For active people, traveling by car is most suitable.  However, when going on a trip, you need to calculate all the pros and cons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Road direction and distance" class="if uuid-2923618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110071/2923618.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, you need to understand that car maintenance, food, overnight and fuel will fall on the shoulders of the car owner.  No matter how many kilometers from Moscow to Rostov, they need to be traveled with comfort. </p><h2>  A car or a train - which is better </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author="" data-source=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Train Station" class="if uuid-2923803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110071/2923803.jpg"></div><p>  Many people have a question: how many km from Moscow to Rostov do you need to travel by car and how much by train?  The answer is simple: by car it‚Äôs faster - about 12, and by train - about 15-20 hours. </p><p>  In addition, there is another significant ‚Äúminus‚Äù of the train ride - this is the price.  If you plan to travel 1000 km from Moscow to Rostov by car, then the cost of the entire trip can be about 10,000 rubles, and by train the minimum price of one ticket will cost about 3,000 rubles per person.  If you travel by car, then the cost of the road will be the same, regardless of the number of people in it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Road selection </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author="" data-source=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostov-on-Don. The cathedral" class="if uuid-2923771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110071/2923771.jpg"></div><p>  The choice of routes for traveling in Russia is quite large.  There are many places in the country where you can go to relax and see the sights of different cities.  However, people are used to spending holidays on the sea, so you can go to the city of Rostov-on-Don.  From it to the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov - already "at hand". </p><p>  From one place to another you need to travel 1076 km ‚Äî that is how many km from Moscow to Rostov-on-Don by car.  In time, the road will take about 12 hours, for which you can explore several cities, take a picture. </p><h2>  Actions before departure </h2><p>  Before the trip, first of all, it is necessary to carry out car diagnostics.  No need to put off maintenance in the last days before the road.  If you need to replace parts that may break on the road, this must be done. </p><p>  Just in case, you should put a couple of bulbs for the front and rear lights in the car, they won‚Äôt take up much space, and you may need them on the road.  You also need to check the spare tire for punctures, if necessary, take it to a tire fitting.  It is imperative to check the availability of drugs in the medicine cabinet: replace all expired ones, and report some. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov" class="if uuid-2923760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110071/2923760.jpg"></div><p>  Before leaving, you need to collect all the documents - both for the car and for each passenger.  The last of the documents must have a passport, policy, SNILS.  For the driver you need: </p><ul><li>  passport; </li><li>  driver's license; </li><li>  STS (vehicle registration certificate); </li><li>  CTP policy; </li><li>  medical insurance policy; </li><li>  SNILS. </li></ul><p>  For a more accurate route, you can take a navigator with you, which will tell you exactly how many kilometers are from Moscow to Rostov.  He will show in detail where to shorten the route. </p><p>  Without sparing money, you should purchase a transponder, which allows you to pay for road sections, almost without stopping.  The price of such devices ranges from 500 to 800 rubles. </p><p>  How many kilometers from Moscow to Rostov-on-Don will have to be driven by car and how many times to stop is not known, but you should not abuse it and try to arrive faster.  It is better to stop several times along the way to rest or sleep.  The road can be unpredictable, and drivers on it too. </p>
