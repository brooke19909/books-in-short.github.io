And this is no coincidence, because now you can contact a person who is thousands of kilometers away. </p><div class="photo" data-original="marinduquegov.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Long distance" class="if uuid-3158606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3158606.jpg"></div><p>  People make a huge number of calls every day.  You can even call these contacts necessary, since often many professions include this type of activity in the duties of workers.  But you should remember: to contact someone by phone, you must pay.  Payment is made from the balance of the account, which must be replenished.  It is important for a person to know how to connect the promised payment on Megafon if there are no funds left in the account. </p><p>  The promised payment is a service from the Megafon company, which consists in loaning money and transferring it to the subscriber's account, if the need arose.  This function is very useful, as it can help a person out in difficult situations, when the funds have run out on the phone and you need to make an important call. </p><h2>  General rules </h2><p>  In fact, this service is quite popular and is provided by almost all operators. </p><div class="photo" data-original="life.ansor.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobile operators" class="if uuid-3158616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3158616.jpg"></div><p>  The user can connect the promised payment from MegaFon from the phone, being anywhere in Russia or even abroad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The operator lends to the subscriber funds that can be spent only on communication services, for example, on a conversation with another subscriber.  The user cannot pay for other services using the promised payment. </p><h2>  Debt payment term </h2><p>  The time allotted for a refund depends on 2 factors: </p><ol><li>  The time during which the subscriber uses the services of this operator. </li><li>  Monthly costs that are spent on various services. </li></ol><p>  If a person uses Megafon for less than a crescent, then the limit of the promised payment is 50 rubles, and the return period is one day.  For people using the operator‚Äôs services for more than 2 months, 300 rubles are already available for a loan, and the maximum payment time is 3 days. </p><h2>  Automatic payment </h2><p>  This service consists in the fact that the account is replenished on the basis of the promised payment on its own every time the amount of money on the phone is below 10 rubles.  This is very convenient, since a person can be very busy, he does not have enough time to check the balance, and making calls often. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pxhere.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Talking on the phone" class="if uuid-3160113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3160113.jpg"></div><p>  It is very simple to connect such a payment: you need to dial * 106 * 1 # on your phone.  To stop using automatic payment, you must enter * 105 * 83 #. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How to connect the promised payment on Megafon?  Consider several ways. </p><h2>  Method number 1. Combination of numbers </h2><p>  If you need to quickly top up your account, you can dial * 106 # on your phone and press the call key.  A window appears with a choice of further actions where you need to follow the instructions.  After all operations, an SMS will arrive that the funds will be credited soon.  The refund period is 3 days for ordinary users and a week for VIP customers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thenextweb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone Money" class="if uuid-3158564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3158564.jpg"></div><h2>  Method number 2. Voice request </h2><p>  It is also possible to call the short number 0006 and follow the instructions of the answering machine.  Then you need to send a message with the desired loan amount and then just wait for the account to be replenished. </p><p>  You can also simply send a message to this number, in which you need to specify the amount required for the loan.  For example, if you need to have 100 rubles on your balance sheet, then you need to write ‚Äú100‚Äù in the message and send it. </p><p>  How to connect the promised payment from Megafon on the Internet, if for some reason there is no way to apply the previous methods?  You need to use your personal account. </p><h2>  Method number 3. Personal account </h2><p>  This is the most convenient and practical way.  The user first needs to register on the official site of Megafon.  Further, when the time has come for a shortage of funds, you just need to go to your personal account on the site, select the item "Promised payment" and request a service.  For some time, the funds will go to the subscriber's account, they can be used to pay for calls. </p><p>  In addition, the personal account will open the user several other possibilities: </p><ul><li>  Change the tariff plan of your number to a more profitable one without calling the operator. </li><li>  Contact specialists to solve problems and questions. </li><li>  View current promotions for subscribers. </li><li>  Keep track of your spending and control it. </li></ul><h2>  Method number 4. Service "Pay when convenient" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.komando.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Money and phone" class="if uuid-3160114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3160114.jpg"></div><p>  Connecting this function can also be a solution to the question: how to connect the promised payment on Megafon. </p><p>  The need for this service appears if taking the promised payment due to lack of funds for any reason is inconvenient, but you do not want to lose the ability to make calls.  This function can be connected to those people who use the services of Megafon for more than 3 months, and the monthly costs are more than 170 rubles.  Just dial * 550 * 1 # to enable this feature on your number.  There are several benefits to using: </p><ol><li>  Indication of the amount to be used in case of a negative balance.  That is, the limit of used funds is pushed back by this amount in minus.  The user can spend the specified funds if the balance is below zero. </li><li>  Free application of the service.  The operator does not require a commission or deposit of additional funds for the provision of the service.  It is only necessary not to allow the delay of the loan and not to go beyond the established limit. </li></ol><h2>  Possible problems </h2><p>  It may happen that Megafon independently connects the promised payment.  This situation may occur due to inattention of the user.  For example, a person once connected an automatic recharge account and forgot about it.  Now the operator replenishes the balance every time the funds in the account are less than 10 rubles.  Of course, the service can connect accidentally on the server, but such situations are very rare. </p><p>  There are several ways to solve the problem: </p><ol><li>  Call 0500. You need to notify the operator about the automatic payment being disabled. </li><li>  In the personal account on the Megafon website, find the "Disable" button in the "Promised Payment" section. </li><li>  Send a message to the number 0006 with the word "STOP" in capital letters. </li><li>  Dial the combination * 106 #.  As already mentioned, it is used to connect the promised payment.  However, when dialing this number, it is possible to disable the service. </li></ol><p>  This article addressed the question: how to activate the promised payment service on Megafon. </p>
