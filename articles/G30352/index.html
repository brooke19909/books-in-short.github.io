  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Monopoly rules and basic secrets</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Monopoly is a very interesting board game that allows you not only to have fun with friends, but also to try yourself as a businessman.  The main goal is to ruin your rivals, but not to become bankrupt yourself.  Such interesting board games develop thinking, learn to think outside the box, and help you learn how to value money.  These skills are very important in the modern world, so I would advise everyone to definitely purchase such a game, regardless of your age.  It is useful to everyone to learn something new in the course of what would seem to be ordinary tabletop fun.  There are other board economic games, however, Monopoly is considered one of the most interesting and popular. </p><p>  In its most general form, the essence boils down to increasing wealth by renting or selling real estate.  Of course, in order to sell real estate, you must first purchase it. </p><p>  The rules of the game in Monopoly are as follows.  The process begins with a field called ‚Äúforward‚Äù.  Players need to take turns to roll dice and move the chip to the corresponding zones.  If a chip lands on a free field, then you can purchase it and subsequently build a hotel or a house on it in order to take the rent from players who fall into this zone.  If you do not have enough money, you can take a loan from the bank. </p><p>  Also in the game there are fields called "chance".  Once on them, you must take the card and follow the instructions that are placed in it.  There is also a game prison.  Success in the game Monopoly depends not only on luck, but also on how wisely you make investments. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now consider the rules of the game of Monopoly and the course of action more carefully.  First you need to place hotels, houses, documents on property rights and banknotes in the intended sectors of the field.  Cards of Odds and the Public Treasury must be shuffled and put them upside down. </p><p>  Each player selects a chip and puts it on the field called "Forward".  One player is appointed by the banker.  The banker gives out to the players $ 1,500 each, and he also keeps documents on property rights, hotels and houses until they are bought by the players.  In addition, the bank represented by the banker pays bonuses and salaries, collects fines, taxes, issues loans, and acts as an auctioneer at an auction. </p><p>  Participants throw dice.  The one who throws a larger number for the first time begins the game. </p><p>  The chip moves along the board in the direction that the arrow points.  That field of the board where it stopped indicates what needs to be done.  At the same time, several chips can be placed on one field.  Depending on the field you are in, you can buy real estate, pay taxes, rent, end up in jail, get paid, take out the Treasury or Chance card, and rest in the parking lot. </p><p>  If you get the same number on both dice, you get the right to roll them again.  Each time you overcome the Forward field, the banker pays 200 thousand cu </p><p>  If you stop at the field that stands for free real estate, you can purchase it.  You need to pay the bank the amount indicated on the playing area.  If you did not buy real estate, then the banker puts it up for auction.  Ownership of real estate allows you to charge players who come to your field rent. </p><p>  As the rules of the game in Monopoly say, if you stay on someone else's real estate, you will have to pay the <span>rent to the</span> owner of the field. </p><p>  A stop on the ‚ÄúPublic Treasury‚Äù or ‚ÄúChance‚Äù field means that you should take the top card from the required pile.  She may require you to pay taxes, move the chip, go to jail, or give you freedom and money. </p><p>  This article only explains the basic rules of the game of Monopoly.  You can find more detailed instructions.  Have a good time! </p>
