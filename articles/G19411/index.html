First Generation Nuclear Bombs: Baby and Fat</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The discovery of the process of <span>fission of the uranium nucleus</span> in 1938 marked the beginning of a new era in the development of mankind.  And this meant not only the use of acquired knowledge for the benefit of civilization.  The world saw a bomb of monstrous destructive power.  Having such a powerful weapon in the arsenal, with just the click of a button you can destroy our entire planet.  History shows that world wars began with very small, minor conflicts.  The main task of the government of all countries is to be prudent.  Few can survive the third world war.  The consequences of the attacks of two Japanese cities in 1945 clearly confirm these words. </p><h2>  The first combat use of the <span>atomic bomb</span> in history </h2><p>  The answer to the question: "When did the bombs drop on Hiroshima?"  any student will give: "On the morning of the sixth of August 1945."  At 8:15 a.m., the Enola Gay bomber crew of the B-29 brand attacked the Japanese city with the latest weapons weighing four tons.  The name that received the first atomic bomb is ‚ÄúBaby‚Äù.  Only at the time of the attack killed about sixty thousand people.  In the next day after that - another 90,000, mainly from the strongest radiation exposure.  The power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima was up to twenty kilotons of <span>TNT.</span>  The radius of destruction is over one and a half kilometers. </p><h2>  The second combat use of the atomic bomb in history </h2><p>  The power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima was slightly less than the Fat Man who attacked the Japanese city of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945 with a bomber of the same model as in Hiroshima (Box Car).  The main target for the attacker was the settlement of Kokura, in whose territory a large number of military depots were concentrated (Yokohama and Kyoto were also considered).  But due to heavy cloud cover, the command changed the direction of the aviation flight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city had a chance to remain unharmed - that day was very cloudy.  And the plane had a faulty fuel pump.  The team had the opportunity to go on only one circle, which was done. </p><p>  Japanese radars "spotted" enemy planes, but fire on them was not launched.  According to one version, the military mistook them for intelligence. </p><p>  American pilots were able to detect a slight dispersal of clouds and the pilot, focusing on the shape of the local stadium, pressed the lever.  The bomb fell far beyond its intended target.  Witnesses recall the explosion of such power that they felt in the settlements four hundred kilometers from Nagasaki. </p>

    <h2>  Unprecedented power </h2><p>  The power of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki totaled nearly forty kilotons.  About twenty at the Fat Man and eighteen at the Kid.  But the active substance was different.  A cloud of uranium-235 swept over Hiroshima.  Nagasaki was destroyed by plutonium-239 exposure. </p><p>  The power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima was such that the entire urban infrastructure and the vast majority of buildings were destroyed.  Over the next few days, fire brigades fought with fire in more than eleven square kilometers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Nagasaki from a major seaport, shipbuilding center and industry in an instant turned into ruins.  All living creatures that were one kilometer from the epicenter died immediately.  Strong fires also did not subside for a long time, which was facilitated by a strong wind.  In the whole city, only twelve percent of the buildings remained intact. </p>

    <p>  The crew of the Box Car consisted of thirteen people. </p><p>  At the helm was the crew commander and one of the best pilots in the US Air Force, Major Charles Sweeney (during the first bombardment he was on an escort plane).  He sent a bomb to a <span>Japanese city.</span> </p><p>  Lieutenant Jacob Bezer participated in both historic bombing raids. </p><p>  All lived a fairly long life.  And almost no one regretted what had happened.  To date, not a single member of these two historical crews has survived. </p><h2>  Was there a need? </h2><p>  More than seventy years have passed since the day of the two attacks.  Disputes about their feasibility are still ongoing.  Some scientists are sure that the Japanese would fight to the last.  And the war could drag on for several more years.  In addition, the lives of thousands of Soviet soldiers who were to begin a military operation in the Far East were saved. </p><p>  Others are inclined to believe that Japan was already ready to capitulate and the events of August 6 and 9, 1945 were for the Americans nothing more than a show of strength. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>
