The final information serves as the basis for calculating the amount of taxes, calculating the financial result, management decisions are formed on the basis of financial statements.  But not many companies can afford to hire highly qualified accountants, as their services are expensive and the amount of work (especially in small and new companies) is usually small.  This problem will help solve companies that provide accounting services. </p><p>  Professional accounting assistance is offered by specialized outsourcing companies.  Accounting outsourcing is a godsend for small and medium-sized businesses.  Many appreciated the advantage of such a work scheme when an enterprise transfers accounting or its individual directions to an outsourcer.  Outsourcing is ongoing, but the customer pays only for the work actually done, which is much cheaper than maintaining your own accounting. </p><p>  Hired specialists can be involved in the inventory, the formation, submission of reports, restoration of accounting and other operations.  A fresh ‚Äúoutside‚Äù look and high training of accountants-outsourcers allows us to identify flaws in the organization of accounting and identify hidden reserves to minimize costs and various risks. </p><p><noindex>  <span>Accounting</span> </noindex>  allows the company: </p><ul><li>  to establish quality records; </li><li>  save on salaries and organization of the accounting workplace; </li><li>  get a specialist who is not sick, does not go on vacation; </li><li>  shift responsibility to the outsourcer; </li><li>  avoid labor disputes with employees; </li><li>  reduce staff workload; </li><li>  concentrate on other areas of activity. </li></ul><h2>  Accounting services in Moscow </h2><p>  You should be responsible for the company to which you entrust keeping records of your company.
