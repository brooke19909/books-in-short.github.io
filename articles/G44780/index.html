    <h2>  Russian education as the basis for the formation of scientific knowledge </h2><p>  If in the Soviet school, teachers simply used the theoretical basis, teaching various academic disciplines, now they give preference to productive teaching methods.  Domestic psychologists and teachers are developing new educational technologies in which the theoretical basis of the study is supplemented by a full-fledged experiment.  Of particular interest is shown in the results obtained by European experts, who for several decades have successfully applied not only the theoretical foundations of studying information in the learning process, but also add practical research. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Theoretical aspects </h2><p>  Conscious purposeful <span>innovative activity</span> always presupposes the theoretical foundations of the formation of an organization.  Without the application of scientific development of problems of technology and design methodology, it is impossible to manage the processes of modernization of production.  Purposeful, informed, theoretically worked out and scientifically grounded innovative activity is based on the theoretical principles of design.  Currently, without the scientific development of problems of the methodology and design technology, it is impossible to manage the transformation processes.  Issues related to design were considered in the works of domestic and foreign scientists: V. N. Burkova, Yu. V Gromyko, E. I. Mashbats, V. E. Radionova.  M. M. Potashnik, E. A. Yamburg were closely connected with the theoretical basis for creating new learning models. </p>

    <h2>  Terminology features </h2><p>  For a long time, a term such as ‚Äúproject‚Äù was used to a greater extent in the technical field.  He was associated with the development of complex documentation.  Currently, the design methodology is the theoretical basis of numerous areas of human activity: literary, theatrical, technical, musical.  For example, considering the importance of social design for parents and students, the object of research will be the search for the importance of such an experiment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Project Algorithm </h2><p>  There are certain theoretical foundations for the development of any project, regardless of its purpose.  To begin with, a hypothesis is put forward, that is, the idea that has to be refuted or confirmed after completion of the work.  For example, if you are planning a social study, you can choose as an assumption the possibility of students mastering <span>project design</span> skills in the course of academic and extracurricular activities. </p><p>  Next, direct participants in the work are selected: representatives of civil society, parents, employees, and students. </p><p>  When setting goals, take into account the theoretical foundations of management, the specifics of the organization.  Depending on the chosen direction of the project, tasks are put forward for it: </p><ul><li>  studying the theoretical basis of the activity in question (education, tourism, production); </li><li>  identification of the significance of the implementation of the project; </li><li>  learning from competing companies. </li></ul><p>  At the next stage, the relevance of the work, its theoretical and practical significance is determined.  The project itself involves introduction, calculations, market analysis, conclusion, bibliography, implementation prospects, as well as economic risks. </p>

    <h2>  Base design work </h2><p>  Design - the theoretical basis of the work of any company.  It is associated with the beginning of changes in the artificial environment.  This problem is multifaceted, it is equally suitable for all types of activities.  It is design that is considered an important component of the life of a modern person, because each of us should set certain goals, strive to achieve them.  Since such processes do not depend on the direction of activity, they are a cultural-historical phenomenon.  This activity can be considered intellectual, because before you ‚Äútry‚Äù it with real material, you need to predict, research, evaluate, anticipate the consequences of intentions.  Thanks to the scientific basis of design, a new activity is being created, the horizons of human subjectivity are expanding.  There are certain features of the project: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  his relevance to the future; </li><li>  orientation to a certain state after a period of time; </li><li>  presentation in the form of a system of means to achieve the future; </li><li>  the presence of the beginning and end of design work. </li></ul><p>  If you analyze the theoretical foundations of enterprises specializing in project development, it is necessary to mention the criteria of effectiveness (essence). </p><ol><li>  Direct connection with current needs and a certain system of objective conditions. </li><li>  Relationship with the importance of making consistent and responsible decisions. </li></ol><p>  This method is always aimed at independent activity, is practice-oriented in nature.  It focuses on a practical solution to a theoretically significant problem.  The result should be tangible, reproducible in real activity. </p>

    <h2>  Requirements for using the project method </h2><p>  The theoretical foundations of analysis are impossible without a similar technology.  It is important to have a problem that requires integrated knowledge.  For example, it is required to study the demographic problem in various regions of the world, study acid rain, and create your own tourism business.  Cognitive practical activity can be individual, group, collective.  At each stage, subtotals are supposed to be summarized.  The peculiarity of the project method is that all representatives of the team are on an equal footing.  Everyone has every opportunity to become a leader, to take responsibility for the work being created. </p><h2>  Varieties of application of the theoretical foundations of design </h2><p>  The theoretical foundations of the organization of an enterprise engaged in the provision of services are no different from other areas of activity.  Even in ancient times, there were individuals and entire organizations professionally providing expensive and complex services that required special scientific knowledge, skills, and also certain equipment.  In the 20th century, the service modernized a large-scale sphere of human activity.  "Service" translated from English is a special kind of human activity aimed at meeting customer needs by providing a certain range of services. </p>

    <h2>  Approaches to understanding the essence of service </h2><p>  Considering the theoretical foundations of enterprises of this orientation, it is customary to highlight their essence.  Service is perceived as a form of human activity.  Such large sectors of the economy as transport, finance, trade, the sports and entertainment industry, healthcare, management, education, and science are currently equated with the service sector.  But there is a classification based on four main forms of human activity: </p><p>  1. The theoretical foundations make it possible to conduct a full-fledged material-transformative orientation of various services, due to which all material needs of the population are fully satisfied.  For example, having drawings, you can create certain objects and technical devices, repair equipment. </p><p>  2. Due to the cognitive orientation of the service sector, not only material but also spiritual needs of people are satisfied.  For example, educational services and ICT technologies help educate the young generation of the country, process information at a professional level, and conduct statistical processing of the results of the functioning of a company or enterprise. </p><p>  3. Thanks to the value-orientational form of activity, the significance of existing social and natural phenomena for society is established, a detailed assessment is given to them.  Promote this advertising, expert, diagnostic, artistic direction. </p><p>  4. The communicative kind of activity is a way of communication between organizations and individual consumers.  This area includes service activities in the form of presentations, exhibitions, conferences, communication on the World Wide Web, negotiations, psychological training, and communication services. </p><p>  Applying the theoretical foundations of analysis, representatives of various types of services fully satisfy the needs of customers.  In order to understand them, it is important to master the mechanism of this service. </p><h2>  What is a need? </h2><p>  This is such a state of a person that develops as a result of contradictions between existing and necessary ones that encourage active actions aimed at eliminating it.  Using the service, this problem is solved.  There is a division into primary and secondary needs.  The former are physiological in nature, often innate.  For example, the need for water, food, sleep.  The second are of a psychological nature.  Among their examples can be mentioned affection, respect, success, power.  They appear in humans gradually.  Since everyone has their own experience, there are much more secondary needs than primary ones. </p><p>  Modern European civilization has formed a worldview that connects the cultural environment with social status, general personality development, and educational level.  Such a system of values ‚Äã‚Äãrequires society to have conditions in which the full development of a free personality is possible.  Approval in Europe uses these types of services, thanks to which the development and enrichment of the individual takes place.  The modern European needs a certain set of vital goods that are not of interest to the monk.  The service offered today is oriented towards a flexible character, a soft system of socio-cultural needs.  This allows you to transform it in the direction that is chosen by the consumer. </p><p>  <span>F. Kotler</span> said that the service is an event or a benefit, due to which one side offers the other certain benefits.  There are different types of classification of species and types.  The scientific basis allows us to develop common criteria and schemes for their units, adopted in various countries and regions. </p><p>  The interstate practice of some countries involves classifying them on the basis of interrelated criteria: scope, type of service.  Typologically similar services are divided into: </p><ul><li>  production (maintenance, leasing, engineering, equipment repair); </li><li>  professional (insurance, banking, advertising, consulting); </li><li>  consumer (mass); </li><li>  public (radio education, culture, television). </li></ul><p>  Given the historically established practice of carrying out business activities, it is possible to subdivide services on the basis of an industry approach.  For example, in modern Russia, a special classifier of services rendered to the population exists and successfully functions. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Any educational institution in modern conditions is obliged to create optimal conditions for the normal development of a person who has creative and critical thinking, independence skills.  Without theoretical knowledge, such institutions cannot cope with the assigned tasks.  Among the many methods that contribute to the development of independence, the ability to adapt to the changing realities of modern society, a special place belongs to design technologies.  Not a single field of activity, a developing enterprise, is complete without its own research and projects.  Starting options are suitable for those who decide to try their hand at business.  They not only help to master scientific knowledge, but also contribute to their practical application.  Ongoing projects help to independently solve certain problems, comprehend theoretical material, apply information in new conditions. </p><p>  The starting project is the development of ways for students to master (taking into account their inclinations and interest) subject material and work planning for a certain perspective.  Thus, each student is given a real right to choose the method of his advancement in mastering the material specified by the program. </p><p>  Final developments always help to approach the results of certain disciplines, the company's work for the analyzed period of time.  Depending on the content, mono-subject, intersubject studies are distinguished.  The tourism business is supposed to specialize in organizing leisure activities for clients.  But even in this <span>non-productive sphere, a</span> complete scientific basis is indispensable.  Before offering specific directions to customers, company employees study detailed information about all the intricacies of the tour in order to answer questions that their customers will definitely have.  Modern services provided to consumers are also interconnected with theoretical knowledge.  In any sphere of human life and activity, the ability to use scientific information comes first, adapting it, depending on real conditions, to a specific situation. </p>
