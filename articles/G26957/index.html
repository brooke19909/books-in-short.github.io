At first, their representatives were mostly vigilantes.  What was common to both classes was that they belonged to the circle of those whom the prince trusted the most and who could be relied upon.  But not everyone understands who such nobles are, and how they differ from the boyars. </p>

    <h2>  The origin of the estate </h2><p>  Based on the data that came from the depths of centuries, it can be assumed that the birth of the boyar estate occurred at the beginning of the 9th century.  For the next six centuries, it occupied a leading position in feudal society. </p><p>  In the historical document "Laurentian Chronicle Arch" there is such a term as "nobles."  The so-called <span>birch bark letters,</span> drawn up around the 12th-13th centuries, already provide a detailed description of who the nobles are. </p><h2>  What kind of people are these? </h2><p>  From the moment of its appearance until the end of the 12th century, there was a rule: the prince made a decision which of his entourage was able to bear the honorary title of ‚Äúboyar‚Äù.  Such a lucky prince could entrust the management of his army.  The boyar was also given the opportunity to dispose of the land, which became property, which was acquired as, so to speak, the military trophy of the prince. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Depending on their position and influence, the boyars were divided into two categories: </p><ul><li>  very rich - older boyars; </li><li>  the less wealthy are representatives of the younger squad. </li></ul><p>  The first acquired a small army - a squad, which they often abused, competing with each other and even with the prince.  The most senior boyars sat in the Duma.  The prince was forced to listen to their weighty opinion when issues of national importance or litigation were resolved.  The princes were valued by the boyars and nobles, but they regularly quarreled among themselves. </p>

    <p>  Younger boyars and <span>boyar children</span> were appointed by the prince to various important posts: falconer, groom, treasurer, steward, butler, etc. For this they received a salary ‚Äúfor feeding‚Äù. </p><p>  The term "nobleman" is obviously associated with the service at the princely court, which consisted in the execution of various orders on the military, financial or economic side.  This right was bothered by a representative of the younger squad.  As a reward for loyal service and shown valor during the hostilities, the noble received a plot of land with the peasants.  Since the 15th century, the noble title has become inherited.  Moreover, the land allocated for use was also transferred to the heirs.  Who are the nobles, they study back in high school. </p><p>  The boyar estate loses its dominant position in the 17th century.  The reforms of Peter I served as the beginning of this process. On the contrary, the nobles received more privileges thanks to the manifesto of Peter III and the letter of Catherine, respectively in 1762 and 1785. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Distinctive features of the</span> boyars and nobles </h2><p>  The nobles of the 17th century enjoy a special position, since the estate of the boyars is losing its position.  But, despite this, it is worth noting the differences between the boyars and the nobles: </p><ol><li>  Boyars were equated with large feudal lords.  They owned land, which was supposed to be inherited.  The nobles who served the prince or the senior boyar did not have this right until the 14th century. </li><li>  If the boyar is free to choose which prince to serve, the nobleman depended on the will of the master. </li><li>  For a long period of time, the boyars played an important role in government affairs, while the nobles had this opportunity with the accession of Peter the Great. </li></ol><p>  From the article you learned who the nobles are and what position they occupied during the rule of princes and kings. </p>
