This place is located in the Rostov region on the shores of a wonderful lake.  His name is the tourist base "Eldorado".  Rest here leaves indelible, always bright, impressions filled with novelty.  In the Eldorado near Rostov, he will meet with the severe Indians, walk past a giant spider, see the remains of a pirate sailboat with a decaying skeleton on its bow.  Of course, all these "residents" of the Eldorado base are not at all dangerous, they even willingly participate in photo shoots, which are arranged by numerous tourists with them.  Are you intrigued?

    <h2>  Location, how to get there </h2><p>  Eldorado Tourist Base, a holiday in which tourists from different cities of Russia are so attracted, is located in the small village of Chistoozernoye, located about 12 km from the city of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky.  It is 140 km from Rostov, 120 km from Novocherkassk, 91 km from Lugansk, and only 75 km from the city of Shakhty.  It is very convenient for residents of these settlements to come to Eldorado for the weekend. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It‚Äôs easy to get here by car.  From Rostov you need to go along <span>the M4 highway</span> in the Moscow direction.  Without stopping at Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, pass the left turn and in the traffic police area (at 932 km), in front of the <span>Seversky Donets River,</span> turn right.  Along the road, there will be large banners decorated in the form of a dry tree on which the <span>bar</span> sits <span>.</span>  <span>Birds</span> in their paws hold the mileage indicator, how much is left before the camp site. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center Eldorado Kamensk Shakhtinsky" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/972009.jpg" width="546"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Not only for relaxation, but just for an excursion you can come to Eldorado (Kamensk-Shakhtinsky).  <span>The recreation center, the</span> photo of one of the main entrance of which is already impressive, is framed very extravagantly.  Design was done here by people who certainly have a sense of humor and great talent.  Everyone who has been to these places before is surprised how such a miracle could be created in the bare steppe.  On a not very large territory, there was a place for Indians with spears in their hands, and huge snakes, wriggling their bodies with rings frozen in concrete, and a terrible bronze spider, "looking" at the audience from the center of the web, which it "weaved" in a real vineyard, and unusual fountains decorated with Native American figurines, and a restaurant that looks like a sailboat that has been in a shipwreck. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Photos of the recreation center "Eldorado", without a doubt, will become one of the most exclusive in any tourist's photo albums.  In addition to mythical Native American deities, wild animals and birds, the territory has a wonderful playground, a bathhouse, several bars, a night club, a shop, a sports equipment rental, a paid parking lot, gazebos with barbecue areas and many beautiful flower beds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eldorado Rostov region recreation center" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/972013.jpg" width="521"></div>

    <h2>  Accommodation </h2><p>  The recreation center "Eldorado" (Kamensk-Shakhtinsky) for accommodation offers its guests 4 small hotels, called simply and unpretentiously: "Red", "Green", "Yellow" and "Blue" hotels.  The closest to the lake is Sinaya, closer to the center of the base is Krasnaya, farthest from the lake and closer to green spaces is Zelenaya.  All of them are not higher than two floors, so there are no elevators in them.  There is also an administrative building based on which issues with payment and accommodation are resolved. </p><p>  All rooms are double, but each has the possibility of installing an extra folding bed.  The recreation center "Eldorado" (Kamensk-Shakhtinsky) is original not only for its territory, but also for the design of its rooms.  Among them, it is difficult to find two of the same.  The interior of the rooms continues to convince the guests of the base that they really are in a mythical country.  Everything - walls, bedspreads, curtains on the windows, tiles in the bathroom - is bright and impressive here.  Good furniture is also quite non-standard.  There are no beds with wooden headboards that are familiar to most of us, massive wardrobes, and awkward nightstands.  <span>Lamps, lamps,</span> upholstered furniture, mirrors, an entrance hall, paintings on the walls, figurines on shelves, large panoramic windows - this is what awaits guests in the rooms of the Eldorado base.  All apartments are equipped with modern amenities in the form of a TV, air conditioning, refrigerator, hygiene room with shower, washbasin and toilet.  Price per day - from 1400 rubles for the entire room in the so-called low season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eldorado Kamensk Shakhtinsky recreation center photo" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/972011.jpg" width="488"></div>

In this regard, breakfast and dinner are also included in the price per room.  They pass in a restaurant called the Tavern.  Its appearance is fully consistent with the general theme of the design base.  Inside the restaurant is decorated in the style of an old tavern, which also has fake skulls, animal heads and other horror stories. </p><p>  The restaurant has an outdoor terrace under the canopy of dense green foliage.  For breakfast, they serve pancakes with honey, jam or sour cream, egg dishes, bread, coffee, tea, one candy.  Dinner is approximately the following: meat or fish dishes, side dish, salad.  Everything is quite tasty and satisfying.  In addition, Eldorado (recreation center, Kamensk) has a bar and a sushi bar in its infrastructure.  The restaurant has the possibility of corporate events, any special occasions.  The administration of the base also has nothing against it if people bring their food and drinks with them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eldorado recreation center Kamensk" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/972008.jpg" width="564"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Far beyond the boundaries of the Rostov region, rest in the Eldorado (Kamensk-Shakhtinsky) is unusually popular.  The recreation center, the photos of which are always exclusive, has another attraction - a wonderful lake.  It is located on the shore of the reservoir.  This lake was once a mining quarry.  At some point, the water-bearing layer was touched, and the quarry was filled with clean cool water in a matter of hours. </p><p>  The bank opposite the base externally resembles a canyon wall, which gives the area even more color.  From the side of the base, the coast is fairly gentle, the beach is sandy, the entry into the water is good, the depth does not start right away.  For entertainment there are plenty of opportunities.  This is a catamaran ride, descent from the water slides, "banana", diving.  For 800 rubles per hour, you can not only descend to the depths of the lake, but also get a disc recording swimming and diving. </p><p>  Entrance to the beach costs 100 rubles.  Sun beds and mattresses are paid, the price is hourly (100 rubles / hour). </p><h2>  Fun in the afternoon </h2><p>  Varied leisure offers its guests a tourist base "Eldorado".  Rest here exists not only beach.  Everyone can take a professional massage course.  The cost of the service per hour is 300 rubles.  For fans of billiards in the base there are billiard tables.  On the shore of the lake, a little away from the beach, there is a sauna, a bathhouse with a steam room and a relaxation room.  Their capacity is up to 8 vacationers.  The cost is 1000 rubles per hour, but for guests of the base hotels the cost is half as much. </p><p>  There are a lot of fish in the lake.  It can even be seen through the clear water column.  Fishing on the basis of Eldorado is also one of the types of leisure, however, it is better to engage in it on weekdays, when there are fewer people.  For children on the territory there is not only a playground and slides in the water park, but also a games room, where a girl educator will look after the kids for 50 rubles per hour. </p><p>  Eldorado (Rostov Region) is a recreation center where you can spend a long time or just a weekend.  For tourists there are no restrictions on how long to rent a room.  In addition, you can come here only to have fun in a night club or just for one day without spending the night in order to arrange a photo shoot in the unique territory of the base and relax on the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="photo recreation Eldorado" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/972014.jpg" width="578"></div>

    <h2>  Fun at night </h2><p>  Eldorado (Rostov Region) is a recreation center where people of all ages are interested.  But most of all it is suitable for youth.  There is a night club at the base.  It is made in the form of an old castle.  Inside, the whole decor is beautiful and modern.  But the main thing is not this, but the fact that the most popular dance tracks among youth are played here all night.  In addition, the club constantly hosts interesting events.

Such advantages attract people: </p><p>  - registration of the territory; </p><p>  - developed infrastructure; </p><p>  - a wonderful beach; </p><p>  - An excellent entertainment program in a night club; </p><p>  - the ability to have picnics with barbecue. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings noted are: </p><p>  - not always efficient staff; </p><p>  - in the tavern small portions of breakfast and dinner; </p><p>  - poor-quality cleaning in the rooms; </p><p>  - small parking area; </p><p>  - A large influx of people, especially on weekends; </p><p>  - 100% prepayment when booking; </p><p>  - high prices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center Eldorado Primosad" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/972010.jpg" width="515"></div>

Suites and junior suites also have upholstered furniture, an electric kettle, a microwave, a set of dishes. </p><p>  Meals at the base are provided in the dining room according to a custom menu.  Vacationers also have the opportunity to cook on their own in the shared kitchen. </p><p>  The sea from the gates of the base "Eldorado" is literally a few steps away.  The beach here is sandy, the entry into the water is excellent, the sea is warm and clean. </p><h2>  Reviews about Eldorado in Primosada </h2><p>  This <span>recreation center is</span> focused on rest quiet, calm, beach, family, with children.  Noted advantages: </p><p>  - well-groomed territory; </p><p>  - proximity to the sea and the beach; </p><p>  - comfortable rooms; </p><p>  - relatively low prices (from 800 rubles per day per room); </p><p>  - Great animation for kids. </p><p>  Minuses: </p><p>  - no room cleaning; </p><p>  - claims to nutrition (tasteless dishes, monotonous menu); </p><p>  - salt water in the shower. </p>
