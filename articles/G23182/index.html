Every summer people come here, longing for the warm sun and sea.  It has everything that travelers craving for relaxation in the lap of nature - wild sand spits, picturesque bays, reserved lands and mud volcanoes can crave.  There is a shallow sea, a great coast for surfers, a mild climate, comfortable housing, not too many people and enough budget prices.  Reviews about the <span>rest in Primorsko-Akhtarsk</span> served as the basis for this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacation primorsko akhtarsk reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2185678.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to the resort </h2><p>  To get to Primorsko-Akhtarsk, you need to take a train or plane.  If you prefer to fly - because the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov is located in the south-west of the country, which means that it will take a long time to reach it from most regions of Russia, then you should know that there is no airport nearby the resort.  In reviews of holidays in Primorsko-Akhtarsk tourists write that by plane you can only get to Krasnodar or Anapa.  There is also no train station or railway station.  Therefore, from large cities accessible by train or plane, you will have to get further by bus or taxi.  It is best to go on vacation to Primorsko-Akhtarsk (reviews are unanimous in this) from Krasnodar.  A direct bus runs from there to the resort.  And you will have to get from Anapa with transfers - it is both expensive and long.  At the resort there are minibuses.  It is also popular here for cycling.  You can rent such a two-wheeled vehicle at any major base or hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Primorsko akhtarsk rest 2014 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2185669.jpg"></div>

There are good wide beaches, clean, sandy.  The sea is very shallow, so young children are just paradise.  And the water is very warm.  But keep in mind that on the wild beaches often come across sharp shells.  Therefore, so that your child does not cut himself, listen to the advice of experienced vacationers - go to sunbathe on the Central Beach.  He is cleaned of shells, and he is comfortable.  There are sun loungers and umbrellas (from 20 rubles per hour), as well as scooters and catamarans for rent. </p><p>  Windsurfers love the central beach.  There is even a special center for training beginners.  Travelers who love outdoor activities wrote in reviews of Primorsko-Akhtarsk that there is a school for managing yachts and other small sailing ships.  Well, if you are real tourists and you are attracted by wild, reserved places, then welcome to the Achuevskaya and Yasenskaya spits.  There is nothing at all except sand, water, birds, rare animals and plants.  But the sea is deep, you can swim and dive.  ‚ÄúSavages‚Äù with tents are often located here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holiday Village lotus Primorsko Akhtarsk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2185679.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Where to live </h2><p>  If you come to this resort, then you are unlikely to meet with a frequent problem of the Russian south.  Here is a large offer of housing, including budget.  This is the private sector, and guest houses, and mini-hotels, and pensions with recreation centers.  Only about a hundred options.  The beaches are so wide that many guest houses have not only excellent living conditions, but also very picturesque sea views.  Therefore, tourists often illustrate reviews about holidays in Primorsko-Akhtarsk with photos taken from balconies and loggias.  Many offers of budget housing - from 300 rubles per room.  Tourists most often rate the local service as good. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Marisol Hotel, the Venice Guesthouse and the Lotos Recreation Center deserved the best reviews.  Primorsko-Akhtarsk, or rather, its central part, is located three kilometers from this boarding house.  Therefore, it is located in the steppe, but thanks to irrigation gardening, its territory is surrounded by greenery.  On the territory of the base there are summer houses, a hotel-type building with European-quality repair.  The beach at the Lotus has its own, three meals a day, comprehensive.  Children's animation works. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Primorsko akhtarsk rest reviews photos" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2185673.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What to see and try </h2><p>  The best refreshment on vacation in Primorsko-Akhtarsk in the reviews is called fish and wine.  Indeed, in these places there is such a diversity of inhabitants of the sea, lakes and rivers!  This is pike, and sterlet, and pike perch, and trout, and catfish.  As for wine, we all know that the lion's share of Russian alcohol (of course, not distillates) is produced in the Kuban Territory.  The resort has many cafes and restaurants, especially in season.  There is even a chain of fast foods ‚ÄúSubway‚Äù, a pizzeria at ‚ÄúVenice‚Äù and a traditional beach bar called ‚ÄúTropicana‚Äù.  Well, and those who can not imagine relaxation without sightseeing will enjoy the local nature.  These are braids, estuaries, healing mud and springs with mineral water. </p><p>  Some guest houses and pensions, in particular the recreation center "Lotus" (Primorsko-Akhtarsk) organize excursions along the floodplains of the Azov region.  They carry tourists on sightseeing trips to Anapa and Gelendzhik.  But most importantly, the guides of the base on boats will sail with you on an unforgettable trip to the plantations of real Indian lotuses (provided that you arrived at the resort during their flowering, namely in August).  On the other hand, the infrastructure in the village is not too developed.  Reviews about the rest in Primorsko-Akhtarsk 2014, for example, are not much different from the description of this town in 2017.  Some tourists write that it remains a large village of Soviet times.  But the undoubted advantage of these places is the lack of industry and remoteness from large and noisy cities. </p>
