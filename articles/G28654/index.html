If you want to get new beautiful shoes, you can make crocheted sneakers for yourself or for your child. </p><h2>  Knitting preparation </h2><p>  For those who are interested in crochet sneakers, there is a clear sequence of actions.  First, if you knit on yourself, decide with your size.  Take measurements from the foot, or make a copy from the sole of the shoe that you now wear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet sneakers" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/735621.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Then you need to make yarn - one hundred grams.  You can take yarn, which is dominated by cotton or acrylic.  It is better to take macrame threads, in which case your shoes will be more durable and there will be no risk that the threads will break. </p><h2>  Knitted sneakers for children: sole </h2><p>  If you want to <span>crochet the booties,</span> they have a simple description.  To create such shoes, you will need Kirov Iris yarn: fifty grams of red, one hundred grams of white, one hundred grams of <span>pink.</span>  You will also need hooks - the first and second number, a sewing needle, manicure scissors. </p><p>  We knit a thread in two additions.  First we knit forty air loops, then ten of them we knit with single crochet, and the remaining loops we knit with double crochet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Crochet is a good activity.

    <p>  We knit the second row only <span>with double crochet.</span>  The third and fourth rows are also knitted with crochets, the fifth and sixth rows are also knitted.  Then we tie the finished sole with SC. </p><h2>  Making booties </h2><p>  How do you get slippers?  You can crochet them very quickly.  The seventh and eighth rows are crocheted with columns without a crochet, and now the finished part of the booties is folded in half.  Ninth row - we knit only fifty-eight double crochets, the remaining fourteen stitches must be left untied. </p><p>  Tenth row: crochet in the same pattern.  Sneakers that can be made this way are very durable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet booties" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/735628.jpg" width="342"></div>

    <p>  In the eleventh row we knit in the same way, but we untie the three columns at the end. </p><p>  The twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth rows are knitted in the same way as the eleventh row.  Then we start making a tongue, and our crochet sneakers will be ready soon.  We collect ten air loops and knit in ordinary rows seven centimeters high, where we close the loops.  Then we sew the tongue with white threads to the inside of the booties.  This is how our booties-sneakers turn out (scheme).  Crocheted, they are made from double crochet and single crochet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet slippers" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/735630.jpg" width="200"></div>

Laces can also be made with a hook.  Crochet thirty air loops, knit one or two rows with a single crochet, and you get laces. </p><h2>  Knitted sneakers for adults </h2><p>  In general, crochet sneakers, the schemes of which depict the alternation of double crochet and single crochet columns, can also be connected to an adult.  In such sneakers, it will be convenient for you to walk around the apartment, they can serve as slippers. </p><p>  To create such shoes, you will need two hundred grams of acrylic thread, hook number three.  We start knitting from the sole.  We make a chain of ten air loops, tie it with crochets.  Crochet sneakers are further made as follows: the second, third, fourth, fifth rows are tied with crochets, and the sixth row will be different.  In this row, we knit one single crochet in every four loops, and then in the fifth loop we knit two single crochet, so until the thirty second row.  Work ends when you have thirty-eight loops in a circle. </p><h2>  Boca slippers </h2><p>  So, our sneakers are partially ready.  To knit the sides, you will need to tie the sole with half columns.  At the same time, you need to make reductions in order to make the sides of the slippers upright. </p><p>  Now we knit all the rows with half columns, so up to a height of three centimeters.  We do all these rows with the help of half-columns, which we connect at the end of the rows with the help of air half-columns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet sneakers" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/735655.jpg" width="270"></div>

    <p>  So we knit four centimeters, leaving a hole where the strap is outlined.  And do not forget that you need to beautifully shape the toe.  We all love crochet.  Sneakers are a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat can be connected, but you need to calculate everything correctly.  All calculations must be carried out before knitting. </p><h2>  Toe and end of work </h2><p>  In order to tie a toe, you need to dial eight loops.  In the next row, knit everything completely with single crochet, in the third and fourth rows you continue to knit with single crochet.  To make the edges of slippers round, you need to knit two single crochet in one loop in one loop. </p><p>  We make eleven rows, we knit all the rows with double crochet, gradually reducing the number of columns in a row.  So we get the sides of the sneaker, which we then tie on top with single crochet columns.  You can use a thread of a different color for SC.  For example, if the thread for the main knitting you had was green, then you can take the red thread for tying. </p><p>  You can separately tie the shoelaces, that is, first a chain of air loops of the desired length is knitted, and the second row is made from top with columns without a crochet.  Beads from beads can be sewn to such laces, which will become an original decoration. </p><h2>  Knitted slippers </h2><p>  So, crochet gym shoes is easy to do.  Let's try to learn more about how <span>crochet slippers</span> fit <span>.</span>  These simple shoes will come in handy for you in your household.  And to create it is not difficult at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet sneakers" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/712346.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <p>  In order to create such a knitted product, you need to know the volume of your leg.  Then get one hundred grams of wool yarn, hook number three, five.  In the first loop we knit six single crochet, then the work goes in circles.  When you make a circle six by six centimeters in size, then knit on ten loops with a straight cloth up, and so on twenty rows. </p><p>  Then we get a toe plus a foot, and we need to tie more sides.  Following the instructions, you will quickly make comfortable slippers that you can wear around the house and in the country. </p><p>  When knitting things such as sneakers or slippers, you need to accept the circle rule, that is, the number of loops that you add in each row should be equal to their number that you typed in the first row.  For example, if you had six loops in the initial ring row, then in each circle you add six, and as a result in the sixth row you get thirty-six loops. </p><p>  For <span>knitting slippers,</span> use woolen coarse threads, you can use leftover threads.  It will take one hundred to two hundred grams. </p><h2>  Slippers tanks </h2><p>  If you are interested in what kind of an original gift you can give your beloved man on his birthday or on February 23, then crocheted slippers-sneakers called ‚Äúslippers ‚Äì tanks‚Äù will suit you.  They look like military equipment "Tiger" or "T 34".  Their masters knit to order, but if you are interested, then you can try to knit such slippers yourself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet sneakers description" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/715499.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <p>  To do this, you will like felt insoles, in which around the circumference you need to make holes with an awl.  We take a small hook, we tie the sole around them, threading the thread through the holes.  Then we take a thicker hook and knit four rows up.  <span>Knit booties are</span> similarly <span>knitted,</span> the crochet pattern for them is the same as for slippers. </p><p>  For your ‚Äútank‚Äù you will need ‚Äúwheels‚Äù, which can be connected like regular circles.  That is, you type two loops and knit in a circle in columns with a single crochet.  At first there are six, then twelve, then eighteen, then twenty-four.  Then you can reduce two loops in each row so that your wheel becomes slightly convex. </p><p>  After that, we knit the rise using the rotary rows, and then we knit a step around the circumference - a transition in three loops.  We begin to gradually reduce the sides.  And soon before us is a hole for a slipper.  When you knit a second slipper, do not forget that the insole is tied on the other side, and then you will get the right and left slippers.  The necessary attributes can be found in the accessories department, it is especially good to use sewing accessories that will look beautiful in this case. </p><p>  Such crochet sneakers, the schemes of which are simple, will turn out to be just excellent for you, because you will create them with the aim of making something pleasant for your loved one.  Slipper tanks will become his favorite shoes, because you created them according to his individual sizes. </p>
