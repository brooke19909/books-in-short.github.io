It is separated from China (mainland) by the Gulf of Taiwan (or Formosa), whose width is 160 km. </p><p>  For many centuries around the world this land has been called the Formos Island, which means “beautiful” in Portuguese. This romantic name in the 16th century was given to it by Portuguese sailors, struck by the unimaginable beauty of the island. </p><p>  In Asia, Taiwan is one of the largest islands.  The total area is about 36 thousand square meters.  km  Its waters are washed: from the north of the East China Sea, from the east - the Pacific Ocean, and from the south - the South China Sea.  From Taiwan, the distance to Hong Kong and Shanghai is exactly the same. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What country is Taiwan located in?" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1308087.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Economy </h2><p>  Taiwan is part of the <span>New Industrial Countries.</span>  In 1995, its annual <span>gross national income</span> amounted to about 263 billion dollars, which enables the state to occupy 19th place around the world.  GNP is $ 12,439 per capita, with $ 89.5 billion in dollar reserves. Taiwan ranks second after Japan in the world. </p><h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  Where can I try the most varied types of Chinese cuisine?  Should go to Taiwan.  What country can still offer guests Sichuan, Guangdong, Shanghai, Huan, Beijing and Taiwan cuisines in such a variety? </p><p>  Taiwan is also famous for its fine French, Italian, Swiss and German restaurants.  American KFC and McDonald's have taken root here. </p><p>  Amazing, a wide variety of dishes are prepared from seafood and exotic fruits.  No wonder subtropical Taiwan is home to more than 45 species of fruit. </p><h2>  In conclusion, about the features of life and life </h2><p>  To go to rest, you need to know the originality of life and communication of the peoples of the Republic of Taiwan.  Which country is this?  Consider some of these features. </p><ol><li>  Since 2009, smoking in public places has been prohibited in this republic. </li><li>  Despite the fact that the Taiwanese do not pay any attention to the person who sneezed, they can quite easily sniff out on the street even without using a scarf, which is considered quite normal. </li><li>  Just by last name or first name is not accepted here.  Be sure to use the connecting words: title, position, other treatment ("miss", "mistress", "master", etc.). </li><li>  Patting on the back, kisses and all sorts of other similar forms of contact can greatly shock local people. </li><li>  They do not like it when they call them Chinese.  Only in cases of a more global discussion of the culture of ancient times can such a word be allowed in conversation. </li><li>  As in many countries, here you can bargain in private stores and markets, and for sellers the art of bargaining is more important than its result. </li></ol>
