    <h2>  Many different places: which one to choose? </h2><p>  Based on the purpose for which each tourist goes on a trip, and determine the direction of movement.  To improve health with thermal water, it is better to go to Lankaran, to be coated with medicinal oil - welcome to Naftalan.  It is better to spend a quiet vacation in unity with nature in Kusary, Masall or Nabran-sel.  But if the Russian soul requires a celebration of life with festivities and fireworks, it is better to choose Baku.  Although, of course, each of the listed holiday destinations can please with a cultural program, the latter will be more crowded.  To expand their historical knowledge and explore the ancient cultural monuments, it is better to go to Shiki, Nakhichevan or Shemakha.  But first things first. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baku city republic of azerbaijan" class="if" height="459" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/1268465.jpg" width="600"></div>

Consider the best of them. </p><h2>  Lankaran </h2><p>  <span>Sea tour</span> in Azerbaijan reviews <strong> </strong>  on the restoration of health through thermal waters is positive.  There are thermal springs not far from the city of Lankaran, in the Gaftoninsky forests.  In the city itself there are several resorts that specialize in various diseases of the musculoskeletal system, nervous and cardiovascular systems, as well as the restoration of immunity. </p><p>  Lankaran stands on the swampy coast of the <span>Caspian Sea.</span>  As archaeological excavations prove, people settled here already in the Bronze Age, in other words, 2-3 thousand years before the advent of our era.  The city itself arose already in the 10th century AD. </p><p>  In addition to medical procedures, it is worth taking a closer look at the beauty of the city.  Many very well-preserved attractions date back to the 8th century.  Particular attention should be paid to the Lankaran fortress and Khanig. </p><h2>  Lankaran fortress </h2><p>  It is a round structure with high stone walls topped with rows of sharp teeth.  Previously, a couple of bazaars were located in the fortress, but over time they were abolished. </p><h2>  Haniga </h2><p>  Behind the fortress wall are several mosques and mausoleums that have become famous for their magnificent architectural decoration - beautiful stone carvings.  The main buildings of Hanigi were erected in the XI-XIV centuries, but over time they were repeatedly rebuilt.  A mosque is located next to Haniga, in which is located the tomb of Pir-Hussein.  The mihrab is a great pride of the mosque - a <span>niche in the wall,</span> consisting of two columns and an arch, decorated with kufic inscriptions and in an ornament of multi-colored tiles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

A little later here, Legzy Akhmedov, a national poet and singer, told him about Ashug-Garib, later Lermontov wrote ‚ÄúAshik-Kerib‚Äù based on the story.  In Kusary, the house-museum of M. Yu. Lermontov is located, the facade of which is decorated with a memorial tablet with words of greeting to the Caucasus. </p><p>  To get a little acquainted with the city, you can visit the museum of local lore, which has about 3,000 exhibits, take a walk in the park named after Nariman Narimanovich, and also go to the square of acquaintances and dates. </p><h2>  Masalli </h2><p>  Sea vacations in Azerbaijan are admired by the nature of the city of Masalli.  The city is located 230 km from Baku, but nevertheless it has rather high chances to enter the most popular routes of the country in the future.  Looking at Azerbaijan on the map, you can see that the city of Masalli somehow stands out - probably due to its amazing location.  On the one hand, the coast of the Caspian, on the other - Talysh mountains.  And wherever the eye is enough, nature is amazingly beautiful.  They go to Masalli to enjoy the purity and coolness of the Caspian waters, dense forests with valuable species of trees: beech, oak, hornbeam, alder and iron tree.  Here, in the forest thicket, there is an amazingly beautiful lake.  Both tourists and residents of surrounding cities come here for fishing.  Mineral springs located near the city of Masalli will help patients with diseases of the joints and bones. </p><p>  In Massaly, as in almost all <span>cities of Azerbaijan,</span> there are many historical buildings and structures.  It is worth visiting a mosque built in the 19th century, and if you make a trip to the nearby villages, you can find buildings dating back to the 16th century.  To find out various interesting facts about the city, as well as get acquainted with handicrafts, you should go to the museum of local lore. </p><p>  Tourists who do not want to live in the city can settle in modern recreation centers, which also have healing mineral springs. </p><h2>  Nabran (village) </h2><p>  Sea tour in Azerbaijan reviews about Nabran as a good place for recreation has in sufficient quantity.  They will be useful to those who are going to go there.  Tyran has long established itself as a resort area, and not only among the indigenous people of the country, but also among citizens of countries that were formerly part of the USSR.

We list the main ones. </p><h2>  Shamakhi </h2><p>  Holidays in the Caspian are a great opportunity to expand your knowledge, get acquainted with the ancient culture and traditions of the country. </p><p>  <span>Archaeological excavations</span> have shown that in the northwestern part of the city there used to be a settlement whose age dates back to the 4th-5th centuries BC.  e. </p><p>  In 1222, Shemakhia was in a long siege, but could not resist for a long time, so the Tatar-Mongol troops captured and destroyed the fortress. </p><p>  The location of the city (it was on the intersection of several roads) contributed to the fact that for a very long time Shemakhia was attacked by its neighbors.  They constantly robbed and destroyed the city. </p><p>  Later, the Great Silk Road began to run through the city.  And all because in Shamakhi there were schools of carpet weaving and miniatures.  Silk was traded between representatives of different countries: Azerbaijan and Iran, Russia and India, as well as Arab, West European and Central Asian merchants. </p><p>  The most famous building of Shemakha is the Gulistan fortress, erected in the XII century.  On its territory, archaeologists have found several items whose age was determined by the IX century.  Consequently, the fortress has more than 1000 years.  For several centuries, the walls of the fortress defended the inhabitants from the attacks of the troops of the Mongols, Arabs and Ottomans.  The main feature of the Gulistan fortress is the secret passage that leads from it to the gorge.  Gulistan was used until the 16th century, but was subsequently destroyed by numerous earthquakes almost to the ground.  Currently, it has remained from the picturesque ruins, which are located on the outskirts of the city. </p>

    <h2>  Yeddy Gumbez </h2><p>  At the foot of the Gulistan fortress is located the mausoleum of ‚ÄúSeven Domes‚Äù, or Yeddy Gumbez.  Noble people from the Shirvanshah clan were buried in this tomb.  Seven domes mean the number of burials that are similar to spheres grown from the earth. </p><h2>  Juma mosque </h2><p>  Built in 744 and is the oldest mosque in the Caucasus.  During its construction, a unique architectural solution was applied: 3 halls for prayers, which were interconnected by wide openings. </p><p>  Many wars and earthquakes led to the fact that the mosque had to be rebuilt several times.  But during its reconstruction, the basic principles of construction were preserved: one central hall, located under a large dome, and two side ones with smaller domes.  As before, each hall has its own separate entrance and mihrab. </p><h2>  Sheki </h2><p>  When buying tours to Azerbaijan in Sheki, you should know that this is one of the oldest cities in Transcaucasia.  In the old days, Sheki was the capital of the Sheki Khanate, which was subsequently annexed to Russia in 1805.  And with the death of the last of the khans, Ismail, in 1819 became the Transcaucasian province of Tsarist Russia.  Like all resorts on the Caspian Sea, Sheki also boasts memorials, but there are not many of them. </p><h2>  Sheki Khans Palace </h2><p>  It was built in the 18th century.  Window openings are decorated with openwork ligature, and on the walls are depicted images of Nizami. </p><p>  The Telesen-Geresen fortress (‚Äúcome-see‚Äù) for a long time defended its inaccessible walls of the inhabitants from the attack of various enemies. </p><p>  The ancient city of Sheki used to be a major shopping center.  Here were located the caravanserais that have survived to this day: Lezgi, Isfahan, Tabriz, as well as hotels and inns.  Silk was produced, which was famous in other countries.  Today, silk factory, silk-weaving and silk-spinning factories are engaged in its production. </p><p>  Due to numerous earthquakes, Sheki is not rich in historical monuments, but the city is still famous for the production of copper utensils, embroidery, embossing and jewelry.  Famous silk scarves are loved by women all over the world. </p>

    <h2>  Nakhichevan </h2><p>  The age of the city is estimated at almost five thousand years.  And proof of this are cave paintings, letters, archaeological finds. </p><p>  The cave paintings that have come down to our time can be seen today on the slope of Mount Gapydzhik.  Ancient Azerbaijanis living at the foot of the mountain painted images of various animals on the stones: dogs, wolves, goats, deer, as well as symbols and fantastic images of people.  Drawings were performed in a single version and in pairs.  Nowadays, one can admire the preserved images of hunters with bows and dance couples that were knocked out by someone else's hand. </p><h2>  Mausoleum of Noah </h2><p>  There are many monuments in Azerbaijan, therefore, in order to carefully examine everything, it is better to travel to resorts on the Caspian Sea more than once. </p><p>  The tomb of Noah belongs to the IX-XII centuries and is located in the southern part of the city, not far from the ancient fortress.  According to legend, after a long voyage, the ark of Noah found its refuge at the top of the mountain Gapydzhik. </p>

    <p>  Azerbaijan on the map does not occupy a very large area, but this does not mean that there are no interesting places for every taste.  In Baku, a large area is occupied by shopping centers and fashion stores.  In shopping centers there are very good discounts, so when you go shopping, you can please yourself with inexpensive things and funny trinkets.  Prices in Azerbaijan are quite high: a tourist spends about 110-130 dollars a day, and for a low quality of service this is quite a lot.  Of course, you can save money, but for this you will have to rent housing on the outskirts of Baku, where public services leave much to be desired. </p><p>  Go on tours to the Caspian Sea, travel, try to find out as much as possible - because our life is so short! </p>
