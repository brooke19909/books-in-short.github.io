    <p>  The equipment of the domestic brand has a two-way communication channel between the car and the user's keychain.  This greatly simplifies the process of setting up and managing the system.  A special encoding of the signal completely eliminates the possibility of cracking messages.  Its transmission range can reach 1800 m in open areas. </p><p>  The dynamic principle underlies the encoding of the signal.  The driver is notified through various sound and vibration signals.  About 300 car models allow the installation of the equipment presented.  They can have almost any type of gearbox, as well as a diesel, gasoline and turbocharged engine type. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Operational Features </h2><p>  Starline A91, A61, <span>Starline</span> <span>B9</span> systems possess high quality equipment <span>.</span>  <span>How to enable autorun</span> will be presented later.

    <p>  The system includes the ability to change settings in accordance with the requirements of the user.  This greatly increases the comfort of its use.  Settings are easily changed by means of trinkets that come with the equipment.  They may or may not have an LCD display.  In the first embodiment, the exchange of information between the on-board computer and the user is easier. </p><p>  The alarm system is Russified, which facilitates the settings.  Using the keychain is very simple.  In total, the control unit can write 4 control devices to its memory.  Then you can proceed to the settings. </p><h2>  Remote controller </h2><p>  Studying the issue of <span>how to turn on the autostart of the Starline engine</span> , you need to understand the features of the application of the remote controls.  It is with the help of these remotes that you can configure almost any function of the security system.  A keychain with a screen is best suited for these purposes.  Push-button varieties to make such settings will be much more difficult.  If for some reason the keychain with the display is out of order, it can be purchased at a specialized store and stored in the computer's memory. </p>

    <p>  Such a remote control has in addition to the screen three buttons.  Each of them is responsible for a specific function.  The most popular keychain commands among motorists are the inclusion of a security program and autostart.  Managing an on-board computer is simple, even without being near your car. </p><p>  The keychain comes with a battery.  It is not installed inside the remote control.  First, the battery must be put in its intended place.  Next, the keychain is turned on.  The user can proceed with the settings. </p><h2>  Buttons </h2><p>  When considering <span>how to enable Starline autostart, you</span> should start by controlling the remote control.  It includes 3 buttons.  All settings are performed with their help. </p><p>  The first control button is responsible for enabling various program commands.  It should be pressed 1 time.  If the I button is clamped and held in this position, the system will turn on (or turn off) the engine.  If the motor is on, holding the I button for 3 seconds will allow the system to enter the armed mode. </p><p>  Button II is responsible for the cursor that moves around the screen.  Its movement is carried out by quick pressing.  If button II is held for a certain time, the trunk lock will open.  Button III moves the cursor in the opposite direction.  She is responsible for turning off the sound of the key fob.  If you hold it pressed for a long time, you can program the time indicators and turn on the system energy saving. </p><h2>  Safety operation </h2><p>  Before you enable Starline autorun, it is recommended that you study the safety rules when using the presented security program.  All requirements are presented in the instructions. </p><p>  High signal range can only be achieved in open space.  In this case, the car must be put on the handbrake.  The transmission of a manual gearbox is brought into a neutral state.  Automatic transmission is fixed in the parking position. </p><p>  All machine systems at the time of the settings must be fully operational.  The system must have a sufficient amount of lubricant and fuel.  If the autostart function is activated, there should not be any objects in the immediate vicinity of the car.  Leave the keychain in a place where children cannot reach. </p><h2>  Add devices to computer memory </h2><p>  Before starting autostart, the Starline alarm must be properly configured.  If the vehicle that the user purchased was already in use, be sure to overwrite the key fobs in the computer's memory.  Also, a similar procedure will be required if there is no reaction of the control unit to the signals that the user sends from the remote control. </p>
