In a word, beach Italy includes a full palette of pleasures! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="half moon 3" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/469973.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays on the coast of Italy </h2><p>  Everything contributes to a comfortable rest in the local places: the gentle sea, the gorgeous coast, and the fantastically beautiful landscapes, the mild sea climate, and the mass of interesting entertainments, the hospitable and friendly people, and a large selection of hotels in which tourists are provided regardless of the number of stars high quality service.  So, for example, the Half Moon 3 * hotel, which is located in Rimini at Via Brindisi, 1847900 Rivazzura, despite its modest size and discreet interior, as well as a three-star category, serves its guests at the highest level.  By the way, almost all 3 * European hotels are modest in their interiors, you will not see elements of luxury, expensive decorations and interesting stylistic decisions in them, but you will not find tourists complaining about the quality of service in these hotels at any of the tourism forums.  The same applies to the hotel Half Moon 3 *.  Reviews from tourists from Russia may contain dissatisfaction with the repair or the small size of the rooms, however, all of them unanimously praise the hospitable employees of this Italian establishment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The characteristic features of three-star hotels in Europe </h2><p>  Before proceeding with the description of the hotel Half Moon 3 * (Italy), let's get acquainted with what is meant by the category of three-star hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="half moon 3 hotel" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/469972.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Hotels of this class are the most popular among European tourists.  And this is a special category of travelers.  They are unpretentious and content with little, if only it would be clean and comfortable.  They will never overpay for increased comfort, since in sea resorts most of the day you have to spend on the beach.  All three-star European hotels have a bathroom with shower, bath accessories, hygiene products and a hairdryer;  satellite television;  telephone with international dialing;  minibar and safe (optional);  furniture for storing clothes and other luggage, etc. In hotels of this type, guests are served as BB, BH or All Inclusive (at the choice of tourists), however, regardless of their decision, breakfast is required.  Unlike Greek or Turkish hotels, Western European, for example, the Italian hotel Half Moon 3 *, offer tourists much less services.  Tourists should consider this when choosing a tour.  For an average European, a three-star hotel is the best option for the price-quality ratio.  For example, the price for a weekly tour at the Half Moon Hotel, depending on the season and type of room, varies from 500 to 1200 euros.  And it‚Äôs a very convenient price.  For Europeans, it is important that the rooms are clean, that the staff, besides the mother tongue, also speak English, that the restaurant is fed with quality products, etc.  But Russian tourists expect more from a three-star hotel, and they often experience disappointment, although, by and large, they can‚Äôt complain about anything concrete.  So in the case of the hotel Half Moon 3 * <span>(Rimini).</span>  <span>Reviews</span> and ratings of tourists from Russia about the service in it are mostly negative.  Along with this, they note the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff, which speaks only in favor of this hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="half moon 3 italy" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/469971.jpg" width="600"></div>

The total length of the coastline of Italy is about 1000 km.  The resort town of Rimini, which houses the Half Moon 3 * hotel, is the regional center of Emily-Rommany.  It is also the ‚Äúair gate‚Äù of the entire ‚ÄúAdriatic Riviera‚Äù.  This explains the popularity of this resort among tourists from different countries, including Russia.  In addition, here on the coast there are all conditions for a comfortable beach holiday: a mild <span>subtropical climate</span> with a mild summer (average +28), although in recent years the thermometer has sometimes reached + 40 ¬∞ mark, wonderful sandy beaches, gentle and warm sea , mineral springs, thalassotherapy centers and, importantly, low prices. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hotel Half Moon 3 * (Rimini) is located almost in the center of the resort in the Rivazzura area on the second line.  Since the hotel is located just 150 meters from beach number 108, it can be reached in just 3-5 minutes on foot.  This is a pretty modern hotel, although it was built in the 90s of the last century.  Wireless internet is available throughout the hotel, which is important for tourists from different countries.  The hotel building is a five-story building with an elevator, with balconies and a <span>summer terrace.</span>  Here you will not see any excesses, no scenery.  The modern design of the hotel is modest and even, at first glance, a little strict for the resort hotel.  But the service is up to standard here.  You will be greeted immediately at the entrance with a friendly smile, register immediately and check into the desired room, in which you will find everything you need for temporary residence.  This hotel is aimed at all categories of vacationers, both adults and children.  However, young people come here most often.  The biggest plus for boys and girls is the proximity of the hotel to the famous disco throughout Rimini. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel Interior </h2><p>  According to the rules established inside the hotel, check-in is from 14 hours and check-out is until 10 hours.  Children under 3 years stay free of charge.  Pets are not allowed in the hotel, international credit cards are accepted when paying.  The hotel does not have a lobby, but there is a lounge with a seating area next to the reception.  Another lounge area is in the hotel courtyard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="half moon 3 rimini reviews" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/469969.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Number of rooms of the hotel Half Moon (Rivazzurra) 3 * </h2><p>  The five-story building of the hotel accommodates only 36 standard rooms for up to 4 people.  Each room has air conditioning, heating, a bathroom (toilet, bidet, shower, mirror, hair dryer, hygiene products and towels), <span>wardrobe,</span> beds, a large mirror, a chair and a table, a mini-safe.  As you can see, there is not much furniture here, but the modest size of the room does not imply anything superfluous.  But cleaning, towel change and the provision of hygiene products are daily, and bed linen is changed twice a week.  In addition, the rooms have a TV and satellite channels, as well as a telephone.  Balconies, although small, but they are in each of the rooms. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  The following services are available on site: </p><ul><li>  car parking; </li><li>  bicycle practice; </li><li>  a restaurant; </li><li>  a bar (round the clock); </li><li>  live music in the evenings; </li><li>  <span>babysitting services</span> (paid); </li><li>  gym; </li><li>  left-luggage office (for a fee); </li><li>  WiFi </li><li>  transfer (paid); </li><li>  concierge service; </li><li>  playroom; </li><li>  kids club, etc. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel half moon 3 rimini" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/469970.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Each of the guests can choose for themselves an individual type of food.  This can be type BB, that is, accommodation + breakfast, VN (accommodation + breakfast + dinner) or OI (all inclusive).  However, most tourists choose the first option, since the evenings at the resort can be diversified by visiting various restaurants and trying different dishes of the famous Italian cuisine.  By the way, in the reviews of Russian tourists you can see complaints about a meager breakfast and a monotonous dinner at the Half Moon 3 * hotel.  Spoiled by Turkish hospitality, Russian tourists, of course, notice a lot of minuses in Western European hotels of this level.  However, here it is considered the norm, and if this state of affairs does not suit you, then you need to choose a 4 * hotel, which, incidentally, will cost an order of magnitude higher.  Therefore, you either have to put up with it, or not spare money on your vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="half moon rivazzurra 3" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/469968.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  For guests of resort hotels, of course, the most important is the condition of the nearest beach, because tourists spend most of their time outside the walls of the hotel, on the beach or on excursions.
