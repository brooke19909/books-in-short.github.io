    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  Until the mid-nineteenth century, the Ottoman Empire controlled most of the Balkans and Bulgaria.  Turkish oppression spread to almost all of the South Slavic peoples.  The Russian Empire has always acted as the defender of all Slavs, and foreign policy was largely aimed at their liberation.  However, following the results of the previous war, Russia lost its fleet in the Black Sea and a number of territories in the south.  Allied treaties were also concluded between the Ottoman Empire and Great Britain.  In the event that the Russians declared war, the British pledged to provide military assistance to the Turks.  This situation excluded the possibility of the expulsion of the Ottomans from Europe.  In return, the Turks promised to respect the rights of Christians and not to persecute them on religious grounds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Oppression of the Slavs </h2><p>  However, the 60s of the 19th century were marked by new persecutions of Christians.  Muslims had great privileges before the law.  In court, the Christian‚Äôs voice against the Muslim was weightless.  Also, most state posts in the field were occupied by the Turks.  Dissatisfaction with this state of affairs has caused massive protests in Bulgaria and the Balkan countries.  In the summer of 1975, an uprising begins in Bosnia.  And a year later, in April, popular riots swept Bulgaria.  As a result, the Turks fiercely suppress the rebellion, killing tens of thousands of people.  Such atrocities against Christians cause discontent in Europe. </p><p>  Under the pressure of public opinion, Great Britain rejects pro-Turkish politics.  This unties the hands of the Russian Empire, which is preparing a campaign against the Ottomans. </p><h2>  Start of war </h2><p>  On April 12, the <span>Russo-Turkish war began.</span>  The capture of Plevna will actually complete it in six months.  However, there was a long way to go.  According to the plan of the Russian headquarters, the troops were supposed to advance from two directions.  The first group to go through Romanian territory to the Balkans, and the other to strike from the Caucasus.  There were insurmountable obstacles in both of these directions.  <span>The Balkan ridge</span> prevented a quick strike from the Caucasus, and the ‚Äúquadrangle‚Äù of fortresses from Romania.  The situation was also complicated by the possible intervention of the United Kingdom.  Despite public pressure, the British still continued to support the Turks.  Therefore, the war had to be won as soon as possible so that the Ottoman Empire capitulated before reinforcements arrived. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fast offensive </h2><p>  The capture of Plevna was carried out by troops under the command of General Skobelev.  In early July, the Russians crossed the Danube and reached the road to Sofia.  In this campaign, the Romanian army joined them.  Initially, the Turks were going to meet allies on the banks of the Danube.  However, the swift offensive forced Osman Pasha to retreat to the fortresses.  In fact, the first capture of Plevna took place on June 26th.  An elite squad under the command of Ivan Gurko entered the city.  However, there were only fifty scouts in the unit.  Almost simultaneously with the Russian Cossacks, three Turkish battalions entered the city, which forced them out. </p><p>  Understanding that the capture of Plevna will give the Russians a complete strategic advantage, Osman Pasha decides to occupy the city before the arrival of the main forces.  At this time, his army was in the city of Vidin.  From there, the Turks were supposed to advance along the Danube to prevent the Russians from crossing.  However, the danger of the environment forced the Muslims to abandon the original plan.  On the first of July, 19 battalions march from Vidin.  In six days, they traveled more than two hundred kilometers with artillery, convoys, provisions, and so on.  At dawn on July 7, the Turks entered the fortress. </p><p>  The Russians had the opportunity to take the city before Osman Pasha.  However, the negligence of some generals played.  Due to the lack of military intelligence, the Russians did not find out in time about the Turkish march to the city.  As a result, the capture of the Plevna fortress by the Turks took place without battles.  Russian General Yuri Schilder-Schuldner was late for just a day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="military history day" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1711678.jpg" width="600"></div>  But during this time, the Turks have already managed to entrench themselves and take up the defense.  After some deliberation, the headquarters decides to storm the fortress.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  First Attempt </h2><p>  Russian troops marched on the city from two sides.  General Schilder-Schuldern had no idea about the number of Turks in the city.  He led the right column of troops, while the left marched at a distance of four kilometers.  According to the original plan, both columns were to enter the city at the same time.  However, due to the incorrectly compiled map, they only moved away from each other.  At about one in the afternoon the main column approached the city.  Suddenly, they were attacked by the advance detachments of the Turks, who occupied Plevna just a few hours before.  A battle ensued, which developed into an artillery duel. </p><p>  Schilder-Schuldner had no idea about the actions of the left column, so he ordered to move away from the fired positions and set up camp.  The left column under the command of Kleinghaus came out to the city from the direction of Grivitsa.  Cossack intelligence was sent.  Two hundred soldiers advanced along the river with the aim of reconnaissance of the nearest villages and the fortress itself.  However, hearing the sounds of battle, they retreated to their own. </p><h2>  Offensive </h2><p>  On the night of July 8, it was decided to storm.  From the direction of Grivitsa, the left column was advancing.  The general with most of the soldiers was coming from the north.  Osman Pasha's main positions were near the village of Opanets.  About eight thousand Russians marched against them at a front line of up to three kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="siege and capture" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1711683.jpg" width="600"></div>  Schilder-Schuldner lost the ability to maneuver due to the lowlands.  His troops had to go on a frontal attack.  At five in the morning, artillery preparation began.  The vanguard of the Russians launched an attack on Bukovlek and in two hours knocked out the Turks from there.  The road to Plevna was open.  Arkhangelsk regiment went to the main battery of the enemy.  The soldiers were at a distance of a shot from the artillery positions of the Ottomans.  Osman Pasha understood that numerical superiority was on his side, and gave the order to counterattack.  Under pressure from the Turks, two regiments retreated to the ravine.  The general requested support from the left column, but the enemy was advancing too quickly.  Therefore, Schilder-Schuldner ordered the retreat to begin.

    <h2>  Strike from the other flank </h2><p>  At the same time, Kridener was advancing from the direction of Grivitsa.  At six in the morning (when the main troops had already begun artillery preparation), the Caucasian corps hit the right flank of the Turkish defense.  After an uncontrollable onslaught of the Cossacks, the Ottomans in a panic began to flee to the fortress.  However, by the time of taking up positions at Grivitsa, Schilder-Schuldner had already retreated.  Therefore, the left column also began to retreat to its original positions.  The capture of Plevna by Russian troops was stopped with heavy losses for the latter.  Largely affected by the lack of intelligence and inept decisions of the general. </p><h2>  Preparing a New Offensive </h2><p>  After an unsuccessful assault, preparations began for a new attack.  Russian troops received significant reinforcements.  The cavalry and artillery units arrived.  The city was surrounded.  Tracking of all roads, especially those leading to Lovcha, began. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="taking a bite date" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1711690.jpg" width="600"></div>  For several days, reconnaissance was conducted in battle.  Constant skirmishes were heard both day and night.  However, it was not possible to find out the number of the Ottoman garrison in the city.

    <h2>  New assault </h2><p>  While the Russians were preparing for the assault, the Turks were rapidly erecting defense structures.  Construction took place in conditions of lack of tools and constant shelling.  On July 18, another assault began.  The capture of Pleven by the Russians would mean defeat in the war.  Therefore, Osman Pasha ordered his fighters to fight to the death.  The attack was preceded by a long artillery preparation.  After that, the soldiers rushed into battle from two flanks.  The troops under the command of Kridener managed to capture the first lines of defense.  However, near the redoubt they were met by overwhelming gun fire.  After bloody clashes, the Russians had to step back.  Skobelev attacked the left flank.  His fighters also failed to break through the lines of defense of the Turks.  The fight lasted all day.  Towards evening, the Turks launched a counterattack and knocked out Krinder soldiers from their trenches.  The Russians had to retreat again.  After this defeat, the government turned to the Romanians for help. </p><h2>  Blockade </h2><p>  After the arrival of the Romanian troops, the blockade and capture of Plevna became inevitable.  Therefore, Osman Pasha decided to break out of the besieged fortress.  On August 31, his troops carried out a distracting maneuver.  After which the main forces left the city and hit the nearest outposts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian-Turkish war" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1711695.jpg" width="225"></div>  After a short battle, they managed to push back the Russians and even capture one battery.  However, reinforcements soon arrived.  Melee ensued.  The Turks faltered and fled back to the city, leaving almost one and a half thousand soldiers on the battlefield.

    <p>  For a complete <span>siege of the fortress,</span> it was necessary to capture Lovcha.  It was through her that the Turks received reinforcements and provisions.  The city was occupied by <span>Turkish troops</span> and auxiliary detachments of Bashibuzuk.  They did a great job of punitive operations against civilians, but quickly left their positions in the future to meet with the regular army.  Therefore, when the Russians attacked the city on August 22, the Turks fled from there without much resistance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian spitting" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1711698.jpg" width="600"></div>  After the capture of the city, a siege began, and the capture of Plevna was only a matter of time.  Reinforcements arrived at the Russians.  Osman Pasha received reserves.

    <h2>  Capture of the Plevna Fortress: December 10, 1877 </h2><p>  After the complete encirclement of the city, the Turks remained completely cut off from the outside world.  Osman Pasha refused to capitulate and continued to strengthen the fortress.  At this point, 50 thousand Turks were hiding in the city against 120 thousand Russian and Romanian soldiers.  Siege fortifications were built around the city.  From time to time Plevna was fired by artillery.  The Turks ran out of provisions and ammunition.  The army suffered from disease and hunger. </p><p>  Osman Pasha decided to break out of the blockade, realizing that the inevitable swift capture of Pleven.  The breakthrough date was set for December 10th.  In the morning, Turkish troops mounted scarecrows in the fortifications and began to break out of the city.  But Little Russian and Siberian regiments became on their way.  And the Ottomans came with looted property and a large convoy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the capture of spit by Russian troops" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1711699.jpg" width="600"></div>  Of course, this complicated maneuverability.  After the start of the battle, reinforcements were sent to the breakthrough site.  At first, the Turks were able to discard the advanced units, but after hitting the flank they began to retreat to the lowland.  After the inclusion of artillery in the battle, the Turks ran randomly and eventually surrendered.
