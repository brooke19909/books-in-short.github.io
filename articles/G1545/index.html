Therefore, Queen Elizabeth’s events, which ensured her reign, are of interest. </p><h2>  Moderate Protestantism </h2><p>  By the time of accession to the throne of Queen Elizabeth, a religious crisis was brewing in the country.  Catholics could not come to terms with the Reformation of the church and refused to accept the changes.  Protestants insisted on the execution of true Catholics, faithful to the Pope. </p><p>  Listing the events of Queen Elizabeth that ensured the success of her rule, one cannot fail to mention the reform of the church.  The ruler did not choose one of the warring parties to openly support her.  Instead, she carried out a series of reforms that made it possible to establish peace in the country. </p>

    <p>  England remained a Protestant kingdom.  But at the same time, Catholics were not subjected to persecution and bloody reprisals.  Elizabeth became the head of the church.  This dealt a severe blow to the Catholic aristocracy, but not so powerful that a civil war broke out in the country. </p><p>  If under the father of Elizabeth, King Henry, many Catholics who were prominent and significant at court were executed on the scaffold or burned, then under the elder sister of Mary, Protestants were already destroyed.  Elizabeth refused religious executions.  She chose to punish with taxes and fines.  After the reign of Mary, nicknamed the Bloody, it seemed like mercy.  Although complete peace was not established in the country, the Queen’s reforms were enough to eliminate the threat of civil war. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The defeat of the invincible armada </h2><p>  Spain for many years remained one of England's most dangerous rivals.  Although attempts were made to reconcile the two states through marriage, every year it became increasingly clear that war could not be avoided.  Because the events of Queen Elizabeth, ensuring the success of her rule, were aimed at combating a powerful competitor. </p><p>  <span>Queen Elizabeth</span> supported the pirates, led by <span>Francis Drake,</span> who robbed the Spaniards' merchant ships and gave part of the mined to the treasury of England.  In addition, Elizabeth remained a Protestant and supported this branch of Christianity in her own land.  Spain at that time remained Catholic.  The events of Queen Elizabeth, ensuring the success of her reign, provoked outrage from King Philip.  All this only aggravated the conflict between the two countries.  As a result, the Spanish king Philip announced that Elizabeth illegally took the throne, and gathered a fleet to overthrow the queen. </p><p>  Philip was supported not only by ordinary Catholics, but also by the Pope himself.  He wanted to return England to his own influence and again become the head of the church in these lands.  In the meantime, the queen was at the head. </p>

    <p>  When Queen Elizabeth’s events, which ensured the success of her rule, are listed, they also speak of victory over the Invincible Armada.  The best warships were sent to battle with England.  It seemed that the queen had no chance of victory.  But the elements and <span>military cunning of</span> Elizabeth I accomplished the almost impossible. </p><p>  The armada was destroyed.  Ships went to the bottom, taking with them the military.  Those who were able to escape from the fate of the drowned man died on the shore.  Spain lost its strength and could no longer compete with England.  The latter received more advantages in international trade.  This success has led to replenishment of the treasury.  Art and literature began to develop in the country, theaters were built, among which was the legendary Globus. </p><p>  The events of Queen Elizabeth 1, ensuring the success of her reign, became an example for many generations of rulers from different countries.  This woman acted carefully and thoughtfully, which ensured the prosperity of her country and her exaltation in the international arena. </p>
