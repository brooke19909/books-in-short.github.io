The air conditioner provides a comfortable temperature, a stunning view from the windows opens from the balcony or terrace.

Again, next to the airport, near the sea, only 6 kilometers from Heraklion.  This hotel has 136 rooms and all are furnished to stringent requirements and standards.

However, despite the fact that the listed options are hotels for wealthy people, guests of different levels of income relax in them.  So, for example, in the previously mentioned Neptuno Beach a double room for two for five days will cost about 19,000 rubles.  And this is for the all-inclusive service, and even in a room with all amenities.  And in the Mareblue Beach Resort 4 * (Corfu Island, Agios, Spiridon), which was mostly discussed in our article, in a standard double room for six days will cost 19,500 rubles.  As you can see, the cost is not so high if you take into account what services are offered for the money.  In general, there are plenty of accommodation options - from upscale five-star complexes to budget options for an economical vacation.  For example, the three-star Akti Corali Hotel.  The option is no worse than all of the above - about 8,000 rubles for six days.  There is more modest service and not such a favorable location, but guests will find all the amenities here: a pool, comfortable comfortable rooms, stylish furnishings, Wi-Fi and food.  Incidentally, the windows offer breathtaking mountain views.  In general, hospitable Greece is rich in hotels of various classes and destinations.  The choice depends only on the tourist and his personal preferences.
