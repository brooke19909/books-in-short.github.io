  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Car vacuum cleaner: which one to choose?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A clean car interior is a necessary component of a comfortable ride, so frequent cleaning can not be avoided.  But in order to manually do this with a brush, it will take a lot of time.  Not everyone can afford to call in a car wash regularly.  So, you should buy a good car vacuum cleaner, and the process of cleaning the cabin will become easier and faster.  And here the main question looms: which car <span>vacuum cleaner is better?</span> </p><p>  In the review below we will try to find an answer to this question by analyzing the most common models.  But first, we will determine the main requirements for this unit, namely a vacuum cleaner should be: </p><ul><li>  Compact </li><li>  Not quite expensive and not the noisiest; </li><li>  Powerful. </li></ul><p>  Almost all of them are connected to the cigarette lighter, but there are models that operate on battery power and have the option of connecting to an electrical outlet.  Also, initially I want to note that models from Chinese manufacturers are the cheapest, but also the least reliable will not be considered.  Since the purchase of such a product is a waste of time and effort. </p><p>  <strong>Black &amp; Decker ACV 1205</strong> </p><p>  This is the most popular car vacuum cleaner.  Among its advantages it should be noted good power when absorbing dust and dirt, a convenient long cable, low price for this brand.  True, it must be said about the disadvantages: the wool is not collected as efficiently as when using models with the appropriate brush (important for those who often carry cats or dogs), a frequent change of the fine filter will be required (if it is dirty, the power of the vacuum cleaner weakens). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Black &amp; Decker PAV 1205</strong> </p><p>  Another, more powerful car vacuum cleaner from an American manufacturer.  It is stated that it can be used both in the car and indoors.  Among its advantages are light weight and convenient nozzles, as well as high power and a self-cleaning filter.  No cons were noticed, except that the price is more expensive than the previous model. </p><p>  <strong>Electrolux ZB 4103</strong> </p><p>  The convenience of this model is that instead of a dust bag, a container is used, which can be cleaned easily and simply.  The power is also good, though often you will have to change the fine filter.  There is also a crevice nozzle that will allow you to vacuum even the most inaccessible places, but there is no rotating brush that collects wool and hair well.  The price is quite reasonable. </p><p>  <strong>"Pitch" Vc60</strong> </p><p>  The best car vacuum cleaner among analogues of domestic production.  It should be noted a good set of this car vacuum cleaner, it is accompanied by several brushes, a cover.  It collects wool and hair from the seats well, the power is initially high, but with a gradual filling of the dust collector it falls.  You will not need to buy additional filters during operation, as the car owner can clean them, wash them.  The optimal price-quality ratio. </p><p>  <strong>Thomas dolphin</strong> </p><p>  This car vacuum cleaner is the only one from the whole list equipped with the option of collecting liquid, which is important.  Also among the advantages of the model: the absence of a bag for collecting dust (container), there is an indicator of fullness of the dust collector, high suction power.  The vacuum cleaner filter can be easily washed by yourself. </p><p>  Thus, the most notable models of the modern market of car vacuum cleaners are given above.  It should be noted that they are still slightly different from each other.  If it is possible to clean the interior with a home <span>washing vacuum cleaner,</span> then naturally such units are not needed.  But if this is not possible or often you have to clean away from home, then you can choose the most convenient model for yourself.  Moreover, the prices are relatively inexpensive.  With frequent cleaning and basic accuracy, the cleanliness of the interior of the car will be ensured. </p>
