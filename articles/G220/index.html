    <h2>  "The Snow Queen" - a fairy tale for children and adults </h2><p>  On New Year's Eve, many women want to feel at least for a while as a queen, even if they are snowy.  And at corporate parties, screenwriters often turn their attention to this wonderful tale.  After all, playing the story re-twisted in a modern way is an opportunity to allegorically express through the scene your attitude to reality, laugh somewhere, and make the viewer think somewhere.  That's where fancy dress costumes are needed! </p>

    <p>  The hat can be taken from the grandmother‚Äôs wardrobe, you can knit or sew it yourself.  The fact that the costume will become serious or cool will already depend on the chosen style of the headgear, because most often the main attributes that express the main masquerade ideas are masks, hats.  A do-it-yourself costume can even be made with one piece.  It is the red headdress that already symbolizes the carnival outfit for the fairy-tale character named Little Red Riding Hood.  And such, for example, can be a <span>pioneer cap</span> or a red bandana with painted skull and crossbones, a wide-brimmed extravagant hat with a huge feather or veil, or a soldier‚Äôs hat with earflaps repainted in the corresponding color.  And how the creative outfit will be beaten is not the business of the dresser, but the scriptwriter. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cool Baba Yaga in five minutes! </h2><p>  Some do-it-yourself fancy dress costumes can be done in just a few minutes.  For example, an outfit of some kind of "evil spirits": Baba Yaga, kikimory, devils, goblin.  Here the main role is played by ragged floors of clothes and crooked sewn patches.  Moreover, the patches should be sewn in a contrasting color with bright thick threads over the edge.  If you have a huge nose at home, even with a mustache - it's just wonderful!  Baba Yaga just didn‚Äôt shave for a long time.  But live yourself for a thousand years, let's see if your mustache grows or not ... </p><p>  Although there is still a variant of the costume for Babka the Cute Cutie.  Here you shouldn‚Äôt bother at all - you can put on everything that your eyes fall on!  The main thing is not to forget tattered or hemmed boots (one can be replaced with an old huge men's sneaker), make-up bright to disgrace, causing homeric laughter, the same jewelry and several patches - just a little.  The dress can be worn on the cool Babulechka-Yagulechka extra-short, and under it fit torn tights or elongated underpants - knitted shorts that older women use as underwear.  And the panicle would not be forgotten!  One hundred percent, that over Grandma Yaga everyone will have fun.  But such fancy dress carnival costumes with their own hands to build is not difficult. </p>

    <h2>  For the devil horns and tail are essential attributes <strong> </strong></h2><p>  To create such outfits, you can use tracksuits with sewn patches.  Although it is worth conjuring, preparing for girls fancy dresses with their own hands.  Perhaps they can add some coquetry and femininity.  Therefore, it is best to use leggings, leggings or tight tights. </p><p>  And on the ponytails of cute devils, of course, you need to hang bright bows or hairpins.  And you can even lay them intricate ornament on the pope "with the meaning", if only the tail will be different from the clothes in color. </p><p>  If we make a fancy dress with our own hands for the devils, then do not lose sight of the need to make horns.  They, of course, can be bought.  But it‚Äôs quite realistic to build them yourself from papier-m√¢ch√© or threads wound around a template and plastered with glue, and then painted in the right way.  Carnival glasses can very well be improved by adding a cute little nose-piglet, and from above "having increased" their horns. </p><p>  Horns adapted to luxurious hats or frivolous hats look very elegant and sexy. </p><h2>  The role of hats and carnival glasses in fancy dress </h2><p>  In general, one such accessory as a hat can play a leading role in the appearance of the hero.  Sometimes you don‚Äôt even have to bother with how to make a children's carnival costume with your own hands, if you have an original hat.  A pointed hat with brim and a black cloak decorated with stars - that‚Äôs the outfit of an astrologer.  If a woman in a black suit puts on the same headdress, then this outfit automatically gets the name <span>"witch costume."</span> </p>

    <p>  A checkered cap indicates that the mummer is imitating the famous Russian clown Oleg Popov.  A headdress with balls on top or a rabbit and the same cloak will turn the baby into a magician.

Young slender girls can use short tutu skirts, and mature curvy matrons will quite respectably look in wide overalls or ridiculous wide short pants.  Wigs of various colors will become a bright creative addition to the appearance of a clown or clowness.  It is very easy to make such masquerade costumes with your own hands.  Discussion of these outfits, laughter and funny remarks will only add to them a rating among all the others presented at the holiday.  It will definitely be fun. </p>

    <h2>  Jack Sparrow - Favorite Character for Carnival </h2><p>  You can make a fancy dress for a boy with your own hands.  Boys, and sometimes even girls, just love to dress up in sea robbers: pirates, filibusters.  Yes, and adults often come up with such ideas for fancy dress.  With your own hands, especially <span>Jack Sparrow's costume, it is</span> quite easy to make.  You will need loose pants, high boots, a shirt and a vest, a bandana and a crooked knife from children's toys or cardboard, glued with foil.  Long boots can be made independently by stitching the top of the bootlegs out of cardboard.  This freebie can even be cut off from old boots that are prepared for disposal. </p><p>  It would be nice to decorate a shirt with an extravagant frill with a huge brooch - everyone knows that the legendary Jack loved to dress beautifully.  You can also tie a scarf or a bright bow on the neck.  The satin sash on the belt also does not hurt.  The symbol "skull with bones" is a mandatory attribute of any pirate, so you should consider where to place it in the outfit. </p><p>  If the choice falls not specifically on Jack Sparrow, but simply on a filibuster, then it is quite appropriate to replace the bandana with a wide-brimmed hat, you can add a dark cloak to the robe that is tied under the chin. </p>

    <h2>  Dressing up a dragon is easy! </h2><p>  There are other examples of fancy dress.  With your own hands, for example, you can make a dragon outfit.  It is easy to build if the boy or even the girl has a black T-shirt with sleeves and tight-fitting leotards or tight black tights.  The wings are made of either thick paper or black fabric.  To maintain the shape should be attached to them pieces of wire.  On the sleeves and legs can be sewn strips of "noodles" of paper or fabric.  The tail can be made either from fabric or weaved from an ordinary clothesline by placing the wire inside and painting the part in the desired color. </p><p>  To complete the image, you can do with a half mask, consisting of masquerade glasses.  It only needs to be painted and added ears.  But if you wish, you can build a full-fledged mask by repainting any of the available ones in black.  From above, in the forehead, it is recommended to stick ears and horns on it. </p><h2>  Serpent Gorynych: options for clothing for one and three people </h2><p>  The <span>costume of the Snake</span> Gorynych looks very creative.  It can be made both for one child, and immediately for two.  If the outfit is prepared for one, then a couple more goals need to be adjusted to the collar on the wire.  But for three people they simply sew a wide hoodie of green or black color with three necks and a long tail.  One man sticks his hand in one sleeve, the other in the other.  Unfortunately, the third will have to be at the festival "without hands."  And sitting at the table in such an outfit is not very convenient.  Therefore, most often it is used only for performance. </p><h2>  Spongebob and his square pants </h2><p>  Making children's fancy dresses with their own hands, adults often turn to cartoon characters.  All kids today are familiar with SpongeBob.  And every child wants to dress up in it, regardless of gender.  You can make such an outfit pretty quickly from a simple white pillowcase.  You just need to cut holes for the head and hands and paint the ‚Äúshirt‚Äù with ordinary paints.  You can, of course, make the applique with different fabrics using a sewing machine or iron and polyethylene.  The main thing is to insert a solid wire or stick in the upper seam so that the square shape does not deform. </p>

How to sew it at home - this article will tell. </p><p>  The main part in the outfit is overalls.  It is sewn of fleece or flannel of the appropriate color.  The pattern is easy to make from old clothes, which are recommended to be cut.  It is necessary to leave allowances for seams and length if the child has already grown from the attire that is selected as a template.  You can also sew not overalls, but separately panties and a blouse, so it will be more practical, because the costume in this case will last more than one year. </p><p>  If necessary, sew pieces of fur on the collar, the tip of the tail, on the ankles or wrists. </p>

    <ol><li>  The middle rectangle is 7 cm wide. The length is calculated from the lowest point behind the back of the head of a real person to the virtual tip of a wolf‚Äôs nose.  Angles from one end should be smoothly cut to form. </li><li>  4 identical triangular parts - ears.  They are connected in pairs and turned inside out by seams. </li><li>  Two identical sidewalls, which include the cheeks, eyes and side of the nose.  In shape, these parts resemble a semicircle with a wolf nose in profile.  Tucks or tucks are made into the semicircle during sewing in order to give the cap a roundness.  The middle rectangle is sewn to the upper part of the muzzle (along the red dotted line), while the ears are sewn together (along the blue dotted line). </li><li>  Half of the open upper part of the mouth is red or pink.  Sew a mouth after the upper part of the mask is sewn (green dotted line).  Along the way, you can attach white fangs, which are most conveniently cut from a rubber insole or can be sewn from fabric and stuffed with cotton.  You can use cardboard. </li></ol><p>  Eyes are glued onto the finished mask or buttons are sewn.  You can make eyebrows out of fur.  The nose is stuffed with foam rubber or synthetic winterizer, a button is sewn onto the pipka. </p><p>  You can make a mask of paper or papier-m√¢ch√©.  And some even manage to crochet a luxurious funny muzzle of yarn. </p><p>  In general, there can be no barriers for imagination when making a costume for a carnival.  To the inventor, a wide field for activity will open up! </p>
