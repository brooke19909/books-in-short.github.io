Nokia x2</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Who has not heard of the legendary Finnish company Nokia?  Phones from this manufacturer have long been considered cult.  For a long time nothing was heard about this company, because it was bought by Bill Gates brainchild under the name "Microsoft".  And this office is known for its ability to kill legendary brands.  It so happened with Nokia.  But it was not there!  The legendary brand is back with new phones and smartphones.  And now the company will focus on devices running on the Android mobile operating system.  I must say that in the past phones on the Android from Nokia took place, but there were very few of them.  And now there will be many of them.  Consider the most interesting models of the past and look at the new flagship under the control of the "green robot". </p><h2>  <span>Nokia X2.</span>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  This is a pretty old smartphone, which the company released as an experiment.  I must say that there have been several such experiments in the history of the old Nokia.  What is interesting about the flagship Nokia X2?  First of all, it has compact dimensions (especially in comparison with modern "shovels").  The screen size of this smartphone is only 4.3 inches. </p>

    <p>  Nothing at all compared to modern diagonals.  The device runs on the Android operating system version 4.4 from Google.  On board the gadget is a dual-core processor from Qualcomm with a clock frequency of 1.4 gigahertz.  The RAM of the device is equal to a gigabyte.  There is no need to say that this "old man" will not pull normal games.  But he was not designed for this in his best years.  And at that time there were almost no particularly demanding games.  Therefore, this unit was positioned as a device for work and some innocent entertainment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Opportunities </h2><p>  The amount of memory available to the user is 4 gigabytes.  Compared to modern drives, this is a pretty ridiculous figure.  However, <span>Nokia X2</span> supports micro SD cards up to 32 gigabytes.  Good help.  It is better to remain silent about the support of modern communication standards.  You cannot use LTE in this smartphone.  Only 3G.  But implemented full support for two SIM cards.  And no hybrid slots.  They were able to do it before!  As for the camera, there is a 5-megapixel module with four-time digital zoom. </p>

    <p>  There are no delights like manual tuning.  But there is autofocus, flash and the ability to record video in HD at a speed of 30 frames per second.  That's just quality limping on both legs.  But let's not forget that this is an "ancient" apparatus.  Now a little about the battery.  It uses a removable Li-Pol battery with a capacity of 1800 mAh.  I must say that for a smartphone of this level this is quite normal.  The device can "live" 6 hours when playing video at maximum screen brightness and 13 hours in talk mode.  And if you do not touch the smartphone at all, then it will live 23 days on a single charge.  Pretty good result. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Positive feedback on the X2 </h2><p>  Nokia phones based on the Android X2 series have always enjoyed some popularity.  Users were interested in the fact of the presence of a "green robot" in devices from a cult company.  Naturally, the owners left reviews.  And in the case of X2, the situation is ambiguous.  Some owners praise the smartphone for a rather interesting appearance and good speed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new nokia phones on android" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2069438.jpg"></div>  I also like the fact that the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù in ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù works almost perfectly, which does not happen in gadgets from ‚ÄúHuawei‚Äù and others like them.  However, the autonomy of the smartphone was especially praised by the owners.  At that time, <span>"Nokia X2"</span> was almost the most "tenacious" device.  And it could not but please the users.

    <h2>  Negative X2 Reviews </h2><p>  At the same time, individual owners noted no quality materials.  Indeed, very cheap plastic was used as the main material for the case.  And the assembly was not at the highest level: creaks, crunches, crevices and so on.  You expect something better from the Nokia brand.  Also, users categorically did not like the smartphone‚Äôs camera.  She could not adequately cope with the shooting, even in normal lighting.  Not to mention the dark time of day.  The reviews about the Nokia phone on the Android X2 series indicate that the company turned out to be a rather controversial device.  The Finnish giant definitely has room to develop.  One can only hope that the company will heed constructive criticism. </p><h2>  Nokia 6 </h2><p>  This exhibit is the new Nokia phone on Android.  It appeared after the legendary brand announced its return.  No doubt, the gadget turned out to be much more interesting than X2.  However, not everything is going smoothly with him either.  The "six" looks worthy: solid materials of the case, high-quality assembly.  But inside, a morally obsolete processor is installed, which was used by the Chinese in Xiaomi a year ago - Snapdragon 430. </p>

    <p>  At the same time, as many as 4 gigabytes of RAM were installed in the gadget.  What for?  All the same, this processor will not let the RAM open up completely.  The novelty is running the Android operating system version 7. The most interesting is that the manufacturer decided to abandon the proprietary shell, but in vain.  That would be more interesting.  It is not known that the engineers of the company with the OS have made up their minds, but running Android on Nokia is somehow strange: sometimes it thinks (with 4 gigabytes of RAM), sometimes it completely ignores the actions of the owner. </p><h2>  Features Nokia 6 </h2><p>  As for the camera, a 16-megapixel photomodule of medium speed with autofocus and flash is installed here.  It does not shine with outstanding characteristics and shoots as a camera of a device of the middle price segment would shoot.  It does not reach the flagship level.  Nevertheless, the photos are decent.  Especially during daylight hours.  The amount of internal memory is 64 gigabytes.  However, there is support for memory cards. </p>

    <p>  The new product uses a 5.5-inch IPS screen.  Screen Resolution - Full HD.  The colors are vibrant and juicy.  Fingerprint scanner a little upset.  In order to recognize the print, he needs as much as five seconds.  This is a lot.  But after updating the firmware everything worked as it should.  It was probably a software bug.  The device is equipped with a 3000 mAh battery.  But, given the technical characteristics, we can safely say that this gadget will live only one day in normal use.  These are the phones on the "Android" from the "Nokia" of our days. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about Nokia 6 </h2><p>  What do people say about the new flagship of the revived Nokia?  Opinions differ, since the apparatus itself is ambiguous.  Most of the old Nokia fans, of course, are pleased that the manufacturer has returned.  But only his return could be made better.  Nevertheless, the owners are delighted with the performance of the smartphone, its appearance also causes delight. </p>

    <p>  And the camera is pretty good, if not to find fault.  One thing is not clear: how to upgrade the Nokia phone to Android?  So the relevant requests are flying to Google, because these devices have their own "troubles."  Many owners of this smartphone indicate that the gadget has been working for more than one day, as stated.  The battery charge may well last for two days of active use.  Well, if this is true, then the smartphone is not as bad as it seems.  But these are all reviews from enthusiastic fans of Nokia.  And if you listen to those who belong to this brand without reverence? </p><h2>  Negative reviews about the "six" </h2><p>  Comments that are credible tell us that the new device from the legendary brand is not worth a damn.  Very poor optimization of the operating system and hardware, an outdated processor, no camera, unreasonably huge amount of RAM, an insufficiently capacious battery, a very slow fingerprint scanner, very quiet speaker sound and a disgusting front camera. </p>

    <p>  These are the reviews of those people who did not like the new Nokia phone on the Android touchscreen.  And they can be understood, since you expect something upscale from a brand with that name.  And this smartphone resembles the creation of early Chinese designers.  However, everything falls into place if you recall that Nokia was bought from Microsoft by an unknown Chinese company. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, the phones on Android from Nokia are clearly worthy of attention.  Especially old models.  They look quite unusual compared to modern devices.  But the new ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù still needs a lot of work to do in order to regain its former glory. </p>
