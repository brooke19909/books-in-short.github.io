Master class and useful recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is always pleasant to make gifts, but it is doubly pleasant to do it in an original and unusual way.  And in this whole process there is no more exciting moment than that when the present needs to be unpacked.  Of course, you can simply put the gift into a box wrapped in colorful paper, or make a bright bundle decorated with elegant bows and ribbon, but we offer a wonderful alternative to this gray routine - a cardboard packing cake.  It‚Äôs not difficult to make such a product with your own hands.  With the help of several sheets of thick paper for crafts and elementary tools, which most likely are in the drawer of the writing desk for each of us, you can arrange a gift in a stylish and non-standard way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thespruce.com" data-author=": Studio DIY, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper ice cream cake" class="if uuid-2237058" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2237058.jpg"></div><h2>  Inedible Yummy </h2><p>  In our time, handmade gifts have become especially popular.  A cardboard cake (the whole or only its ‚Äúslice‚Äù) is an excellent opportunity to present a hand-made product beautifully.  But our master class will also be useful for those who are used to presenting things bought in stores. </p><p>  A large present will not fit in a cake box, but you don‚Äôt have to take your loved one with a large gift, you can win it in quantity by putting different cute and useful little things in each piece of your cake. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It can be jewelry, sweets, miniature toys, flowers, gadgets or accessories for them.  And the subject matter for such packaging can be very different.  By choosing the right colors and decor, you can make a cardboard cake with your own hands for any occasion: birthday, newborn party, Valentine's Day, March 8, New Year.  Another interesting feature of this particular design of the gift is the ability to do a few things at once.  This is a great idea for congratulating children at school or kindergarten, at a matinee or at any other celebration where kids are expected to stay, but there is not a large budget for presentations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ohhappyday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cardboard cake" class="if uuid-2237057" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2237057.jpg"></div><h2>  Easy peasy </h2><p>  To begin with, we will offer readers a version of the craft in the form of a whole cake, not divided into segments.  This is a good packaging for a small gift.  Making such a <span>cardboard</span> cake <span>with your own hands</span> is easy.  It is necessary to form a cylinder of plain paper of the appropriate color, following our detailed photo instructions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ohhappyday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY paper cake" class="if uuid-2237055" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2237055.jpg"></div><p>  After assembling the base of the cake, you can proceed to its design.  In our version, the ‚Äúcream‚Äù made of corrugated paper and candles made of plastic tubes serves as decor, but you can use what you like - glitter, sequins, blanks made of foamiran, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ohhappyday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Master class: cake" class="if uuid-2237056" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2237056.jpg"></div><h2>  Portion gift </h2><p>  Now let's talk about how to make a cake out of cardboard, divided into pieces.  In order for the box to be neat and have the correct shape, you need to print it on a printer or redraw the template we proposed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="scarlettscrapper.blogspot.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cardboard cake" class="if uuid-2237054" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2237054.jpg"></div><p>  The above scheme will allow the formation of a continuous package consisting of one part.  The lines indicated by the dotted line are the places of folds that need to be properly smoothed using a special scoring tool.  There is nothing to worry about, if you don‚Äôt have such a device, you can make an analog from an improvised means - a ballpoint pen.  From it you need to remove the core and put a sewing pin with a bead tip in its place.  Such a device should "walk" along all the bends and, having done along the lines of the grooves, form a box.  Then you need to apply glue to the marked elements and completely assemble the product.  The subsequent decor is a matter of taste and personal preference. </p><h2>  Option number 2 </h2><p>  In this case, we propose to make a box consisting of a base and a lid.  The scheme for forming the bottom and top of the product looks like the one shown in the figure below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cake box pattern" class="if uuid-2237052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39466/2237052.jpg"></div><p>  A piece with a curly edge is a cover that does not have to be made so tender and romantic.  If you have to give a gift to a man or just want to make a product with strict and elegant lines, the wavy edge is enough to equalize. </p><p>  One paper cake consists of approximately 12 such slices.  To make the craft look as advantageous and realistic as possible, all segments must be made in the same style.  You can visually tie them together by decorating the middle of the composition with a lush flower or bow, and a narrow ribbon will perfectly complement the cake around the circumference. </p>
