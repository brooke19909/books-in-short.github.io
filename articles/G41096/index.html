    <h2>  Most popular booking option </h2><p>  There are several room categories at Golden Coast Resort and Spa.  But I would like to start with the most popular and, accordingly, cheap.  This is a superior 2-bed apartment with one wide bed.  These rooms offer beautiful views of the green garden.  42 sq. M.  m of living space, a spacious bathroom, free Wi-Fi, pleasant atmosphere, breakfast - all this can get guests for 14 days for only 55-68 thousand rubles for two.  Admittedly, the price is pretty low!  True, the cost may vary - it depends on how well, as they say, ‚Äúthe season is on‚Äù and whether the hotel administration offers special offers or discounts. </p><h2>  Facilities and conditions </h2><p>  The 2-bed superior apartments offered by Golden Coast Resort and Spa have a very good environment.  In this really nice to be.  The rooms are decorated in an interesting Vietnamese style and have nice wooden furniture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is a balcony with a view, a radio and a telephone, a flat-screen TV with cable and satellite TV.  Important amenities include air conditioning, a safe, a spacious work desk and a personal seating area.  What can we say about such generally accepted devices and objects that make life easier, such as a fan, hairdryer, wardrobe and more.  But that is not all.  The apartments of this category, offered by Golden Coast Resort and Spa, even have a refrigerator, a minibar and a dining area, an electric kettle, as well as cleaning products and hygiene products.  A sofa, bidet, shower, the ability to request an adjoining room - all this is also available for guests.  And of course, all of them are provided with bathrobes, linen, towels and slippers.  In general, the apartments have everything that can only come in handy.  It is not surprising why many people go to the Von Golden Coast Resort <span>Hotel Spa 5 *.</span>  This is the highest rating tourists give to hotel rooms. </p>
