    <h2>  Historical information </h2><p>  The Soviet army has already liberated almost the entire territory of Slovakia.  The Nazis were expelled from the capital of Bratislava, the large industrial centers of Brno and Moravsk-Ostrava.  The Wehrmacht group was defeated, Berlin fell.  All this led to the collapse of the German war machine.  The fascist troops operating on the Italian and western fronts ceased resistance.  German soldiers began to surrender.  It was the spring of 1945.  The liberation of Czechoslovakia was the next step towards a universal goal - to destroy fascism.  <span>German troops</span> were still on its territory and continued stubborn defense. </p><h2>  The liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945: the position of the Germans </h2><p>  In early May, on the lines of the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 2nd Ukrainian fronts at the border of Sternberk, Krnov, Strigau, Kamenz, Wurzen, to the west of Stockerau, Glognits, Brno, troops were defended by the Center group.  They were commanded by Field Marshal Sherner.  Together with them, resistance was rendered by part of the troops from the Austria group.  They were led by General Rendulich.  In total, defense was held by 65 divisions, fifteen separate regiments and 3 brigades.  The main enemy forces were in front of the left flank and the center of the 1st Ukrainian Front.  They acted on the basis of a powerful defense prepared in advance.  In front of the right flank, the enemy‚Äôs resistance was weaker, the line of contact of the armies was unstable.  On the directions of the second and fourth Ukrainian fronts, there were enemy field-type fortifications formed in tactical depths.  Using powerful prepared positions, the Nazis continued stubborn resistance.  In some areas, German forces even launched a counterattack. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/840536.jpg" width="500"></div>

Not wanting to under any circumstances recognize the hopelessness of the situation, the monopoly circles and the ruling elite continued to follow the previously outlined political course.  The German leadership tried to conclude a separate deal with Great Britain and the USA.  Thus, it was supposed to separate the allies, gaining time to preserve their state.  The Denitsky government intended to delay the advance of the Soviet army into Western territories.  Due to this, an unobstructed passage to the west would open, followed by the liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945 by the Americans and the British.  In addition, the troops of the United States and Great Britain could occupy most of the territory of Austria and Germany.  In this regard, an order was issued to the fascist armed forces.  It said that due to the fact that the struggle against Western countries has become meaningless, it is necessary to lay down arms in Holland, Denmark and North-West Germany.  Along with this, the struggle on the eastern fronts was ordered to continue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945 photo" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/840537.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Fascist leadership meeting </h2><p>  In Moravia and the Czech Republic, a <span>national liberation movement was</span> growing <span>.</span>  Which significantly complicated the situation of the fascist army in these territories.  The liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945.  accompanied by an active partisan struggle of the local population.  So, by the beginning of March there were 20 national liberation associations, detachments and brigades in the country.  They involved more than 7700 volunteers.  The fascist leadership has repeatedly discussed the situation in Czechoslovakia.  On May 3, a regular meeting was convened.  In addition to members of the Doenick government, it was attended by Jodl, Keitel, Frank (governor of Moravia and the Czech Republic), as well as the chief of staff of the Army Center "National" Nazmer.  The position of the troops was hopeless.  However, contrary to common sense, the fascist leadership considered that the surrender of troops on the eastern front is impossible.  At the meeting, discussing the difficult situation of Scherner‚Äôs army, agreeing that the situation was forcing him to lay down his arms, nevertheless decided to continue the resistance.  The German leadership understood that if the troops surrendered, then all the <span>forces of Germany</span> would be in Russian power.  In this regard, the earlier decision to take a wait-and-see attitude was confirmed at the meeting.  Along with this, it was supposed to begin preparations for Army Group Center to move west and surrender to US troops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945 briefly" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/840538.jpg" width="500"></div>

The liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945 began even before the defeat of the enemy group in Berlin was completed.  The headquarters of the High Command decided to start the <span>Prague operation.</span>  May 1-2 in some cities of Czechoslovakia spontaneous protests against the Nazis took place.  Gradually, they began to take on a more organized form.  The liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945 was facilitated by the highly advantageous position of the Soviet troops.  The enemy group operating on the territory of the country was surrounded from the southeast, east and north.  The armies of the 1st, 2nd and 4th Ukrainian fronts acted here.  The troops of the First were on the 650-kilometer line between Krnov and Potsdam. </p><h2>  Right flank and center </h2><p>  They began regrouping and preparing for the offensive in Prague.  The forces included the forces of the second <span>army of the Polish Army, the</span> 3rd and 4th tank, 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th Guards, 7th mechanized corps, as well as the 52th, 28th, 13th armies.  At the same time, the forces of the left flank held the defense on the border north of Krnov, west of Levenberg.  The Sixth Army continued to block the garrison of the Breslau fortress.  Ground forces supported the Second Air Army.  It was commanded by Krasovsky.  The main aviation forces also retargeted the liberation of Czechoslovakia.  In 1945, operating between Krnov and Vsetin in a strip of 220 kilometers, the 4th Ukrainian Front, consisting of the 31st Panzer Corps, the 1st, 38th, 60th Guards Regiment and the 18th Army, completed the Moravian-Ostrava operation.  On this line, the 8th Air Army provided support to ground forces.  It included the 1st mixed Czechoslovak aviation division. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945 [" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/840539.jpg" width="500"></div>  Since March 26, the front troops were under the command of Eremenko.  In a strip 350 km wide, from Vsetin to Korneiburg, the liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945 was carried out by the army of the 2nd Ukrainian Front.  In the right wing were the 6th, 53rd, 40th Guards Tank, 1st and 4th Romanian armies under the command of Atanassiu and Descalescu.  The army advanced towards Olomouc, towards the army of the 4th Ukrainian Front.  The remaining forces (the 1st horse-mechanized guards group of Pliev, the 46th army and the 7th guards) were sent to the defense.  In the reserve of the front was the 23rd <span>tank corps.</span>  From the air, the ground troops, which carried out the liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945 on the right flank, were supported by the 5th Air Army. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spring 1945 liberation of Czechoslovakia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/840540.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Operation completion </h2><p>  The liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945 was carried out on a 1220-kilometer strip.  By early May, three Ukrainian fronts participated in the operation, consisting of 20 combined arms (including the Romanian and two Polish), 3 air and 3 tank armies, 5 tank, cavalry and mechanized corps, as well as a horse-mechanized group.  The number of Soviet soldiers more than doubled the Nazi soldiers.  The number of tanks was approximately the same.  The decisive preponderance of the domestic army was in aviation and artillery.  Here our superiority was threefold.  Due to the favorable general military-political situation, thanks to the advantageous positions on the front line, Soviet troops quickly liberated Czechoslovakia in 1945. </p>
