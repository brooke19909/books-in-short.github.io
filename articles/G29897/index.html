    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  <span>The first mention of the doll in the usual way for us is found in Egyptian manuscripts in the 20th century BC.</span>  <span>e.</span>  <span>They were carved from wood and decorated with paintings.</span>  <span>Instead of hair there were threads decorated with wooden beads.</span>  <span>Ancient Greece further developed the cult of making toys.</span>  <span>And it was at this time that the dolls began to be intended for girls.</span>  <span>They played with them until marriage, and then presented to the gods as a sign that they had already grown.</span> </p><h2>  Doll in Russia </h2><p>  <span>Here, a folk toy with their own hands was made from time immemorial.</span>  <span>Moreover, initially dolls were made without a face.</span>  <span>It was believed that in this way you revive the figure, and what it will be, good or evil, it is impossible to predict.</span>  <span>Only later did folk sages begin to make dolls with different facial expressions.</span>  <span>But they were not intended for the game, they were amulets.</span>  <span>Do-it-yourself folk toy is made from a variety of materials.</span>  <span>Today we will consider manufacturing from different materials so that each of you can make a little joy for your baby, or with it.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="clay toys" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1566946.jpg" width="548"></div>
