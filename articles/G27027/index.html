  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is a communicative competency for a leader</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Competency refers to the skills and knowledge of a person.  Competence is a sphere of authority and rights within which the individual must know and be able to do what is required.  Thus, the second concept includes the first. </p><p>  Based on the activities of the Russian leader, we can distinguish several types of his activity.  These include, in particular, work with papers and information, reading and writing emails, negotiations, meetings, trips, telephone conversations, thoughts, small discussions, conversations with employees, unplanned meetings. </p><p>  Having assessed the picture of activity as a whole, it can be noted that the main element of the leader‚Äôs activity is communication, both written and oral.  This is what determines the formation of such a concept as <span>communicative competence.</span>  The definition of the effective activities of a modern leader (manager) is incomplete without this component.  Moreover, setting goals, motivating, delegating, presenting and receiving information, as well as control are provided with skills in constructive communication and effective business interaction. </p><p>  Communicative competence is a concept that includes the necessary skills, knowledge, skills for conducting business negotiations, correspondence, performing representative functions, communicating with subordinates, peers, and higher authorities, resolving conflicts that have arisen.  This takes into account the fact that, in addition to simple communication, interaction should be present. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be noted that the focus of communication is more inclined towards the formation of relations, atmosphere, and informal influence.  While the interaction, in addition to the above factors, involves a certain activity. </p><p>  The use of these forms (communication and interaction) should ideally be as intended and in optimal proportions.  Otherwise, the creation of a favorable environment can easily go into <span>hazing</span> with individual employees or with the team as a whole.  There is another extreme.  In this case, in the organization all employees are only functional units, communication is excluded in it, colleagues do not know anything about each other.  In this case, the head receives only the information that relates to the activities of subordinates directly and is necessary to obtain a result. </p><p>  Considering the concept more broadly, it should be noted that <span>communicative competence</span> is the ability to understand strangers and form their programs in speech behavior.  At the same time, these attitudes must correspond to the situation, sphere, purpose of communication.  Communicative competence, therefore, includes knowledge of the basic concepts of linguistic speech.  These include, in particular, options for linking sentences, reasoning, storytelling, description building, types, <span>styles of speech.</span>  Here you can add skills and abilities to analyze the text. </p><p>  It should be noted that these skills in most cases do not provide an appropriate communication situation.  Communicative competence also includes such an important concept as, in fact, the very ability to choose a suitable linguistic form, an adequate wording, depending on the existing conditions of linguistic activity. </p><p>  Communicative abilities are present to one degree or another in all people.  At the same time, primary skills are formed to varying degrees in childhood.  The implementation of activities (leading, for example) requires not only a clear understanding of what communicative competence is, but also its development.  In particular, a number of authors pay particular attention to the free possession of the entire complex of their skills and knowledge used to implement effective non-verbal and <span>verbal communication.</span> </p>
