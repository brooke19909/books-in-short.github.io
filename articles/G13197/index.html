The main gift to residents was the hotel "St. George".  Yaroslavl received as a gift for its 1000th anniversary the best hotel built with money from the Moscow government. </p><h2>  General information about the hotel </h2><p>  One of the oldest cities in Russia is considered to be Yaroslavl.  Hotel "St. George" nevertheless does not stand out from the general flavor of the ancient Russian settlement.  The exterior facade of the building is made in a simple classical style.  Rectangular contours are diluted with arches, balconies and flower pots located around the perimeter of the hotel "St. George" (Yaroslavl).  Photos are a confirmation of this. </p><p>  A poster flaunts the main entrance - a sign that the construction of the hotel was financed from the budget of Moscow as a gift to the residents of Yaroslavl.  But the true decoration of the facade is the image <span>of St. George the Victorious.</span> </p>
