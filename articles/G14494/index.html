The greatest empires of the world</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The word "empire" has recently been heard by everyone; it has even become fashionable.  On it lies a reflection of past greatness and luxury.  What is an empire? </p><h2>  Is it promising? </h2><p>  Dictionaries and encyclopedias offer the main meaning of the word "empire" (from the Latin word "imperium" - power), the meaning of which, if you do not go into boring details and do not resort to dry scientific vocabulary, is as follows.  First, an empire is a monarchy headed by an emperor or empress (Roman <span>Empire, Russian Empire).</span>  However, in order for the state to become an empire, it is not enough for its ruler to simply call himself emperor.  The existence of an empire implies the existence of sufficiently vast controlled territories and peoples, a strong centralized power (authoritarian or totalitarian).  And if tomorrow Prince Hans-Adam II calls himself emperor, this will not change the essence of the state system of <span>Liechtenstein (</span> whose <span>population</span> is less than forty thousand people), and it will not be possible to say that this small principality is an empire (as a form of state). </p><h2>  Not less important </h2><p>  Secondly, empires are often called countries that have impressive colonial possessions.  In this case, the presence of an emperor is not necessary.  For example, the English kings were never called emperors, but for almost five centuries led the British Empire, which included not only Great Britain, but also a large number of colonies and dominions.  The great empires of the world forever imprinted their names in the tablets of history, but what did they end with? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Empire is" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/415685.jpg" width="450"></div>

Realizing the need for serious reforms, Caesar passed laws that changed the political system of Ancient Rome.  The role of the National Assembly was lost, Caesar's supporters were replenished by the Senate, which granted Caesar the title of emperor with the right to transfer it to descendants.  Caesar began to mint gold coins with his own image.  His desire for unlimited power led to a conspiracy of senators (44 BC), organized by Mark Brutus and Guy Cassius.  In fact, the first emperor was Caesar's nephew - Octavian Augustus (63 B.C. - 14 A.D.).  The title of emperor in those days meant the supreme commander who won significant victories.  Formally, the <span>Roman Republic</span> still existed, and Augustus himself was called the Princeps ("the first among equals"), but it was under Octavian that the republic acquired the features of a monarchy similar to the eastern despotic states.  In 284, the Emperor Diocletian (245 - 313 gg.) Initiated reforms that finally turned the former Roman Republic into an empire.  Since then, the emperor began to be called the dominus - the lord.  In 395, the state was divided into two parts - Eastern (capital - Constantinople) and Western (capital - Rome) - each of which was headed by its own emperor.  Such was the will of Emperor Theodosius, who, on the eve of his death, divided the state between his sons.  In the last period of its existence, the Western empire was subjected to constant invasions by barbarians, and in 476, the once powerful state would be finally defeated by the commander-barbarian Odoacre (about 431 - 496), who would rule only Italy, renouncing the title of emperor and others possessions of the Roman Empire.  After the fall of Rome, great empires will arise one after another. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meaning of the word empire" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/415687.jpg" width="600"></div>

When Odoacer overthrew the last <span>Roman emperor,</span> he robbed him of the dignity of power and sent them to Constantinople.  There is only one Sun on earth, and the emperor should also be one - roughly the same significance was attached to this act.  <span>The Byzantine Empire was</span> located at the junction of Europe, Asia and Africa, its borders extended from the Euphrates to the Danube.  A major role in the consolidation of Byzantium was played by Christianity, which in 381 became the state religion of the entire Roman Empire.  The Church Fathers argued that faith saved not only man, but society itself.  Therefore, Byzantium is under the protection of the Lord and is obliged to lead other nations to salvation.  Secular and spiritual power should be united in the name of a single goal.  The Byzantine Empire is a state in which the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãimperial power has acquired its most mature form.  God is the lord of the entire Universe, and the emperor dominates the earthly kingdom.  Therefore, the power of the emperor is kept by God and is sacred.  The Byzantine emperor possessed almost unlimited power, he determined domestic and foreign policy, was commander in chief of the army, supreme judge and at the same time legislator.  The emperor of Byzantium is not only the head of state, but also the head of the Church, so he should have set an example of exemplary Christian piety.  It is curious that the emperor‚Äôs power here was not hereditary from a legal point of view.  The history of Byzantium knows examples when a man became its emperor not because of a crowned birth, but according to the results of his real merits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="empire as a form of state" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/415690.jpg" width="415"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ottoman (Ottoman) Empire (1299 - 1922) </h2><p>  Typically, historians have counted its existence since 1299, when the Ottoman state arose in the north-west of Anatolia, founded by its first sultan, Ottoman, the founder of the new dynasty.  Soon Osman will conquer the whole west of Asia Minor, which will become a powerful platform for the further expansion of the Turkic tribes.  We can say that the Ottoman Empire is Turkey of the period of sultanism.  But strictly speaking, an empire formed here only in the 15th-16th centuries, when the Turkish conquests in Europe, Asia and Africa became very significant.  Its heyday coincided with the collapse of the Byzantine Empire.  This, of course, is not accidental: if it diminishes somewhere, then it will certainly increase in another place, as the law of conservation of energy and power on the Eurasian continent says.  In the spring of <span>1453,</span> as a result of a long siege and bloody battles, the Ottoman Turks, led by Sultan Mehmed II, occupied the capital of Byzantium, Constantinople.  This victory will lead to the fact that the Turks will secure a dominant position in the eastern Mediterranean for many years.  The capital of the Ottoman Empire will be Constantinople (Istanbul).  The Ottoman Empire reached its highest point of influence and prosperity in the 16th century - during the reign of Suleiman I the Magnificent.  By the beginning of the XVII century, the Ottoman state would become one of the most powerful in the world.  The empire controlled almost the whole of Southeast Europe, North Africa and West Asia, it consisted of 32 provinces and many subordinate states.  The collapse of the Ottoman Empire will occur as a result of the First World War.  As allies of Germany, the Turks will be defeated, in 1922 the sultanate will be abolished, and in 1923 Turkey will become a republic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="imperialist war" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/415688.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  British Empire (1497 - 1949) </h2><p>  The British Empire is the largest colonial state in the entire history of civilization.  In the 30s of the twentieth century, the territory of the United Kingdom accounted for almost a quarter of the earth's land, and its population - one fourth of those living on the planet (it is not by chance that English has become the most authoritative language in the world).  The European conquests of England began with the invasion of Ireland, while the intercontinental conquests began with the capture of Newfoundland (1583), which became a springboard for expansion in North America.  The success of British colonization was facilitated by the successful imperialist war that England waged with Spain, France, and Holland.  At the very beginning of the XVII century, the penetration of Britain into India will begin, later England will take on Australia and New Zealand, North, Tropical and South Africa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia empire" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/415686.jpg" width="470"></div>

    <h2>  Britain and the colonies </h2><p>  After the First World War, the League of Nations will entrust the United Kingdom with a mandate to govern some of the former colonies of the Ottoman and <span>German empires</span> (including Iran and Palestine).  However, the results of World War II significantly shifted the emphasis on the colonial issue.  Britain, although it was among the winners, was forced to take a huge loan from the United States in order to avoid bankruptcy.  The USSR and the USA - the largest players in the political arena - were opposed to colonization.  And in the colonies, meanwhile, liberation sentiments intensified.  In this situation, it was too difficult and expensive to maintain their colonial rule.  Unlike Portugal and France, England did not do this and transferred power to local governments.  To date, the UK continues to maintain dominance over 14 territories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="great empires" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/415689.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Russian Empire (1721 - 1917) </h2><p>  After the end of the Northern War, when new lands were secured for the <span>Moscow state</span> and access to the Baltic, Tsar Peter I took the title of All-Russian Emperor at the request of the Senate - the highest state authority established ten years earlier.  By its area, the Russian Empire became the third (after the British and Mongolian empires) of the ever existing state entities.  Before the appearance of the State Duma in 1905, the power of the Russian emperor was not limited to anything other than Orthodox norms.  Peter I, who strengthened the <span>vertical of power</span> in the country, divided Russia into eight provinces.  At the time of Catherine II, there were 50 of them, and by 1917, as a result of territorial expansion, their number increased to 78. Russia is an empire, which included a number of modern sovereign states (Finland, Belarus, Ukraine, the <span>Baltic countries,</span> Transcaucasia and the Middle Caucasus Asia).  As a result of the February Revolution of 1917, the rule of the dynasty of Russian emperors Romanovs ceased, and in September of the same year, Russia was proclaimed a republic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="great empires of the world" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14907/415691.jpg" width="600"></div>
