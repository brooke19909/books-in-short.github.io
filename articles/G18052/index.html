This was done by an Austrian scientist working in the corresponding department at a technical institute. </p><p>  In the center of such a settlement as Graz is the Old Town, which in 1999 was declared a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage.  Therefore, its significance has greatly increased.  And in 2003, the city received the unofficial title of the cultural capital of Europe.  And in connection with this event, a museum of modern art was opened in Graz.  He quickly became one of the main attractions of the city.  Moreover, in Graz, the festival of contemporary art is held annually in early September.  It was first held in 1968. </p><p>  Graz gained world fame as a city in which the famous Hollywood actor and governor Arnold Schwarzenegger began his sports career. </p><h2>  Arsenal </h2><p>  Another attraction is the Arsenal Museum.  There is a collection of weapons that stores the military history that was performed by ancestors in the city of Graz.  What does it mean for the country?  This is truly a real pride, because almost all exhibits are real weapons of people.  And thanks to this arsenal, in which weapons were stored for 16 thousand military personnel, there was no conquest of Central Europe. </p><p>  Later, the empress abolished all military institutions in Austria, except Graz, since the locals were against it.  They hoped that it would become a local attraction, being a historical and cultural monument. </p>
