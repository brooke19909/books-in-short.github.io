Graphology is a science in the field of view of which is the connection between a person‚Äôs handwriting and personality traits.  For all its specificity, using the basics of graphology is becoming more and more common.  Interest in graphology has affected us.  Let us examine what kind of science it is that can tell the secrets of a person only by his handwriting or short list. </p><h2>  From ancient times </h2>

    <p>  The ancient Roman writer Suetonius contributed to the history of the birth of graphology by characterizing the handwriting of Emperor Augustus, his contemporary. </p><h2>  The rise of modern graphology </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 17th century, the first book on graphology was published in Italy.  Its author was Professor Camillo Balde.  Unfortunately, that work did not become popular. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

At that time, Pastor Lafater, the author of physiognomic studies, gave the name "graphic portraits" to the signs of the letter, by which certain aspects of character are determined.

    <p>  The year 1872 is significant for modern graphology: then the book ‚ÄúThe System of Graphology‚Äù by Abbot Jean-Hippolytus Michon appeared.  He is considered the founder of graphology as a science.  He first applied the term "graphology", the meaning of which suggests that it has Greek roots ("I write" + "science"). </p><p>  Abbot Michon did for graphology at that time more than all other researchers: he systematized knowledge, popularized a new science. </p><p>  It was easy to put into practice the principles formulated by Michonne, since the object of study was separate rather simple details: slopes, strokes, lines, etc.  Today, such principles would seem too simplistic and inaccurate, but some of them are still considered correct to this day. </p><h2>  The relationship of handwriting and character </h2><p>  Graphology is closely related to psychological research.  And naturally, there have been attempts, through psychology and psychiatry, to verify the reliability of the data that can be learned from a person‚Äôs handwriting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

This was confirmed in the last century by the data of then developing psychiatry and psychology.  This brought special status to the <span>science of handwriting.</span>  Since then, in the USA, for example, graphology is a legitimate method of selecting people for work.

    <h2>  What you can learn with graphology </h2><p>  <span>Handwriting analysis</span> will help to find out a person‚Äôs mental abilities, his self-esteem, willpower and many other aspects of personality.  In fact, the application of graphological analysis is very close to a complete psycho-diagnosis of a person. </p><p>  From the handwriting you can extract the information that is only in the human subconscious.  Thus, graphology is a powerful tool for self-knowledge. </p><p>  If a little generalized, then using handwriting you can find out the <span>personal qualities of a person,</span> both inborn and acquired, the difficulties present in his life at the time of writing the sample, the state of health.  The latter is very closely related to the handwriting: it is proved that the slightest change in well-being and health is reflected in the writing. </p><p>  However, the study of handwriting will not provide comprehensive information about human life.  So, in many cases it is impossible to say who he works with, whether he has love affairs, children, whether he loves cats or dogs. </p><h2>  Handwriting </h2><p>  In the study of handwriting, attention is paid to the various characteristics of the notes.  So, the main criteria by which a handwriting pattern is characterized is the size of the letters, pressure, line thickness, letters between the letters, the presence or absence of fields, the distance between words, the roundness or angularity of the letters, the direction of the lines. </p>

First of all, this is the letter "p", which gives information about the aggressiveness of the person who wrote it.  The character of the trait in the letter (its length, slope) is estimated.

    <p>  Upon receipt of a sample for analysis, it is important that the person writes on an unstripped sheet.  This is necessary in order to manifest all the features of his handwriting, in particular the direction of the lines. </p><h2>  Exploring Signatures </h2><p>  In addition to samples of written texts, in the field of studying such a science as graphology is a character by signature.  It turns out that even in such a short inscription important information can be covered. </p>

Experts evaluate the signature according to many other criteria if the information already received is not enough.

    <h2>  Graphology application today </h2><p>  Nowadays, experts from various industries, including working with people, have discovered that graphology is an excellent tool, an assistant in the selection of people with the qualities necessary for work.  Therefore, many companies select employees by resorting to graphological analysis.  This method is also used to select reliable people in human rights bodies. </p><p>  Germany was distinguished by the fact that visits of the bride and groom to the graphologist are becoming popular there, so that he helps to determine whether they are suitable for living together. </p><p>  Space medicine has also taken graphology into service.  Specialists analyze the records of astronauts in order to learn about changes in the handwriting about the state of the central nervous system of people in space. </p><p>  Medicine uses graphological analysis to identify certain diseases whose symptoms appear in handwriting. </p><p>  The fact of applying graphological expertise in forensics is widely known. </p><p>  Not so long ago there was a direction in graphology, studying handwriting samples obtained from a person under hypnosis.  Interesting information was obtained that, if the test subject was told that he was 6 years old, his handwriting became what he was at that age. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="basics of graphology" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19591/523929.jpg" width="435"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  In the article, we presented some data on what kind of an interesting modern science is graphology, the examples of its use in different fields of knowledge are striking.  We found out that with its help one can learn about such human qualities that could never have been revealed in any other way. </p><p>  The basics of graphology are very likely to help you find out if a left-handed person is a right-handed person, emotional or restrained, callous or kind.  However, it is impossible to determine by handwriting whether a person was married, whether he has domestic animals, or similar facts. </p><p>  The value of the signature in graphology is an important aspect that makes up a separate section of science, no less interesting than the rest. </p><p>  We also indicated that it is not necessary to rely on the data of graphological analysis as an unquestioning truth, because they never give a 100% correct result.  Rather, graphology in communication with people should be used in order to verify something or clarify some character traits. </p>
