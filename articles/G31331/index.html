From here came many world famous figures of public, culture and science.  Bezhetsk, the sights of this confirmation, is proud of its history and bears the achievements of its ancestors with special dignity. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="57.77810659969102" data-lng="36.690618900000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/0/2/5/5025.png"></div><h2>  Refugees from Novgorod </h2><p>  It is believed that they founded the Bezhichi settlement, which eventually became the city of Bezhetsky.  Its geographical location is very good: the city is located on the right bank <span>of the Mologa River</span> at the confluence of the Ostrichina River. </p><p>  At the beginning of last year, the city had 22,000 indigenous people. </p><p>  Bezhetsk‚Äôs story is quite long.  The first time it was mentioned in the annals in 1127, but he received the city status only in 1775. </p><p>  The city is the small homeland of famous Russian artists A. Samokhvalov and P. Chistyakov, the founder of the first Russian folk instrument orchestra - V. Andreev, writer V. Shishkov and many others who glorified Russia. </p><p>  Bezhetsk's modern attractions, see photo below, attract a large number of guests to the city.  The Raspberry Museum and the Monument to the original Russian instrument - the balalaika, opened in 2010, are especially popular.  What else is interesting here for curious tourists? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Merchant Mansions </h2><p>  The house of the merchant family of the Andreevs is a beautiful log two-story building with a brick basement.  The house has architectural value and historical significance.  The owner of the mansion was a <span>merchant of the first guild</span> and the main trustee of the city hospital. </p><p>  The house at the intersection of Rozhdestvensky Lane and Bolshaya Street, in which in the last century was a district executive committee, at the beginning of that century belonged to the Korovkin family.  These rather wealthy people (in 1917 they were even recognized as the richest citizens) made an invaluable contribution to the formation of industry, the development of trade, the educational system and health care of Bezhetsk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dostoprimechatelnosti-m.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Bezhetsk, photo" class="if uuid-2585936" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2585936.jpg"></div><p>  The former Moscow-style Art Nouveau landmark on Bolshaya Street is the mansion of the merchant Nevorotin.  Tourists are conquered not only by the Atlanteans, "holding" the cornice, but also the interior with beautifully preserved elements, embossed with embossed leather, exquisite stucco molding and painting. </p><p>  The house of the merchant Revyakin, built according to a regular plan at the end of the 18th century, is the oldest surviving.  Although several times rebuilt.  In the second half of the XIX century, urban society bought it from a merchant.  As a result, the bank, the city government, the orphanage, the city school and the fire department were able to accommodate here.  Later, the Kalancha attached to the house was lost already in Soviet times. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The house of the tradesman Tyranova is also unique in its kind.  It was built in the style of late classicism.  The three-story stone building at the end of the 19th century passed into the hands of the wife of the merchant Krylov, and in the first decade of the last century the first cinema hall inaugurated on the third floor. </p><h2>  Temples </h2><p>  Unfortunately, most of them (thanks to the Soviet government) have been lost.  However, what remains to be seen.  In the photo of Bezhetsk sights, see the description below, you can see the pride of the city - the Transfiguration and Kazan churches (XVIII century) and the Church of the Exaltation of the Cross (XVII century). </p><p>  The latter since the mid-17th century has become the center of spiritual city life.  Historians claim that they built the church on the territory of the then existing convent.  The bell tower appeared later - in 1782.  Thus, this building is the oldest in the city.  The exterior decoration of the temple is designed in the early Baroque style.  Inside is a well-preserved wall painting from around the end of the 19th century.  Services were resumed here in 1991. </p><p>  The Annunciation Monastery, which is actively reborn today, was built in 1878.  He occupied a fairly large area.  At first, the monastery included buildings for priors with an adjoining church.  Ten years later, the construction of the Annunciation Cathedral was completed on the territory.  Then two more churches appeared.  The full ensemble of the monastery was formed by the beginning of 1900.  Almost all the buildings of this complex were destroyed during the years of Soviet power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another interesting temple is the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord, built in 1772 with donations from parishioners.  It was built on the site of a man‚Äôs monastery that had sunk into oblivion during the Time of Troubles.  The northern chapel was consecrated last - in 1819.  Naturally, during the years of Soviet power, almost nothing remained of the church.  Restoration work, begun in 2000, has now been completed.  Now this temple is included in the list of attractions of Bezhetsk. </p><p>  The bell tower of the Vvedensky monastery is the only surviving structure of this complex.  The monastery operated until 1764.  Then a parish church was located on its territory.  Historians attribute the construction of the bell tower to the beginning of the 19th century.  It has three auditory rows and two tiers.  Crowns her with a cross with a crown. </p><h2>  Church of the Savior Cemetery </h2><p>  The temple of amazing beauty was erected in 1787.  In the Soviet years, the church was the only one operating.  Here you can still see ancient, well-preserved icons and an altar of cypress.  Relatives of Nikolai Gumilyov and the local writer Shishkov are buried in the cemetery at the church. </p><div class="photo" data-original="autotravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Bezhetsk, description" class="if uuid-2585938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2585938.jpg"></div><h2>  Children's music school </h2><p>  On the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Soviet city of Bezhetsk, Tver region, a tourist attraction with a rather interesting history meets tourists.  This is the building in which the secondary school named after  A.P. Ivanova, where, in addition to the main subjects, they study music wisdom in depth, and the Children's Musical School of Russian Instrumental Art.  But the building itself is interesting here.  This is the former Church of St. John the Evangelist, built in 1869 in a style close to Russian-Byzantine.  According to local legends, the first temple that arose on this site was built by Dmitry Krasny, the grandson of Dmitry Donskoy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sobory.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Bezhetsk, description" class="if uuid-2585957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2585957.jpg"></div><h2>  Museums and complexes </h2><p>  A unique attraction of Bezhetsk is the museum of V. Shishkov.  This native refugee wrote the famous novel The Gloomy River.  The exposition is open in the building of the former school, in which the writer studied.  The halls of the museum belong to the local Literary-Memorial and Local History Museum.  In addition to exhibits relating to the life and work of Shishkov, there are exhibits dedicated to the Gumilev family, the history of the city and the nature of the Tula Territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bezheck.tverlib.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Bezhetsk" class="if uuid-2585948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2585948.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the description, the Bezhetsk attraction was founded by Nikolai Sverchkov, Nikolay Gumilyov‚Äôs own nephew.  He and his successors gathered a memory of the amazing townspeople who became famous in one area or another.  For example, this is the balalaika Vasily Andreev, the poets Akhmatova and Gumilyov and their son - a brilliant thinker and theorist of Eurasianism - Lev Gumilyov, and many, many others.  The museum has an interesting exposition dedicated to ethnography.  It is valuable in that the place in which it was gathered is the point of interaction of several peoples: the Balts, Slavs and Ugro-Finns. </p><p>  Here you can find rare collections of Russian folk instruments and paintings.  Of great interest is the annual exhibition, reflecting the historical aspects of the eight-century history of the region. </p><p>  The Literary Memorial and Local History Museum is rich in unique values.  This is a rare collection of Russian folk instruments of the end of the century before last, exclusive lifetime editions with an autographed autograph and documents of the writer V. Shishkov, a rare collection of paintings by I. Kostenko and unique photographs with negatives of the views of the city from the beginning of the last century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bezh-citi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of the city Bezhetsk" class="if uuid-2585993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2585993.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting and memorable places </h2><p>  Lev Gumilyov himself can be "met" on one of the streets of the city.  He "waits" for guests with his parents.  The composition was opened in 2003.  By the way, Bezhetsk is the first city in Russia to erect a monument to the son of Akhmatova and Gumilyov. </p><p>  What else to see in Bezhetsk?  The attraction of our day is a monument to the bus.  He stands at the entrance to the bus depot on a pedestal of concrete slabs, and, it seems, is now ready to go on the route. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dostoprimechatelnosti-m.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Bezhetsk, description" class="if uuid-2586008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2586008.jpg"></div><p>  Monument to <span>Vasily Andreev,</span> which was opened in late summer 2001.  This is the famous balalaika virtuoso.  He was the first to organize an orchestra of Russian musical instruments.  He himself, except for the balalaika, played the violin and piano freely.  Andreev belongs to the merit of improving the three-stringed instrument.  With his submission, she became a five-cows.  A little later Andreev developed the balalaika - double bass, bass, viola, primo, piccolo and treble. </p><p>  On the main square of the city in memory of the dead natives of Bezhetsk, an obelisk of Victory is installed.  The Eternal Flame burns before him.  Many city-wide events are held here.  On the side you can see the memorial stone.  It was established in honor of the founding of the city.  There is a corresponding plate on the stone. </p><h2>  Who would have thought ... Raspberry Museum !? </h2><p>  Its exposition is a motley collection of objects collected by the efforts of indifferent citizens, who have at least a slight relation to the berry.  By the way, raspberries are on the arms of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dostoprimechatelnosti-m.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bezhetsk - attractions, what to see" class="if uuid-2586016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2586016.jpg"></div><p>  Each visitor to the museum is waiting for a surprise - tasting raspberry jam. </p><h2>  City garden </h2><p>  In the photo of the city of Bezhetsk you can often see views of the City Garden.  It is located in the historical center.  But this is not why this is a favorite place for families.  The Praise river flows here, the territory is ‚Äúprotected‚Äù by the openwork forged lattice with gates, and in the center of the guests the famous local resident V. Shishkov meets.  In addition, the park pleases with new pedestrian paths and a bridge, children's attractions, cozy benches and romantic lighting at night. </p><h2>  Original monuments </h2><p>  Talking about the sights of the city of Bezhetsk, one cannot ignore a rather original monument.  This is a balalaika monument.  It is installed at the very beginning of the linden alley, a few steps from the Nevorotin estate.  In fact, it is a real musical instrument.  It is made of wood, only the dimensions are impressive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="forum.tourdom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Bezhetsk, photo" class="if uuid-2586024" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2586024.jpg"></div><p>  A balalaika is set on a stone pedestal.  The opening of the monument was dedicated to the 150th anniversary of the head of the orchestra of Russian folk instruments - V.V. Andreev.  It was with his light hand that the balalaika became the unofficial symbol of Russia in the world. </p>
