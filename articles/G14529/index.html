How tempting it sounds!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To do applied art, you need, firstly, desire.  Some basic knowledge of the materials you will have to deal with will not hinder.  Further, it is desirable to study the basic technologies.  It is great if for the first experiment there is already a ready-made algorithm.  Therefore, we will tell further how to mold a three-dimensional figure of a parrot from plasticine. </p><h2>  Creation </h2><p>  The man decided to go in for creativity.  Suppose he chose plastic material for his purpose.  That is, one that, when pressed, takes a given shape easily and retains it for a long time, without returning to its original form. </p><p>  Stocking up materials, in the modern variety of products on offer, anyone who has decided to mold a parrot from plasticine, like any researcher, will have to act by trial and possibly error.  But in the end, you can choose the right one specifically for you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plasticine - material for creativity" class="if uuid-3091247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3091247.jpg"></div><h2>  Plasticine </h2><p>  This is the children's favorite craft material.  You can mold plasticine from a parrot, a cake, a computer, and a real photo frame.  Yes, everything your heart desires! </p><p>  Previously, plasticine was made from clay, to which animal fats and wax were added, so that the mass did not dry longer. </p><p>  Now plasticine is made from technological materials, such as high molecular weight polyethylene, rubbers and others, and painted in all possible colors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Preparation for work </h2><p>  An impatient master may already be tired of asking: ‚ÄúWhen, at last, can one mold a parrot from plasticine?‚Äù  How to get started if tools, materials and a workplace are not ready?  For work you will need: </p><ul><li>  plasticine; </li><li>  stack </li><li>  board; </li><li>  napkin. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="38 Parrots - Favorite Cartoon" class="if uuid-3091256" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3091256.jpg"></div><h2>  And why exactly a plasticine parrot? </h2><p>  Perhaps because it is bright and colorful.  In addition, not so complicated nature - anyone can do it. </p><p>  And maybe also because this bird is very popular.  A parrot is not just a favorite pet of many citizens.  He is also a famous hero of fables, jokes (and more serious literature), songs and, of course, movies! </p><p>  You can recall the domestic series "The Return of the Prodigal Parrot" and its main feathered hero - Keshu.  But perhaps even more famous was the ten-episode cartoon "38 Parrots", which received many awards around the world, loved by children and adults.  We blind one of his main characters. </p><p>  Do not be horrified in advance!  38 birds do not have to sculpt.  Although, it is quite possible that someone will get carried away to such an extent.  You can start with one. </p><h2>  Hurrah!  Sculpt! </h2><p>  Step 1. We fashion the blanks for future parts of the body of the parrot: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  The body is a cylinder of red plasticine, rounded on top. </li><li>  A flat "apron" that will be the tummy of the bird. </li><li>  Two green, flattened, but thicker than the tummy, pear-shaped blanks on the wings. </li><li>  Brown flagella: 2 thicker and more authentic for paws, and 8 thinner and shorter for fingers (4 each). </li><li>  Black pyramid (future beak). </li><li>  A flat but rather thick orange horseshoe crest. </li><li>  Two white cakes for the eyes and two smaller black ones for the pupils. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="Step 1 - part blanks" class="if uuid-3091249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3091249.jpg"></div><p>  Some parts need to be marked with a stack.  It will need to cut out the details. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="Step 2 - Stacking" class="if uuid-3091250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3091250.jpg"></div><p>  Step 2. Cut the stack on the blanks: </p><ul><li>  on the yellow tummy we make a cut, like a T-shirt; </li><li>  on the wings, according to the markup, we make 4 feather fingers; </li><li>  make a cut in the center of the beak; </li><li>  cut feathers on an orange crest. </li></ul><p>  Step 3. Connect: </p><ul><li>  fingers with paws; </li><li>  pupils with eyes. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="Step 3 - Connect the Parts" class="if uuid-3091251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3091251.jpg"></div><p>  Step 4. Connect all the details in a single volumetric figure. </p><p>  The parrot is ready! </p><p>  Just do not need to hope that such a heavy figure will stand on such thin legs.  The secret of sculptors and masters of volumetric plasticine animation is that such figures have a wire frame. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="The cartoon parrot is ready!" class="if uuid-3091245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111526/3091245.jpg"></div><h2>  Why was all this </h2><p>  Well, now it‚Äôs clear how to mold a parrot from plasticine, the hero of the famous animated series. </p><p>  Will this sculpture become a gift to a loved one, will she receive a diploma at a creative competition or just decorate the author‚Äôs room?  Or maybe the parrot will come to life in the new cartoon? </p><p>  Indeed, today children's animation is actively developing throughout the country.  And voluminous plasticine animation, when the figures are removed frame by frame in different phases of movement, is very popular among children. </p><p>  Well, parrot, live.  And learn to fly! </p>
