In chemistry classes, students are told about the most prominent scientists in this field.  But the knowledge about the discoveries of our compatriots should be especially vivid.  It is Russian chemists <strong> </strong>  compiled the most important table for science, analyzed the obsidian mineral, became the founders of thermochemistry, became the authors of many scientific papers that helped other scientists advance in the study of chemistry. </p>

    <h2>  Victor Ivanov </h2><p>  <span>Ivanov Viktor</span> Petrovich - a famous Russian scientist, is a distinguished chemist of Russia, as well as a candidate of <span>technical sciences.</span>  Born in 1943, graduated from Tomsk University, and already in 1988 became deputy minister of the chemical industry of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  In 2009 he became an honorary professor.  Viktor Petrovich devoted his whole life to chemistry, and then began to get involved in petrochemistry.  Viktor Petrovich is the author of many works, works, studies and essays. </p><h2>  Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev </h2><p>  Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleev is the most famous and outstanding Russian chemist.  Every high school student around the world knows him.  In addition to the fact that Dmitry Ivanovich made many discoveries in the field of chemistry and the chemical industry, he was also a geologist, mineralogist, economist and physicist. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Dmitry Ivanovich was born in Tobolsk into a teacher's family.  He was the youngest, seventeenth, a child in the family.  According to reports, eight children died in infancy.  In the year of the birth of Dmitry Mendeleev, his father became blind and he had to leave the post of director of the school.  It was then that all the care for the family went to Dmitry's mother.  According to the historian, Mendeleev‚Äôs mother was a very active and intelligent woman.  She managed to take care of her family and manage a glass factory.  True, she earned very little money: she barely had enough for food.  The mother devoted a lot of time in the family to Dmitry, since she considered him an outstanding child.  But at that time her youngest son studied at school very poorly, he liked only the lessons of mathematics and physics. </p><p>  Dmitry Mendeleev began to study well and became interested in scientific activity only at St. Petersburg University.  After graduating, Dmitry worked as a teacher in Odessa, but then returned to Petersburg again and continued to study physical chemistry. </p><p>  <span>Mendeleev</span> made his first legendary <span>discovery</span> in Germany, in the city of Heidelberg.  He experimentally discovered a critical temperature, which is also called the absolute boiling point.  Then Dmitry Ivanovich worked in the field of physics and did a lot of experiments and research. </p>

    <p>  Suddenly, Dmitry returns to St. Petersburg, where he begins to give lectures at the university on the subject of chemistry and physics.  He pays special attention to organic chemistry.  A few years later he even published Russia's first textbook on organic chemistry.  Dmitry is awarded the highest scientific award for this textbook. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In subsequent years, the scientist studied the similarities between such chemical elements as lithium, sodium and potassium, as well as between cobalt, manganese and iron.  Then the scientist tried for the first time to create a table that would combine all the elements, but that time nothing came of it.  The scientist continued to study chemical elements, dreaming to combine them into one table. </p><p>  Among his most outstanding discoveries, Russian chemists singled out the <span>periodic law of the</span> elements.  In Germany, it was believed that Meyer was also a co-author of this periodic law, which was subsequently refuted.  After all, it was Mendeleev who was able to enter into the table not only existing substances, but unknown scientists at that time, which greatly helped the development of science.  Dmitry Mendeleev was able to predict the existence of elements, as well as distribute them in the desired sequence, which forever made him the <span>greatest chemist.</span> </p>

    <h2>  German Ivanovich Hess and thermochemistry </h2><p>  The main thing in the career of German Ivanovich was that he made many discoveries in the field of thermochemistry, which made him one of its founders.  He discovered an important law called the law of Hess.  After some time, he recognized the composition of four minerals.  In addition to these discoveries, he studied minerals (he was engaged in geochemistry).  In honor of the Russian scientist, they even called the mineral that was first studied by him, hessite.  Hermann Hess is still considered a famous and revered chemist. </p><h2>  Evgeny Timofeevich Denisov </h2><p>  Evgeny Timofeevich Denisov is an outstanding Russian physicist and chemist, however, very little is known about him.  Eugene was born in the city of Kaluga, studied at the Moscow State University at the Faculty of Chemistry, specializing in physical chemistry.  Then he continued his path in scientific activity.  Evgeny Denisov has several published works that have become very authoritative.  He also has a series of works on the topic of cyclic mechanisms and several models built by him.  The scientist is an academician at the Academy of Creativity, as well as at the International Academy of Sciences.  Evgeny Denisov is a man who devoted his whole life to chemistry and physics, and also taught the younger generation these sciences. </p>

    <p>  Degtev Mikhail Ivanovich published about 500 very important scientific papers: research results, monographs, study guides. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the scientist is already 69 years old, he still works at Perm University, where he writes scientific papers, conducts research and teaches chemistry to the younger generation.  Today, the scientist directs two research areas at the university, as well as the work and research of graduate students and doctoral students. </p><h2>  Vladimir Vasilievich Markovnikov </h2><p>  It is difficult to underestimate the contribution of this famous Russian scientist to such a science as chemistry.  Vladimir Markovnikov was born in the first half of the 19th century into a noble family.  At the age of ten, Vladimir Vasilievich began to study at the Nizhny Novgorod noble institute, where he graduated from high school classes.  After that, he studied at Kazan University, where Professor Butlerov, a well-known Russian chemist, was his teacher.  It was during these years that Vladimir Vasilievich Markovnikov discovered his interest in chemistry.  After graduating from Kazan University, Vladimir became a laboratory assistant and worked hard, dreaming of getting a professorship. </p>

    <p>  Vladimir Markovnikov studied isomerism and after a few years successfully defended his scientific work on the topic of isomerism of organic compounds.  Professor Markovnikov already proved in this dissertation that such isomerism exists.  After that, he was sent to work in Europe, where he worked with the most famous foreign scientists. </p><p>  In addition to isomerism, Vladimir Vasilievich studied the chemical <span>composition of oil.</span>  He worked for several years at Moscow University, where he taught the young generation of chemistry and, until his very old age, gave his lectures to students in the physics and mathematics department. </p><p>  In addition, Vladimir Vasilievich Markovnikov also released a book, which he called the "Lomonosov collection."  It presents almost all the famous and prominent Russian chemists, as well as tells about the history of the development of chemistry in Russia. </p>
