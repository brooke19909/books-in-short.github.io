In Thailand, it is considered a five-star, although according to international classification it is more likely to be positioned as the "four".  It is not new, built in the eighties of the last century.  But the hotel is constantly undergoing a renewal process, which, by the way, does not interfere with the rest.  Maybe that's why the services, living conditions, beach, location and food at this hotel, the majority of tourists, even quite picky and spoiled by various exclusives, evaluates as impeccable.

    <h2>  What is Panwa Beach? </h2><p>  This resort region of Phuket is located in the southeast of the island.  Previously, there was a fishing village, but now they have built a beautiful promenade, an aquarium and many hotels, cafes and restaurants.  But even now there are quite a lot of long-tail boats near the cape, which depart in the morning for a catch.  The beaches at the resort are not very wide, five to six meters.  But the views from the hills of Panwa are very beautiful - both on the coast of Phuket and on the nearby islands.  There are not many people here, and the resort is very popular with privacy lovers.  After all, not only party people, but also romantics come to rest in Thailand.  Cape Panwa Hotel is an ideal place for travelers like this.  And if you want to go to some island, then any fisherman can take you there for a price that you will agree among themselves.  You can go here all year round.  Even in the ‚Äúwet‚Äù season, it rains rarely, and the sea is always calm. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location of the Cape Panwa Hotel </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, Cape Panwa Hotel is located on Cape Panwa.
