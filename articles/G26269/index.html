    <h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  Crete is one of the Greek islands.  However, it has its own history of tradition and folklore.  Crete can be safely called the cradle of Greek culture. </p><p>  <span>Holidays in Bali are</span> preferred by those tourists who are fans of peace and tranquility, as well as beautiful nature.  The fishing village with a beautiful name is located near Rethymnon.  The local slopes of the mountains are covered with continuous green carpets of plants, and secluded coves with clean clear water are located nearby.  Holidays in Bali can be described as a leisurely calm pastime surrounded by beautiful nature. </p><p>  It is necessary to take into account the fact that the local mountain slopes are quite steep.  Therefore, trips to the sea are reduced to descents and ascents.  For this reason, the resort may not be suitable for the elderly. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  How to get to Bali Paradise Beach 4 *?  The map shows that the distances are very small. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has a shuttle service, which will cost 60 EUR per person one way.  But there is another way to get to the hotel.  You can always take a taxi at the airport.  Pre-reserve it is not worth it, because it costs money.  Moreover, there are always free cars at the airport.  Taxi from <span>Heraklion (airport)</span> to Bali costs about 60 EUR. </p><p>  There are passing buses passing to Bali to Chania, Rethymnon, Heraklion.  However, they all stop on the track.  Go from it to the village itself for about two kilometers.  You can use the local tram, but you need to analyze the schedule of its movement.  In addition, you should not really hope for him, because he does not always go. </p><p>  There are several companies in Bali where you can rent a car or a scooter.  If you want to see the beautiful island of Crete, then the best option is a car.  If you can not rent it, then it will be difficult to move around. </p><h2>  Resort beaches </h2><p>  In Bali, there are four main beaches located in the bays for tourists.  The first of them is the most open and large.  Decent waves rise here during the wind.  The second bay is much smaller, but also calmer.  But the central one is the busiest.  There are moorings with fishing boats, pirate pleasure boats sailing here, which conduct excursions for tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bali paradise beach 4 on the map" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1551108.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The most calm and quiet bay is called Evita (or Karavostasi).  There are never waves, because it is located behind a mountain cape.  This place is considered the most secluded and calm in Bali, since there is only one hotel and several taverns.  Near the beach there are several small bays with beautiful grottoes, which can be reached by boat or by swimming. </p><p>  And at the very top of the mountain there is an observation deck with a unique view.  The highlight of Bali is the absence of waves.  But it should be understood that during the high season (July and August) in windy weather, beaches can be crowded not only with vacationers, but also with residents of local villages in which the sea is not so calm. </p><h2>  Restaurants and Leisure in Bali </h2><p>  The village has a lot of souvenir shops, there are several supermarkets.  There are many traditional taverns in Bali, which are famous not only for their excellent cuisine, but also for solid portions.  One of the most popular places is Panorama, a port tavern. </p><p>  Proponents of water sports can go diving, canoeing, go sea fishing. </p><p>  There are no special attractions in Bali.  If you want to see something worthwhile, then you can go around the island, which is really rich in interesting places.  As for the village, there is Melidoni cave near it.  Its worth a look.  The entrance to it is located at an altitude of 230 meters above sea level.  The main stone hall has spacious dimensions (44 x 55 meters), and the height of the cave ranges from ten to twenty-five meters.  The cave is decorated with bizarre stalactites, illuminated by lights. </p><h2>  Bali Paradise Beach 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I certainly want to refer to the reviews of tourists who managed to visit this beautiful place.  Bali Paradise Beach 4 * (Crete) - an excellent hotel on the coast.  The complex is French-speaking and more focused on the French.  However, this does not spoil the rest.  The bulk of holidaymakers are Europeans.  The hotel is always quiet and calm, all guests behave culturally and with dignity.  The hotel staff deserves special attention.  Almost all employees are polite and attentive.  However, no one knows the Russian language.  According to our compatriots, some of the workers are more willing to serve the French than the Russians.  But this, apparently, affects the human factor.  In general, vacationers are very satisfied with both the service and the attitude of the staff. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has very nice rooms, especially in the main building.  If you are unhappy with the apartment, you can always ask to replace the room.  As a rule, at the reception they always willingly compromise.  The situation in the rooms and the appliances are practically new, everything is working properly, there are no problems with plumbing at all.  As for the quality of cleaning, almost everyone is satisfied, noting its high level.  Towels and linen are changed very often, while it is clear that all sets are new and not washed.  As for detergents in the bathroom, they are not (they are simply not provided), so it makes sense to take a minimal set of gels and shampoos with you. </p><p>  During check-in, each guest room is left with wine and a fruit plate - a very nice bonus.  But there is no drinking water in the apartment, so you need to buy it in the nearest store.  Many rooms have not just balconies, but extensive equipped terraces with stunning sea views. </p><p>  Dining at the hotel is organized on an all-inclusive basis, but no one bothers you to book half board.  Each tourist has the right to choose for himself the most suitable option.  Hotel guests are very pleased with the variety of buffets and the quality of food.  Food is organized at a decent level.  All Inclusive also implies the provision of free alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.  And in the evening, free vending machines with tea, coffee, and cappuccino work in the lobby. </p><p>  The real pride of the hotel is its beautiful park.  Its territory is well-groomed and surrounded by greenery and flowers.  The hotel has large pools.  Children especially like the pond with a mini water park.  There are also other activities at the hotel.  Throughout the territory there are scattered playgrounds for games to which shady alleys lead.  Animators work during the day and in the evenings.  True, they conduct all programs and shows in French.  Not knowing the language, all the replicas are incomprehensible, but the incendiary mood conveyed by the animators perfectly raises the tone. </p><p>  The hotel has its own small beach on the coast.  Go to him no more than five minutes.  True, to find yourself on the coast, you need to go down the mountain.  And vice versa, you have to go back to the hotel uphill.  At the reception they talk about the existence of an electric car that takes guests ashore.  It is hard to say how regular his flights are. </p>

    <p>  The coast itself is incredibly picturesque and clean.  The beach is small, there are not many sun loungers on it.  There are too many people here in season.  But this is a solvable problem: you can take a walk further to a more spacious and free area.  Entry into the water is gentle and comfortable everywhere.  And the water is incredibly clean and warm. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Bali Paradise Beach 4 * is the most beautiful hotel not only for families, but also for trips with friends.  <span>Bali Resort</span> is an incredibly calm and quiet place that will appeal to absolutely all tourists.  And the most active guests of the hotel can get acquainted with the ancient culture and sights of the island in more detail. </p>
