    <h2>  General information about the recreation center </h2><p>  Korogon is a large <span>recreation center</span> located in the Chemal district on the banks of the Middle Katun River.  It is located 338 km from Barnaul and 512 km from Novosibirsk.  It is famous for its unusually picturesque views, remoteness from noisy city life and a large number of options for entertaining family leisure. </p><h2>  A few words about Chemal </h2><p>  Chemal district deserves special attention.  Few people know that “Chemals” translates as “anthill” or “ant nest”.  In not so distant times, this region was famous for a large number of succulent feeds, which is why it was very popular among shepherds and drovers.  During their journey through the vast expanses of Chemal, herds of goats and sheep resembled the measured and unhurried movement of ants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Chemal itself is located at an altitude of 410 m above sea level, near Gorno-Altaysk, in the northern part of the Altai Republic.  The first information about the appearance of the Chemal camp dates back to 1830.  From ancient times people came here from Barnaul, Biysk, Tomsk and other regions of Russia, dreaming of walking along mountain trails, riding horses and having a great time away from civilization. </p><h2>  Amazing microclimate of the Chemal region </h2><p>  Chemal district is a special place where a peculiar microclimate reigns.  Many visitors have the impression that the local weather is very different from that typical of the Altai Mountains. </p><p>  She is very capricious and sometimes unpredictable, so happy or upset by the sharp temperature jumps, wind and even unexpected precipitation.  However, in the summer, as if it were all over.  Locals say that during this period the weather seems to take a vacation and still pleases vacationers with its stable warmth. </p>

    <h2>  The rebellious and proud Altai Territory </h2><p>  Translated from the Mongolian "Altai" is translated as "golden".  This is truly an unusual region, comfortably located in the very center of Eurasia and affecting the territory of the following states: Mongolia, Kazakhstan, China and Russia.  It is famous for its bright and impressively versatile relief, since here you can meet not only wide basins and picturesque mountain ranges, but also unforgettable landscapes of the steppes and forests of the taiga. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  All the delights of the weather in the Altai Territory </h2><p>  Beautiful and unique weather in Altai.  It is characterized by an uneven distribution of precipitation by season.  So, in the western regions of the region, approximately 40% of precipitation falls.  Moreover, in winter, the thickness of the snow cover is 2-3, less often 5 m. </p><p>  In the summer, Altai is very hot.  This is due to its location and distance from the oceans.  In winter it is cold and windy, but often the weather is clear and frosty.  The average annual air temperature here is + 4º, and in the highlands reaches -7º.  On the slopes of mountain ranges the temperature is more or less stable and keeps at around 10º.  However, this area is characterized by unexpected summer snowfalls and gusty winds. </p><p>  July is considered the hottest month.  The temperature here is kept within + 16-18 º.  During the month, the temperature can increase to + 25-30 º, but this is not always the case.  The coldest place in Altai is considered Chui steppe.
