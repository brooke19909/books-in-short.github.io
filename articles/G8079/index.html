    <h2>  How to learn to think logically? </h2><p>  The main condition for exercise is the formation of flexibility of thinking.

There are also special books that develop deduction.  For example, the well-known work of Arthur Conan Doyle about the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  Reading detective stories greatly contributes to the formation of logical thinking.  Among other works, one can also note stories written by Agatha Christie. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="deduction training" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/359990.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  How to develop deduction on your own? </h2><p>  By and large, such thinking is closely related to the concept of induction - the ability to build a logical sequence from various disparate facts.  If you recall the stories about Holmes, it becomes clear that the detective mastered these two methods perfectly. </p><p>  To start perceiving reality in a new way, you should start with a simple reading.  Of course, this does not mean that books should be exclusively detective genre.  At first, reading classical literature was enough.  The works of many writers, in addition to the main text, contain various additions and include subtexts.  At the same time, one should analyze what was read and imagine what the heroes would do if the development of events was different. </p><p>  Since deduction can be developed by solving various problems of logical thinking, it is necessary to purchase the appropriate collections containing puzzles and puzzles.  It‚Äôs better to start with easy questions, gradually increasing the level of difficulty.  The solitaire layout helps a little in the formation of analytical abilities.  In the process, not only does brain activity develop.  The solitaire layout is calming, helps to focus better. </p><p>  The general educational level is also important.  To improve education, it is recommended to watch educational programs, read popular science articles.  According to doctors, memorizing poems and learning a foreign language have a strong stimulating effect on thinking and memory.  Developing deductive-inductive abilities, it is necessary to find time for self-education.  Forming logical thinking is easy.  In this matter, the most important thing is to start and not stop there.  In the process, a person learns a lot of new things, understands how many fascinating things and phenomena exist in the world. </p>
