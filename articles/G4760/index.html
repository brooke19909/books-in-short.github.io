  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Paris Peace Conference</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The</span> 1946 <span>Paris Peace</span> Conference was convened to consider several draft peace <span>treaties.</span>  <span>The conclusion of agreements was</span> supposed between the countries of the anti-Hitler union that won the war of 1939-1945 and the former German allies in Europe: Hungary, Bulgaria, Finland, Italy, Romania. </p><p>  The Paris Peace Conference was held with the participation of the USSR, China, Great Britain, BSSR, USA, France, Australia.  The meetings were attended by representatives of Belgium, Greece, Brazil, Canada, India, New Zealand, Poland.  The Paris Peace Conference was also held with the participation of the Ukrainian SSR, Norway, Yugoslavia, the <span>Union of South Africa,</span> Ethiopia, Czechoslovakia.  A number of interested countries also got the opportunity through their representatives to state their positions.  So, the interests of Egypt, Cuba, Mexico, Austria, Albania, Iraq, Iran were represented. </p><p>  The Paris Peace Conference was held in sharp clashes between Western delegations and Soviet representatives.  The USSR defended the national independence of all peoples.  The Western powers sought in treaties to secure the right to intervene in the internal life of most of the former German allies. </p><p>  The Russian question at the Paris Peace Conference escalated quite often, however, thanks to the firm position of the Soviet government, many of the provisions adopted earlier at the Ministerial Council were approved.  At the same time, <span>Western countries</span> used the procedure for adopting provisions imposed by them in the same way - by a simple majority.  This contradicted the recommendations of the Ministerial Council, which in such cases required 2/3 of the vote, that is, a <span>qualified majority.</span>  As a result, the Paris Peace Conference was marked by the adoption of several unacceptable recommendations proposed by Western countries (for example, on the internationalization of the Danube). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Some articles of draft agreements (those that were not agreed upon) were considered at the Ministerial Council session in America (New York).  Among such provisions were articles on the Greco-Bulgarian borders, reparations with Italy, the status of Trieste, navigation regimes on the Danube, and others.  So, in November-December 1946, the preparation of the provisions for signing was completed. </p><p>  The following year, 1947, agreements were signed.  The Paris Treaties (peace agreements) were concluded on February 10 between the former German allies and the victorious countries.  The projects, in accordance with the decisions taken at the <span>Potsdam Conference of the</span> 45th year, were considered and prepared at the first meeting of the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs (CMFA), at the meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Great Britain, the USA and the USSR in Moscow on December 45th years, meetings of deputy foreign ministers in London.  In addition, all articles of the draft treaties were considered at the Paris Conference.  The signed agreements entered into force on September 15, 1947.  The treaties were signed with each of the five countries by those victorious powers that were at war with a particular country. </p><p>  All agreements were drawn up the same way.  They have a preamble and decrees.  The regulations reflect territorial, military, political, economic, as well as reparation issues.  Final decisions concerned interpretations and methods of treaty execution, their ratification and entry into force.  Each agreement contained an appendix, which clarified a number of significant issues related to the articles, as well as special provisions that related to literary, artistic and industrial property, to those contracts that were concluded before the war.  All peace agreements contain provisions on the timing of the withdrawal of troops. </p>
