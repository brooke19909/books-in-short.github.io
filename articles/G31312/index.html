Hand-made style is now gaining popularity and is widely used in many areas related to design.  This applies to the interior, clothing, furniture.  To decorate any item with a beautiful pattern, you can make DIY stencils for decoration.  With their help, making any complex ornament on the surface is much easier.  At the same time, any thing becomes unique and stylish. </p><h2>  Do-it-yourself stencils for decor </h2><p>  The photographs presented in the article clearly demonstrate the beauty and grace, as well as the originality of the created decor.  Simple tools and a minimum of artistic skills - this is quite enough to radically transform the interior, furniture or any other decorative object. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY wall decor stencils" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/667531.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Working with stencils is gaining popularity due to its ease of implementation.  You just need to attach the template to the surface to be decorated and fill the cut out holes with paint or putty to get the original effects of the textured surface, for example, on the wall.  Sometimes reverse stencils or anti-stencils are used, when the surrounding space is filled with colored paint, and the pattern under the sample remains white.  This creates a glow effect for the image. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ready-made stencils for every taste and budget are available for sale.  There are universal ones that are suitable for various techniques.  In construction stores, you can purchase those that are designed for interior work.  However, their cost is quite high.  They are reusable, easy to clean.  When you do not need these properties, and you need to put a picture in only one place on the wall, it‚Äôs cheaper to make a stencil yourself.  In addition, in this case, you yourself choose an image from a huge number of possible.  If you have artistic skills, you can develop the design yourself, then surely no one will have such a decor, as a result, any decorated object will be completely individual. </p><h2>  Materials and manufacturing technology </h2><p>  So, you need the following: </p><ul><li>  Cardboard, thick paper, film, plastic. </li><li>  Knife, scissors. </li><li>  Pencil, felt-tip pen, marker. </li><li>  Glass or any material for the substrate on which you will cut the contours. </li></ul><p>  The sequence of work will be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Find the desired picture, scale it to the desired size and print.  If a size larger than A4 is required, then divide the image into several sheets, and then glue together individual parts with tape.  You can order printing services in the company.  Advertising agencies offer large format printing up to A1 format and more.  By the way, there you can completely make a stencil from a film on a special cutting plotter, so if you do not want to cut, order a stencil there.  If you still decide to master the technique of creating a stencil yourself manually, go to the next step. </li><li>  Fix the pattern on the basis of which you will cut out the contours.  Transfer the image to film (cardboard, paper).  There are no problems with transparent material.  On whatman paper can be transferred through carbon paper, tracing paper.  If these funds are not at hand, simply circle, for example, a helium pen on the contours several times on both sides so that the pigment from the inside passes to the base when you pass the pattern on the outside. </li><li>  Cut the image with a sharp knife or scissors.  It is important to do everything carefully so as not to get any burrs, otherwise the drawing obtained by poor stencil will look untidy.  If you are cutting paper or cardboard, it is better to paste over their surface with tape so that they do not quickly get wet from paint.  When using the stencil repeatedly, do not forget to wipe it through 2-3 images. </li></ol><p>  The stencil is ready, you can proceed to creative work on the decorated surface. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to design a preschooler's room </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself children's stencils for decor are made similarly to any others.  The difference is only in the content of the picture.  Children like to be surrounded by their favorite characters of fairy tales, cartoons.  This is what should be used as the main idea in the children's interior.  Any picture is easy to find on the Internet and print it.  The only difficulty is that you will need to perform multi-color pictures, so you will have to produce several different stencils, one for each color.  It is important here not to get confused in them when you work with paint.  You can turn stencil drawing and their creation into an exciting collective family process. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY stencils for decor" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/667520.jpg" width="464"></div>

    <p>  In addition, for the decor of children's items or gifts, such as a cake, ordinary stencils for children's creativity are suitable.  They are reusable, made of safe plastic.  At the same time, they cost several times cheaper than special design ones. </p><h2>  Entertaining cooking </h2><p>  If you want to surprise guests or family members, as well as give someone a sweet gift, use the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdecorating cakes or pastries with beautiful drawings made using powdered sugar, cocoa, white, chocolate or colored glaze, food colors.  DIY stencils for decorating cakes are also very simple.  You need a film: you can take a regular liner from a folder for storing papers or a cover.  It is better not to use paper and cardboard in this case, so that particles of such a stencil (glue from the composition and other components) do not accidentally get into food.  Cut the pattern and use the product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY cake stencils" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/667527.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you are going to decorate not a flat surface, but, for example, Easter eggs, then the stencil is made of a material that can easily be glued on a rounded shape with a minimum number of folds.  You can use tape or a <span>self-adhesive film,</span> which is much stronger than the first material. </p><h2>  Do-it- <span>yourself wall decor</span> </h2><p>  Stencils are increasingly used in interior design for finishing various surfaces.  You can apply stencils to painted plain walls.  In this way, they usually allocate some part of the space, placing emphasis in the room and at the same time not overloading it with details.  Any drawing should contain a concise outline and not be overflowing with small elements.  They are difficult to paint over, and from afar they will look like ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù or random spots of paint. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY decor stencils" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/667528.jpg" width="483"></div>

    <h2>  Mirror decoration </h2><p>  Any glossy surfaces reflecting light look very aesthetically pleasing in the interior.  They visually expand the space and give the room a special sophistication, especially in the evening due to the reflections of the lamps.  Glasses and mirrors look original, complemented by a <span>sandblasted pattern,</span> when part of the surface is matte.  You can make jewelry in this technique, but for its implementation you will need special equipment.  Another option is to simulate a sandblast, simply by drawing a paint or a special matting compound.  In both cases, a stencil is required.  It can be either direct or reverse.  It all depends on what you will paint over: a picture or a background. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY butterfly stencils" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/667518.jpg" width="300"></div>
