    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  There are several ways to get to the hotel: </p><ul><li>  As part of a tourist group.  Upon arrival, everyone is met by a bus pre-ordered from the hotel, which delivers vacationers to the place of their planned stay. </li><li>  Alone by taxi.  It is important to remember that landing in a taxi (from 06:00 to 22:00) costs 3 dirhams (local currency), at night - 3,5 dirhams.  At the same time, taxi drivers on duty at the airport ask for a fare of 20 dirhams.  The calculation of the amount payable on the counter depends on the distance that the vehicle has traveled (based on the assumption that 1 km of the route is from <span>1,5 dirhams).</span>  The hotel is 5 km from the international airport.  You only need to choose cars equipped with a luminous TAXI sign on the roof, and women are not recommended to ride alone. </li><li>  Alone on public transport.  The metro station, which is located near the main entrance to the Holiday Inn, is called Al Rigga.  You can get here directly from the airport (for independent tourists this method seems the most profitable and fast, since the airport is located within the city limits and if you have a small amount of baggage you can save a lot). </li></ul><p>  Do not try to catch a ride, in the UAE movement is thus prohibited (the exception is an emergency, which must be confirmed by either doctors or police officers). </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Holiday Inn Downtown 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  First of all, vacationers note responsive staff who speak several languages.  According to tourists, all questions and emerging problems were resolved in a matter of minutes.  The administration always goes towards the guests, takes care of the image of the hotel.  Baggage carriers and doorman act clearly and harmoniously.  Tourists who visited Dubai in the summer months strongly recommend not to fly there at that time due to too much heat (eyewitnesses say that public transport stops melt in the hot sun), and since the hotel is located in the central area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, far from the coast , the air heats up faster, and cools down more slowly, you will have to hide in the rooms from the heat. </p><p>  In the period that lasts from October to March, the rest does not turn into something terrible, on warm evenings it is most pleasant to walk along the wide streets of Dubai.  Hotel Holiday Inn Downtown Dubai 4 * receives positive reviews for the beautiful pool, which is located on the roof.  Everyone who visited it unanimously claimed that in addition to transparent and always clear water, they were pleased with excellent views of the city, coast and water surface.  Drinks are sold right by the pool (there is a wide variety of alcoholic, non-alcoholic and soft drinks in the bar menu, there is ice cream and fresh fruit). </p><p>  Everyone who stayed in the walls of this hotel during an independent trip (without organized groups and mediation of tour operators), strongly recommend using the airport transfer service to the hotel entrance, as an untrained tourist will have a hard time understanding the local metro scheme, and taxi drivers (especially private individuals) are not always honest with foreigners. </p><p>  Guests of Holiday Inn Downtown leave a lot of praise in the direction of the local tour desk.  Those who want to see all the main attractions of both Dubai and other cities of the country, to hear the history of their appearance and development in their native language, you need to contact the bureau staff, who will promptly offer several options for field trips with a guide and offer to use an audio guide. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  After visiting the Hotel Holiday Inn Downtown Dubai, only positive emotions and pleasant impressions remain.  The hotel administration and its staff make sure that the rest of all its guests goes "perfectly"!  They are interested in making everyone's vacation as comfortable as possible.  And, as many visitors note, the hotel administration is completely successful.  I want to come back here.  Is not this the main indicator of quality?  In general, visit the Holiday Inn Downtown Hotel and see for yourself!  Have a nice rest! </p>
