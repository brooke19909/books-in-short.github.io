  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sven SPS-611S speaker overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sven has been releasing a variety of electronics and peripherals for desktops and laptops for a long time.  Particularly popular were the speaker systems, which, despite the low cost, had good sound quality.  Just one of these speakers today will be discussed - the Sven SPS-611S speakers. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.sven.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sven sps 611s equipment" class="if uuid-2347562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2347562.jpg"></div><p>  The speakers are sold in a medium sized cardboard box.  The packaging is branded in the shape of the flag of Finland.  It contains photos of the columns themselves, as well as all the main characteristics of the model.  Inside the box, in addition to the Sven SPS-611S acoustics themselves, there is also a quick user guide, warranty card, a set of instructions in different languages, a connection cable and a power cord.  Unfortunately, there is nothing more. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Acoustics look very good.  The body is made of MDF and glued with a film with a pattern of different colors.  By the way, several colors are available to choose from, but the most interesting ones are for ordinary wood and black leather. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="front view" class="if uuid-2347567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2347567.jpg"></div><p>  There are no controls on the left <span>column of the</span> Sven SPS-611S <span>speaker system</span> .  In front, behind the decorative trim, only 2 satellites are hiding.  At the back is the connector for connecting the connecting cable and the hole of the bass reflex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sven sps 611s rear view" class="if uuid-2347566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2347566.jpg"></div><p>  The right column of the Sven SPS-611S is active.  In front, she also has 2 satellites.  At the rear is a bass reflex and 4 connectors: 2 RCA, one input and one output.  On the side, in a small niche, are the controls for low frequencies, high frequencies, volume and a power switch. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  It's time to talk about the technical characteristics of the Sven SPS-611S.  Here they are: </p><ul><li>  The type of acoustics is 2.0. </li><li>  Power - 36 watts. </li><li>  Frequency range - 40 Hz - 18 kHz. </li><li>  The number of satellites is 2. </li><li>  The power of the satellites is 18 watts. </li><li>  The size of the satellites is 37 mm / 100 mm. </li><li>  Connectors - RCA, subwoofer output. </li><li>  Dimensions (W / H / D) - 143/250/175 mm. </li><li>  Weight - 4.86 kg. </li></ul><p>  In addition to these characteristics, it is definitely worth noting the presence of magnetic shielding.  This is certainly a plus, since the satellites will be much less likely to pick up various signals and interference. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sven sps 611s side view" class="if uuid-2347563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2347563.jpg"></div><p>  As for the satellites.  At the top of the speakers is a small tweeter, and a larger one at the bottom is a woofer.  This arrangement is standard, however, based on the size of the satellites, then, most likely, the high-frequency range and the middle will not sound too expressive.  In general, tests will show. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  Finally, the most important part of the review is the sound quality.  Connecting speakers is extremely simple, so describing this process does not make sense.  The overall sound quality experience is positive.  The Sven SPS-611S speaker system seamlessly plays various electronic and dance music.  The bass sounds confident, although not fully worked out.  Mid frequencies are slightly shifted, with high everything is in order. </p><p>  When listening to classical music and rock, there is a slight deterioration in sound quality.  High frequencies more clearly prevail over the bottoms.  In principle, there is nothing particularly critical, and most users will most likely not notice anything like this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sven sps 611s sound" class="if uuid-2347565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2347565.jpg"></div><p>  It is also worth noting the controls that are located on the rear right column.  If you play with them, then it is quite possible to achieve the highest quality sound level. </p><p>  There are no complaints about the volume margin.  It is enough with a head and even more.  The only thing to remember is that when you increase the volume level, the sound quality drops significantly.  All frequencies begin to ‚Äúmix‚Äù as if, together forming an incomprehensible ‚Äúmess‚Äù. </p><h2>  Reviews and cost </h2><p>  Reviews about the Sven SPS-611S speakers are in most cases positive, although there were some minuses as well.  Mostly users complain about not quite perfect shielding.  Often, especially if the phone is near the speakers, an extraneous signal and interference begin to break through them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="sven sps 611s side view" class="if uuid-2347564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2347564.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, users note too much noise from the transformer, which is heard in silence.  Another drawback is that after several years of use, many noise and crackles begin to appear in many columns.  It is also worth noting that defective copies often come across. </p><p>  Otherwise, no one has more complaints, and most of the reviews are positive. </p><p>  As for the cost, at the moment the Sven SPS-611S speakers can be bought at a price of 1900 to 2300 rubles, which is not so much as for a good and powerful speaker system. </p>
