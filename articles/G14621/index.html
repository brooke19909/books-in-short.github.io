  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Communicative Speech Qualities</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The communicative qualities of speech are the real properties of its formal and substantive aspects.  Among the properties distinguish accuracy, purity, correctness, consistency, expressiveness.  The main qualities of speech also include expediency and wealth. </p><p>  All these characteristics are identified on the basis of the ratio of various language structures. </p><p>  So, for example, the <span>richness of speech</span> arises on the basis of the correlation of <span>language and speech.</span>  This characteristic (wealth) is expressed in the maximum possible saturation with various non-repeating <span>linguistic means</span> to the extent necessary for the realization of conversational intent. </p><p>  Lexical wealth is manifested by the desire to use as rarely as possible words that do not carry a special communicative <span>intention.</span>  <span>This is</span> achieved if the writer or speaker has a large vocabulary. </p><p>  Lexical richness is a reflection and informative richness of the message. </p><p>  The concept of ‚Äúcommunicative quality of speech‚Äù also includes such a property as logic.  This characteristic is associated with the syntactic organization of both the text and the utterance.  <span>The logic of speech</span> is formed on the basis of the speech relationship with thinking.  When evaluating this property, it is important to see and hear the emerging whole in the process of combining words.  Moreover, the assessment of this whole is carried out within the entire text, and not just one statement.  Logic in speech is present in the absence of semantic inconsistency in the whole text. </p><p>  Another property that is of great importance in communication is correctness.  It is formed on the basis of the ratio of speech and language.  This characteristic reflects the correspondence of the linguistic structure to the norms of stress, pronunciation, vocabulary, word formation, morphology, stylistics and syntax. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The communicative qualities of speech include such a thing as accuracy arising on the basis of the speech relationship with reality.  Accuracy in communication can be both conceptual and substantive.  In the first case, we are talking about the presence in the text of the speaker of terms (concepts).  Objective accuracy takes place when designating objects of real reality in a conversation. </p><p>  Communicative qualities of speech suggest the presence of such a property as relevance.  This property is necessary when creating a message that meets the conditions and goals of communication.  The relevance of speech is formed on the basis of the ratio of speech and communication conditions.  This property (relevance) corresponds to the emotional and logical content, subject of the message, the composition of readers or listeners, as well as the aesthetic, educational, informational and other tasks of written or oral presentation.  Relevance is divided into personality-psychological, situational, contextual and stylistic. </p><p>  Communicative qualities of speech include such a characteristic as expediency.  By this concept is meant the relationship of the message with the situation in which the intentions of the speaker are realized, taking into account the characteristics of the addressee, circumstances and subject of the message. </p><p>  Such a quality of speech as purity arises on the basis of the ratio of speech and language.  The characteristic is applied to a text that does not have literary elements, phrases and words that are alien to the language.  The means that can violate the purity of speech include barbarism, dialectism, vulgarism, jargon, swear words and words.  To this list also include parasitic words.  Independently these means (parasitic words) do not cause any judgment, however their frequent, intrusive repetition makes them not related to the fulfillment of communication tasks. </p>
