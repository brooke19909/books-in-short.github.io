The Republic of Khakassia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Republic of Khakassia is a small part of great Russia.  This region is in the list of the best Russian resorts.  The Republic was officially founded in 1992, and before that this territory was considered a separate independent state.  But no matter what regional status Khakassia would have, it has always been famous for its breathtaking landscapes.  After all, only here you can find stones that resemble old tombstones, picturesque rocks and trees that look like Japanese plants.  Khakassia is a region that cannot boast of abundance and diversity of flora, which is why you rarely come across tall grasses or trees.  But in the Republic there are many different attractions, which we will talk about. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khakassia attractions" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/685296.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Worship the sun </h2><p>  <span>Khakassia,</span> whose <span>sights</span> are mostly <span>natural monuments, is</span> known for the fact that on its territory there is the "Mountain of the Sun", or Mount Kunya.  <span>This object</span> is located near the village of Ust-Abakan.  Mount Kunya is a mysterious and ancient natural phenomenon, which is a sacred relic for Khakasses.  This is a cult rock, near which the rites of worship of <span>the sun god were</span> performed <span>.</span>  Such ceremonies were held at the observation deck on the top of Cooney.  The old fortress was also located there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On top of the "mountain of the Sun" opens a bewitching panorama of the Yenisei Valley.  The height of Kunya exceeds 400 meters and is a large fortress of natural origin.  Even in the Bronze Age, the population used it as a shelter from enemy attacks.  A map of Khakassia with sights will demonstrate that the fortification stretches along the ridge, which separates the gently sloping mountain slopes from the inside of the object.  There, in glens, there was an opportunity to hide not only for women with children, but also for domestic animals.  Men, however, could well defend the walls from enemy armies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Republic of Khakassia" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/685295.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  Lake shira </h2><p>  Shira (Khakassia) is a famous healing lake in the Republic.  It is located in the steppe zone of this region.  Mankind knew about the properties of a reservoir more than a century ago.  About this miraculous power is told in various legends and tales.  So, the <span>first person to</span> pay attention to the healing functions of the lake waters was Zibulsky Z. M. - a gold merchant from Tomsk.  She was an energetic and business person.  But once he hunted in this area with his dog and accidentally wounded his faithful companion.  The wound was very serious, but because the upset merchant left the dog to die on one of the shores of the Shira. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But, most likely, the dog somehow was able to swim in the pond.  She did this more than once, recovered and returned to her hometown.  The gold miner was very interested in such a turn of events, especially since he was harassed by chronic sciatica.  So, in 1874 he organized a yurt on the Shire, bathed in the lake every day and was able to defeat the disease.  And in February 1891, the resort began to be equipped here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="map of Khakassia with landmarks" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/685294.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Pandora's box</span> from Russia </h2><p>  Khakassia, the sights of which are described above, is not for nothing called a miracle edge.  Proof of this fact is the presence in the region of another amazing object - a cave, which bears the name Pandora's Box.  For a long period, it was called Broad, and it was just one of the small caves in the canyon named Stone Sack.  At that time it was only a grotto two meters high and almost ten meters wide.  But at the very beginning of the 80s of the last century, cavers dug up about 25 meters of the entrance and discovered the main (second) part of the cave.  She was called the Pandora's Box.  The opening length reaches 11 meters. </p><p>  There are suggestions that once the cave served as a temple or a cache of <span>ancient people.</span>  The skulls of primitive persons were found there, the stalagmite ‚Äúgrew‚Äù right from the prehistoric bonfire.  Also in some areas there is a well-preserved cave painting. </p><h2>  Stone deity </h2>

    <p>  Khakassia, the sights of which we describe, boasts another very interesting object - it is Ulug Khurtuyakh Tas.  This is the embodiment of a deity of stone in the form of a stele three meters high.  The sculpture appeared here about four to six millennia ago.  It was formed in the place where the geological fault occurred as a result of the strongest energy radiation.  Scientists suggest that it has a radioactive, magnetic or electrical nature.  But none of these hypotheses has confirmation, and therefore the mystery is not solved today. </p><h2>  Museum </h2><p>  The Casanivka Museum is another object in Khakassia that deserves the attention of tourists.  The reserve combines different types of cultural and natural heritage: the abundance of the archaeological foundation, examples of Khakass folk life and landscapes.  The nature of ‚ÄúKazanovka‚Äù is an amazing landscape that captivates you from the first minutes of your stay on the territory. </p><p>  Khakassia (attractions described above) does not cease to amaze the attention of those who come here for the first time, and experienced travelers who have repeatedly crossed the borders of the Republic. </p>
