    <p>  However, the need to pay for the good intentions of the authorities with their own finances makes us delve into the intricacies of the innovation in detail, and also look for the answer to the question: if you do not pay for the overhaul, what will happen?  For some, it seems rhetorical, for others - an occasion to think about the possible consequences after making such a decision. </p><h2>  How much will it cost? </h2><p>  Inaccurate data on tariffs for new utility payments is not uncommon.  The same can be said for capital repair payments.  The average tariffs at which it is established how much to pay for the overhaul vary from 5 to 15 rubles.  per sq.  m. That is, the regions independently determine the size of contributions based on the condition in which the local housing stock is located.  The highest rates were noted back in 2014, when the numbers were 20-50 rubles.  At the moment, experts still note the possibility of using modern technologies and materials, as well as the likelihood of an increase in overhaul periods. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Presumably, these factors, even in the most neglected entities, will not allow raising the minimum reasonable price above 20 rubles.  per sq.  m. But the unpleasant moments in this part include the fact that many citizens have already faced a high commission when paying by mail and through savings banks.  On average, it is 30-50 rubles. </p><h2>  Who should pay? </h2><p>  According to the law, the owners of apartment buildings must pay for capital repairs.  Now it‚Äôs worth figuring out whether all apartment owners need to pay for overhaul?  According to the authors of the law, the poor should not suffer.  In this regard, the benefits for overhaul payments will be received by the same citizens who currently have them for all <span>utility bills.</span> </p><p>  In other words, <span>labor</span> and WWII <span>veterans</span> , as well as a number of citizens who are included in social support programs, are not among those who have to pay for overhaul and related services.  The payment of benefits will be carried out according to the old scheme: in the event that the cost of paying for real estate is exceeded after capital repairs are turned on by 10%, the family will receive the right to subsidies. </p><h2>  What is included in overhaul? </h2><p>  In order to assess the appropriateness of contributions for the overhaul of houses, it is worthwhile to familiarize yourself with the list of works included in this communal service point.  It includes the following: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  repair of roofing and supporting structures; </li><li>  restoration and <span>restoration of facades</span> ; </li><li>  basement repair work; </li><li>  cleaning the foundations; </li><li>  updating or repair of engineering systems (sewage, water supply); </li><li>  replacement or installation of elevators. </li></ul>

    <p>  Also, in some regions it is planned to audit smoke removal and fire extinguishing systems, carry out technical <span>measures for energy conservation</span> , etc. But these are still isolated cases, since the cost of overhaul against the background of its expansion is significantly increasing.  One way or another, the described works make us consider the question in a new way: if you do not pay for the overhaul, what will happen?  In this context, we mean what will happen to the house, because it was the number of emergency and urgently needed repair of apartment buildings that motivated the authorities to take such drastic measures. </p><h2>  Warranty </h2><p>  There are quite a few people who positively consider housing overhaul.  To pay or not - for them such a question is not worth it, but at the same time there should be guarantees.  In any case, many want to be sure that the money is not stolen, but will be used in accordance with its intended purpose.  Regional operators will take responsibility for this.  Departments are being formed in their departments, the tasks of which include overhauling the funds received in the regional funds according to the plan.  All apartment buildings are included in special lists with registries, access to which will be provided to any payer.  Thus, it is possible to track the expense of funds and the implementation of repairs for each object. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Arguments against Contributions </h2>

    <p>  Claims to the amendment from the day of its adoption come not only from ordinary citizens, but also from experts.  In particular, the appropriateness of the innovations is called into question for the reason that the apartment owners do not have common property in the property.  It is this aspect that justifies the very formulation of the question: to pay for the overhaul of housing or not?  The fact is that the municipality transfers only a certain area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe house, but the <span>stairwell,</span> attic, roofing, utilities and basement are not owned by a particular tenant.  A typical example illustrating the injustice of this approach is the obligation of owners of apartments on the ground floor to invest in replacing the elevator. </p><p>  In addition to everything, the dates are unknown when the planned plan will be implemented to improve the state of the housing stock.  For this reason, many owners deliberately refused to pay for the overhaul, since at the time of its implementation they would completely change their place of residence.  For reference: in some regions, the implementation of repairs is stretched for decades - and this is only according to the documents. </p><h2>  If not to pay? </h2><p>  It is difficult to predict what the practical consequences will be for those who refuse such cooperation with the municipality.  In theory, the owner of the apartment has the right not to pay in full all the columns in the communal receipt.  Nevertheless, the question remains: if you do not pay for the overhaul, what will happen?  The capital repair funds note that people who have debts under this item will receive notifications.  After this, as with other utilities, a trial should be expected.  In accordance with the law, interest will also be added to the amount owed each month.  However, from the moment a house is listed on the list of capital repairs, its owners have the right to independently determine the format of the collection of money in the ‚Äúrepair fund‚Äù. </p><p>  There is also the appearance of rumors about the abolition of monthly compensations for citizens who are in the category of socially protected.  This is especially true for retirees.  That is, if the owner of this group does not pay for the overhaul, then the benefit in the form of the EBC is canceled for him.  In fact, such a measure has no reason, since monetary compensation does not apply to overhaul. </p><h2>  How not to pay legally? </h2><p>  The most rational deliverance from new obligations may be one of the options proposed by the authorities: the use of rental savings from the delivery of non-residential premises in the house and the independent implementation of repairs at the expense of residents.  Of course, in this case, one cannot avoid collecting money, which will also be overhauled.  To pay or not to pay on receipt - such a question will disappear and will be transferred to the responsibility of the meeting of homeowners. </p><h2>  Overhaul at the expense of the house </h2>

    <p>  This option, as an alternative, is convenient for those who do not want to pay utility companies and plan to carry out repairs on their own.  The scheme is quite understandable and worked out in other areas of public utilities: the owners at the general meeting decide to open an account at home, from which funding for maintenance activities will occur.  In this case, a legal suspension of payments is allowed and it is not necessary to pay for the overhaul of regional funds.  However, it is important to consider that the amount on the house‚Äôs account must correspond to the minimum established by the regional authorities for the overhaul.  That is, self-collected money should correspond to the size of the total payments relative to a particular house. </p><h2>  Rental and advertising finance </h2><p>  Almost every apartment building has non-residential premises.  Since the mandatory payment of contributions for overhaul assumes that all the property of the building is in the possession of the residents, then they can dispose of it at their discretion.  So, for example, due to rental income, you can make up for the cost of overhaul.  To pay or not to pay - in this case such a question does not arise.  Moreover, the owner of the apartment may not invest a penny at all from his own pocket. </p><p>  But again, the main thing is that the amount from the lease of non-residential premises is enough to cover the cost of repairs.  In addition to this method, the possibility of providing a facade as an advertising platform can be noted.  By the way, the new law may become an occasion to check how this financial potential is used in the house.  The most active members of the local government often receive income from rented premises.  Perhaps you should redirect them to a direct improvement in the condition of the house? </p><h2>  Emergency homes - do I have to pay? </h2>

    <p>  At the moment, this is the most pressing issue that affects not only the overhaul program, but also the procedures for the resettlement of residents.  The law clearly spells out whether it is necessary to pay for overhaul in emergency housing - no, until it is excluded from the program.  Nevertheless, in many regions there are cases when owners of apartments in non-repairable houses complain about receipts with clauses about payment for <span>major repairs.</span>  <span>A building</span> recognized as an emergency should be excluded from the list of facilities for the restoration of which funds are being raised. </p><p>  Such inconsistencies arise from other problems.  In this case, these are delays with resettlement.  People complain that while they are standing in line, they have to pay the cost of maintaining a house that is unsuitable for living.  In this regard, the question is interesting: if you do not pay for the overhaul, what will happen in the case of housing that has received emergency status?  The authorities indicate that all the funds raised for such houses will be spent on their demolition and the implementation of the resettlement program. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you know, many laws at the first stages of implementation reveal significant shortcomings and are adjusted in accordance with them.  Most likely, this is also awaiting the mandatory overhaul of houses, since its flaws respond very noticeably to the financial well-being of citizens.  It is also important to note the alternative opportunities that were left to people who wanted to tidy their homes on their own.  True, in such cases, it will not be possible to avoid the hassle of organizing a major overhaul.  Indeed, in addition to the general collection of money from the owners, it is necessary to seek and hire a contractor. </p>

    <p>  One way or another, today in Russia, millions of homes need repairs.  To take responsibility for the maintenance of the house in their own hands or to entrust it to the state - each house management decides privately.  But one thing is clear: the overhaul costs are borne by the citizens themselves, and this is perhaps the main drawback of the new amendment. </p>
