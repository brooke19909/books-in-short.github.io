It develops thinking, imagination, hand motility, independence.  The child in the manufacturing process learns the surrounding nature, distinguishing the fruits of not only fruit, deciduous, but also conifers.  To complete each crafts, including birds from cones, you must go to the park in advance and collect the necessary material, think over what may come in handy. </p><p>  In the park you can collect cones of Christmas trees and pines, acorns and <span>maple seeds,</span> nuts and chestnuts, acacia seeds for small details.  You can also use autumn leaves, twigs, needles of pine or spruce.  Anything can come in handy.  But in addition to <span>natural material,</span> you need something else to fasten the parts together.  So you need to have clay or glue.  In this article we will discuss how to make a bird out of cones.  Consider a few simple manufacturing options, explain in detail how to make them better, what materials to use. </p><h2>  Owl </h2><p>  One of the birds most loved by children is an owl.  She has a very characteristic appearance with large round eyes.  Children in her class and sculpt, and draw, and of course, do crafts.  In the photograph, this bird made of cones using felt sheets.  It is often used in various crafts.  This material is soft, bright, glues well, it can be sewn with threads.

    <p>  In order to make an owl, you need to take a large clean pine cone.  Separately, cut two identical wings from brown felt.  For the beak you will need a red or orange leaf.  The shape of the beak is triangular.  Eyes are made up of several layers of material.  Two large circles of blue color are cut according to the pattern, and around the circumference the child must cut the edges to get a fringe.  Then the eyes will be more voluminous. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then two identical circles of beige or light brown are cut.  To make our owl the same eyes as in the photo, you will need to buy the necessary parts in the hardware store.  It is quite possible to replace them with white and black pieces of felt. </p><p>  It remains to collect all the individual parts together.  To do this, you need to take glue with strong fixation.  The felt is light and fleecy, so it glues well, there should be no problems.  You can also cut out the legs from the brown sheet, which are glued from the bottom of the cone. </p><h2>  Fluffy chickens </h2><p>  Such birds of cones are painted with yellow gouache paint.  The scales are carefully coated on top and bottom.  The beak and paws for chickens can also be made from a sheet of thin felt, or you can simply cut it out of two-sided thick paper for the printer.  And to mold a head from plasticine, salt dough or buy <span>foam balls</span> or beads in a store.  They can be found in specialized departments for manual labor, sewing accessories or stationery. </p>

    <p>  The foam head must be painted in the same color as the feathers.  After all, chickens are not only yellow, they can be black or motley.  You can make a <span>chicken</span> brood <span>multicolored.</span>  Glue eyes ready-made or blind from plasticine.  You can also create them combined.  For example, proteins are made from plasticine, and black pupils can be made from acacia seeds by simply sticking them into plasticine balls. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To keep the head well on the top of the bump, it can be attached in two ways.  Firstly, you can push the hole in the ball with an awl or a pointed stick and just pull it on the top flake.  Secondly, you can cut off the top of the pine cone and stick the head into the resulting hollow. </p><h2>  Crossbill </h2><p>  This is the most suitable bird for crafts from such a natural material.  Indeed, in nature, crossbill, or in another way - shishkar, lives in coniferous forest and feeds on seeds that are in cones.  He has a special beak in the shape of nippers.  Only in this way can he get cedar seeds or nuts out from under hard scales. </p><p>  They make such birds from <span>fir cones.</span>  You need to choose the longest, wet it with water and bend in half, but carefully so as not to break.  The ends are tied with a rope and put in a warm place so that the lump is dry.  When she is completely ready for work, she became dry, she is untied.  The deformed spruce cone will retain its bent shape, which we needed to complete this craft. </p>

    <p>  In order to finish a bird from cones, you need to find a long brown feather of a chicken or another bird, wash it, dry it and bend it a bit to make a semicircle.  Glue it from the sharp end.  On the other hand, crafts make a head.  For the beak, you can use a piece of bark or twigs.  Eyes - black small pieces of plasticine or beads.  You can plant such a craft on a Christmas tree. </p><h2>  Sparrows </h2><p>  Such beautiful birds from cones (crafts for the New Year's exhibition) are made from pine fruits and foam balls according to the same principle as the chickens described earlier.  The beak for sparrows can be made from sunflower seeds by sticking them deep into the foam.  From the wire or twigs, make paws and, piercing the scales of the cone, firmly insert them into the bodies of the birds. </p>

    <p>  Sparrows are covered with spray paint.  The wings and tail are cut out of cardboard and inserted between the scales.  They can be fixed with PVA glue or ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù. </p><h2>  Peacock </h2><p>  Such a bird is made of cones and leaves.  You can take thin leaves of willow or ash or cut carved analogues from colored thick paper, as in the photo of the peacock below.  The pine cone is placed horizontally, in length.  On the place where it is attached to the twig, natural or paper leaves are glued.  This is the open magnificent tail of a male peacock.  You can make it bright, colorful, or you can glue the same geometric applique on paper feathers, decorating them with circles and rhombs. </p>

    <p>  The head and beak are cut out of a thin felt sheet and glued to the scales.  You can make a stand out of plasticine so that the cone does not fall and does not roll sideways. </p><h2>  Turkey </h2><p>  When you look at a live turkey, you understand that such a bird needs to be made only from a pine cone.  Its body is round in shape, and the feathers sticking out in different directions are very reminiscent of scales.  You can do this craft from various additional materials.  Bright tail feathers made of paper, leaves or threads can be glued to the back.  Since the turkey has a <span>long neck,</span> the image of the head is aligned on the contour with it. </p>

    <p>  It turns out the shape of a figure eight.  From above we glue the eyes and the beak, which is made of a rhombus folded in half.  It is attached with a thin central strip at the bend.  Then his view is voluminous.  The red beard inherent in the appearance of this bird is also made of thick threads, just by putting a small length on the glue. </p><h2>  Voronyata </h2><p>  Such cute little crafts make it very easy to do.  The pine cone must be turned with the sharp part down.  Tops of felt balls are attached.  These are round big eyes.  Their beak is long and sharp.  After all, nevertheless, crows are predators.  Feet can be knitted from fluffy acrylic threads or mohair.  They are glued on the narrow side of the cone. </p>

    <p>  You can also make wings from leaflets.  They crow small, sticking out to the sides, since they still do not know how to fly. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In the article we told in detail how to make a bird out of fir and pine cones.  What options exist, what can be used when working as additional materials, how to fix parts.  The rest depends on your desire, imagination and inspiration! </p>
