  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crafts for giving with your own hands made of wood</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Wood is a unique material from which you can make many crafts and ornaments.  For many years, the tree has not ceased to delight with its variety of colors and textures.  In addition to tactile sensations, this material retains its divine aroma in products.  Apparently, for these reasons, the tree is highly regarded among creative people.  In the country, wood is probably the most widely distributed and used. </p><p>  So, making <span>wooden crafts</span> for the garden with your own hands will not be difficult.  For example, you can easily make an outdoor flower pot.  To do this, you will need a stump of the right size and height, a drill, drills, a chisel, a hammer, sandpaper and varnish.  First, we mark on the hemp the places of future holes.  After that, we drill the indicated holes, and combine them with a drill.  It is also necessary to do not only around the circumference, but also in the center of the workpiece.  Next, with the help of a chisel and a hammer, it is necessary to remove the core of the stump.  When this is done, take sandpaper and grind the edges and insides of our hemp.  In the end, of course, several times we coat the entire wooden pot with varnish.  That's it, the work is over, it's time to plant flowers. </p><p>  <span>Crafts for giving</span> with your own hands are not limited to only wooden pots.  From a suitable branch, consisting of a handle and three branches, it is quite possible to build a flower stand.  To do this, you just need to nail a circle of plywood of the desired diameter to the handle, clean the entire stand with sandpaper and cover with two layers of varnish. </p><p>  Those craftsmen who are more experienced in handling and working with wood can easily make such crafts for giving their own hands from wood, as figures of various fairy-tale or cartoon characters.  Children who come with their family to the country will be delighted with such crafts. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One cannot but mention the beauty and practicality of the wooden arbor.  Professionals who can afford to take up such work will immortalize their work and skill for many years.  One has only to imagine how the whole family gathers at a table in a wooden carved arbor on a quiet summer evening.  This place will serve not only for family vacations, but also an occasion to gather a large and noisy company of friends. </p><p>  If a <span>wooden arbor is</span> within the power of the owner, then a shower for giving with your own hands can not be a problem at all.  Such construction will take much less time and effort.  Each summer resident in his own experience knows how to refresh and tone the summer shower, how cool water gives strength to a tired body.  You cannot do without a shower in a summer cottage, even if there is a pond nearby.  Therefore, we immediately begin construction. </p><p>  So, you should start by installing load-bearing wooden poles at a distance of no more than one meter from each other.  We also nail wooden planks to the posts in a horizontal position.  Further, the walls on both sides must be decorated with wood paneling.  They should not be painted with varnish or paint, since the tree should ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù.  Do not forget, of course, to make a small window in the shower, as well as hang the door on the hinges.  As for the wooden floor, it needs to be laid on horizontal bars at a distance of about 10-15 cm from the ground.  When the water tank is installed and fixed, a shower can be used.  As you can see, building a summer shower turned out to be a very simple and interesting activity. </p><p>  It is as easy to build a toilet in the country with your own hands as a shower.  First, you need to dig a deep hole, after which we build the same wooden ‚Äúbox‚Äù from the wooden bars as for the shower.  We process it and remove all the flaws.  Secondly, from wooden materials and plywood we make a toilet seat, after which we install it.  The walls inside are sheathed as desired with any material you like.  We pay special attention to the roof, it can be made of slate or galvanized iron.  Everything, the toilet is ready! </p><p>  I can‚Äôt believe that you mastered such crafts for giving with your own hands?  In vain!  After all, now you are ready for new victories in country creativity. </p>
