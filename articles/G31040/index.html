    <h2>  The history of Scythian civilization </h2><p>  Basically, the ideas of modern historians about the ancient civilization of the Scythians are gleaned from written records made by the Greeks - Strabo, Herodotus, Pliny the Elder and others.  Information is also provided by utensils, military affairs, art found in excavations, as well as Scythian gold, which is so much talked about now. </p><p>  According to historical data, these tribes in the VII-II centuries BC occupied the territory of Eastern Europe.  There are two theories of the origin of Scythian civilization.  According to one of them, these tribes were formed from the population that used to live in these territories.  The second theory belongs to the historian Herodotus.  It consists in the fact that the Scythians came to these steppes from Asian lands.  Their language (according to the few data that have been found) belongs to the group of the Iranian Indo-European family. </p><p>  The early stage of Scythian civilization is marked by large military campaigns, which reached almost to Egypt.  This was around the 7th century BC.  In the last decades of this century, the Scythians have already settled on the <span>Crimean peninsula</span> (archaeological finds confirm this). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Already in the 7th-5th centuries BC, a change in the activities of the tribes was characteristic here, namely the transition to nomadic cattle breeding.  If we talk about the further residence of the Scythians on the territory of the peninsula, then we can say about several wars that were fought here.  They can be judged by the extensive burials (mounds) of soldiers. </p><p>  In the fourth century <span>BC, the</span> Scythians ended their nomadic life and switched to agriculture.  This happened due to the increase in population, which contributed little to a large movement. </p><p>  In the III century BC, the Scythians were completely destroyed.  Judging by the charred remains, a foreign invasion completely burned down their settlements.  Only the cities of the Greeks remained, which were protected by sound walls. </p><p>  However, it cannot be said that their entire heritage has sunk into oblivion.  The Nart epic is a heritage of the Scythian culture.  It went to the <span>peoples of the North Caucasus,</span> most of all to Ossetians. </p><h2>  Crafts of Scythian civilization </h2><p>  If we talk about the crafts of the Scythian civilization, many are of the opinion that in the early stages of its development they were at a fairly primitive level, especially among the nomadic peoples.  Many archaeologists are inclined to believe that most of the products of this time were made to order from Greek masters or simply bought from them. </p><p>  Only later, when the tribes began to lead a more or less settled life, they began to improve their skills, create new ones.  Of course, the basis of some products became Greek, but later on they developed their own style of work. </p><p>  So what did the ancient Scythians do?  According to the excavations of the workshops (for example, in the Kamensky settlement), it can be judged that they had well-developed metallurgy, blacksmithing, as well as jewelry.  These crafts were put into large production.  In contrast, weaving, pottery and others were developed at the level of home production. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If we talk about the jewelry business of the Scythians, now it is believed that in the territory of modern Ukraine it was they who began to extract gold for the first time.  Obviously, this is what subsequently had a great influence on the fact that this metal was very popular and revered in their culture.  Masters made various decorations that were worn on various <span>parts of the body,</span> as well as sewn onto clothes. </p><p>  Today, the gold of the Scythians (photos of some artifacts are presented below) is a unique archaeological find of this civilization, the most numerous of their heritage. </p>

    <h2>  Golden artifacts of antiquity.  Their meaning </h2><p>  Studying the finds related to the ancient Scythians, it can be noted that some gold items bore not only the function of decoration, but also ritual significance.  For the latter, various special golden vessels were used, of the jewelry they were tiaras, hats.  Numerous additional decorations for ritual objects were also made (for example, knobs for ritual staves). </p><p>  Scythian gold was also used as a decoration.  For example, gold plaques that were sewn onto clothes to decorate them were popular.  Metal hoops (hryvnias) that were worn around the neck were also common for men.  At the ends they were decorated with animals.  Pectorals, which were large necklaces that descended on the shoulders and chest, were also popular. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For women, special hats were created, which were decorated with plaques and gold plates.  Also often found pendants that were placed on the temples, and a variety of bracelets, rings, earrings, etc. </p><h2>  Gold artifacts that have survived to this day </h2><p>  To date, gold found by archaeologists in the preserved barrows is in numerous museums.  The collections are represented by various finds that truly have no price (both in historical value and in monetary value).  Each gold product reflects the lifestyle that was inherent in this ancient civilization. </p><p>  For example, one of the most famous artifacts found in the barrows of the Scythians is the golden pectoral.  This is a royal decoration.  It is considered a rather interesting artifact from the Scythian Gold series.  The museum in Kiev stores it.  Pectoral was found in the Dnepropetrovsk region, in the mound Tolstaya Grave. </p><p>  The Hermitage also houses a rather famous figure from the heritage of the Scythians - the figure of a deer made of gold.  She was found in the Kuban region, in one of the mounds. </p>

    <h2>  Symbolism on Scythian Gold Items </h2><p>  What can be said about the symbols that were depicted on the products of ancient Scythians?  The so-called animal style was very popular in their culture.  His appearance on their legacy, which is now the gold of the Scythians (photo is presented below), has several versions. </p><p>  For example, according to one of them, such images showed the structure of the universe and were its symbolic image.  True, this version has not yet been studied. </p><p>  Also, some researchers are of the opinion that this style appeared as a result of the fact that the Scythians wanted to give the owner of the product the qualities that were inherent in a particular beast. </p><p>  But many found signs that these ancient gods embodied their gods in the images of such animals.  One way or another, this style was very popular among the Scythians. </p><p>  Even now, his echoes are preserved in the multitude of cultures that lived after the Scythian civilization.  They can be found in various artistic crafts, in the decoration of clothes (ornaments, embroidery).  For example, the image of a woman with riders standing on either side is very common.  There is a similar figurine in the culture of the Scythians, which was found in the Karagodeuashkh mound.  This is a plate that depicts a female deity surrounded by horsemen and standing people. </p>

    <h2>  Territories where traces of the Scythian civilization were found </h2><p>  Based on the fact that the Scythians were originally nomadic people, their traces were found in various territories.  For example, in Tuva, the royal mound Arzhan was found, which belongs to this ancient culture.  However, the age of this burial is very large, much larger than those that were found in the Black Sea and Dnieper.  After a while, the second burial place was immediately found - Arzhan-2.  It was in it that the gold of the Scythians was found by archaeologists.  Since the burial was excavated, accompanying objects were found that were put in the grave of the dead (rich clothing, utensils, weapons). </p><p>  Traces of this civilization were also found in East Kazakhstan, in Altai, near the Yenisei.  All this suggests that it was initially more extensive than previously thought about it.  By the way, it is still unknown where archaeological finds will be found in the future. </p><p>  Today, Scythian gold, whose collection is numerous, is in many museums in different countries. </p>

    <h2>  Legends of Scythian Gold </h2><p>  This legacy of ancient civilization, like any archaeological value, has its own legends.  The Scythians generally treated this metal with trepidation.  He was the personification of the solar deity, as well as a symbol of royal power.  It is noteworthy that the remaining metals were used in their civilization much less frequently. </p><p>  Scythians also believed that it was gold that possesses magical properties.  Some researchers of our time find them in especially significant jewelry worn by the kings of those times.  This is how the object was made, what it was used for, what was depicted on it. </p><p>  There is also a legend about the origin of this people, and Scythian gold is already mentioned there.  It speaks of a man named Targitai, who had three sons.  Somehow they witnessed a miracle - in front of them four golden objects fell from heaven.  It was a bowl, an ax, a plow and a yoke.  Each of the brothers tried to get closer to the gold items, but each time the gold was ignited and kept out.  Only the third managed to do this.  Then the two older brothers accepted this sign, and the youngest got the whole kingdom. </p><p>  Thus, he subsequently became the ancestor of the Scythian people, who were called the Paralats.  The elder brother is the founder of the Avkhats, and the middle one is the Cathars and Trapians.  The common name of their genus is chipped.  The Greeks began to call them Scythians. </p><p>  This legend was recorded by the Greek scholar Herodotus.  He, by the way, at that time was recording numerous historical events.  Our contemporaries learned a lot of information from his notes. </p><p>  Scythian mounds are also shrouded in mystery.  Many archaeologists believe that those people who are fortunate enough to find something are doomed.  So, for example, Vasily Bidzila, a scientist who found a bowl in the Gaimanova‚Äôs grave in the Barrow, passed away.  Boris Mozolevsky also died.  He was lucky to find a golden pectoral.  Of course, not all of this is associated with finds, but many adhere to just such a version.  It is believed that the Scythian mounds in this are similar to the Egyptian pyramids. </p><p>  Of course, many are attracted not so much by the interest of a scientist, but simply by an elementary way of enrichment.  There are numerous legends about this golden people, about their countless treasures.  In Ukraine, almost every locality has its own legends.  For example, in the Zaporozhye region there is an opinion that in one of the Scythian barrows a golden boat was hidden. In the <span>Poltava region</span> , a whole horse made of this metal is said to be.  If you listen to legends in other places, then you can find gold products from diadem to whole carriages. </p><p>  Obviously, this is by no means accidental, because, again according to legend, the Scythian people were the most golden in these territories. </p>

    <h2>  Crimean gold of Scythians, as well as other items of their heritage </h2><p>  Many museums scattered gold of Scythians.  Crimea, as one of the main places of life of this people, also did not stand aside.  The museums of this peninsula have a rich collection of this ancient civilization (and not only gold items).  Here you can find gold jewelry, numerous jewelry that were worn by both the royal family and ordinary people (earrings, bracelets, breastplates, necklaces, rings, etc.). </p><p>  In addition, there are numerous objects that were used in everyday life, in wars (weapons, vessels, vases, objects of worship, etc.).  Such a large number of artifacts of this culture located on the peninsula is explained by the fact that these peoples lived here for a long time. </p><p>  Gold of the Scythians is very important for the peninsula.  Crimea is like a continuation of the nationality that once lived here.  One of the major discoveries was the Kul-Oba mound, which is located near Kerch.  In September 1830, a burial place was found there, which was the first clear example of what the ancient Scythians looked like, their decoration and scenes of life. </p><p>  The burial place of the tsarina and a noble warrior was found in the mound.  The deceased were fully dressed, and also decorated with various jewelry (diadem, bracelets, etc.).  The burial was not yet plundered, therefore, made a great impression with its wealth. </p><h2>  Scythian gold, which is stored in Kiev </h2><p>  The Museum of Historical Treasures, which is located in the city of Kiev, has a truly unique collection.  This includes the ancient gold of the Scythians.  Ukraine can really be proud of this collection.  Here are collected unique jewelry worn in ancient times by royal people. </p><p>  One of the most famous exhibits (as was already written above) is a pectoral belonging to the royal dynasty.  This unique treasure was found in the thick grave mound. </p><p>  Even in the museum you can find another noble decoration - the hryvnia.  It was worn by men who deserved it by their deeds or origin. </p><p>  The museum also holds the Gaiman cup, which was found in the Gayman grave mound.  It is noteworthy in that the author very carefully conveyed the faces and facial expressions of the warriors depicted on it.  The decoration as well as the ornament on the clothes are also very clearly visible. </p>

    <h2>  The last exhibition of the collection </h2><p>  The last exhibition was presented in Amsterdam in February 2014.  Scythian gold was taken from five museums: from one of Kiev, as well as four, which are located on the territory of the Crimean peninsula. </p><p>  The exhibition was called ‚ÄúCrimea: Gold and the Secrets of the Black Sea‚Äù.  She was held in the city of Amsterdam, in the museum.  Allard Pearson.  Unique things were presented at the exhibition: a pectoral from the Kiev museum, lacquered <span>Chinese caskets</span> from the Bakhchisarai reserve, etc. </p><p>  If one wonders where the Scythian gold is now, it can be said that it was returned to its homeland, but due to the difficult political situation this did not happen completely. </p><h2>  Today's situation around ancient Scythian artifacts </h2><p>  To date, the situation that affects the Crimean gold of the Scythians is very difficult, perhaps even a dead end.  That part of the collection, which after the end of the exhibition was supposed to return to the peninsula to museums, simply was not given away.  The gold of the Scythians, which was exported before the detachment of Crimea from Ukraine, simply does not know where to return, since both parties claim it. </p><p>  At the moment, there is a court that is deciding where the exhibits should be returned.  By the way, many of them are the property of the peninsula, as they were found on its territory.  Also in favor of returning it to Crimea is the fact that it is museums that are the custodians of rarities, and not the state itself. </p><p>  If we talk about the gold of the Scythians, which was returned after the exhibition, then this is only nineteen items.  They were taken out of the Kiev Museum, where they were stored.  The remaining 565 exhibits, which belong to the Crimean museums, were never returned. </p>
