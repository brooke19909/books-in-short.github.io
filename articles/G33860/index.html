  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Choose a microwave</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To quickly cook or reheat food, many housewives today use a microwave.  This functional household appliance at first served precisely for heating food and had only a few boiled dishes in its arsenal.  Now this list is replenished almost daily, and the imagination of the housewives does not dry out.  Those who for the first time want to become the owner of such a thing necessary in the household need to know a few subtleties. </p><h2>  What is hiding behind a glass door? </h2><p>  The first thing we see when we open the door is a common cooking chamber.  It happens of such types: </p><ul><li>  enameled - the most standard option, which is easy to care for; </li><li>  ceramic - a durable and smooth material that easily repels any dirt; </li><li>  stainless steel is the most durable and aesthetic coating, but it is difficult to keep clean; </li><li>  painted under enamel - used in very cheap models and is not recommended for dishes with a long cooking process. </li></ul><ul><li>  If you figured out the material for the camera, what to do with the volume?  Here the choice is even simpler: </li><li>  microwaves with a chamber volume of more than 28 liters are considered energy-consuming, therefore they are used for cooking in a large family or team. </li><li>  Volume from 20 to 28 liters - medium and most common.  Most popular manufacturers fulfill the lion's share of their products in this range of volumes. </li><li>  Small ovens with a chamber volume of up to 20 liters are suitable for making sandwiches or for baking a small portion of meat or poultry.  They are also rarely bought. </li></ul><p>  We reviewed most of the indicators, it remains to determine the power of the grill.  Here the principle is simple - the more, the faster the food will be prepared, and if the control of the microwave oven is mechanical, then adjusting to the lower side can always be done without problems.  At the same time, the price of a model with different grill power changes slightly so that it is better not to save on this necessary element. </p><p>  Choose the most suitable option today is not difficult.  On Sravni.com, which is a modern price comparison site, you can find many offers from various online stores.  Among the microwaves for sale ( <noindex>  <span>there are a lot of them</span> </noindex>  ), the characteristics of which are proposed next to each photograph of the microwave oven, you can determine the most suitable for its technical parameters and visual preferences.  And then it‚Äôs easy to navigate the current prices for the current day.  It is likely to find the cheapest option from among similar models.  In all cases, a microwave oven with a grill will be your good helper in the kitchen. </p></div></article>
