One of such ways is to arrange profitable deposits for ordinary citizens.  But which bank has the highest deposit?  Based on an analysis of the proposals of the largest financial institutions of the country at the beginning of 2019, a review of deposits in rubles is compiled, which differ in favorable interest rates.  Let's consider them further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flatworldsolutions.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="highest contributions" class="if uuid-3154239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3154239.jpg"></div><h2>  Deposits of individuals as a traditional way of investing money </h2><p>  There are quite a few options for investing finance in order to receive passive income.  You can buy currency and wait until it grows in value or earn money on Forex, invest in PAMM accounts, try to make a profit by trading binary options and more.  All of the above ways of earning a fairly high profit, but at the same time they involve certain risks.  Bank investments today are not the highest deposits, but remain the most reliable.  And at the same time, with traditional methods of investing finance in our country. </p><h2>  What do you pay attention to when choosing a profitable deposit? </h2><p>  When choosing a financial institution to trust money with, depositors usually turn their attention to at least two of the following parameters: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The size of interest rates, which makes it possible to choose a contribution with maximum profit. </li><li>  The reliability of a banking institution, which allows you to not worry about the safety of savings even during a crisis. </li></ol><p>  Combining high interest rates and the necessary reliability can be quite difficult. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deltoroloanservicing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="highest deposits in banks" class="if uuid-3154245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3154245.jpg"></div><h2>  The main types of deposits for individuals </h2><p>  Today, banks offer a large number of various profitable deposits for individuals.  In order to understand which deposits are the highest, you need to navigate the following groups of financial investments: </p><ol><li>  Urgent at the highest interest.  Opening such a deposit, the client gives the company his money for a certain period, and at this time he cannot take it back without losing a percentage.  Also, it will not be possible to replenish your account. </li><li>  <span>Refillable deposit.</span>  Opening such a deposit, depositors can save money, replenish the account, and along with this, interest also grows.  True, you cannot withdraw funds and not lose profit. </li><li>  Deposit with partial withdrawal of finances without interest loss.  Such deposits usually have the lowest rates.  But they provide an opportunity to take a share of the funds on a pre-agreed minimum balance, the amount of which will be calculated on interest. </li></ol><h2>  List of banks where you can get a profitable loan </h2><p>  So, the highest deposits in rubles, according to current conditions in the beginning of 2019, are offers from several financial institutions.  It refers to the following: Fora-Bank along with Sovcombank, East Bank, Mosnarbank, Russian Agricultural Bank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="magyartakarek.blog.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="highest interest on bank deposits" class="if uuid-3154240" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3154240.jpg"></div><h2>  The best deals in rubles and interest rates </h2><p>  Let us now consider in detail the interest rates of the above organizations.  It is worth noting that all these deposits are protected by the state in the amount of up to one million four hundred rubles.  Today, they are the most profitable for citizens. </p><h2>  888 deposit at Fora Bank </h2><p>  The highest deposit rate of 8.88% is granted for a period of up to 1095 five days.

The minimum amount is 650 thousand rubles, while replenishment is unfortunately impossible, and interest payments are usually made at the end of the term.

At the same time, the period is 1097 days.  And the minimum amount is ten thousand rubles.  When using the deposit in question, replenishment will be impossible, and interest is paid at the end of the term.  The cities where investments can be made are Moscow, along with St. Petersburg, Kaliningrad and the territory of the Leningrad Region. </p><h2>  Highest Deposits: ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù at Mosnarbank </h2><p>  This organization also provides an opportunity to invest at 8.1%.  The term of cooperation is 365, and the minimum amount is one hundred thousand rubles, replenishment will not be possible, and interest will be paid at the end of the term.  The city of presence enters only Moscow. </p><h2>  Russian Winter at Loko Bank </h2><p>  At this institution, the rate is 8.03%.  Moreover, it amounts to 7.7% from the first to 300 days and 9% from 301 to 400. Thus, the total period will be 400 days, and the minimum amount of fifty thousand rubles, replenishment for customers of this deposit is not possible, and interest is paid monthly.  Which is very convenient, because even a little financial assistance can significantly alleviate the situation.  This organization has a wide network throughout the country. </p><h2>  "Profitable" in Russian Agricultural Bank </h2><p>  This offer is most often mentioned in reviews of depositors who have already trusted or are just about to entrust their savings.  Customers note that this option is suitable even for "not quite prosperous people."  Why? </p><p>  The highest deposit at the bank provides a rate of 8%, and the deposit term is usually 1460 days.  At the same time, the minimum amount is only three thousand rubles and replenishment is impossible, interest payments are made at the end of the term or on a monthly basis.  This organization also has a wide network throughout our country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="which contributions are the most" class="if uuid-3154254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3154254.jpg"></div><h2>  Tauride Maximum at Tauride Bank </h2><p>  Another attractive offer.  As in the previous case, the interest rate on the highest deposit in this bank is 8%, and the term is 730 days.  The minimum amount is fifty thousand rubles, replenishment is not possible, and interest is paid at the end of the term.  The cities of presence are Moscow, along with Peter, Syktyvkar, Kingisepp, Sosnovy Bor and others. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúUrgent‚Äù at Credit Europe Bank </h2><p>  8% is granted for 1098 days.  The minimum amount is three thousand rubles, replenishment, unfortunately, is not possible, interest is paid at the end of the term.  This organization also has a wide network in Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dawrat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="highest deposits in rubles" class="if uuid-3154243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3154243.jpg"></div><h2>  Smart Deposit at Tinkoff Bank </h2><p>  The rate is 7.70% (under the terms of capitalization), the term is twelve months, and the minimum amount is fifty thousand rubles.  In the process of using the deposit, replenishment will be possible, monthly payments are provided.  The rate is indicated taking into account the 0.5% bonus.  The bank operates according to the system of an officeless model.  A representative shall bring all documents.  Money is deposited by wire transfer or through an ATM of Tinkoff Bank (the device accepts up to a million rubles with one bundle of notes). </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  It is worth emphasizing that today banks in various ways try to lure their customers and force them to make an investment.  In this regard, it is very important to carefully study the tariffs of a financial institution.  The fact is that quite often a poor organization with inflated conditions for replenishment can be hidden behind the highest deposits in banks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aspirefs.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="highest deposit rates" class="if uuid-3154246" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/3154246.jpg"></div><p>  Account opening gifts may also affect your effective bid.  No need to chase after them.  Very often people come to the bank, make a deposit and ask about where is their gift, and in return they receive the fact that the gifts have ended.  It is not recommended to open deposits in banks conducting the draws of apartments and cars among depositors.  They always do not have the highest deposit rates.  Citizens should be aware that they will not receive any prize, and the profitability will be much less.  Thus, gifts are just a marketing move, which makes it possible to attract customers and does not bring any profit for them. </p>
