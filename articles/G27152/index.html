    <h2>  Making pineapple from sweets.  Workshop with step by step photos </h2><p>  Next, let's talk about how to make pineapple from sweets and a <span>bottle of champagne.</span>  This original and very beautiful craft can be performed for any holiday.  It will be an excellent gift for both man and woman.  To make a sweet present you will need a bottle of <span>sparkling wine, a</span> yellow organza, a <span>glue gun, a</span> decorative ribbon (aspidistra leaf).  The last "ingredient" can be bought at any flower shop.  You will also need sweets (about 700 g).  We used delicious chocolates called Golden Lily.  They have a rounded shape, so convenient for work, and a bright golden wrap.  Pineapple from Golden Lily candies looks very beautiful and presentable.  Although you can pick up any other sweets, the main thing is that they be round. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  DIY technology </h2><p>  First, prepare the organza - cut it into small squares (6 cm * 6 cm).  Next, proceed to the preparation of sweets.  Gently bend the "tails" of the wrapper and glue them with a hot-melt gun.  The result is a neat rounded billet, without protruding "parts".  In our case, it took 75 candies to make a bottle of champagne look beautiful and elegant.  We continue to make pineapple from sweets as follows: apply glue to the candy tails, attach the sweetness to a piece of organza and immediately glue the candy to the bottle.  <span>You</span> need to <span>make champagne in</span> rows, moving from the bottom (from the bottom) up. </p>

At the first row of sweets, it is necessary to tuck the lower corners of the organza and fix them with a hot glue gun.  This is necessary so that the champagne is stable.  By analogy with the first, we draw up six more rows.

    <h2>  Making leaves for our pineapple </h2><p>  After the entire surface of the bottle is decorated with sweets, you can proceed to decorate the crafts.  In order to make leaves, take a decorative ribbon that simulates a leaf of an aspidistra.  If you cannot purchase it, use colored paper.  Cut from the tape a few wide leaves with pointed tips.  We make them of different sizes to make the pineapple look more natural.  Now glue the leaves to the bottle.  That's all, we got a chic candy pineapple!  The step-by-step photo presented in the article demonstrates the manufacturing technology of this magnificent craft.  If you wish, you can decorate your craft with sparkles, beads and any other decorative elements. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="champagne bottle pineapple made of sweets" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/374272.jpg?1397485209567" width="457"></div></h2><h2>  Making a great gift - pineapple from sweets - do it yourself </h2><p>  We suggest that you ‚Äúbeat‚Äù an ordinary glass bottle (with a capacity of 0.5 l) by filling it with chocolate candies.

    <h2>  Candy pineapple fruit: manufacturing technology </h2><p>  Now on the line of sweets: take them and one at a time attach to the bottle.  This operation is conveniently performed from the bottom up, gradually shaping the entire surface of the bottle.  It is advisable to glue the sweets in a checkerboard pattern, so your pineapple from sweets will look more realistic.  With our own hands, after decorating with sweets, we wrap the bottle with plastic roll bags.  Leave it like that for the night.  This procedure is necessary so that the candies stick to the container as best as possible.  The next morning, you can carefully remove the winding.  It remains only to fill the awl with the tails of sweets inside, and then make a bunch of leaves and attach it to the top of our "fruit".  Foliage can be made from green cardboard and paper.  How to make pineapple from sweets more realistic?  Glue the sheet of cardboard and the sheet of paper so that the blank on both sides is green.  Cut oblong petals from it and glue them to the neck of the bottle.  Using scissors, give the foliage a beautiful shape.  So our magnificent present is ready - pineapple.  You made a wonderful craft out of sweets with your own hands, spending a minimum of time and effort.  Congratulations! </p><h2>  Another simple workshop is pineapple from a plastic bottle. </h2>

The instruction is as follows: first we prepare a plastic bottle - wash it well, remove the labels and let it dry.  Tip: if you can‚Äôt find a barrel-shaped plastic container for sale, you can use a regular two-liter container for lemonade.  But it will need to be prepared in advance, that is, to give the shape of a pineapple.  It is not difficult to do this: with a sharp knife, cut the container into three parts.  Put the middle aside - we will not use it.  But leave the top and bottom.  Align them by tucking the top with the neck into the bottom.  You should get the necessary form. </p><h2>  We attach sweets to a plastic container </h2>

We take five sweets and fasten them into a ring, wrapping the tails with bead wire.  Now we fix the sweets at the bottom of the bottle.  We close the hole in the center with two more candies.  The bottom of the pineapple is ready, go to the design of the sides.  Glue a strip of adhesive tape in a circle.  We take eight candies and fasten them with each other with wire, without having to form a ring.  Glue the sweets on a strip of scotch tape, pressing them denser to the front row.  By analogy, we draw up the entire plastic bottle to the very neck.  Each row can have a different amount of sweets - vary it as you wish.  Remember that sweets must be glued to the packaging in a checkerboard pattern.  DIY pineapple made of sweets is almost done.
