LG Smartphone with Curved Screen</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Touch screens became a habit for each of us about 6-7 years ago.  Until then, no one could have imagined that the device could be controlled by clicking on the screen.  Today, there is another model of the phone - it is a rectangular "brick", which is similar to most modern models. </p><p>  Some manufacturers are trying in every possible way to ‚Äúbreak‚Äù this circle of stereotypes and present something new to the world.  Another such device at the time was G Flex - the brainchild of LG, - a curved phone that breaks our ideas about how a smartphone should look. </p><h2>  Curved screen phone </h2>

    <p>  Obviously, this model is the result of experiments by LG engineers trying to present something original on the market.  They succeeded, however, the device did not make any special furore.  He was remembered simply as an experimental device, designed primarily for the so-called "wow effect" of the buyer. </p><p>  In general, the device, in terms of its characteristics and capabilities, strongly resembles the flagship (at one time) G2 model - the same high performance, response speed, powerful equipment, attractive design.  Of course, the main feature is that this LG is a curved phone.  According to manufacturers, this form of it allows you to increase the sound quality of the voice of the owner of the device, and also increases audibility in general. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hardware stuffing </h2>

    <p>  A smartphone with a curved display (LG GFlex) also boasts a strong filling.  It, as noted above, is similar to what the manufacturer offers along with the G2 model - this is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor (performance equals 2.26 GHz).  Also, the model is equipped with 2 GB of RAM and an Adreno 330 graphics processor, which allows for high-quality graphics in any conditions. </p><h2>  Picture </h2><p>  In general, with regard to graphics, manufacturers promise users that the new LG, whose curved screen appears at a different angle, will transmit the picture in a new, unusual form.  Due to this, <span>viewing photos,</span> movies and video clips on the G Flex will be different from the image that we are used to seeing on other devices. </p><p>  True, as the experience of users who left reviews about the device shows, this effect will soon cease to be noticeable - the human eye quickly gets used to such a viewing angle.  And there‚Äôs nothing unusual about that. </p>

    <h2>  Special screen coverage </h2><p>  Another interesting feature that the developers of the model mention is the special coating on the display.  It is called self-healing for the reason that it allows you to hide minor scratches that inevitably occur on any sensor as a result of using a device from LG.  A curved phone can, as tests have shown, cope with 70 percent of minor damage through the use of this technology. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This effect is achieved due to more efficient filling of the space that forms after scratching.  True, it is impossible to hope that this will make the phone invulnerable - larger damage to the case will remain ‚Äúas is‚Äù, engineers have nothing against them.  The LG smartphone with a curved screen is already positioned as a high-tech novelty. </p><h2>  Battery </h2>

    <p>  Judging by the reviews, many users are interested in the question regarding the battery.  What should be the battery for the new Flex - also curved? </p><p>  In fact, you should not worry about this - the design of the device is thought out to the smallest detail - and even in such an unusual case an excellent battery with a capacity of 3500 mAh is placed.  She follows the contours of the phone, so she sits inside quite organically;  the user cannot remove it.  At the same time, it is enough for a sufficiently long period of operation of the device due to the excellent optimization carried out by LG.  The curved phone, in addition to its unusual shape, also boasts stamina at the G2 level. </p><h2>  Price and reviews </h2><p>  The cost of the device can not be called budget - at the time of release it cost 950 dollars.  As it became obsolete, the price fell, especially after the second generation.  The new LG phone with a curved screen is called G Flex 2, it has a modified case: it is more comfortable in the hand, equipped with an improved processor, camera and other features that will please the buyer.  Now the first generation smartphone costs about 22 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  For these funds, the buyer gets a fairly strong smartphone with a good 12-megapixel camera, an optimized quad-core processor and a good graphics engine.  In the G FLex screen, of course, there is nothing unusual except the viewing angle - believe me, this is just an LG smartphone with a curved screen.  Although the reviews, of course, are for the most part positive about the device, the ‚Äúwow effect‚Äù really works.  Plus, again, the large 6-inch screen allows you to conveniently perform a lot of tasks for which small displays are not suitable. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Despite the overall positive picture in the reviews, I would like to highlight some of the nuances that users noted on the negative side.  For example, these are inconvenient buttons to unlock the screen.  Unlike the G2 model, the LG phone with a curved screen was equipped with keys from another material, which is not so pleasant to press.  Yes, and do it on a flat surface, according to customers, more convenient. </p><p>  Next, we should mention the graininess of pixels in some places on the screen.  The reviews claim that this effect can be seen only on certain videos - but it is present, which is sometimes very annoying. </p>

    <p>  Another point is the headphone jack.  For some users using the phone in a horizontal position (like a tablet), it seems uncomfortable that the hole is located on the top panel, and not on the side of the device. </p><p>  Another curved LG phone (the price of which, recall, is now 20-22 thousand), as noted by users, is not equipped with a second SIM card and does not support a memory card, which makes it less convenient to use. </p><p>  However, we will proceed from what we have, and leave the task to come up with improvements for the device to LG engineers. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In general, the phone can be described as <span>an unusual gadget that</span> attracts attention.  The phone itself has enough ‚Äúcool‚Äù equipment - thanks to this, users have access to wide functionality, excellent performance, and the mass of advantages of a middle-class smartphone. </p><p>  Plus, as some reviews testify, the curved shape is really convenient conversations (due to the fact that the device follows the contours of the face) and cool watching movies (due to a different viewing angle of the screen). </p><p>  As a result, we get a phone that could be purchased by those who like to experiment.  Plus, again, if someone may not have enough model capabilities, you can buy a second generation gadget - G Flex 2, a modified and improved version at a higher price. </p>
