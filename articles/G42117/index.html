At that time there was a boyar‚Äôs yard, a wooden church and serf yards.  In the period from 1750 to 1770, according to the plan of Sergey Dmitrievich, a large estate was created in Kuskovo, in which there was a palace, a large park, ponds and the so-called amusement ventures.  The estate was designed by serf architects F. Argunov and A. Mironov in the style of early classicism. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kudamoscow.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Kuskovo" class="if uuid-3113947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3113947.jpg"></div><p>  Upon completion of all construction and finishing works, the estate began to be visited by numerous guests who were amazed by its beauty.  Quite often, large and magnificent receptions were held here. </p><h2>  Description of the estate </h2><p>  The palace in the estate is dominant in the architectural composition.  The layout is designed in such a way that all the doors are located on one axis and open one after another in each room.  All the premises of the palace were successively combined into three special compositional groups. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="kudamoscow.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Park Kuskovo" class="if uuid-3113948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3113948.jpg"></div><p>  As mentioned earlier, the estate complex met a huge number of guests.  In addition to the magnificent interiors of the palace and the beauty of the manor itself, Sergey Dmitrievich Sheremetev conceived and implemented the amusement ventures.  They included: park gazebos and pavilions, a greenhouse, menagerie, Kunstkamera and a hunting lodge. </p><p>  A small flotilla consisting of rowing vessels was created at Kuskovsky pond.  To imagine the size of the estate, which was 230 hectares, it should be said that in the days of special celebrations, it took about 30 thousand people.  Entire legends about the estate of Kuskovo circulated in St. Petersburg and Moscow.  The guests who visited it for a long time were enthusiastically impressed. </p><h2>  Museum </h2><p>  Currently, the museum is located on the estate Kuskovo.

It was created at the end of the 18th century, as it is supposed, according to the project of the architect I. Starov.  At that time, when Sergey Dmitrievich Sheremetev lived in the estate, it became the Moscow literary center.  Famous poets and writers of the Golden Age gathered here.  In 1899, the Pushkin Museum was created and opened here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Ostafyevo" class="if uuid-3113951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3113951.jpg"></div><p>  On the estate there is a two-story palace.  The building was built in the style of classicism and had a colonnade gallery.  During the construction of the estate, a pond was created, a linden alley was planted and a park was erected. </p><p>  Currently, the estate is a museum, which houses the palace itself with two wings and a park with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã21 hectares, a linden alley and a pond.  The park has monuments to the founders: Princes Vyazemsky, V. A. Zhukovsky and A. S. Pushkin. </p><p>  A palace is available for visiting, in which the interiors of the 19th century are preserved, with furniture and decoration.  The main highlight of the palace are three libraries that have been assembled for 200 years.  A great contribution to their creation was made by Sergei Dmitrievich Sheremetev.  The number of books he collected is estimated at about 80 to 100 thousand volumes. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Count Sheremetev was a member of the Russian Geographical Society, the Academy of Arts, the acclimatization of animals and plants and the English club in St. Petersburg.  In addition to membership, he was also the trustee of these societies.  For his military service and scientific activity, Sheremetev was awarded more than 30 orders and medals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pond in the park of the estate Ostafyevo" class="if uuid-3113953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3113953.jpg"></div><p>  Sergey Dmitrievich published more than 40 scientific works and books, and also became the publisher of a huge amount of scientific literature.  It should be noted that the count was a very rich man.  He owned land in 11 provinces, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich was more than 240 thousand acres (about 262 000 ha).  He had three large houses in St. Petersburg, and two in Moscow.  Sheremetev loved to collect not only books, but also historical documents and weapons. </p><p>  He leased the premises that were in his property, for which he made a big profit, and he also owned three distilleries.  It should be noted that the graph not only earned a lot, but also spent a lot.  However, he did not spend money on festivities and gambling, but on charity and science.  As mentioned earlier, some scientific communities, of which he was a co-founder, contained at the expense of his own funds. </p><p>  At the age of 74, in 1918 Sergei Dmitrievich Sheremetev died and was buried in the churchyard of Novospassky Monastery.  Concluding the story, it should be said that the count made a huge contribution to the science of Russia.  He not only financially supported scientific societies, but also created historical and genealogical works and works, which he himself published.  He devoted himself to the study of various sciences and social activities.  This, of course, is the most worthy representative of the Sheremetev family, who created and preserved scientific knowledge for future generations. </p>
