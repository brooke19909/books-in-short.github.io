    <h2>  History of balneological resorts </h2><p>  Even the ancient Greeks highly appreciated the treatment on the waters.  Then the Romans mastered this practice.  They own the term "balneotherapy".  Translated from Latin, this means "bathing treatment."  The Romans are great lovers of term; they knew a lot about sulfur and other sources, as well as massages and rubbing.  It was they who built the first ever balneological resorts in Europe throughout the entire territory of their empire.  In the Middle Ages, healing springs were fanned with a halo of holiness, and many monasteries profited from them.  Since only wealthy patients could afford to go ‚Äúunder water treatment‚Äù, the most comfortable conditions were created for such clients at the baths.  In order to not be bored, the casinos, theaters, and golf courses were opened.  And the best chefs were invited to restaurants at hydropathic institutions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Balneological resort of Matsesta" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/888008.jpg" width="510"></div>

Mineral water will remove stress, chronic fatigue, and normalize blood pressure.  In the world there are several tens of thousands of balneological resorts.  In some of them, prices are sky-high, while others are very affordable.  The difference is in the related service.  Who knows, maybe this is also important.  In order not to come home as a ‚Äúman exhausted by a narzan‚Äù, first study what a particular balneological resort offers to vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech spa resorts" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/888012.jpg" width="595"></div>

Petrarch, William Shakespeare, Byron, Mozart and Goethe were treated here.  The balneological resorts of Italy are very numerous, but Abano Terme, which is fifteen kilometers from Padua, is special.  It treats all diseases that can be overcome with thermal mineral water - from skin and respiratory to neurosis and ailments of the musculoskeletal system.  Mud is widely used, the application of which, as they say, removes extra pounds from the hips and abdomen.  Water in some sources reaches a temperature of 87 <sup>0</sup> Celsius.  The course of treatment is two weeks.  In the resort of Abano, you can find many resorts, hotels from three to five stars.  The ‚Äútrick‚Äù of local treatment is that you need to empty your stomach on an empty stomach, then soak it in a mineral bath, then enjoy a massage and only then proceed to breakfast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Balneological resort Carpathians" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/887978.jpg" width="293"></div>

    <h2>  Bad ischl </h2><p>  Austrian balneological resorts are cute old villages in the Alps, a charm of luxury with a touch of rural simple life.  The Salzkammergut region (translated as ‚Äúsalt storage‚Äù) was famous for its <span>mineral springs</span> from ancient times.  But when bathing in one of them, in Ischl, cured the spouse of Archduke Franz Karl Habsburg of infertility, the whole Austrian aristocracy was frequent in this village.  There was built a summer villa of the emperor, and Kaiser Therms were built over the famous source.  In addition to infertility, salt waters treat many diseases: skin, muscles and joints, bones, heart and blood vessels, respiratory tract, blood.  Bad Ischl is located just fifty kilometers from Salzburg, so that wellness can be combined with excursions.  But even without this, the resort cannot be bored.  In winter, there are lifts working with might and main and skiers and snowboarders ride.  At other times, hiking, cycling and horse riding trails along beautiful trails running a thousand meters above sea level were developed.  And in August, an operetta festival takes place, because Lehar, who was treated here, wrote about a dozen of his creations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Bad Homburg </h2><p>  In Germany there are more than three hundred hydropathic institutions.  And in general, if the name of the town has the prefix "bad", be sure - there are healing keys.  It cannot be said that Homburg, which is located near Frankfurt am Main, is Germany‚Äôs best balneological resort, but it‚Äôs the most famous one.  In addition, it is narrow-profile.  The staff of the luxurious Kaiser Wilhelm Bad swimming pool does not promise to cure infertility, gastrointestinal tract or respiratory tract ailments, but guarantees: after a course of baths you will no longer be tormented by diseases of the musculoskeletal system.  The resort was opened by the ancient Romans, but Wilhelm II gave it a second life.  When the emperor‚Äôs summer residence was built in 1888 in Homburg, as if by magic, the first golf club and casino appeared in continental Europe.  By the way, the famous Russian writer Fedor Dostoyevsky was playing to the smithereens at the table with a tape measure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best balneological resort" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/888007.jpg" width="535"></div>

    <h2>  Bat </h2><p>  Many balneological resorts in the world can boast of a history dating back centuries.  But Bath, one hundred kilometers from London, is probably the oldest among them.  Archaeologists find evidence that people here took therapeutic baths as early as the eighth century BC.  And the first written mention of Bath serves as his best recommendation: Bloodood, the king of the Celts, was cured of leprosy here.  Later, the water was appreciated by other monarchs and members of their families.  Henry VIII and Anna Boleyn were treated in the Bath waters, and Jacob II's wife after them was able to give Britain an heir.  Shakespeare dedicated two wonderful sonnets to the baths, described by <span>Jane Austen.</span>  In 2006, the resort was updated.  Thermae Bath Spa's wonderful center treats diabetes, digestive diseases, joints and poor metabolism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Balneological resorts in Italy" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/888006.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Druskininkai </h2><p>  The climate of Lithuania cannot be called subtropical.  But in Druskininkai, balneological resorts are a real opportunity to get a beautiful even tan besides health improvement.  Why?  Yes, because the hydropathic facilities there are equipped with a beach with artificial ultraviolet light.  And some of them also offer all the entertainment of a real water park.  The town in southern Lithuania got its name from druska, which means ‚Äúsalt‚Äù.  On the banks of the Neman River, Lithuanian princes and the king of Poland, Stanislav, were treated.  Peat mud and the amazing pine-drunken air druskininkai come to the aid of healing saline waters.  Bathtubs and body wraps are recommended to be combined with long walks along specially designed terrains.  Diving in local lakes contributes to the treatment of gynecological diseases and the nervous system.  Dirt from their bottom has the same effect on joints as in Tunisian hospitals. </p><h2>  Marienbad (Marianske Lazne) and Karlovy Vary </h2><p>  <span>Czech spa resorts are</span> more accessible for Russian tourists.  There is a developed infrastructure and relatively affordable prices for holidays.  The lion's share of our compatriots visits Karlovy Vary.  This small resort has 136 keys.  In boarding houses and sanatoriums they are treated with showers and baths, irrigation, as well as the intake of mineral water inside.  After a three-week course, you can say goodbye or forget about skin diseases, ailments of the heart system and the motor apparatus for a long time.  Endocrine problems are eliminated, women's reproductive health improves.  There are 140 sources in Marienbad, each with its own unique composition.  Peat mud is used here for body wraps; water is not only drunk, but also inhaled on inhalations.  Even local gas is used - they are given subcutaneous injections.  At this resort, Nicholas II, as well as Gogol, Goethe and Wagner, improved their health.  Other places of balneological rest in the Czech Republic - Teplice, Frantiskovy Lazne - are no less popular. </p><h2>  Resorts in Ukraine </h2><p>  Our southwestern neighbor has many health resorts of different specializations.  Healing mineral waters are offered by the sanatoriums of the White Church (near Kiev), Mirgorod (Poltava region), Khmelnik (Vinnitsa region).  Especially a lot of such resorts are concentrated in the west of the country.  These are Lviv (Morshin, Truskavets, Shklo) and Transcarpathian (Sinyak, Svalyava, Polyana, Kvasy, Shayan) regions.  In addition to water, therapeutic mud is widely used in Ukraine.  They are available in the Odessa region (Kuyalnik, Rasseika, Sergeevka).  All these health resorts have their own specialization, and you can always choose for yourself a suitable balneological resort.  The Carpathians, in addition to recovery, give the opportunity for skiing or green tourism.  Gastrointestinal diseases and kidneys are treated in Polyana and Shayan.  In Kvass, radon baths treat the problems of the musculoskeletal system and peripheral nervous system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Balneological resorts in Europe" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/887980.jpg" width="600"></div>
