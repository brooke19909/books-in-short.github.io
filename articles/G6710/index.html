    <h2>  Terra Incognita </h2><p>  Those who have already been to Vietnam will agree that there are no special language problems in the well-known resorts of this country, since any restaurant has a menu in Russian, specialized information centers for Russians, etc. operate. This is primarily due to the popularity of Nha Trang and Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) among residents of the former Soviet republics.  The situation is completely different in Da Nang, where foreign tourists, and even more so Russians, are rare.  However, this has its advantages.  For example, if you are considering whether to go to Danang (Vietnam), reviews of tourists will indicate such an advantage of this city as relatively sparsely populated and clean beaches.  You must admit that this is a rarity for any popular resort, and it cannot but please travelers, especially if they went on vacation with children.  Moreover, the Chinese beach of the city is included in the list of the best in the world and is considered a great place for surf lovers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Temples </h2><p>  Reading reviews of Danang and the impressions of Vietnam by our compatriots, one can often hear praise for the original architecture of local Buddhist temples.  And she really is wonderful!  For those who have been to China, Da Nang Pagodas will not be new.  However, even such sophisticated experts in Asia are unlikely to resist the temptation to inspect the 67-meter Buddha statue, installed in the largest temple of the city of Lunh-Unga in the XVIII century.  To see it, tourists will have to go on a bus excursion to the Son Tra Peninsula and climb the high hill, which offers a magnificent view of Danang. </p>

    <h2>  Cham Museum </h2><p>  The city inherited this establishment from the French, who not only exploited the Vietnamese, but also did much to preserve their national culture. </p><p>  In 1915, on the initiative of the School for the Study of the Far East in Da Nang, a museum was opened, which today is one of the most famous sights of the city.  It contains the largest collection of unique Cham sculpture.  The museum consists of ten halls, where, along with sculptures, photographs taken 100-120 years ago and telling about life in Indochina are also presented.  Many stone sculptures presented in the museum date back to the 5th-15th centuries AD. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A ticket to the museum, which is located in the central part of Da Nang, at the intersection of Bach Dang and Trang Well Wuong, costs 30 000 VND (about 75 rubles). </p><h2>  The hot springs </h2><p>  25 km from Danang is a mud bath, known throughout Southeast Asia.  The complex is based on thermal springs, the temperature in which fluctuates around 55 degrees.  Tourists come there to improve their health and restore youth to their joints. </p>

    <h2>  Museum of the Fifth Military Zone </h2><p>  For those who are going to go to Vietnam (Danang), tourists' reviews recommend visiting the largest exhibition of military equipment.  It is part of a museum exhibition dedicated to the defense of the 5th military zone during the confrontation with the French colonialists and the war with the American occupiers.  Among the most valuable exhibits are rare images of tanks, armored vehicles and aircraft.  His address is 01 Duy Tan Street.

    <h2>  Marble Mountains </h2><p>  This natural attraction is located between Hoi An and Da Nang.  Marble Mountains are 5 stone hills.  It is known that in ancient times these places were covered with water, and the tops of the hills protruding above the surface were islands.  The Vietnamese named each of the mountains by the name of one of the elements that make up the Universe: Hoashon (fire), Thuyshon (water), Mokshon (tree), Thoshon (earth) and Gimshon (metal).  Inside the mountains there are natural caves transformed into Buddhist shrines.  Thousands of pilgrims visit the Marble Mountains annually. </p><p>  If you want to explore Danang Caves, you should take a lantern with you, and be prepared to meet bats, among which there are representatives of species with a frightening appearance. </p><p>  For the climb to the Marmara mountains you need to pay 15,000 in local currency. </p><h2>  Holiday in Da Nang (Vietnam): hotel description </h2><p>  Most of the tourist hotels in the city are located along the beaches with white sand.  It is recommended to give preference to hotels of world brands, the rooms in which are in great demand.  New hotel centers, such as Inter Continental with 150 rooms, are especially in demand. </p><p>  If you are interested in more budget options, then you should look for them along Tran Hung Dao Street.  There you can rent a cozy single room for 14-25 EUR.  There are also inexpensive hotels along Pham Phu Thu. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If you are going to go to Vietnam (Danang), the reviews of tourists will also help you decide which mode of transport is better to get there.  There are several options.  Among them: </p><ul><li>  Fly by plane.  The city has one of three international airports, receiving flights from the capital, as well as the states of the region.  Unfortunately, there are no direct flights to Russia from Danang, so our tourists get there by air after a transfer at Hanoi Airport. </li><li>  By rail.  Danang Railway Station is located in the very center of the city.  Trains run through it along the routes from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh and Nha Trang.  It is most beneficial to take advantage of night flights, as in this case you can save on hotel stays. </li><li>  By bus.  Any review of Vietnam (Da Nang, in particular) shows that the cheapest way to get to this city is by bus.  Prices depend on the route and range from 20 to 30 US dollars.  At the same time, a trip from Hanoi to Da Nang by bus will take about 12 hours.  The bus station through which international flights are carried out to Taoist is located on Dien Bien Phu Street. </li></ul>
