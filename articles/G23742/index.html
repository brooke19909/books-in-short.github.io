  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pricking weapons in antiquity today</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Edged weapons existed as much as humanity itself.  It constantly evolved and at a certain stage it turned out a stabbing weapon - one of the most common and deadly.  We will try to talk about its varieties, as well as to trace the chain of evolution from the time of Hellas to the present day. </p><h2>  What it is </h2><p>  To begin with, we will determine what should be understood by the term piercing weapons.  So it is customary to call any weapon with which damage to the enemy is inflicted by poking strikes.  The small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe wound in this case is compensated by its depth, damage to internal organs and heavy bleeding. </p><p>  Types of piercing weapons are very numerous and diverse.  It is often difficult to believe that two objects that are completely different in weight, shape and size can belong to the same group. </p><p>  First of all, it was used during the wars.  Most types of weapons can be divided into two types: blade (swords, knives and a huge number of their modifications) and a pole (spears and dozens of varieties).  In addition, there were a large number of combined weapons - piercing-cutting, piercing-chopping, and so on.  In different eras, different goals were set - sometimes delivering a not-so-accurate, but very powerful blow, and sometimes a relatively weak injection, applied precisely to a certain place, became more important. </p><p>  However, piercing weapons were used in everyday life.  For example, the stag beetle with which our ancestors went to bear is a typical representative of this.  However, it was also actively used in battle - starting with the Patriotic War and ending with the times of the Mongol invasion and further, in the depth of centuries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What the ancient Greeks fought </h2><p>  Of course, people fought with piercing weapons long before Hellas appeared.  But it was here that the first difficult tactics were applied, where one of the main was the battle in the ranks.  And this left a certain imprint not only on the course of the battle, but also on the requirements for the weapons that were used in this case. </p><p>  Thus appeared the most famous piercing weapon of ancient times - sarissa and xyphos. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bambinoides.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Greek phalanx" class="if uuid-2493965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85035/2493965.jpg"></div><p>  Sarissa was called a spear 5-7 meters long, which was used by soldiers from the time of Tsar Philip (father of Alexander the Great).  A considerable length did not allow the enemy to approach a distance sufficient to strike.  A continuous forest of spears did not leave the enemy the slightest chance of victory - the Greeks easily defeated troops, many times superior in numbers. </p><p>  When the turn came to close combat, the Hellenes snatched xyphos from their scabbard - short swords that were perfect for wounding the enemy in armor, as well as unprotected by metal and skin.  The small length (about 60 centimeters) made xyphos primarily a stabbing weapon, but if necessary, they could also apply the strongest chopping blows, cutting off arms and legs. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Arsenal of Medieval Fighters </h2><p>  The stabbing weapons of the Middle Ages are surprisingly diverse.  If you count only what was used in Europe, you will get a few hundred varieties.  Riders and infantry, light and heavily armed, operating in Russia and in England, Scandinavia and Spain - all this forced to create the most suitable arsenal for each specific case. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The spear is the weapon of commoners and knights" class="if uuid-2493964" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85035/2493964.jpg"></div><p>  For poorly trained warriors, a spear was best suited.  You could learn how to use it in a matter of days - here the most important was simple physical strength.  But yesterday's peasants and workers were not deprived of it.  However, the knights actively used spears.  And not only at spectacular sports competitions in palaces, but also on the battlefield.  It was almost impossible to stop a warrior bound in armor rushing with a long, thick spear on a well-trained horse. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.1stdibs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Broadsword - light and deadly" class="if uuid-2493963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85035/2493963.jpg"></div><p>  But the sword remains the most iconic weapon.  If initially they were chopping weapons, then gradually they became chopping and stabbing - the tip was sharpened well and also became narrower with each century.  As a result, the sword turned into a light broadsword, which turned into a sword, and that, in turn, into a rapier.  The latter was exclusively a stabbing weapon - it was problematic to strike with it because of its light weight.  But a narrow blade with a well-honed tip easily pierced leather armor.  Metal by this time was almost a thing of the past due to the appearance of firearms. </p><h2>  Not forgotten to this day </h2><p>  Actively use piercing weapons today.  First of all, this is a bayonet-knife.  Yes, in real battles it is not used as actively as it was a hundred years ago, when soldiers were specially trained in the art of fencing on them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jaybe-militaria.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Assistant Modern Warrior" class="if uuid-2493966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85035/2493966.jpg"></div><p>  But nevertheless, during urban battles, when the battle is fought in corridors, rooms and just narrow streets, it is he who often remains the last hope of a fighter - if he has run out of ammunition or the main small arms are out of order. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know more about piercing weapons.  And also learned about its application in various countries and eras, traced the entire evolution.  Suppose you did not become a weapons expert after reading one article, but a general idea will certainly appear. </p>
