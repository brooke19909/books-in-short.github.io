    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  In the Far East, in the Khabarovsk region, there are several unique reserves - Bolshekhekhtsirsky, Botchinsky, Bureinsky, Dzhugdzhursky and Komsomolsky.  According to many seasoned travelers, the most interesting natural attraction of the region is the mighty Cupid.  It is on its shore that you can see the unique petroglyphs of Sikachi-Alyan.  This archaeological site is a cave painting made by the ancient inhabitants.  Their experts date back to the twelfth millennium BC.  In recent years, ethno-ecotourism has begun to develop everywhere in the territory of the region.  There are more and more people who want to get acquainted with the culture and customs of indigenous peoples, live in their homes and taste the national cuisine. </p><h2>  Lotuses in Khabarovsk </h2><p>  Do not be surprised: yes, amazing flowers really grow on the territory of this harsh region, which hardly anyone expects to meet here.  Near Khabarovsk there are two places where you can see the real lotuses.  One of them is located near the village of Nikolaevka on the highway to Birobidzhan, and the other is on a lake near the village of Galkino.  And if in the first case it may not be lucky, because, as the locals say, lotuses do not appear here every year, then in the second you just need to know the days of their flowering.  Therefore, when asked where the lotus lake is in Khabarovsk, the majority of local residents indicate a direction to the village of Galkino. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lotus Lake in Khabarovsk how to get there" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2015494.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is believed that it is older than the rest of the flora of the Khabarovsk Territory.  And even millions of years ago, at this place near the village of Nikolaevka, once a year, for several days, lotuses blossomed.  They are listed in the Red Book.  The lotuses growing on a lake near the village of Nikolaevka belong to the Komarov variety.  These are huge pink flowers growing on a stalk in the growth of a person.  It is forbidden to rip them off, and it makes no sense, since they die immediately without water.  But taking a picture is a must.  Moreover, getting to this unique place on a country road is quite difficult. </p><h2>  Lotuses at the village of Galkino </h2><p>  Today in the territory of the region there are more than three hundred protected natural monuments, among which there are several unique and valuable both scientifically and aesthetically.  Among them are the rookeries of the sea lion and the noisy bird markets on the island of Nansikan, Lake Gassi and the mouth of the Chirka River, where the Far Eastern tortoise lives and successfully breeds, etc. But perhaps the most beautiful and at the same time the most exotic for the Far Eastern region lotus lake located in the village of Galkino is considered to be in Khabarovsk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lotus Lake Galkino Khabarovsk" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2015498.jpg" width="450"></div>

However, many travelers prefer to see the lotus lake in Khabarovsk on their own.  "How to get to it?"  - This question can be increasingly seen in various forums.  And this is not surprising.  Gradually, the fame of wonderful flowers, the beauty of which touches the heart, leaving memories for a long time, went beyond the boundaries of this Far Eastern region.  What is the lotus lake in Khabarovsk, how to get there, what season is best to choose for the trip, this article will tell. </p><p>  Getting to this unique natural monument is easy.  Lotosov Lake is only thirty minutes from Khabarovsk.  The nearest settlement is the village of Galkino, from which you need to go another three kilometers.  It is impossible to see the lake itself from the highway, but from the landmark ‚Äî the numerous parked cars ‚Äî you can understand where to turn off the country road.  The last two hundred meters will have to go along a very bad wet road, so judging by the reviews, most travelers go on foot. </p><p>  In the world there are only four types of these flowers: yellow, Caspian, nut-bearing and Far Eastern.  The latter is the lotus of Komarov, the famous botanist, a scientist who made a huge contribution to the study of the Far Eastern flora.  It is in his honor that this amazing flower is named.  The lotus of Komarov, which is discussed in this article, is listed in the Red Book.  It is found in several places throughout the Far Eastern region - under natural conditions, it grows in the Khabarovsk Territory, in Primorye, as well as in the Amur Region.  Recently, however, several reservoirs have appeared in the region, in which they are bred artificially. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lotus Lake in Khabarovsk when blooming" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2015497.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lotus in Khabarovsk </h2><p>  Variety Komarova is, oddly enough, a tropical species.  This relic plant has come down to us since preglacial times.  The estimated age of the lotus, which grows on the lakes of the Khabarovsk Territory, is about one hundred million years.  Despite its tropical origin, this flower has successfully adapted to the Far Eastern low temperatures.  It withstands frosts well up to forty degrees.  But under one condition: the temperature of the sludge in which the lotus resides should not be lower than four degrees of heat.  The root of the plant can sometimes reach a length of three hundred meters.  Flowers that can be seen upon arrival at the lotus lake (Galkino, Khabarovsk) in diameter reach up to thirty centimeters.  But the leaves of this culture are especially striking.  They are covered with a wax coating, due to which they are not wetted by water and are not dirty with dirt.  Droplets of water on meter-long huge leaves resemble the purest crystal crystals.  It is in order to see this miracle that many people come to the lotus lake in Khabarovsk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is the lotus lake in Khabarovsk" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2015493.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  When the "paradise flowers" bloom </h2><p>  The most delicate smell emanates from the lotus.  This flower is always facing the sun: it rotates during the day after its movement.  At night, the lotuses fold their buds, and each morning open again.  It is not enough to know where the lotus lake is located in Khabarovsk, you need to be aware when this amazing tropical guest blooms.  After all, you can come and not see the beauty beyond which people come here for thousands of kilometers.  The lotus lake in Khabarovsk is especially popular and crowded from the second half of July until the first days of September.  Separate buds, opening later, delight the eye until the middle of the first autumn month.  And at other times, the lotus lake in Khabarovsk near the village of Galkino is an ordinary body of water in which you can only see water lilies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where in Khabarovsk lotus lake" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2015496.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Environmentalists sound the alarm </h2><p>  For the first time, the state of this amazing reservoir bothered the local community in 2014.  Bloggers were the first to sound the alarm.  As a result, a signal tape was pulled near Galkino.  Ecologists had to take this measure in order to protect the lotuses that ‚Äúcrawl away‚Äù from the coast into the interior of the lake.  Activists began distributing leaflets in which they asked people to take care of these cult flowers and admire their beauty from afar. </p><p>  The fact is that many tourists are witnessing an incredibly barbaric attitude towards this protected plant.  The most affected <span>lotus lake</span> in Khabarovsk near the village of Galkino.  Today it is more visited compared to a similar place in Nikolaevka.  According to activists, in the lotus flowering season, only one and a half days, one and a half to two thousand people come here. </p><p>  In pursuit of beautiful photographs, people not only pluck these amazingly beautiful large flowers, but also trample down the root system of culture.  As a result, silt condenses, and this inevitably leads to the threat of freezing of this relic plant.  Experts say that the Komarov lotus population is still very limited.  This plant is listed not only in the Red Book of the Khabarovsk Territory, but also in Russia.  As for the lake near the village of Nikolaevka, the situation here was almost critical at one time: these flowers here almost disappeared completely due to the construction of the neighboring dam.  However, the disaster did not happen, although today the lotus does not bloom here every year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lotus Lake in Khabarovsk how to get" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2016007.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  It is difficult to describe in words the delight when you see a lake completely covered with large pink flowers.  Huge buds against a background of green leaves look incredibly beautiful.  Many Russians in their reviews admit that they learned about the wonderful lotuses growing on the territory of Khabarovsk, quite by accident.  Some of them travel great distances to see this miracle.  I must say that everyone who happened to come here during the flowering period of this cult plant does not regret the time spent, the means.  After all, such beauty can not be seen everywhere. </p>
