Turkey, Tekirova - hotel "Rixos"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Holidays in Turkey are</span> now popular all over the world.  This is well-deserved and justified, since the prices here are quite affordable, the service is excellent, the nature is amazing, there are a lot of entertainments.  What else do tourists need?  For many of them, Italy or France is not as desirable as Turkey.  Tekirova, <span>Kemer, Beldibi,</span> Camyuva, Goynuk and Kirish are all one resort area.  Let's talk more about Tekirova. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  On the territory of the ancient, glorified by Homer Lycia, there is a wonderful village, the appearance of which is made up of modern handsome hotel buildings, drowning in the colors of the street, various shops, shops and benches and smiling tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tekirova Turkey" class="if" height="247" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/440827.jpg" width="369"></div>  It is called Tekirova.  Turkey pays great attention to the development of the tourism business.  Thanks to this, new parks were opened in the village, first-class roads were laid, and a wide network of services was created.  Getting here is easy.  <span>Antalya Airport</span> is approximately 60 km away <span>,</span> where a shuttle can be booked.  Many hotels provide free transportation on the day of arrival and departure.  In addition, you can take a minibus to Kemer, and from there to Tekirova just a stone's throw (only 12 km), and buses run every thirty minutes.  The village is geographically somewhat remote from the rest of Kemer, which makes it possible to relax without unnecessary noise and fuss.  The endless sea distances provide an excellent opportunity to surf, and the snowy peaks of Takhtala will present a unique opportunity to treat yourself to playing snowballs and sculpting snowmen in the summer (until June), and then go down to the foot and plunge into the warm sea waters.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Tekirova in Turkey, where it is very hot in summer and snow can fall in winter, does not differ in such a temperature difference.  Even at night in the coldest winter months, the thermometer does not drop below +5.  In the afternoon all winter is completely warm, the air warms up to +14 +16, and water to +16 +17 degrees.  If it weren‚Äôt for heavy rains, which peak in December and January, would be Tekirova‚Äôs paradise all year round.  Turkey mainly has a continental climate, which means a sultry arid summer.  In Kemer, July and August ‚Äúdelight‚Äù tourists with a heat of 40 degrees.  Tekirova is a bit cooler.  There, the maximum is held at +36 during the day, and +22 at night at a water temperature of +25 +27.  Precipitation at this time falls about 18-20 mm per month, that is, a rare rain can only dust. </p><h2>  Sea and beaches </h2><p>  Tekirova is located on the Mediterranean Sea.  The coastline is flat everywhere, the entrance to the water is convenient for everyone.  True, in some parts of the coast, large stones create a problem. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Tekirova Hotel Rixos" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/440862.jpg" width="400"></div>  The beaches throughout Kemer are mostly small-pebbled.  The bottom is also pebble.  If the stones are covered with slippery algae, it becomes difficult to move on them, so it is advisable to have special shoes on your feet.  For the convenience of their guests, on their own beach areas many hotels in Tekirova are sanding.  Turkey is very closely monitoring the state of water in all four of its seas and the cleanliness of its coastline.  That is why many of its beaches have the international Blue Flag.  Tekirova is no exception.  The sea here is so clean and transparent that you can freely watch the movement of fish and crabs in the water column.  Everywhere along the shore there are sun loungers, umbrellas or awnings.  You can use them on the municipal beach and on the territory of "your" hotel, but just walking is not prohibited along the entire coast.  It is also not forbidden to set your own umbrella and lay your own towel.  Along the entire promenade there are many bars, convenience stores, souvenir shops and various trinkets.  On the beaches you can rent various equipment (balls, <span>masks for scuba diving</span> and the like), rent catamarans, jet skis, diving clubs work here.

Over the centuries, it was conquered by the Persians, Romans, Turks, and the dyadohs of Alexander of Macedon.  The ancient country left a rich legacy to its successor - the village of Tekirova. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Queens Tekirova Park" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/440826.jpg" width="305"></div>  Turkey is world famous for its monuments of ancient culture.  In Tekirova there is also something to see.  The remains of the city of Fezalis, built more than two and a half thousand years ago, are of constant interest.  It is located north of the village, and to the south you can admire Cleopatra's Bay.  It will be interesting for fishermen to go to Ulupinar, where they provide an opportunity to fish for trout.  Immediately, on the spot, they are preparing it.  In addition, you can order excursion tours to Kemer from Tekirova.  Turkey is an unusually interesting country.  There is even Mount Chimera here with eternally burning lights escaping directly from the stones.  She and the village of Cirali with a beach of turtles are half an hour from Kemer.  In addition, you can visit the ruins of ancient Olympus, the Beldibi Paleolithic Cave, the city of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker Miru and Yoryuk Park with a curious exposition of nomad Turks, which will certainly offer you to try national drinks from koumiss.  At 12 km from Tekirova there is a suspension road with a length of 4350 meters.  She raises to the top of Tahtal.  The journey takes place in booths with excellent visibility.  The climb lasts about 15 minutes.  At the top, in addition to the observation platforms, there are two restaurants.  In the village itself, a park of exotic plants and reptiles has recently been opened.  Animals can be photographed, picked up, which always causes delight in children and adults.

Kemer, Tekirova and other regions of the resort can offer their guests accommodation for every taste - from modest inexpensive "rooms for rent" to chic royal apartments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Tekirova Kemer" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/440825.jpg" width="399"></div>  The village compares favorably with other similar ones in that there is no crowding of buildings.  For comparison: since 2000, about 200 large hotels have been built in Kemer, not counting private villas and guest houses.  Turkey does everything possible and impossible for its guests.  Tekirova (the hotel "Rixos" here, for example, is located on the territory of 95 thousand square meters) also has something to offer vacationers.  And the Rixos is far from the only one.  The same situation with other hotels 5, 4 and even 3 stars.  Of course, the service in them is more modest, but for those who travel to Tekirova over the sea, the sun and interesting pastime in all kinds of sightseeing tours, this is exactly what you need.  One of the solid three-star hotels is the Millennium.  Here guests can offer excellent double or triple rooms of the Standard type, in which there is everything you need, even a refrigerator (which you rarely find in hotels of greater stardom).  Food here is three meals a day according to the BB system.  The area is decorated with a picturesque garden and a beautiful pool.  For guests, the hotel has a sauna and free parking.  Only its beach in the "Millennium" is not.  Guests have to go to the municipal.  But a five-minute drive from the hotel is the diving club Three Islands.
