Although it does not stand directly on the beach, tourists consider its location very good.  It is not far from the promenade, along which you can even walk to Playa de Las Americas.  The hotel is quite solid, there are many British and Italians, and Russian tourists are not so often.  But those who rested in this hotel rated it positively and often recommended it to their friends and acquaintances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Best jacaranda 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1550995.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Costa Adeje </h2><p>  This most popular resort in Tenerife has earned the attention and love of tourists from all over the world.  Unlike the more famous and noisy neighboring Playa de Las Americas, travelers with families prefer to relax here.  The hotel Best Jacaranda 4 * is configured for this type of guests.  <span>Costa Adeje</span> has several beach areas.  The most exclusive of them is Duke.  It is very expensive and the best hotels are located.  There is a beautiful shopping center, spectacularly illuminated in the evenings - Plaza del Duque.  And overcoming two capes bristling with rocks, you find yourself on the more democratic beach of Fanabe.  There are more tourists here, the infrastructure is better, but there is practically no nightlife.  For all this, you will have to go to Playa de Las Americas, especially Veronikas street.  Moreover, it is located very close to Costa Adeje.  In the east of Fa√±abe, on the beach of Puerto Colon, there is a pier for pleasure boats and one of the few discos - El Faro.  And the Al Ten - Gran Tinerife hotel has the only casino in the vicinity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Best Jacaranda 4 Tenerife" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1550992.jpg" width="600"></div>
