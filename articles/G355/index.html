  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Collection - "useful programs for iphone" from Cydia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cydia compiled a special collection of programs for the iphone.  This assembly includes all useful <span>iphone programs developed by</span> one manufacturer - Cydia.  And this, by the way, is a little repulsive moment for some users.  After all, programs from Cydia are not free, and our compatriots are not used to spending their money on such services. </p><p>  Nevertheless, many recommend useful programs for iphone 4s from this collection.  After downloading the entire archive completely, you can subsequently at any time, even without access to the Internet, install the application you need. </p><p>  It should be noted that over the past year, the iPhone received a huge number of different applications from a variety of manufacturers that work seamlessly with Windows Mobile or <span>Symbian OS.</span>  This allows you to call the iPhone a smartphone in every sense. </p><p>  However, it is not clear why the manufacturers from Apple install only a minimal set of applications, and the rest offer to be purchased separately for their users. </p><p>  Consider one of the most successful assemblies, which includes really useful programs for the iPhone.  Just note that the assembly contains a huge number of utilities, united under one interface that is convenient and convenient from the point of view of usability, which brings the collection to the leaders of the iPhone software segment. </p><p>  Among the programs I would like to highlight the following: </p><p>  - IBluenova v2.  0. 1, which allows you to transfer via Bluetooth files of any type.  It is the latest version of the application; </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - SBSetting - this program allows you to configure quick access to basic phone features and functions; </p><p>  - IFile RUS today is considered one of the best <span>file managers for iPhones</span> ; </p><p>  - Backgrounder for three.  0 allows you to work with various programs in the background; </p><p>  - Insomnia - this program provides wireless WI-FI access even in <span>sleep mode</span> ; </p><p>  - for reading video files, developers suggest using a special program Yxflash, capable of recognizing such formats as flv, avi, wmv; </p><p>  - Winterboard will allow the owner of the iPhone to easily change the desktop settings.  For this, the program has several built-in design options.  But you can add your own images; </p><p>  - Videorecorder - a program for recording video; </p><p>  - Cycorder is another video recording program.  However, unlike the previous one, it has high recording parameters and the ability to customize the output stream.  It does not require special activation, unlike videorecorder; <br>  - NES is a Dendy emulator.  Used to customize games; </p><p>  - To group icons on the desktop, we recommend using the Categories program.  It automatically creates separate folders in which you can put the same type of icons and shortcuts; </p><p>  - FontSwap allows you to replace the settings of the system cipher; </p><p>  - MAdvLock utility allows you to set a password for your applications; </p><p>  - two utilities Cydia RUS and Icy RUS are useful programs for iphone - installers; </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - XGPS RUS allows you to work with the program Google Maps.  In addition, it supports audio prompts of the router.  The program is compatible for working with external GPS receivers; </p><p>  - AppBackup will help users to backup all installed applications.  And with it, you can easily find previous settings and restore them; </p><p>  - Using PwnPlayer you can easily configure the playback of mp3 files.  This program supports working with the iTunes library.  And downloading music can be done through any type manager: iPhoneBrowser.  CyberDuck, WinSCP, CureFTP. </p><p>  - Cylay application is suitable for the title "Useful programs for iphone" in all respects.  Using this utility, you can easily <span>protect your phone</span> from theft or loss.  The program allows you to remotely control the phone and hide personal information from prying eyes.  This is done by creating a backup of the data and transferring them for storage to Google or Cylay; </p><p>  - IBlackList RUS - this program allows you to configure a filter for incoming SMS and phone calls; </p><p>  - For those who have been blacklisted by BeejiveIM, the UDID Faker program allows you to change the phone <span>identification number</span> ; </p><p>  - MyFox is a browser that allows you to view pages horizontally.  It is possible to restore the addresses of the last visited pages. </p><p>  And this is not all the useful iphone programs that exist today.  However, we believe that this assembly is the most efficient and user-friendly. </p>
