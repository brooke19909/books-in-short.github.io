    <p>  The beach is within walking distance, across the road.  Most of the beach is rocks, only the water has a strip of sand.  Locals recommend for the beach and swimming to buy special "hole" slippers with thick soles.  You can buy them here on every corner.  The water is clear: even when you stand up to the neck in the water, you can see your toes!  There are few people on the beach.  The beach is clean and well maintained. </p><h2>  Conditions for tourists </h2><p>  The boarding house is located in a huge park.  This is a huge territory planted with cypresses, oleanders, eucalyptus trees and palm trees.  The park is divided into zones, which are separated by eucalyptus alleys and palm. </p><p>  The boarding house lagoon (Abkhazia) provides its guests with large single and double rooms (third place may be issued additionally) in a beautiful building.  The apartments have a bathroom with shower, fridge and TV. </p>

    <p>  Vacationers can always visit the late working bar.  In the pension there is a beautiful sauna with a solarium.  For those who like to relax actively, the boarding house has football fields (with heating and grass), volleyball and basketball courts and a treadmill running track.  There are also several table tennis tables, equipment for which can be requested at the reception.  For fans of tennis there are two courts: clay and tartan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On weekends, the boarding house "Laguna" (Abkhazia) organizes discos. </p><p>  Within walking distance from the pension there are several cafes, there are shops with inexpensive products, boutiques with sea souvenirs and rental points with equipment for sports and beach holidays. </p><p>  Tourists leaving the ‚ÄúLaguna‚Äù boarding house (Abkhazia) leave good reviews.  For example, a married couple, happy with their vacation, writes that "one cannot wish for better."  The place is quiet, heavenly, the staff is helpful.  Special thanks to the vacationers of the boarding house tell the cooks. </p><p>  Older guests note comfort and cleanliness in the rooms and in the surrounding area. </p><h2>  If you are bored with a beach holiday </h2><p>  Excursion routes in these places abound.  You can buy a tour anywhere.  But vacationers recommend buying sightseeing tours right at the boarding house. </p><p>  Trips to Lake Ritsa, to evening Gagra, to alpine meadows, to a trout breeding farm, and many others are popular. </p><p>  For those who are strong in mind and body, the excursion bureau of the Laguna complex (boarding house, Abkhazia, Gechripsh) offers jipping in mountain gorges.  The route passes through Lake Ritsa and ends in alpine meadows.  The tour starts at 9 a.m. and ends at half past seven in the evening.  During this time, tourists visit many large and small waterfalls by car with an open top, find themselves on Lake Ritsa, and then on breathtaking alpine meadows.  All this on the road with bumps and a bunch of water spray.  In addition to the beauties, drivers know where you can buy good brandy or honey, where you can take cheap pictures with an owl or jump from a bungee ... The emotions received from this trip last for the whole winter. </p>

    <h2>  Extreme lovers </h2><p>  Rafting along <span>the Bzyb</span> mountain <span>river,</span> horse and boat trips, paragliding are no less exciting for tourists.  They fly paragliders in almost any resort place.  But it is in this part of Abkhazia, from the top of Mount Mamdzyshha, that you can see Mount Arabica, Cape Pitsunda, the Main Caucasian Range and the entire Gagra in full view!  The flight lasts 25-30 minutes.  At the request of the tourist, video and photography are being conducted.  Usually a paraglider lands very effectively - on an agreed place on the beach. </p><p>  In the Republic of Abkhazia (boarding house "Laguna"), the memory photos remain amazing!  Many tourists in the reviews notice that the landscapes are better than in the famous "Lord of the Rings"! </p><p>  Not the cheapest excursion is offered in Sochi.  Here the program is rich: Krasnaya Polyana, Olympic Park and Riviera Park and other fascinating places.  There are excursion routes to New Athos and to Stalin's cottage.  There is simply no time to be bored! </p><p>  Almost every excursion ends with a tasting of national Abkhazian drinks: chachi, honey wines, cognacs, etc. But there is also a separate excursion to the places of production of the famous alcohol. </p><h2>  Reservation </h2><p>  You can book rooms at the Laguna boarding house online on the official website or on tourist portals.  And also by a toll-free phone for any region of Russia. </p>
