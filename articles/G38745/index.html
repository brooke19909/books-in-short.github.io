Patong city, resort places Karon and Kata are very popular among Russian tourists.  But the northwest coast of Phuket is less known.  However, there is a unique place called Nai Yang.  This beach is interesting because casuarins grow there directly on the sand.  They look like conifers, only their needles are soft as leaves.  Thus, the beach is perfectly shaded. </p><p>  Nai Yang Bay is more suitable for a relaxing, relaxing holiday.  There are wonderful sunsets and beautiful nature.  But this is not the backyard of civilization.  There are several 4-5 star hotels in the bay.  In this article we will talk about one of them - <span>Nai Yang Beach Resort 4 *.</span>  Reviews and photos of tourists served as an informative base for our article. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Nai Young Beach Resort is just a kilometer from Phuket International Airport.  But the planes taking off and landing did not interfere with rest.  The airport does not accept flights at night.  Very close to the hotel we are describing is the vast Sirinat Park - a fabulous place, judging by the reviews.  Tourism infrastructure on the Nai Yang coast is well developed.  There is a pharmacy, several shops, fruit and fish markets, cafes and restaurants.  True, all this trading life is concentrated near the Phuket Marriott Resort &amp; Spa Naiyang Beach 5 * hotel. </p><p>  Chic "five" is located on the first line.  It can not be called the closest neighbor of our hotel, because between it and the Marriott is still a small hotel L'Esprit de Naiyang Beach Resort.  To the north, towards the airport, there are more hotels.  But they are separated from Nai Young Beach Resort by Sirinat Park.  To Patong and Phuket Town from the hotel - about 40 kilometers.  Thus, tourists claim that this resort is suitable for those who do not suffer from noisy parties and discos.  But this place cannot be called wild either. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="8.0882151" data-lng="98.29796710000005" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/7/2/1/17721.png"></div><h2>  Naiyang Beach Resort Phuket: hotel description </h2><p>  The hotel was built in 1997.  But do not be afraid of dilapidated buildings and rooms.  The last renovation was carried out in 2015. Those tourists who have visited the hotel more than once (and there are quite a few) say that in the low season something is always under construction or repair, and a new building has recently been erected.  The territory of the hotel is quite significant - 24 thousand square meters.  It stretched out into a narrow strip to the road, beyond which Nai Yang Beach immediately stretched. </p><p>  The hotel has several buildings.  In the middle stretched in a row single-storey bungalows connected among themselves, classified as oriental wing and tropical wing.  On one side of this row of cottages are two three-story buildings.  Between them are three pools.  On the other hand, two-story buildings and a building on 4 levels extend from a number of bungalows.  The whole territory is very well-groomed, landscaped.  From the Sirinat park, chipmunks, lizards, geckos run into the hotel garden, you can see turtles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nai Yang Beach Resort 4 *" class="if uuid-3228157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3228157.jpg"></div><h2>  Room Categories </h2><p>  The lowest price segment in the hotel is a tropical wing bungalow.  These one-story houses are located in the depths of the territory, away from the sea.  But in terms of amenities and area (39 sq. M.) They are no different from the bungalows in the east wing.  The small terraces of these houses overlook the garden or pool.  The buildings are more expensive rooms.  Tropical Deluxe with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã40 square meters.  m located in the depths of the territory, in a four-story building.  But thai deluxe is occupied by three-level buildings closer to the sea.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthese rooms is more - 45 square meters.  m </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel has another 24 Thai mini suites.  These rooms consist of a bedroom and a living room.  And mini-suites are located closer to the reception.  Tourists who have a deluxe ROH in their voucher, NaiYang Beach Resort Phuket are accommodated in bungalows of the east wing (closer to the sea) or in Thai deluxe.  Tourists recommend choosing the first option, since the houses have a very convenient access to the pools.  Tourists in reviews often mention that they upgraded cheap rooms to more expensive ones.  But this is possible only if there is free space. </p><h2>  Room decoration </h2><p>  The bungalow has small verandas.  And all rooms in the buildings have private balconies.  According to tourists in the reviews, the guest rooms are stylishly decorated, it is pleasant to stay in them.  Often referred to as an L-shaped sofa, which is so comfortable to watch TV.  By the way, this latter broadcasts satellite channels, and three of them are Russian.  The rooms of NaiYang Beach Resort Phuket 4 * (Thailand) have all the amenities you expect to see in the Quartet.  This is an air conditioner with an individual remote control, a mini fridge, a safe, a hairdryer, and an electric kettle with bags of drinks. </p><p>  The bathroom has a modern shower with a glass door.  Daily maids report on toiletries, tea / coffee bags and two bottles of drinking water.  Wi-Fi is free throughout.  Tourists praise its quality in reviews.  But there are numbers and cons.  This is an insufficient number of outlets.  So tourists recommend taking a tee from home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebookers.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="NaiYang Beach Resort Phuket - room description" class="if uuid-3228167" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3228167.jpg"></div><h2>  What tourists say about the rooms </h2><p>  Although travelers claim that they go to Thailand solely for the sake of the sea and excursions, they do not miss the opportunity to paint in the smallest details the conditions of their stay at the NaiYang Beach Resort Phuket 4 * hotel.  In the reviews you can read about a very spacious and comfortable king size bed and many pillows.  The air conditioner is installed so that it does not blow into the head of sleeping people.  The refrigerator is quite roomy, as is the safe.  The last fits a laptop.  But tourists say that they left the equipment without a safe and nothing was lost. </p><p>  In addition to the listed amenities, rooms include beach towels.  Their maids change every day with the baths.  The tourists had no complaints about the quality of cleaning.  The technique worked properly.  Geckos sometimes crawled out of the living creatures, but, surprisingly, no insects ‚Äî mosquitoes and cockroaches ‚Äî were noticed.  Maids are cleaned very quickly while tourists have breakfast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gites.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel NaiYang Beach Resort Phuket" class="if uuid-3228166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3228166.jpg"></div><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Morning meals are included in the room rate at NaiYang Beach Resort Phuket.  But when buying a ticket or directly at the check-in, you can pay extra for half or full board.  Breakfast is buffet style, while lunches and dinners are served √† la carte.  Morning meal is offered by the main restaurant ‚ÄúTortle Bay‚Äù (‚ÄúTurtle Bay‚Äù).  But you can have lunch and dinner at the See Sand with Thai cuisine or La Romana with Italian. </p><p>  Unfortunately, with half board you need to immediately stipulate what meal you pay.  You cannot exchange lunches for dinners after this.  As for breakfast, tourists were satisfied with them.  A lot of time has been allocated for the meal - from 7 to 10:30.  That is, everyone had time to have breakfast: both ‚Äúlarks‚Äù and ‚Äúowls‚Äù.  There were always hot dishes during the meal.  Hungry to leave breakfast was simply unrealistic.  Scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs, rice with sauce, noodles ... In addition, there were sausages, cereals, and juices.  There were always three kinds of fruits and a lot of pastries on the tables.  As for breakfast, tourists searched for only one minus - instant coffee in bags. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gites.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nai Yang Beach Resort 4 *. Reviews and photos of tourists" class="if uuid-3228164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3228164.jpg"></div><h2>  Where did the hotel guests eat during the day </h2><p>  NaiYang Beach Resort Phuket is built in the southern part of Nai Yang Beach.  Near the hotel there are many cheap cafes and more expensive restaurants.  The advantage of this resort is that you can go to different hotels and even have dinner in their establishments on the menu.  Budget tourists recommend going to the market (15 minutes leisurely step).  The fish and seafood bought there will be gutted and cooked with you! </p><p>  Also, tourists recommend buying in the stores of the 7/11 chain.  There are mini-ovens where you can warm up for a meal, and devices with drinks and containers with ice.  At lunchtime, they go directly to the beach, and the shackers drive up to the hotel.  These are such merchants with portable braziers.  Chicken kebabs, seafood, fruit and vegetable salads and even soups cost them mere pennies. </p><h2>  Beach, sea, pools </h2><p>  Nai Yang is little known among vacationers in Phuket.  Tourists from Patong go to the popular Kathu and Karon, and almost no one gets to this beach, which is located on the northwest coast of the island.  Therefore, only residents of local hotels have a rest here.  Only Marriott's representative office has its own dedicated area with sunbeds and umbrellas.  Since the NaiYang Beach Resort Phuket is located on the second line (across the road), its guests must pay for beach equipment.  It costs 200 rubles a day.  But many tourists report that they were perfectly arranged on a hotel beach towel on a soft white sand in the shade of casuarina. </p><p>  Low tides here are poorly identified.  Sunset at sea is very convenient for bathing young children.  The beach is protected by a rugged coast from winds and storms.  There is no biting plankton in the sea, but the water is not completely transparent.  You can see the fish only at full tide.  The hotel has three swimming pools.  The water in them is fresh and clean.  The pools have a sun terrace, with free sunbeds and umbrellas.  According to tourists, there is almost always deserted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trivago.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="NaiYang Beach Resort Phuket (Thailand)" class="if uuid-3228168" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3228168.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel services and infrastructure </h2><p>  The administration of NaiYang Beach Resort Phuket is doing everything possible to make people with disabilities (including wheelchairs) feel comfortable here.  Tourists with small children will be cradled in the room at no extra charge, while the restaurant has a special menu and high chairs for feeding babies.  In one of the pools there is a department with shallow water.  But the playground, as well as the mini-club, is not in the hotel. </p><p>  In general, the hotel positions itself as a place of quiet relaxation, and guests are invited to entertain themselves.  But for this, a suitable infrastructure has been created.  There is a gym, a tennis table with rackets and balls, for a fee you can play billiards.  Like many hotels in Thailand, Nai Yang Beach Resort has a small spa with various types of massage.  Parking at the hotel is free for guests.  At the 24-hour reception, you can order tickets and excursions, call a taxi, send a fax or print documents, change currency, rent a scooter or bicycle, put things in a locker.  There is a shop and a beauty salon on site. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel NaiYang Beach Resort Phuket (Thailand)" class="if uuid-3228169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3228169.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting places near the hotel </h2><p>  Since there is no animation at the Nye Young Beach Resort, guests were looking for entertainment "on the side."  Fortunately, in Thailand, unlike Egypt and Turkey, you can freely go to neighboring hotels.  The attention of tourists was attracted by the chic ‚Äúfive‚Äù Phuket Marriott Resort &amp; Spa Naiyang Beach, which is located on the first line.  Despite the fact that it has only 180 rooms, the territory of the hotel is huge.  And the lion's part is occupied by a curved horseshoe pool.  The rooms are located in 2-3-storey buildings and small villas right on the beach. </p><p>  Tourists from Nai Young Beach Resort not only used the Marriott pool, but also visited its restaurants.  If you want to have a truly luxurious and romantic dinner, reserve a table at Big Fish Restaurant &amp; Bar.  This establishment is open until one in the morning and serves delicious seafood dishes.  The See Andaman Restaurant specializes in Thai cuisine.  Both establishments have both luxurious rooms and outdoor verandas.  Tourists also recommend visiting the beautiful Sirinat Park. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iknowthepilot.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket Marriott Resort &amp; Spa Naiyang Beach" class="if uuid-3228173" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3228173.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursions from Nai Yang Beach Resort Phuket 4 * (Thailand) </h2><p>  Phuket is the largest island in the country, and it is full of attractions.  Tourists recommend to travel independently in the evening to the city of Patong.  After all, to be in Phuket and not to walk along Bangla Road is an unforgivable omission.  Tourists are also advised to go on boat trips to Koh Tachai and Khao Lak.  A trip to a floating village promises to be very interesting.  Tourists recommend taking cash with them, as pearl catchers make fine jewelry.  A set of necklaces, bracelets and earrings can be bought for almost nothing. </p><p>  Travelers also praise a kayaking tour of the mangroves.  But for such an adventure you need to be at least a little in a sporting form.  Tours are not worth buying at the NaiYang Beach Resort Phuket, but at the many outdoor offices.  They offer the same services, but one and a half times cheaper. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The lack of animation was perceived by tourists as a plus.  In general, a calm audience is resting here, aimed at a relaxing beach holiday.  Those who can‚Äôt sit still can rent a scooter and go explore the island on their own.  It‚Äôs a long way to go to Patong every night.  So partying youth at Nai Yang Resort will be bored.  Tourists note that the NaiYang Beach Resort Phuket 4 * hotel does not charge a deposit when checking in. </p>
