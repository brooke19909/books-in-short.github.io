    <p>  To get to the sea, when leaving the hotel you need to turn left, go to the intersection and turn again in the same direction.  Then you should again go to the intersection.

And there, and there you can relax very well. </p><h2>  Karon Beach Features </h2><p>  At this point in the ocean, the coastline is covered with very high silica sand.

    <p>  The coast in this place of the ocean is absolutely flat.  Therefore, shallow water is formed, convenient for bathing children.  There are absolutely no stones in the water at the entrance to the sea.  There are fewer sunbeds on this beach than on Karon.  However, there are almost always free.  Palm trees grow along the coastline, and tourists have the opportunity to sit in the shade if necessary. </p><p>  All over <span>Kata beach,</span> as well as on Karon, all kinds of cafes and restaurants are scattered.  There is no transit road along the sea here.  Do not settle on the beach and all sorts of discos.  Therefore, silence, apart from the sound of waves, practically does not violate the shore. </p><h2>  What you can visit on the island </h2><p>  A large number of different sights is what distinguishes the island of Phuket.  The Melody Phuket 3 *, in addition to an exchange office and a business corner, offers its guests excursion services.  The on- <span>site</span> office can be contacted for help if you wish to plan visits to <span>Phuket's attractions.</span> </p>
