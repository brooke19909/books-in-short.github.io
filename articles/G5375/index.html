If these are major defects or even cracks, then either buying a new phone or completely replacing the screen can help.  However, what if they are cosmetic?  Is it possible to remove scratches from the phone screen myself, using home remedies, without contacting a specialized workshop?  We will try to answer this question in our article today. </p><h2>  Using Toothpaste </h2><p>  One of the ways to remove scratches from the phone screen is to use the most ordinary toothpaste, which is found in almost every person in the bathroom and does not need to be purchased specifically for this purpose.  Due to the abrasive properties that help the toothpaste to clean tooth enamel, small scratches can be completely eliminated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oddmenot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove scratches" class="if uuid-2540421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2540421.jpg"></div><p>  The composition is applied to the treatment site with a paper towel, soft cloth, cotton swab or soft toothbrush.  For polishing, you need literally a pea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe product.  We gently rub it into the place of damage and in a circular motion remove the scratches from the phone screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="goodyfeed.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove scratches from the phone screen" class="if uuid-2540436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2540436.jpg"></div><p>  Rubbing lasts until the scratch becomes invisible.  Remember to remove the rest of the toothpaste from the phone with a soft damp cloth or a moistened cotton pad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Gel paste </h2><p>  Another option, how to remove small scratches on the phone screen, is to use not a regular toothpaste, but a gel-like one.  This option is more gentle.  So let's get started: </p><ol><li>  You need to prepare a <span>cotton pad</span> or soft cloth, on which a little gel toothpaste is applied. </li><li>  The paste is carefully rubbed into the defect.  Using movements in a circle, we remove scratches from the phone screen. </li><li>  To remove excess paste, wipe the phone with a damp cloth (the cloth is moistened with clean water). </li></ol><h2>  Car Scratch Repair Products </h2><p>  Tools to eliminate scratches on the car surface can completely destroy or minimize scratches on the phone screen. </p><p>  The method of application is simple.  Anti-scratch cream is applied to a cotton pad or soft cloth, which then wiped the phone with neat movements in a circle. </p><h2>  Fine sandpaper </h2><p>  And it's not a joke.  You just need to get sandpaper with the smallest grain size in advance and practice on an identical surface in order to practice and know specifically how to remove minor scratches on the phone screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oddmenot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="remove scratches from the phone screen" class="if uuid-2540422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2540422.jpg"></div><p>  The essence of this method is polishing or grinding the edges of the scratch.  The surface of the screen becomes concave, but visually smooth and without damage, because the reflective edges of the scratch disappear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Using baking soda </h2><p>  Soda is the most affordable way to remove scratches from the phone screen.  But there is a certain sequence: </p><ol><li>  Soda and water in a 2: 1 ratio are mixed in a small plate or cup. </li><li>  Stirring lasts until a thick, uniform paste appears. </li><li>  A finished paste of water and soda is applied to a cotton pad or soft cloth, which wipes the screen scratch.  Rubbing is done very carefully. </li><li>  The remaining excess soda solution is removed with a damp cloth. </li></ol><h2>  Baby powder </h2><p>  How can I remove scratches from the phone screen with dusting powder for young children?  Very simple: you need to make a paste by adding a little water, and use it similarly to a soda solution. </p><h2>  Oil </h2><p>  To add shine to the screen, any vegetable oil is used.  Literally 1 drop is enough for rubbing - and the worn-out phone will sparkle again, at least temporarily. </p><h2>  Glass polish </h2><p>  If your phone‚Äôs screen is glass, then you can use a glass polish (it is only necessary that cerium oxide is included).  There are two types of polish: powdery and pasty.  If you buy the first one, then to start work it must be diluted with water to the consistency of cream. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.padandquill.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="remove scratches from iPhone phone screen" class="if uuid-2540427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2540427.jpg"></div><p>  For safety, it is better to protect all areas that can be damaged during <span>polishing</span> with adhesive tape <span>.</span>  <span>It</span> can be openings for the speaker, a connector from a charge or a headset, a camera module.  If even a small amount of polish gets into any hole in the phone, it can lead to a permanent damage to the device.  If you plan to polish not the entire screen, but only parts with scratches, then all the surrounding space on the phone can also be pasted with a protective tape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Direct application of polish to the surface is done using a special soft polishing material by vigorous circular movements in order to clean the scratch.  In order to maximize the result, it is advisable to wipe the polished surface with clean cloth every half minute - say the reviews.  It is not worth it to intensively and forcefully press the surface during processing.  After all, polish has abrasive functions and can contribute to the appearance of other scratches. </p><p>  To complete the work, it is necessary to wipe the entire smartphone with polishing clean and dry material in order to finally get rid of all dirt stains and excess polish. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.7techlover.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove scratches from an iPhone screen" class="if uuid-2540435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2540435.jpg"></div><p>  Some phone models (for example, iPhone 8) have not only a glass screen, but also a glass back panel.  Having a polish, you know how to remove scratches from the iPhone screen and clean the entire case from microcracks. </p><h2>  Paste GOI </h2><p>  Such a paste for polishing precious metals, glass, mirrors and plastic is sold in the form of a solid green substance in jars or containers of one kilogram in specialized stores or automotive markets.  The composition includes chromium oxide. </p><p>  How to remove scratches from the phone screen?  The reviews say that only one type of this paste is suitable for polishing - ‚Äúespecially thin No. 1‚Äù, since others will be too rough for such a delicate matter.  Before starting work, you should wipe the phone screen from dust and other contaminants for a better and faster result. </p><p>  To polish the screen of a mobile phone, GOI paste rubs soft material, which then processes the surface of the screen.  The pasta bar is very hard and dense.  Therefore, for easier application to the fabric, a few drops of oil are added to the paste. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onlinenytt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove scratches from an iPhone phone screen" class="if uuid-2540438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2540438.jpg"></div><p>  At the end of the work with the paste, the screen is wiped with a slightly damp soft cloth. </p><h2>  Deeper scratches and cracks </h2><p>  And how to remove deep scratches from the phone screen?  Of course, all of the above methods will not be able to completely remove serious damage to the screen and deep cracks, but at least they can make them less noticeable, and then the screen will not look so sad.  Cracks and similar defects can not be completely eliminated. </p><h2>  General recommendations </h2><p>  Before you apply any of the above methods to combat scratches, you need to determine exactly which screen on the model of your phone: plastic or glass.  If the instruction with the description of the gadget has not been preserved, you can use the description of your device in online stores or on the official website page.  Determining the composition of the screen surface will help you choose which material is best to treat the damaged surface. </p><p>  The need and popularity of mobile devices is very great today, so the specialty of repairing telephones, and in particular displays, is quite in demand and widespread.  So, in the absence of free time and the desire to take risks, trying to overcome the unpresentable appearance of your phone yourself, just go to the workshop that provides this service and has experience in eliminating screen scratches.  However, in this situation it is better not to chase a low price, but to contact a reliable, specialized service center. </p><p>  If you have one of the latest models of smartphones, then you should also find out whether, on top of the protective function, there is also an oleophobic coating on the screen, which makes the process of using the phone more comfortable and enjoyable.  If such a coating is present, it is better to completely refuse or use as carefully as possible all abrasive polishing materials so as not to risk and damage the oleophobic layer.  After all, the use of such a phone after abrasive processing will be less comfortable. </p><h2>  Prevention of occurrence </h2><p>  In order not to "google" on the Internet, is it possible to remove scratches from the phone screen at home and how to do it, it is better to do everything possible in advance to protect the screen of your phone from various kinds of damage. </p><p>  What can be done: </p><ul><li>  At the very beginning, when buying a phone, put protection on the screen. </li><li>  Regularly wipe the display. </li><li>  Carefully carry the phone, especially in a bag or with you in clothes.  Try not to touch sharp objects. </li></ul><h2>  Setting screen protection </h2><p>  The most vulnerable part of any smartphone is the touch screen.  Due to mechanical stress, it is often scratched.  To prevent this unpleasant situation and not to remove scratches from the phone screen, you can use a relatively inexpensive, but reliable accessory: film or reinforced glass.  Such a protective mechanism is definitely worth installing, because installing or replacing it costs several times less than acquiring the entire screen module.  If we talk about the price, then the film is cheaper, but it does not give a one hundred percent guarantee of safety, but only eliminates the possibility of microcracks and scratches.  But glass at a price higher, but the guarantee of protection of the fragile surface of the gadget is almost complete.  In the event of a fall, the screen will not be damaged.  All impact will be taken by a <span>protective glass.</span> </p><h2>  Display Wipe </h2><p>  Usually, small scratches are the result of the presence of dust, sand and other small particles on the surface of the phone.  Wipe the display regularly with microfiber.  This procedure will not only remove scratches from the phone screen, but also contribute to the improvement of the device.  After all, the touch screen may lose sensitivity due to mud stains that are left from fingerprints, faces, etc. </p><h2>  Neatly worn </h2><p>  At the present pace of life, it is impossible to live a second without a phone, so he should always be with a person.  For this reason, when moving it, they put it in a pocket, bag, purse, backpack, etc.  But in these places there can be not only a telephone, but also other objects with sharp ends (for example, keys), which inflict both small and irreparable damage.  Therefore, it is extremely important to always check where the phone is placed and what is there, next to it.  It is advisable that the bag or pocket be zipped.  This will prevent the possibility of accidental slipping of the phone while moving. </p><h2>  How else can you protect yourself from scratch problems? </h2><p>  In order not to burden yourself with protection settings and regular anti-scratch procedures, you can choose a mobile phone with heavy-duty glass already.  For example, you do not need to remove scratches from the Gorilla Glass screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.7techlover.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove scratches from an iPhone phone" class="if uuid-2540434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72116/2540434.jpg"></div><p>  Phones have a special glass.  Gorilla Glass is chemically tempered to withstand bumps and scratches.  Produces his company Corning.  Since 1959, this company has been conducting experiments with the chemical treatment of glass.  Since 2010, leading mobile phone manufacturing companies (such as Nokia, Samsung, Motorola, NTS and others) have begun using the ultra-strong Gorilla Glass as a screen surface on their models.  So, buying a smartphone with a Gorilla Glass glass screen, you don‚Äôt have to worry about how to remove scratches from the screen of the Samsung phone and other leading modern manufacturers. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we found out how to remove scratches from a smartphone.  As you can see, there are many ways to fix defects.  And all of them are easily repeated at home without experience. </p>
