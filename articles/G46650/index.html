In addition, the resort boasts wonderful landscapes and clean air. </p><h2>  Hotel base in Pitsunda </h2><p>  Mini-hotels are the most common accommodation option for travelers in Abkhazia.  A small two-, three-story complex, a hospitable hostess and homemade food undoubtedly attract tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pizunda mini hotels" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/1170303.jpg" width="600"></div>  As a rule, tourists come to the city and reserve and buy rooms on the spot, which is very risky due to their high workload, especially in the high season - from early June to late September.  Therefore, it is more advantageous in this case to contact tourist operators - the cost is exactly the same as at the reception, and the problems are much less with checking into a hotel.

    <p>  Pitsunda, it is worth noting, does not have a large selection of mini-complexes - only ‚ÄúApsara‚Äù or ‚ÄúCottages on the Cypress Alley‚Äù.  There are boarding houses and sanatoriums, such as the Literary Fund - the only one on the entire resort coast that has official permission to carry out medical activities, or the Mussera. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pearl of the resort </h2><p>  Hotel "Dolphin" (Pitsunda) is a real unique place for these places, which are famous for modest accommodation options.

In addition, the water in it is fresh and is heated throughout the day. </li><li>  A gym and sports games, including table tennis, volleyball court and tennis court, are offered for free by the Dolphin (hotel). </li><li>  Pitsunda is quite popular among athletes in the summer - you can have a great time with an instructor from the center of water-motor sports, doing windsurfing, cutting waves on a jet ski or jet ski. </li><li>  For children, the beach has colorful inflatable slides and a spacious playground under a canopy. </li><li>  Also at the reception you can find a package of tours in Abkhazia and book your favorite. </li></ul><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  "Dolphin" is a hotel (Pitsunda), which offers travelers to stay in the main building or in one of the cottages on the territory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Double two-room suite with panoramic views of the Black Sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel pizunda" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/1170292.jpg" width="600"></div>  Room size is 37 square meters, capacity - up to four people (two in the main places, 2 on sofas or eurofolds at will).

    <h2>  Another option for a quality vacation is ‚ÄúIren‚Äù (hotel) </h2><p>  Pitsunda is a beautiful place with magnificent nature and one of the best complexes on the outskirts.  "Iren" is a hotel for people who want a high degree of comfort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iren pizunda hotel" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/1170295.jpg" width="550"></div>  Own large landscaped area with children's playgrounds near the sea, tasty and varied food, new bright rooms - all this is crazy like tourists.  This hotel is more modest than the Dolphin, but it is designed more for active travelers, since from here you can quickly get to the center of a city like Pitsunda.  The hotel does not offer a rich internal infrastructure, but outside the complex there are a lot of it - cafes, restaurants, and attractions.
