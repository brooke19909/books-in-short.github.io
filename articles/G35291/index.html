The Central Bank license was issued in 2001, when the institution was transformed into a closed joint-stock company.  The history of the Raiffeisen group begins in the middle of the 19th century, when the first mutual aid funds appeared, supporting peasants during the famine.  The founder of the group was Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen. </p><h2>  Branch network </h2><p>  The first Raiffeisenbank bank in Moscow appeared in 1996.  The merger with Imexbank turned the organization into the largest <span>foreign bank in the Russian Federation.</span>  The reorganization procedure was completed in November 2006.  And already in December, the bank began to provide its services to customers under the Raiffeisenbank brand.  Branches in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Khabarovsk today serve 12 thousand corporate clients.  In 2013, the credit institution merged its ATM network with UniCreditBank, and after 3 years - with BINbank.  So more than 3 thousand ATMs are available to cardholders.  The whole network has 200 separate divisions, including additional (98), operational (86), credit and cash offices (6).  9.5 thousand people are engaged in <span>customer service</span> . </p>

The platinum World Map from VTB 24 is recognized as the leader.  Raiffeisenbank products won in other nominations: </p><ul><li>  During the year, the maximum volume of transactions was calculated using an Austrian Airlines credit card. </li><li>  In the nomination "Maximum Benefit" - credit card "VseSrau". </li></ul><p>  Customer attitude to the bank is built around payment instruments.  Therefore, the presence of optimal <span>loyalty programs</span> can be the impetus for the development of a credit institution.  The presence of such programs contributes to an increase in the number of card transactions.  According to statistics, approximately 30% of all transactions on the market were carried out using a debit card.  The number of operations using a card with a loyalty program is 16% higher. </p>

    <p>  SMS banking has also been finalized.  Clients have the opportunity to transfer funds between cards and pay for communication services using SMS commands.  The average transaction amount for 2015 amounted to 4 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Restructuring </h2><p>  The decision to reduce the <span>regional network was</span> caused by low development indicators for 2014.  Net income declined (as a result of the acquisition of Impexbank) by 62%.  The amount of funds in accounts increased by 17%, and for individuals - by 19%.  It is important for the bank to remain super profitable.  Mortgage, consumer loans and cards are more promising areas of development, according to analysts at Raiffeisenbank.  ATMs in Moscow now include not only their own branch network, but also ATM UniCreditBank and BINbank. </p><p>  The development strategy of a financial institution also provides for the refusal to provide car loans.  According to bank analysts, this area is unprofitable in the long run.  New contracts have not been opened since March 2015.  In all new branches, this service is not provided at all.  Terms of customer service under the old contracts have not changed. </p><p>  According to the restructuring plan, in 2015, branches were closed in the Irkutsk, Volgograd, Chelyabinsk, Ivanovo, Kirov, Belgorod regions.  At the same time, Raiffeisenbank's offices were opened in Moscow (6 new branches) and in the Far Eastern regions with a high demand for banking services - Magadan, Vladivostok, Yakutsk, Khabarovsk, Blagoveshchensk and Petropavlovsk. </p><h2>  Raiffeisenbank in Ukraine </h2><p>  The situation is not better in the neighboring region.  The bank‚Äôs withdrawal from the Crimea and Donbass led to a significant reduction in the network of branches.  At the beginning of 2013, the group included 13.7 thousand employees working in 822 branches.  In the third quarter of 2014, the number of employed persons fell to 10.3 thousand employees, and the number of offices is 617. This trend, unfortunately, continues. </p>

    <p>  Although in 2016 the situation improved slightly.  Bank profit for the first half increased by 13.1% for the quarter.  The volume of total assets increased by 4%, the volume of loans decreased by 1.8%.  The total liability increased by 1.3%.  In the NBU rating for the 1st quarter of 2016, Raiffeisenbank occupied 5th place. </p><p>  In 2005, the Ukrainian "daughter" was bought by an Austrian group.  In July 2015, the EBRD began the process of joining the capital of the Ukrainian branch of Raiffeisenbank.  The Antimonopoly Committee authorized the repurchase of a 25% stake in Bank Aval. </p><h2>  Financial performance </h2><p>  According to the results of the 3rd quarter of 2015, the bank ranked 14th in terms of assets in the Russian market, 11th in terms of capital, 7th in terms of funds.  The Russian branch in terms of assets to the Polish ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù RBI (‚Ç¨ 12.2 billion in Russia and ‚Ç¨ 14.7 billion in Poland), but its contribution to the profit of the whole structure is more than 50%.  In 2015, Russian business made a profit of ‚Ç¨ 253 million, and Polish - ‚Ç¨ 40 million, however, the issue of selling the most profitable asset arose in connection with the need to reduce investments in risky assets.  According to planned estimates, in order to maintain a bank in the Russian Federation in 2017, ‚Ç¨ 8.2 should be spent.  Another reason is that according to the results of the ECB stress test in 2014, RBI showed the weakest result among European banks.  Then it was decided to reduce market presence by 20%. </p>

    <h2>  Survive the crisis </h2><p>  In May 2015, it became known that Raiffeisen Bank International was selling its assets worth 25.285 billion rubles.  in the Russian Federation.  We are talking about the sale of the same name NPF to the BIN group.  According to Karl Sevelda, the head of the holding, the development strategy of the Raiffeisen group provides for a switch from Russia and Ukraine to the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania.  In these regions, there is a higher demand for banking services. </p><p>  Until recently, the possibility of selling the Polish ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù of RBI, which in terms of assets corresponds to the Russian one, was discussed.  For RBI, the issue of reducing risky assets is still relevant.  It is impossible to achieve the goal without the sale of "subsidiary" points.  The deal in Poland fell apart due to tightened banking regulation.  There are not many buyers for the largest bank (TOP-15) in the Russian Federation. </p>
