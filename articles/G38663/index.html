  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to Learn to Save Money Properly</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The acute or chronic problem of lack of money periodically concerns almost all of us.  In search of a way out of it, we ask parents for money, borrow from acquaintances, take bank loans, etc. At the same time, the problem is temporarily solved, but its reason remains unchanged.  What is this reason?  The fact that our expenses are trying to exceed revenues, hence the lack of money.  Debts growing <span>exponentially,</span> stress, anxiety and bad mood, the search for the guilty are enough reason to think about how to learn how to save money.  What needs to be done so that it is sufficient not only for everyday needs, but also for achieving long-term goals, for fulfilling desires that have a material form? </p><h2>  Why save money </h2><p>  Most likely, you already have interesting plans for acquiring something at a significant cost.  Perhaps this is a new car, a comfortable apartment, new home appliances, expensive furniture, a diamond necklace or a trip abroad.  The more specific and specific your goal, the easier it is to move towards it.  Visualize your goal as much as possible, imagine yourself in it: at the wheel of a car, on a tourist trip, etc. Dreaming is a must!  Your goal will not be achieved unless you set clear deadlines for it.  Make a schedule of savings and keep it in front of your eyes, mark the steps that have already been taken, admire the progress.  In addition to pleasant dreams, the purpose of your savings can be more important life goals, for example, creating a financial pillow for unforeseen situations, pension savings for a secured old age, and savings for children‚Äôs education. </p><h2>  Where to get money for accumulation </h2><p>  Money for savings comes from the same place where your everyday expenses are financed: wages and income from your own business.  If your income is limited by wages, then set yourself a certain percentage, which you will save in your "piggy bank".  This should be an amount that will not cause you significant discomfort and the feeling that you are infringing on yourself.  If the profit from the business is your main source of income, you can also set a percentage or send a certain amount on a monthly basis for accumulation.  At least 10% of wages and other income should be set aside.  Practice shows that if you do not immediately postpone part of your income after it arrives, then at the end of the month you will have nothing to direct for savings, everything will go to everyday expenses.  If possible, then you can put aside more - 20-30% of income.  The revision of your expenses towards their reduction deserves special attention, but this is a topic for another discussion.  If you want to save more, look for sources of extra income.  It‚Äôs good when your income is diversified, that is, made up of various incomes, then if you lose one of the sources, your standard of living will suffer less. </p><h2>  Where to store savings </h2><p>  The easiest way for small amounts of savings - ordinary envelopes.  If you put it off for several purposes, then there will be several envelopes - according to their number.  The advantage of this method is its simplicity.  But if your willpower is not enough, then this method will not work, there is always the temptation to "take a little bit."  If you save up for large acquisitions (car, apartment, etc.), then the best way to accumulate is to deposit in a bank.  Moreover, this should not be a bank card with which you can easily withdraw money, but a deposit account.  Go around the nearby banks and pick up a term deposit.  Depending on your goals, it can be for six months, a year, three years, etc. This deposit should be able to replenish the account and unfavorable conditions for early termination.  When the account goes at the level of hundreds of thousands of rubles, you need to think about diversification: open several accounts in different banks, a foreign currency account, start investing in mutual funds, etc. Here you can‚Äôt do without a financial consultant.  It is definitely not worth saving on it if you want to maximize the effectiveness of your investments.  If you streamline the attitude to your money in such simple ways, you will understand how to learn how to save money, which in the end will allow you to achieve financial independence and bring closer the fulfillment of your desires.  Do you dream about it? </p></div></article>
