They show interest in the "filling" and design.  But there are those who do not miss a single novelty at all, and they not only study the reviews, but also try to purchase them among the first if possible.  Of course, devices of famous brands attract genuine interest.  These include LG.  She has been manufacturing smartphones for a long time, so she has a considerable number of fans.  Under this brand, gadgets of different price categories are sold.  Of course, they differ in hardware.  But the company is trying to keep up to date, therefore, regularly presents to customers various innovative developments. </p><p>  In early 2017, the LG X Power 2 M320 smartphone appeared on sale.  Reviews about this model are not so widely represented, but there are already the first users who shared their impressions of the new product.  Based on their comments, as well as the specifications declared by the manufacturer, it turned out to be an overview of this phablet.  It will tell not only about the features of the device, but also about the advantages, as well as disadvantages.  So, let's begin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone lg x power 2 m320 reviews" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2012815.jpg" width="600"></div>

Currently, most companies have already abandoned the bright design.  Now laconicism and minimalism are in fashion.  Such a buyer will see the packaging of the smartphone LG X Power 2 M320 Gold and other color options.  All panels are plain.  To design the box, the designers chose a nice silver tint.  It looks stylish, and most importantly, solid.  There are no bright elements.  The buyer will not find the device image either.  A large letter X flaunts on the front panel. Next to it only power 2 is printed in a smaller font. In the lower left corner there was a place for the company logo.  It is also duplicated at the ends and lateral faces.  All inscriptions are made in black.  There is a sticker that shows information about the serial number, manufacturer, country where the assembly was carried out, etc. </p><p>  Now it's time to find out what this stylish box is hiding.  After unpacking, the first thing that opens to the eye is the smartphone LG X Power 2 M320.  The manufacturer did not provide a cover in the kit.  But it does not matter.  If necessary, it can be purchased separately.  The phone itself is laid in a special substrate, which protects it from accidental deformation during transportation.  If you take it out of the box, you can see the documentation, and under it a 1.8 A power adapter and a USB cable. </p><p>  Currently, the manual does not contain detailed information on how to configure the gadget, since the interface of the operating system is intuitive, but still there are some interesting points.  For example, a description of the original accessories and a list of service centers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many users believe that the set of components for such a smartphone could be expanded with branded headphones or at least a bumper.  But alas, the manufacturer decided that this would be quite enough. </p><h2>  Characteristics briefly </h2><p>  Before you begin a detailed review of the smartphone LG X Power 2 M320, briefly introduce the reader a list of the main characteristics. </p><ul><li>  Material: plastic. </li><li>  Weight: 164 g. </li><li>  Diagonal and display technology: IPS, 5.5 ‚Ä≥. </li><li>  Pixel density and screen resolution: 267 ppi, 720 √ó 1280 px. </li><li>  Main chipset: <span>MediaTek MT6750</span> (1500 MHz). </li><li>  OS: seventh Android. </li><li>  The volume of "RAM": 2 GB. </li><li>  Integrated Storage: 16 GB. </li><li>  Video Card: Mali-T860 MP2. </li><li>  Communication Standard: 2 G / 3G / 4G. </li><li>  SIM card slots: two, nano. </li><li>  Battery: 4.5 thousand mAh. </li><li>  Optics: main - 13 megapixels, front - 5 megapixels. </li><li>  Dimensions: 154.7 √ó 78.1 √ó 8.4 mm. </li><li>  Optional: USB On-The-Go cable, flashlight, micro-SD. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  In terms of appearance, the smartphone LG X Power 2 M320 reviews get more neutral.  The reason for this was a rather simple design.  Already in 2017, users want to see some interesting solutions.  But the company did not focus on design.  The ‚Äútrick‚Äù of this phone is other characteristics, and which ones we will tell a little later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The body of the gadget is completely made of plastic.  The surface is glossy, the texture pattern is slightly visible on the back cover.  The screen is excellent even in the sun.  However, according to users, thick frames spoil the big picture.  This is evidenced by some reviews. </p><p>  The LG X Power 2 M320 smartphone, unfortunately, already looks outdated.  Indeed, now the market is flooded with gadgets made of glass and metal, which is why it creates not the most pleasant feeling when interacting with this model.  But there is also a category of users that appreciates simple design solutions.  It was they who became fans of the device. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that the frame passing along the perimeter of the body is made of metal.  At least so stated in the specifications.  However, those buyers who already had the opportunity to study the phone doubt it.  Time will tell.  In addition to the screen, on the front panel there is a front camera equipped with a flash, which also performs the function of a flashlight.  The speaker hole is framed by a chrome mesh.  A logo flaunts in place of the familiar control panel.  And the working buttons are transferred to the screen. </p><p>  On the side faces, as usual, there is a power key (on the right), a ‚Äúrocker‚Äù for changing the volume, trays for SIM cards and an external drive (on the left).  It is worth noting that the latter is displayed separately, which is rarely seen in modern devices.  Owners can use both a memory card and a SIM. </p><p>  We continue to study the location of the functional elements of the LG X Power 2 M320 Gold.  At the bottom there is a microphone hole, micro-USB (port for connecting a cable) and a jack for audio.  On the back cover is a fairly large camera lens.  Why was this solution chosen?  Users could not solve the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe developers.  At least most owners find this strange.  Next to it is a flash.  The company logo flaunts in the center of the lid.  At the bottom left of the speaker.  There are no comments on its location, but the sound is muffled a little if you put the smartphone on a soft surface. </p><p>  The location of the controls and the design of the case correspond not only to the gold instance, but also to other colors. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  What screen size is implemented in the smartphone LG X Power 2 M320?  5.5 inches  It is this indicator that allows you to classify the gadget as a phablet.  Users noticed that the display is quite high quality.  It is manufactured using IPS technology, so that even with direct sunlight, it will be convenient to use the phone.  Resolution could be implemented much more.  The maximum of this model is HD quality (in pixels - 1280 √ó 720).  This, of course, is also a decent indicator, but after Full HD it looks somehow poor.  But let's not talk about sad things.  The brightness level range is optimally selected, so the owners will not feel any discomfort while working with the device both in a dark room and in the sun.  The resolution of the screen is a little alarming, but the density of 267 ppi does not allow pixels to stand out in the image.  Notice the "squares" can only be armed with a magnifying glass.  Viewing angles, although not ideal, but quite wide.  When tilted, the image contrast decreases markedly, but the color remains the same. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone lg x power 2 m320 gold" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2012817.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Separately, pay attention to the protective glass LG X Power 2 M320.  The manufacturer installed <span>Gorilla Glass</span> in the device <span>.</span>  Its properties are already well known to users.  Glass perfectly tolerates mechanical stress and is resistant to various kinds of damage.  The developers abandoned the air gap between him and the matrix.  This greatly improved image quality. </p><p>  The reviews also talk about the color level.  The transmission of shades is so amazing that I just do not want to look away from the screen.  Upset owners only the lack of settings that would allow you to change the color temperature. </p><p>  Describing the screen, you can not keep silent about the option In-Cell Touch.  She is responsible for the quick response of the sensor while touching.  This function works fine.  Those who like to read a lot are advised to use the comfortable reading mode. <strong></strong></p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The largest number of positive reviews smartphone LG X Power 2 M320 received thanks to the new version of the Android OS.  The interface is well thought out.  There are no difficulties in using.  Settings can be made for several minutes.  The menu prompts you to select a theme.  The most sparing for autonomy is dark, but each user can experiment and choose the most optimal option for himself.  All basic settings are identical to previous versions of Android.  In addition to them, there are additional ones.  These include resizing shortcuts, a color filter, and setting navigation keys. </p><p>  Now users have the opportunity to install on the locked screen of the smartphone LG X Power 2 M320 Gold screensaver with an analog clock.  It looks quite impressive and, most importantly, practically does not consume battery life. </p><p>  Users enthusiastically took the opportunity to customize the desktop interface.  Three modes are available: simple, with and without applications.  Also note that you can perform various manipulations with shortcuts, as well as create new ones or delete old ones. </p><p>  And the most popular option, which is often noted in the comments by the owners of the gadget, is the ‚Äúquick‚Äù button.  Everyone can individually program a certain key for the given actions. </p>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  What will help to understand the level of performance of the smartphone LG X Power 2 M320?  Reviews of happy owners!  Of course, the manufacturer indicates the technical specifications for the device, but not everyone understands what the clock frequency or computing modules are. </p><p>  First, let's provide the information declared by the developers.  The phablet is based on a fairly powerful chipset of the Chinese company MediaTek.  Of course, it cannot be compared with ‚Äúapple‚Äù devices in terms of performance, but it still gets a high expert rating.  The MT6750 processor is based on eight Cortex-A53 compute modules.  The maximum that they are capable of is the frequency of 1500 MHz.  For hardware, the developers also chose a graphics accelerator with two cores - Mali-T860 MP2.  Two gigabytes of RAM complements these characteristics. </p><p>  Now let's see what the owners of the LG X Power 2 M320 think about the level of performance.  For its price category, the phablet shows average results.  The 64-bit system allows you to install modern applications and games.  As for the latter, they start smoothly, work without brakes.  In principle, the smartphone copes with all the tasks.  When the load increases, the processor noticeably heats up, but not critical.  Those who constantly play, for example, 3D games, are advised to install a special program that will monitor the load of RAM and temperature conditions. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  We will dwell on the amount of internal memory in more detail.  This indicator is quite important, since the latest versions of the Android OS do not allow unpacking application files to an external drive.  It can only be used to store music, videos, photos.  How much integrated memory is in the LG X Power 2 M320?  16 GB!  And it's all?  So a large number of users were indignant.  What is 16 GB?  Unfortunately, they are not enough.  And even when the owners of the device learn that out of the declared 16, only 9 are available, there is no limit to the indignation. </p><p>  Yes, the manufacturer has implemented support for memory cards, and their volume can reach up to 2 TB.  But this does not help in working with applications.  Will have the old fashioned way, before installing a new game, remove the old one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg x power 2 m320 glass" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2012821.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Battery specifications and battery life reviews </h2><p>  Phone LG X Power 2 M320 is positioned as a phablet, equipped with a fairly capacious battery.  It was on this that the manufacturer emphasized.  And it is worth noting, I did not lose.  For example, design is a matter of taste, but the battery life is already a necessity.  This feature played an important role in choosing a name for the model.  No wonder the word power is present in it. </p><p>  The gadget runs on battery power, the capacity of which is as much as 4,500 milliamps per hour.  Surprised?  The device is able to play video at high brightness for about 12-15 hours.  And this already indicates a lot, especially when you consider that the hardware platform is not energy efficient and the display resolution is not the lowest. </p><p>  Connoisseurs of the brand noticed that the predecessor had a battery capacity of 400 mAh less, and then it had a long battery life. </p><p>  The manufacturer claims in the specifications that the new generation of the smartphone is able to provide the user with 18 hours of surfing the Internet, 14 hours with the GPS module.  In combined mode, the phone can not be charged for three days!  Impressive?  And no less important - it takes only 2 hours to recharge the battery. </p><h2>  Pictures for memory.  Camera Reviews </h2><p>  It's time to consider what the camera is capable of in the LG X Power 2 M320.  The gadget is equipped with two modules.  This does not surprise anyone.  But the permission of the owners will please.  The main camera is based on a 13-megapixel sensor.  It may well compete with cameras.  The pictures are great.  In the settings, there are several modes that the user can select manually.  Also available here is the function for resizing photos.  These, of course, are not flagship indicators, but the requirements are quite consistent with this price category. </p><p>  Smartphone LG X Power 2 M320, unfortunately, can not boast of a high resolution front camera.  But the quality of the pictures is quite competitive.  The optics are equipped with a flash, which allows you to get photos with good color reproduction.  For selfie, you can activate automatic mode.  There is also a feature for face recognition and gestures.  As for the latter, the shutter will work, for example, by unclenching the fist, and then by compression. </p><p>  Impressions of the camera users have developed good.  The quality of the video does not cause comments.  When opening clips on a large screen, pixelation is invisible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg m320 x power 2 4g" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2012819.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Communications </h2><p>  The LG X Power 2 M320 4G works with all well-known networking standards.  It perfectly accepts wireless, satellite and network signals.  Separately, we pay attention to support for 4G.  Unfortunately, it has not yet been implemented throughout Russia, however, in large cities, connecting to it will not be a problem.  Data transfer speed is fast.  The signal of mobile operators is stable. </p><p>  Users also noticed the navigation module.  It works clearly, determines the location without errors, which cannot but rejoice.  If you wish, the smartphone can be used as a navigator.  Among other things, the device is equipped with a wireless Wi-Fi module and can act as an access point.  Distributing the Internet to other devices will not be a problem, and the speed will practically not decrease.  Owners can use Bluetooth to transfer files.  In this model, the developers installed version 4.2, which is considered energy efficient. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages according to users </h2><p>  At the end of the review of the smartphone LG X Power 2 M320 I would like to summarize the information received.  The novelty went on sale this year, but it already has fans.  Of course, the famous brand played an important role, but the manufacturer was not stingy with the characteristics.  What, according to the owners, are the benefits? </p><ul><li>  The capacious battery provides a long period of operation on a single charge. </li><li>  Great sound through speakers and headphones.  The company has already established itself in this criterion only on the positive side. </li><li>  The new version of the operating system. </li><li>  User settings, in particular, changing the assignment of control keys. </li><li>  Beautiful, and most importantly, intuitive interface. </li><li>  Excellent quality pictures and videos taken with the main camera. </li><li>  Screen resolution and realistic color reproduction. </li><li>  Optimum brightness range. </li><li>  Fast charge battery. </li><li>  Powerful hardware platform, although not energy efficient. </li></ul><p> But what are the negative reviews talking about?  LG X Power 2 M320 received the most complaints for the body material.  And this is not at all surprising.  Even in the budget segment there are metal models (though they are assembled in China).  As for the design, a bright negative was not noticed, but nevertheless, the design could be thought up and more original.  The resolution of the front camera slightly spoiled the positive impression, but not critical.  In principle, this is where significant shortcomings end. </p><p>  After analyzing all the reviews of this model, you can put a ‚Äúsolid‚Äù nine on a 10-point scale.  And this is a worthy result. </p><h2>  Who is it for? </h2><p>  Now, after all the features of the gadget have been studied, it became clear who this model is suitable for.  It is designed for those who put the long life of battery life in the forefront, despite the fact that this affects some functions.  Most often, in such devices camera performance is underestimated, the level of performance is not the highest, the design is somewhat outdated.  Although there are not many such buyers, there is a demand for a smartphone. </p><p>  It looks great in the hand.  Characteristics will satisfy even respectable people.  Young people will be interested to deal with new offers of the operating system.
