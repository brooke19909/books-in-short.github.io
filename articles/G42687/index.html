In general, the manufacturing company for the most part focuses specifically on the budget segment.  This, in principle, is noticeable.  Nevertheless, this is not about that now. </p>

    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  Smartphone Doogee <span>X5 (X5C)</span> replenished the model range of the company's devices in 2015.  Although the company's product line consisted of several interesting models even before this time.  For example, ‚Äúsmartphones‚Äù such as the Doogee Nova and Doogee Y100 Pro distinguished themselves ‚Äúin battle‚Äù.  Note that all these devices are located in approximately the same price segment, they cost around $ 100.  Well, of course, not without scatter.  But it is one or two dozen conventional units.  This is the maximum. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  Perhaps the time has come to open the box and see what is inside it.  Before us is a beautiful device that has impressive functionality.  The Doogee X5 phone, reviews of which will be given at the end of the article, is striking in its predisposition to fairly demanding toys, as well as high performance.  But first things first. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Brief Specifications </h2><p>  What can surprise us with the Doogee X5, an overview of which is presented in the article?  Let us first give its main parameters. </p><p>  So, the hardware stuffing consists of the processor manufacturer Mediatek.  This is the MT6580 model.  For those who do not understand the names of devices, we tell: this processor consists of four cores and operates at a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz. </p><p>  The user was provided with 1 gigabyte of RAM.  It is clear that part of it is ‚Äúeaten up‚Äù by software applications and related software.  Nevertheless, this is enough even for demanding games.  As a long-term memory, the phone has 8 GB chips.  In addition, the owner of the phone can always separately purchase microSD drives. </p><p>  The display has a diagonal of 5 inches and displays a picture in HD quality.  It is made according to IPS technology.  And this means, in turn, that the user will be able to read text from the screen for a long time and watch movies on it without much harm to their eyes. </p>

    <p>  But here's what will not please the owner of the Doogee X5, an overview of which is given in the article, is the camera.  The main one has a resolution of 5 megapixels, and additional (front) has only 2 megapixels.  This, of course, is not enough. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù version 5.1 is installed as software.  Which, however, is not bad. </p><p>  There is a complete set of communication modules.  This is ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù version 4.0, and Wi-Fi, and GPS. </p><p>  The battery life of the Doogee X5, the review of which we present, has become one of the main advantages of the phone.  The battery has a capacity of 2400 mAh, which is very, very good. </p><p>  Supports the work of two SIM cards.  They must be installed in the appropriate MicroSIM slots. </p><p>  Perhaps, the listing of the main characteristics of the phone will end on this, and we will immediately proceed to consider the appearance of the device. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Of course, taking into account the price of the device (and it is about $ 50), there is no need to talk about any sophistication.  The case is made of fairly cheap plastic.  The appearance of the device is not just business or serious (as they say, a workhorse): it is severe.  The real apparatus of a secret agent.  The shape of the device is rectangular, angular. </p><h2>  Dimensions and bonuses </h2><p>  In all three planes, the phone‚Äôs dimensions are 142 x 72 x 9 millimeters.  At the same time, together with the battery, the device weighs 165 grams. </p>

    <p>  From the very beginning, a protective film will be glued to the device.  That‚Äôs the kind of encouragement that came up with the engineers (possibly marketers) of the company. </p><h2>  Front Panel </h2><p>  In the front you can see proximity and light sensors.  They are located directly above the display.  There is also an auditory speaker and an additional camera.  Below you can find touch controls - buttons that are typical for devices running the Android operating system.  They, of course, are under the screen.  The backlight for the touch keys, alas, is not provided.  Yes, and there is no event indicator. </p><h2>  Bottom end </h2><p>  Here is a conversational microphone.  Its location can be called convenient.  This part of the device also houses the main sound speaker.  It provides a loud sound for the phone, you definitely will not miss a call. </p><h2>  Top end </h2><p>  If we look here, we will immediately find two connectors.  The first, a standard of 3.5 millimeters, is designed to connect a wired stereo headset to the device.  The second is nothing more than a MicroUSB format connector. </p><h2>  Right side </h2><p>  It has volume controls and a power connector.  It is worth noting that the buttons are pressed clearly, without subsidence.  That is why there should be no complaints to the phone in the corresponding plan. </p><h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  The back cover of the device is also made of matte plastic.  But you should not think that spots will not appear on it.  Of course, they will arise there during the operation of the phone.  The device most likely looks better in white.  There, such shortcomings will not be so obvious.  The black version of the device, as noted in the reviews, is very easily soiled.  Nevertheless, experts suggest that in the near future a large number of covers for the device will appear on the smartphone markets, since it has become very popular. </p>

    <p>  No backlash was noticed in the device, nothing creaks.  The back cover is held tight, just like that, by itself, it will not fly off the phone.  In general, there are no complaints in this regard. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The display, as stated at the beginning of the article, is made using IPS technology, which reduces eye strain.  The screen size is 5 inches, while it displays a picture in HD quality.  If you combine all these three facts together, then it is no exaggeration to say that for such money this is the most real gift.  Individual pixels are very, very faint. </p><p>  There is a small layer of air gap.  The screen has a large margin of brightness, it has good viewing angles. </p><h2>  Doogee <span>X5 (X5C):</span> owner reviews and results </h2><p>  What can be said in conclusion of the article?  The phone is not perfect, but you don‚Äôt expect this for fifty dollars, is it?  One could analyze for a very long time each factor, each feature of the device, in order to thoroughly compile a list of all the advantages and disadvantages of the device.  And it is not known what would be more in it.  But we don‚Äôt need it!  Therefore, we simply analyze everything in general terms. </p><p>  So, for its price category, this is a great option.  Better to find will be very difficult, if at all possible.  Each ruble paid for it by the smartphone fulfills in full.  The budget from the device is simply excellent, this was mentioned at the beginning of the article.  Many users who have purchased a smartphone, note hardware stuffing corresponding to the price level. </p><p>  <span>Nevertheless</span> , the device also has weaknesses.  The main, probably, is a poor-quality, weak camera.  In second place is a strict, tasteless design.  One could compare the device with other smartphones located in the same lineup.  But such a comparison will be ambiguous and incorrect due to the low cost of the subject of our review.  No more particular flaws were identified.  Pleases buyers and battery life. </p><p>  Thus, if you need a cheap device with high performance, but you are not a fan of "selfie" and generally photos, then feel free to buy this smartphone. </p>
