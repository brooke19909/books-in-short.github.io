All our photos, music, important documents are now in electronic format and stored in memory.  On the one hand, it is very convenient, on the other - one wrong press, and all files disappear in an instant. </p><p>  The good news is that you can still recover the data, the bad news is that you will have to spend time and nerves if you do not want to spend money and consult a specialist.  The complexity of file recovery depends on where they were located - in the phone‚Äôs memory or on the SD card.  Let's try to figure out how to recover data on Android in various ways. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tr.fobito.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover data on an android phone" class="if uuid-2758573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44778/2758573.jpg"></div><h2>  Training </h2><p>  You can erase the necessary files in any random way, for example, if, without thinking, reset to the factory settings or delete the wrong files from the manager.  Another option is flashing the gadget. </p><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter how the problem occurred, the main thing is to always remember the basic rule: if files were accidentally deleted before recovering data on Android, try to use the device as little as possible.  The fact is that if other files appear on the drive, the old ones cannot be returned. </p><h2>  If the SD card is cleared </h2><p>  So, if data loss occurred from a flash card, returning the lost will not be difficult.  All you need is a computer and, in fact, an SD card. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first thing to do is download a special program, of which there are a great many on the Internet.  But it is better if it is a free utility, for example Recuva or TestDisk. </p><p>  It remains only to insert the memory card into the computer and scan it through the installed program.  If everything is done correctly, the data should be restored.  Do not forget to save the saved files after recovering the data on Android. </p><div class="photo" data-original="conhecimentodigitall.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover data from android after" class="if uuid-2758558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44778/2758558.jpg"></div><h2>  Is there life after hard reset? </h2><p>  Often, users, finding no other way out, reset their phone to factory settings.  In this case, the SD card remains untouched, that is, all files on the memory card are saved, but the phone‚Äôs memory is erased completely. </p><p>  For those who are wondering how to restore data reset on Android after hard reset, the answer is simple: all the same third-party utilities will help.  The problem is that the file recovery program may not support a specific phone model.  Therefore, it makes sense to start trying the free version.  The list of programs that can recover deleted data on Android - both on the phone and on the tablet: </p><ul><li>  EaseUS MobiSaver; </li><li>  iSkySoft Android Data Recovery; </li><li>  Wondershare Dr. Fone; </li><li>  Recovery; </li><li>  7-Data recovery. </li></ul><p>  The principle of operation of these utilities is approximately the same.  If you carefully follow all the instructions, even a person who does not have any programming skills will cope with the solution to the problem. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.kodcuherif.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="restore android without data loss" class="if uuid-2758560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44778/2758560.jpg"></div><h2>  How to extract phone memory data using a computer? </h2><p>  Since data deletion is mainly the user's own fault, naturally, no insurance or warranty service will solve your problem.  He will have to look for a way out himself and learn from the incident a lesson for the future and save all the important data.  So, the order of the actions: </p><ol><li>  The client downloads the necessary utility to his computer and installs it. </li><li>  A smartphone or tablet connects to a PC using a USB cable. </li><li>  Perform a deep data scan. </li></ol><p>  Unfortunately, if you use the free version of the program, you will only be able to view the files that you could find.  But in order to pull them out and save, you have to buy a licensed version.  In principle, this is quite true, the client sees what the program is capable of, whether it is compatible with this phone, and only then pays for the service. </p><h2>  What is backup? </h2><p>  If you have files on your phone that you really need, and you are afraid of losing them, it would be better to periodically transfer them to your PC for safekeeping.  But you must admit, it‚Äôs impossible to manually transfer some specific phone settings, for example SMS correspondence, phone book data or special smartphone settings.  In this case, a backup system will help. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  First, turn off the phone and then simultaneously press the power and sound buttons.  In the window that opens, the engineering menu, you need to click on the backup and restore tab and then backup.  The copied phone data will be saved in the flash memory and can be transferred to a PC at any time. </p><p>  Now, when you once again wonder about how to recover data from Android after an accidental cleaning, just use the restore tab in the same menu. </p><div class="photo" data-original="topcloudglobalus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover application data on android" class="if uuid-2758465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44778/2758465.jpg"></div><h2>  Long live the Google services! </h2><p>  Usually, all gadgets, whether it‚Äôs a phone or tablet, based on Android are synchronized with a Google account.  If the device was logged in with your Google account and synchronization is enabled in the settings, it will not be difficult to restore Android without data loss. </p><p>  If the user has previously turned on synchronization, all you need to do is enter the Google Play application using your username and password.  Next, the following will be automatically loaded: </p><ul><li>  all contact details (addresses, phone numbers, names); </li><li>  application data; </li><li>  photos and videos stored on Google Drive. </li></ul><p>  In cases where there is no Google account or synchronization has not been carried out, unfortunately, it will not be possible to restore data on Android using backup. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thenextseo.co.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to recover deleted data on android" class="if uuid-2758439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44778/2758439.jpg"></div><h2>  How to return previously installed applications </h2><p>  If for any reason you uninstall the mobile applications that you now want to return back to, it is very simple to do.  First you need to go to Google Play using your account.  In the upper left corner you can see three horizontal lines, when clicked, a personal section opens.  Next, select the ‚ÄúMy Applications and Games‚Äù tab.  In the list that opens, select those applications that are of interest and reinstall them on your smartphone. </p><p>  If you want to return the paid application that you have already paid, just reinstall it.  As usual, such applications are tied to a Google account and do not require re-payment.  If the list does not contain the application that you need, it is possible that you are logged in with a different account.  Another reason for the lack of an application is its complete removal from the store for all users. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fiverr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to restore data reset on android" class="if uuid-2758431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44778/2758431.jpg"></div><h2>  GT Recovery for Android: if there is no computer at hand </h2><p>  Suppose a user with a Google account doesn‚Äôt have a computer either.  What then to do?  How to recover data on an Android phone?  Even in this case, there is a way out, however, it will take a little longer to tinker.  The main thing here is the availability of good mobile Internet and great patience. </p><p>  To solve such a difficult problem, you can use the program GT Recovery for Android.  This app can be found on Google Play.  At the time of writing, the program is provided for free and, according to numerous positive reviews, is one of the best of its kind.  The only negative side of this program can be considered that root-rights are required. </p><p>  First you need to download and install the application on your smartphone or tablet.  Then, in the window that opens, specify which applications need to be found and restored, and start scanning. </p><p>  At this stage, be patient, the scanning process can last up to 30 minutes, depending on the volume of the phone.  As soon as the scan is completed, a list of all found files will appear on the screen.  Select the required ones and click Next. </p><p>  It remains only to specify the path to save.  Note that the contacts will be saved in vcf format, so you have to go into the address book and import them there from the internal memory. </p><h2>  Preventive measures </h2><p>  After recovering the application data on Android, it was time to think about how not to step on the same rake again.  We already wrote about what backup is and why it is needed.  Do not neglect to back up all important files once again, in the future this habit will help to save time and money. </p><p>  To store valuable files, you can use cloud storage from any services.  The volume of such storages can reach up to 36 TB, and most of them provide their services completely free of charge.  Thus, if a problem suddenly occurs and all your files are deleted from your phone or from a flash card, you can always easily and quickly return their backups. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sendelisin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="recover deleted data on android" class="if uuid-2758571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44778/2758571.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Unfortunately, no one is safe from such troubles as accidental deletion of important files.  For example, the disappearance of the first photos of your baby or documents with important information sent the day before by the employer can always cause panic. </p><p>  The main thing here is to calm down and try not to clog the memory with new files, otherwise restoring lost data will be problematic.  If there was no initial backup, and third-party applications did not help to cope with the problem on your own, you will have to contact the service center for more qualified help. </p>
