Its purpose was not only the environment, but also the complete destruction of the largest group of the Wehrmacht, located in this area.  In addition, the Red Army was tasked with clearing the <span>capital of Belarus</span> from the enemy as quickly as possible <span>.</span>  This momentous event occurred on July 3, 1944.  In modern Belarus, this is not only the date of the liberation of Minsk, the capital of the state, but also a national holiday - Independence Day. </p><h2>  The situation before the operation </h2><p>  In 1944, three successful military special operations were carried out - Mogilev, Vitebsk-Orshansk and Bobruisk, as a result of which units of the 4th and 9th armies, members of the German Center group, were almost surrounded by Soviet units.  The Hitler command to help their troops transferred fresh forces, including the 4th, 5th and 12th Panzer Divisions. </p><p>  Gradually, the ring around the Germans tightened, and the long-awaited liberation of Minsk was just around the corner.  By the end of the day, June 28, I. D. Chernyakhovsky, commander of units of the 3rd Belorussian Front, went to the Berezina River, thereby capturing the enemy from the north.  In turn, <span>I. Kh. Baghramyan</span> with the 1st Baltic troops fought in the region of Polotsk.  At the same time, G.F. Zakharov with the troops of the 2nd Belorussian Front bypassed the enemy from the east, and K.K. Rokossovsky with his army from the south, having managed to reach the line Osipovichi - Svisloch - Kopatkevichi and higher along <span>the Pripyat River.</span>  Separate advanced formations were already a hundred kilometers from the republican capital. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Bet Plans </h2><p>  The Soviet command understood that a lot of efforts would have to be made in order for the liberation of Minsk in 1944 to become a reality.  Therefore, on June 28, the Stavka set a goal for the Red Army - to encircle and liquidate a large fascist group.  To this end, it was planned by the forces of the 1st and 3rd Belorussian fronts to inflict devastating blows on German troops located near the city.  At the same time, a further offensive of the 2nd Belorussian compounds was planned to the west.  As a result, the troops of all the fronts involved in this operation had to first surround and then destroy the entire Minsk enemy group. </p><p>  At the same time, units of the Red Army were to, without stopping, steadily moving westward, thereby fettering enemy troops and preventing them from uniting with the Minsk group.  Such actions of the Soviet side created good conditions for the subsequent attack on the Kaunas, Warsaw and ≈†iauliai directions. </p>

    <h2>  Actions of the 3rd Belorussian </h2><p>  On June 28, the Headquarters of the Supreme High Command announced the order concerning this front, which was supposed to immediately force the Berezina River, and then launch a rapid attack in two directions - the Belarusian capital and Molodechno.  The main blow aimed at liberating Minsk from the Nazi invaders was to be inflicted by the troops of the 31st, 5th and 11th armies, as well as the 2nd <span>tank corps.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The next day, the advance detachments of the Red Army managed to capture several bridgeheads on the Berezina River and, having knocked down the enemy barriers, moved inland to a distance of 5 km, and in some sections, 10 km.  However, faced with the stubborn resistance of the Germans, Soviet troops were embroiled in heavy fighting.  For this reason, by the evening of June 29, the Red Army men had only time to force the river. </p>

    <p>  At the same time, the troops of the 5th army under the command of Krylov did not stop crossing the Berezina and fortified themselves on the shore, occupying several bridgeheads.  It should be noted that the advancement of units of the Red Army, whose main goal was the liberation of Minsk, was greatly facilitated by numerous partisan detachments.  They not only indicated the most favorable and shortest road through forests and marshes, but also helped cover the flanks of military convoys and guard crossings. </p><h2>  Deadly confrontation </h2><p>  The liberation of Minsk (1944) was accompanied by extremely fierce resistance from the German side.  It prevented the rapid advance of the 11th army under the command of Galitsky.  That is why Soviet troops in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKrupka - Kholopenichi were forced to engage in battle for the whole day.  Here the Red Army was held back by the 5th Panzer, as well as the remnants of the 95th and 14th divisions.  The aim of the fascist command was to prevent the breakthrough of Soviet troops to Borisov, who was the stronghold of the Germans on the Berezina River and covered the way to the Belarusian capital. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In turn, the 5th Soviet Panzer Army launched an offensive along the highway to Minsk.  After that, she went to Berezina from the north side of Borisov.  It should be noted that the coordinated actions of the tankers under the command of Rotmistrov, as well as the effective advance of the 2nd Tatsinsky Corps, allowed the troops of the 31st Army to advance 40 km in one day and approach the Beaver River just south of the village of Krupki. </p>

    <h2>  Forcing the Berezina River </h2><p>  Given the rather confident advance of the Soviet troops to the Belarusian capital, it was possible to assume with great certainty that the liberation of Minsk in 1944 was almost predetermined.  On June 30, the main forces of the Red Army reached Berezina and crossed through it.  The 5th Army expanded its bridgehead and went deep into the German defenses to a distance of 15 km, <span>and the 3rd</span> Mechanized Corps, having practically destroyed the enemy rear and occupied Pleshchenitsy, blocked the Borisov-Vileyka road.  As a result of such actions, Soviet troops posed a serious threat to one of the flanks and the rear of the enemy Borisov group. </p><p>  Having done her best, the 11th Guards Army nevertheless quickly enough broke the enemy‚Äôs resistance, went to Berezina and, finally, was able to force this river.  At this time, Soviet divisions bypassed the Germans from the left flank and moved to Borisov.  As a result, a battle ensued from the southeast side of the city.  At the same time, the tankers of Rotmistrov launched an attack east of Borisov. </p>

    <h2>  The feat of Soviet tankmen </h2><p>  The operation, whose ultimate goal was the liberation of Minsk from the Nazis, required almost massive heroism from the Soviet soldiers.  So, on June 30, a tank platoon of Pavel Rak, consisting of four vehicles, received an order to break into Borisov and hold out at all costs until the main forces of the 3rd mechanized corps entered the city.  Of all the crews, only the T-34 commander completed the task.  The second and third tanks of Yunayev and Kuznetsov were knocked out earlier, another car caught fire on the bridge over the Berezina River, after which the Germans blew up this crossing.  All Red Army soldiers died. </p><p>  For more than 12 hours the crew of P. Cancer, which included the gunner-radio operator <span>A. Danilov</span> and the driver-mechanic A. Petryaev, held on with all their might.  It is worth noting that the breakthrough of the Soviet armored vehicle caused real panic in the enemy garrison, and in many respects contributed to the speedy liberation of the city of Borisov.  The heroes stood until the last, when the Germans sent several assault guns and tanks to eliminate them.  The crew of P. Cancer died the death of the brave.  Later, they all received the highest military rank of Heroes of the Soviet Union.  There were many such brave people in that great era.  The best sons of the Fatherland gave their lives for the liberation of Minsk and other cities.  It was truly massive heroism. </p>

    <h2>  Further advancement </h2><p>  The German command managed to organize several fairly strong counterattacks on the approaches to Borisov, but they practically had no effect, despite the introduction of the German Air Force.  Enemy planes flying in groups of 18 aircraft tried to prevent the Soviet troops from crossing the Berezina.  But Soviet attack aircraft and bombers repelled the enemy‚Äôs powerful strikes and themselves attacked a cluster of fascist equipment near Borisov. </p><p>  As a result of the fighting on July 1, the Red Army crossed the Berezina and captured the city.  The Wehrmacht Borisov group was defeated.  This fact took a step closer to the liberation of Minsk from the Nazi invaders.  However, the Soviet troops will need another two days in order to accomplish this task. </p>

    <h2>  The return of the Belarusian capital </h2><p>  On the night of July 3, the front commander Chernyakhovsky ordered the liberation of Minsk of the 31st Army, the 2nd Mechanized Corps and partially the Panzer Army under the leadership of Rotmistrov.  In the early morning, a battle ensued on the eastern and northern outskirts of the city, and by 7.30 the Soviet troops had successfully reached its center.  Two hours later, the <span>capital of Belarus</span> was cleared of Nazi mercenaries. </p><p>  1944 - the year of the liberation of Minsk - became truly victorious for the Red Army.  For three endless years, the inhabitants of this dilapidated and desecrated city were waiting for the day when the Soviet troops finally came in and rescued them from under the fascist yoke.  And they nevertheless waited and withstood with honor in this unequal battle! </p>
