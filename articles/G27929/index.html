Or maybe a carefully planned misinformation designed to discredit real events.  Tisulskaya find, like a snowball, is constantly growing with new rumors. </p><h2>  Unexpected find </h2><p>  This story begins in the distant 1969.  Coal mine workers near the village of Rzhavchik, Tisulsky district, began their working day as usual.  Until one of the miners noticed something unusual in the middle of the reservoir.  It turned out to be a sarcophagus made of material similar to marble.  The work was immediately suspended by the head of the site. </p><p>  They decided to pull the find to the surface.  The day was clear.  Solar heat quickly melted the putty, fastening the lid with the burial chamber.  One of the workers recklessly decided to taste the viscous liquid (a week later he <span>went crazy,</span> and then completely died).  It was difficult to restrain curiosity, and soon the sarcophagus was opened. </p>

    <h2>  The come true fairy tale </h2><p>  The coffin was filled with a bluish liquid with a pink tint.  At the bottom of the tank was a young woman.  It seemed as if she was just sleeping peacefully, but how is this possible inside a block of coal? </p><p>  The woman was distinguished by amazing beauty, like a princess descended from the pages of old Russian fairy tales.  In the future, she was nicknamed the Tisuli Princess.  In its appearance, it fits the description of the Eastern Slavs.  Thin features, long blond hair, braided in a traditional braid, and, most amazingly, wide open big blue eyes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The dress on her was also worthy of a princely wardrobe.  The weightless translucent decoration is white ... The lace hem goes down just below the knees, and the short sleeve is decorated with elegant embroidery with floral motifs.  At the head of the bed was another mysterious item - a small black box, in appearance a metal one, the size of a modern mobile phone. </p>

    <h2>  Flying an iron bird </h2><p>  The site manager was not slow to report the find to the government.  The news spread quickly, and before the arrival of scientists, mysterious artifacts had time to consider almost all the inhabitants of Rust. </p><p>  The first to arrive at the place where the Tisulsky find was found, local authorities.  Everything was here - from firefighters to the military.  Already they began to gradually crowd out the local inhabitants.  Historical excavations were curtailed.  After a helicopter arrived a group of scientists who finally dotted all, saying that the place could be contaminated. </p><p>  Artifacts of antiquity were taken into cordon.  The names and other data of all the workers and villagers who appeared on the spot were carefully recorded.  They explained such scrupulousness by the fact that they need to undergo a medical examination for infection. </p><p>  It was decided to send the find to the Novosibirsk Scientific Center.  To facilitate transportation, a liquid was drained from the sarcophagus.  The beauty immediately began to blacken, and the magic vodice was returned back.  Miraculously, the woman was transformed again, all blackness disappeared, a blush returned to her face.  In this form, the Tisulka find went for research.  The girl in the casket was handed over to scientists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Scientific sensation </h2><p>  Less than a week later, a professor came to Rzhavchik.  Everyone was gathered in a village club, and scientists talked about the progress of the study.  It turned out that the Tisulsky find is older than dinosaurs, its age is about 600-800 million years. </p><p>  Scientists failed to identify the exact composition of the magnificent decoration of the princess.  The formula of magic liquid also remained a mystery.  Only components of ancient types of garlic and onion were identified.  A small metal box at that time also remained unsolved.  The professor reassured that the found artifacts of antiquity will up-close modern ideas about the history of our planet. </p><p>  Residents were waiting for sensation and big hype in the scientific world, which simply could not but appear in the press.  But ... there was only a small article in a local newspaper with a length of several sentences.  Its whole meaning was that an ancient relic of high historical value was found.  And that‚Äôs all ... </p><h2>  Development of events </h2><p>  Outwardly, everything looked as if the interest of scientists in this story had faded.  In fact, the Tisulka find fell into the category of classified materials not intended for the general public.  When the hype among the local subside, excavations resumed in Rzhavchik. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Everything was carried out in an atmosphere of strict secrecy.  As the former KGB colonel later said, a triple cordon was created.  People in uniform were constantly plying the streets of a small provincial village.  Excavations in Russia have never been guarded by so many soldiers. </p><p>  According to data that appeared already in the 21st century, 2 more sarcophagi were found there.  Ancient burials were completely identical to the first find.  Local residents saw only flying helicopters. </p><p>  A version was put forward that the burials were made before the <span>Carboniferous period,</span> when vegetation prevailed on Earth.  They were kept in crypts in the middle of a <span>dense forest</span> and gradually went underground.  The wooden crypt collapsed and over millions of years became a part of the coal seam. </p>

    <h2>  Who is the witness </h2><p>  In 2007, Roman Yanchenko conducted an independent journalistic investigation.  He went to the legendary village of Rzhavchik in search of witnesses.  The original source reports that almost the entire village saw the sarcophagus, so it is reasonable to believe that there were eyewitnesses, or at least legends. </p><p>  But, alas, the only surviving member of the brigade claims that all this is fiction, and he first hears about it.  All the rest died within 5 years after the ill-fated find.  What is the curse of the mummy or the operational work of the KGB?  Most likely the second.  All the old villagers just waved away, not wanting to say anything. </p><p>  It is interesting that the local authorities have now turned the excavation sites into a huge dump.  It is likely that this is another attempt to cover up the tracks. </p>

    <h2>  True or fiction </h2><p>  If such a story happened now, witnesses would have time to remove the princess on the phone and put photos or videos on the Internet.  But the workers had only eyes at their disposal.  Although even then information leaked, too honest and curious journalists were quickly fired from their jobs. </p><p>  The author of the sensational article appeared on the Internet in 2012 and said that this happened to him.  After the publication, he was allegedly hit by a car, but managed to get rid of bruises.  After the editor proposed to transfer everything as a joke and write how the girl rose and escaped in an unknown direction.  In response to the refusal, he had to end his journalistic career. </p><p>  There is another strange fact.  The testimonies of the colleague and the wife of the blacksmith regarding his death are fundamentally different.  The wife claims that he died as a result of a serious illness, and a colleague says a motorcycle accident.  It looks like they have erased their memory, as in the famous blockbuster, but they made a mistake and invested different information in return.  However, all this is speculation ... And what do the luminaries of science say about this? </p>

    <h2>  Salvation from the cold </h2><p>  Scientists suggest that approximately 850-650 million years ago, our Earth was subjected to global cataclysms.  The then-only continent of Rodinia was covered with a 6-km crust of ice.  Ice also bound the entire oceans. </p><p>  It is possible that in the preglacial period the Tisul princess was born.  Civilization, although it was more advanced than ours, could not resist nature.  The sarcophagus with liquid was intended for artificial introduction into suspended animation, followed by revitalization.  But something went wrong, and completely failed to revive civilization. </p><p>  Since then, more than one ice age has passed, there has been a significant movement of continental plates.  The traces of this ancient civilization remained deep in the bowels of the earth.  However, here and there, in the strata of coal, skeletons of a modern type, nails and even metal vessels are found. </p>

    <h2>  Similar case </h2><p>  On the territory of ancient Rome, archaeologists discovered a tomb with similar contents.  Presumably, this was the daughter of Cicero.  The girl was in some kind of transparent liquid, perfectly preserving the body.  She looked like she was alive.  There was supposedly a burning lamp at her feet, but when the coffin was opened, it immediately went out.  Similar eternal lamps are found in descriptions of ancient historians.  They were often found in Egyptian tombs, and later in the temples of ancient Hellas. </p><p>  The burial of Chinese noblewoman Xin Zhui also fits into this series of mystical finds.  Her body was wrapped in a luxurious silk cloth and placed in a special liquid, which evaporated within 5 minutes after opening the sarcophagus.  The body of the Chinese woman, according to sources, perfectly preserved the elasticity of the tissues, and in the veins found liquid blood.  Another surprise scientists expected in the drawing on canvas.  It turned out to be a map of China.  The amazing accuracy of the outlines is surprising, now this can only be achieved if you take pictures from space. </p><p>  Perhaps scientists nevertheless miscalculated the determination of age, but how then did the coffin fall into the thickness of a coal block? </p><p>  Tisulskaya find is still one of the most controversial discoveries.  Was it really or was all the information just a newspaper duck?  Or maybe something else top-secret was discovered, and the sarcophagus is another invention of the government in an attempt to hide the real events in Rust?  Who knows ... This whole story remains controversial and controversial, and every year the number of questions only grows.  Believe it or not - the choice is yours. </p>
