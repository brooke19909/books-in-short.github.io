But not only the magnificent nature attracts tourists from all over the globe, the largest island of the Balearic archipelago is known for the variety of cultural and historical attractions concentrated in its capital. </p><p>  The large Mediterranean <span>resort of Palma de Mallorca</span> is full of architectural monuments.  Among them stands apart the <span>Gothic castle of</span> Belver, whose name translates as "a wonderful place." </p><h2>  Symbol of the capital of Mallorca </h2><p>  Located near the center of the capital, a sample of medieval architecture stands on the very top of the hill.  From the observation platforms located on the roof, amazing views of the city and the bay. </p><p>  Belver Castle, considered a symbol of the capital, was built at the beginning of the 14th century at the behest of the ruler Jaime II.  The prototype was the Jordanian fortress Herodion of an unusual shape with four towers. </p><h2>  Royal Palace and fortification </h2><p>  The building with a stone moat and an external wall with loopholes served simultaneously as a royal residence and fortress, guarding access to Palma de Mallorca.  The interest of tourists is the unique feature of the massive citadel - this is the only gothic structure in Spain with a non-standard round shape. </p><p>  Oriented to four cardinal points, Belver Castle from above looks like a huge compass.  The fact is that three towers of cylindrical shape are built into the walls of the ancient structure, and the fourth, the largest one located at a distance from them, is connected to the fortress by a massive arched bridge.  Within the walls of the Spanish fortress, the outlines of small towers are visible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Gallery and interior </h2><p>  Inside the castle, surrounded on all sides by a pine forest, there is a cozy courtyard, along the perimeter of which there is a two-tier gallery.  The rounded arches of the lower floor are supported by 21 square columns.  The rooms of the two-story castle with a courtyard communicate via a covered gallery. </p><p>  The upper tier consists of arches made in the <span>Gothic style</span> , resting on forty-two columns of an octagonal shape, which emphasizes the Italian style, skillfully combining Gothic and antiquity. </p><p>  On the lower floor of the castle there were utility rooms and small rooms for servants without windows, and on the second there were luxurious royal chambers, a gala hall for receiving guests, a kitchen and a chapel. </p><p>  A large well-reservoir was built in the courtyard, supplying residents with drinking water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle belver opening hours" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1321566.jpg" width="600"></div>

Among the prisoners were famous personalities of that time: the widow of King Jaime III with his sons, physicist F. Aragon, famous writer and public figure Gaspard Melchor de Hoveljanos, who described in detail the features of the building structure. </p><p>  Interestingly, in 1936, Belver Castle again turned into a prison for nationalist rebels.  They paved the road leading to the main attraction of the island's capital. </p><p>  Forty years ago, a museum was opened in a well-preserved citadel, the exhibits of which tell about the history of the city, starting from the first settlements.  Large-scale cultural events are often held in the quiet courtyard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle belver" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1321570.jpg" width="600"></div>
