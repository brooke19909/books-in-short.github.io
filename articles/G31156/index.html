  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Slow carbohydrates</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Carbohydrates (saccharides) are involved in the processing of fats and proteins in the body, help the liver function.  For dinner, experts recommend eating protein foods.  Foods rich in carbohydrates are preferable to take in the morning, because after lunch, the carbohydrate metabolism in the body slows down. </p><p>  Saccharides in the body are absorbed in the form of glucose.  Specialists share fast and slow carbohydrates, depending on the rate of breakdown and conversion to glucose.  <span>Speed ‚Äã‚Äãmeasurement is</span> carried out by a special indicator - glycemic index (GI).  Slow carbohydrates have a low GI.  These products are considered beneficial.  These include, in particular, brown rice, pasta made from whole grain flour, cereal (with the exception of semolina) and other slow carbohydrates.  The list can be supplemented with coarse bread. </p><p>  Products with a low glycemic index (less than forty) contribute to a gradual increase in glucose in the body.  This, in turn, prevents sudden spikes in blood sugar levels, as well as a quick change of mood for unknown reasons.  Thus, experts recommend consuming slow carbohydrates to maintain calm. </p><p>  An important process is the digestion of foods with a low glycemic index.  Slow carbohydrates begin to be absorbed in the process of chewing food due to the enzyme contained in saliva. </p><p>  Foods with a high glycemic index are not so useful.  Of course, they are not poison, but experts do not recommend using them every day.  It should be noted that alcohol belongs to the category of ‚Äúfast carbohydrates‚Äù along with desserts, pastries and other products.  To this group should be added ripe bananas, white bread, turnips, mashed potatoes and <span>baked potatoes,</span> melon, pancakes and more. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, experts recommend all <span>products with a glycemic index of</span> more than sixty to be considered ‚Äúholiday food‚Äù.  This will not only help maintain the shape.  Such an attitude to products will greatly help the body.  The fact is that fast carbohydrates adversely affect the pancreas, which is involved in the production of insulin.  From this, both the concentration of sugar in the blood and the mood change. </p><p>  Slow carbohydrates are especially important in the winter.  In cold weather, saccharides further stimulate the production of a special hormone - serotonin, which is responsible for a good mood. </p><p>  A separate place in the carbohydrate classification is occupied by such products as sugar, fruits and vegetables. </p><p>  One type of carbohydrate is fiber (‚Äúdietary fiber‚Äù).  It is insoluble and soluble. </p><p>  Fruits (like pears and apples) contain pectin.  These are soluble dietary fibers that help lower cholesterol in the blood and slow down the digestive process. </p><p>  Grain husk is classified as insoluble fiber.  It is not absorbed in the body and leaves unchanged undigested.  These dietary fibers prevent constipation, normalize digestion, and reduce the likelihood of developing cancer in the colon. </p><p>  It should be noted that fiber is found only in plant foods.  In addition to improving the digestive tract, dietary fiber stimulates lipid (fat) metabolism. </p><p>  Another <span>carbohydrate product</span> is sugar.  Modern industry makes it so clean that it has nothing but calories.  It should be noted that sugar helps to eliminate calcium from the body.  Thus, lovers of sweets can not only gain extra pounds, but also get osteoporosis. </p><p>  Nutritionists advise limiting sugar intake to 30-35 kilograms per year, given the fact that today it is found in almost all foods. </p>
