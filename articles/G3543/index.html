    <h2>  FWD drive - what is it? </h2><p>  This abbreviation can be read in different ways.  At a minimum, there are two options: </p><ol><li>  Front Wheel Drive.  The car has a front drive axle. </li><li>  Full Wheel Drive.  The car is four-wheel drive. </li></ol><p>  There is also an LHD FWD drive.  What does it mean?  The first three letters indicate Left Hand Drive (left-hand drive car), the rest we already know. </p><p>  Unfortunately, there is no clear definition that accurately describes the type of FWD drive.  The car manufacturer decides what exactly he invests in this concept.  Therefore, if in the characteristics of one car these three letters can indicate the presence of a front-wheel drive, then in another car this can quite be interpreted as all-wheel drive. </p><p>  Therefore, it is not possible to specify exactly which FWD drive is meant.  On different machines, it can be a front drive axle or two drive axles. </p>

    <p>  Thanks to the <span>front-wheel drive, the</span> engine and transmission are easy enough to place under the hood of the car.  At the same time, the rear part for cargo, fuel tank and passenger seats is released.  This is partly why most manufacturers produce low-cost machines with a front drive axle. </p><p>  Usually this involves installing the engine across the machine, due to which the rotation of the crankshaft is transmitted compactly to the wheels.  The number of unnecessary ‚Äúadapters‚Äù for transmitting torque is sharply reduced. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  That this solution for cars involves certain advantages - no doubt.  First of all, it is worth noting the heavy load on the front axle of the machine due to the mass of the engine.  Given that this axle is the leading one, the grip of the wheels with the road surface becomes better.  In snow or rain, such a machine will be more manageable.  Under equal circumstances, the front-wheel drive car will begin to skid at a higher speed than the rear-wheel drive due to better traction of the wheels with the road surface.  This is one of the main advantages. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second plus is compactness.  As mentioned above, the location of the motor next to the drive wheels simplifies the transmission of torque, which frees up more space under the hood, bottom and even in the cabin.  Cost also plays a role.  A car with a front drive axle is easier to design and build than a rear-wheel drive car, not to mention all-wheel drive. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Cons also have a place to be: </p><ol><li>  And although such cars are less prone to skidding, if this happens, it becomes very difficult to level the car.  Professionals say that if a car with a front drive axle gets into a skid, the driver needs to add gas, but instinctively this cannot be done.  Most immediately presses the brake, which exacerbates the situation. </li><li>  Given that the drive wheels are swivel, there is a certain restriction on the angle of rotation.  Also, some mechanisms here are more prone to wear.  First of all, ‚Äúgrenades‚Äù deteriorate, which drive the turned wheels. </li><li>  Given that the main components are located in front of the machine, front-wheel drive makes some adjustments to the wear of certain mechanisms.  In particular, when braking, the weight of the vehicle is carried forward.  Therefore, the already heavy front of the car loads the front axle, which brakes have to stop.  Therefore, brake pads wear out faster.  Often in front-wheel drive cars, the rear pads change when the front pads have already been replaced two (or even three) times. </li><li>  When speeding up on such a car, part of the weight is transferred back, which impairs grip.  Therefore, front-wheel drive is more prone to slipping, which is unacceptable for race cars.  That is why many sports cars have a rear drive axle or are all-wheel drive. </li></ol><p>  So, you now fully understand that this is an FWD drive.  But there is another type. </p><h2>  Rear drive </h2>

    <p>  We already know that FWD front-wheel drive is indicated, and rear-wheel drive is RWD (Rear Wheel Drive).  In cars with such a system, the engine is installed longitudinally to the length of the car and transmits torque to the rear wheels through a long driveshaft.  However, due to the simplicity and low cost of rear-wheel drive components, in general, the implementation of such a scheme is cheaper in some cases.  But it is worth considering that modern cars use a lot of expensive modern technologies, which together with rear-wheel drive can make the car expensive. </p><p>  Previously, most vehicles had an exclusively rear drive axle.  Due to limitations in the technology of that time, mechanics could not imagine how to make the front axle leading, and even make the wheels turn. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  Performance is the first plus of the FWD rear-wheel drive.  During acceleration, the weight of the machine moves back and is perceived by the rear drive wheels.  Consequently, the probability of their slipping is reduced.  Therefore, the famous sports cars Ferrari, Lamborghini, Dodge, etc., use just such an option. </p>

    <p>  If in a front-wheel drive car the drive wheels are responsible for the movement and turn of transport, then on the rear-wheel drive car these functions can be divided.  Heavy mechanical components can be positioned front and rear, which will help maintain balance in weight and not overload any one axis.  In theory, this can increase manageability. </p><p>  And although cars with a rear drive axle are easier to skid, they are easier to get out of it.  Developers, freeing the front wheels from unnecessary elements, can significantly increase the turning radius.  As a result, car agility will increase. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The first minus is the need to implement a transmission ‚Äútunnel‚Äù that will pass through the center of the car, occupying the interior space.  The second minus is the worst handling in rain and snow.  Turns must be entered very carefully in the winter. </p><h2>  Four-wheel drive </h2><p>  Note that sometimes the letters FWD mean an all-wheel drive car (Full Wheel Drive).  Cars with such a system are more expensive, and most often it is implemented in large jeeps, crossovers, rarely found in small cars. </p>

    <p>  Of course, all-wheel drive cars are distinguished by better cross-country ability, they easily go through those places where a car with one drive axle will get stuck for a long time and will slip corny.  Modern technology all-wheel drive systems are very advanced.  For example, in most such machines, the system initially loads the front axle, and when the computer notices at least a slight deterioration in the adhesion of the wheels to the coating, it automatically transfers part of the engine power to the rear axle.  As a result, the car does not lose momentum and does not spend extra energy on slipping. </p><p>  Also, due to all-wheel drive, the car is well-controlled, especially in corners.  In any case, four-wheel drive is better, but such solutions are much more expensive. </p>

    <h2>  Front or rear </h2><p>  Which drive is better - RWD, FWD?  This is always a hot issue for many car owners.  At the moment, we can safely say that cars with a front drive axle are better.  They have more important advantages and front-wheel drive is ideal for a budget low-cost car.  <span>Rear-wheel drive is</span> justified if it comes to choosing a sports car.  In everyday city life, it is the car with the front drive axle that shows itself better.  According to many car owners, the winner is obvious.  And do not be surprised that this is an FWD drive.  This is partly why most manufacturers produce just such models. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Now you know that this is the FWD drive, its features, pros and cons.  Carefully consider the choice of a car and be sure to consider its driving axle when driving on roads. </p>
