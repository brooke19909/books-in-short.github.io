Especially relevant are floral motifs.  It‚Äôs best to crochet a flower for decoration, as this technique allows you to accurately recreate the natural shapes and sizes in all details.  Each flower is connected thanks to a unique combination of pattern and thread, assembly scheme. </p><h2>  What threads are suitable for crocheting flowers </h2><p>  Before you begin to create floral ornaments, you need to choose the right material.  The threads should not only be of high quality, but also fit the thickness of the hook number.  Advice on this choice can be obtained directly in the store, but the choice of yarn according to the composition should preferably be done independently. </p><div class="photo" data-original="allegro.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet thread" class="if uuid-2863089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2863089.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth thinking about what material the product will be decorated with knitted flowers in the future.  It is worth considering the degree of deformation of the thread, which will affect the preservation of the shape of the product. </p><p>  For crocheting flowers, you can choose this yarn: </p><ul><li>  Linen yarn has many advantages.  It is not an allergen, does not change color during washing, does not change shape. </li><li>  It is difficult to work with silk threads, but very bright flowers that resemble living ones are obtained. </li><li>  It is easy to form any shape from cotton yarn, but it quickly loses its attractive appearance. </li></ul><p>  You can use other types of threads.  Woolen threads and yarn with decorative effects are popular: grass, spools, lurex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The simplest <span>little</span> crocheted <span>flowers</span> </h2><p>  It is not necessary to be a super master to tie a beautiful petal flower.  Before crocheting small flowers, you need to prepare suitable tools and materials.  The main weapon will be the hook.  To form the flower itself, it is worth choosing tones that will ideally combine with each other. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kikamoracrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The simplest flower in a few minutes" class="if uuid-2863123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2863123.jpg"></div><p>  The principle of creating the simplest little flower: </p><ol><li>  Dial a chain of 9 air loops that close in a circle. </li><li>  It is necessary to tie 15 CCH.  In this case, the columns do not knit in the loop of the chain, but bind it, forming a smooth ring-the middle of the flower. </li><li>  We knit a chain of 3 air loops, which will become the basis of the future petal. </li><li>  At the end of the chain it is worth tying the sc. </li><li>  In the same loop from where the chain was formed, knit 6 more columns with two columns. </li><li>  In each subsequent 2 loops, knit one sc. </li><li>  In 3 stitches, knit 7 stitches with two crochets each. </li><li>  It is worth tying 3 more of the same petals. </li></ol><h2>  How to crochet violets with a hook </h2><p>  When there is a need to decorate a knitted item, many needlewomen immediately set a new goal, which is to learn how to crochet a small flower.  An important condition is that the product looks as natural as possible, and the pattern is simple to execute. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": Melba, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet small violets" class="if uuid-2863117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2863117.jpg"></div><p>  The most common flower that is often used in decoration is violet.  And as practice shows, crocheting such an element is very simple: </p><ol><li>  For knitting violets, it is better to use cotton yarn and a hook No. 1.75.  To completely recreate a natural flower, it is worth choosing two types of yarn - yellow for the middle violet (another) to create petals. </li><li>  We start from the middle - a ring is knitted from yellow yarn.  First, knit 4 air loops that snap into the ring.  Next, you need to knit a row of single crochet columns (RLS) in the amount of 10 loops. </li><li>  Attach the purple thread.  In the first and second stitches, knit three double crochets. </li><li>  Turn the work and continue to form a petal.  In each loop from the previous row, knit two double crochet (CCH). </li><li>  Knit the next row this way: in each loop, knit 1 CCH. </li><li>  In the next row, make 3 decreases by knitting 2 loops together.  Such an action must be done at the beginning, middle and end. </li><li>  In the 5th row, you need to make 3 more reductions according to the same principle as in the previous one.  The thread is fixed and cut. </li></ol><p>  4 more petals are tied in the same way.  The edges of each of which need to be tied with a thread in color a little darker than the main one.  The strapping is done using RLS in each loop. </p><h2>  DIY openwork flower </h2><p>  A simple crochet option is a small openwork flower.  Such an element looks magnificent and original, and fits simply and easily.  You need to know a few notations in order to understand how to crochet a small flower. </p><p>  Pattern for knitting: </p><ol><li>  Dial 10 air loops in a chain and close using RLS. </li><li>  Knit 3 air loops (VP), and then tie 23 CCH, tying the chain. </li><li>  Collect 3 air loops, skip 2 columns and knit, fixing the chain in the 3rd loop.  So arches are formed, they should turn out 8 pieces. </li><li>  Dial 3 VP.  Then tie 2 CCH, 1 VP and again 2 CCH.  This pattern is knitted in 1 arch. </li><li>  After finishing the last arch, you need to dial 2 VP.  Knit the second row of arches as follows: knit 7 CCHs, tying VP in the previous row. </li></ol><h2>  Little rose in a few minutes </h2><p>  Not knowing how to crochet a small flower, and which one, it is worth paying attention to a rose.  This option will be a universal solution for decorating. </p><div class="photo" data-original="knittingday.com" data-author=": Helena, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rose crochet" class="if uuid-2863062" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2863062.jpg"></div><p>  We knit a rose: </p><ol><li>  Link a chain of 10 VPs. </li><li>  2nd row: strengthen the chain by knitting each loop of the RLS. </li><li>  The 3rd row will be the last: in each loop knit 5 CCH. </li><li>  Twist the chain to form a rose. </li></ol><p>  The longer the chain, the larger and larger the rose.  The size of the flower also depends on how many crochets are made during knitting 3 rows. </p><h2>  Volumetric flower </h2><p>  Particularly beautiful small crochet flowers are obtained if they are given volume.  At the same time, you can create such a masterpiece in a few minutes without much effort even for beginners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.heylittlemagpie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Layered Flowers" class="if uuid-2863070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2863070.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Link a chain of 10 VPs.  Close the PRS circuit. </li><li>  Tie 23 CCH, tying the first row. </li><li>  3rd row: form arches.  Make 3 VPs, fixing them through 2 loops, RLS. </li><li>  The next tier will be 2 SSN, 1 VP, 2 SSN. </li><li>  7 CCHs that are tied into the recess from the VP in the previous row. </li><li>  Dial a chain of 5 VPs. </li><li>  Tie a chain of 12 CCH. </li></ol><p>  Knowing how to crochet a small flower along the first tiers, you can form a large one.  This can be done by knitting the required number of tiers. </p>
