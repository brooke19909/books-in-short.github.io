  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Mari El: photos and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Republic of <span>Mari El</span> is located near Chuvashia and Tatarstan.  It is famous for its pristine nature, virgin forests and pristine ponds.  For example, <span>the Sea Eye Lake</span> in its beauty and purity is in no way inferior to the famous lakes of Switzerland. </p><p>  Legend has it that in immemorial times there was a high hill on which the village is located.  One of the peasants decided to marry his own sister.  In the midst of the feast, the earth beneath the sinners opened, the abyss swallowed the village.  In its place a lake formed.  Those who are not sinners can still hear the noise of fun that comes from a wicked wedding.  The lake, as it were, lies in a huge bowl, the banks of which reach a height of 90 meters.  The shape of the pond resembles the eye.  The water in it is emerald.  This lake is not suitable for swimming for everyone, since even in the warm season, the water warms up to no more than twenty degrees above zero.  Another wonderful lake of these places is Yalchik, on its shores there are several sanatoriums and tourist centers. </p><h2>  Big Kokshaga Nature Reserve and Stone Mountain Nature Reserve </h2><p>  Tourists are delighted with <span>the Big Kokshaga Nature Reserve.</span>  These are the richest coniferous-deciduous places rich in various types of flora and fauna, along which several interesting tourist routes have been developed.  It should be noted that the reserve is usually overcast, the weather here does not indulge in sunny days.  If travelers want to enjoy the contemplation of nature under the sun, then it is better to do it in July. </p><p>  On the territory of the republic there is a landscape that is compared with the Alps in miniature.  <span>This is</span> Kamennaya Gora <span>Nature Reserve</span> .  Among this wild and extraordinary nature, the skillful creation of human hands looks very harmonious - a small gazebo near a small elegant Orthodox chapel, and next to it is a modestly equipped natural spring. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mari Chodra National Park and caves </h2><p>  In the village of Gornyak there are picturesque caves.  They are rich in natural ornaments - stalactites and stalagmites, and the walls are covered with hoarfrost.  The caves are from permafrost, so the temperature here does not rise above six degrees of heat all year round. </p><p>  <span>The Mari Chodra National Park,</span> which translates as the “Mari Forest”, is another unrivaled pearl of the region.  Here is the so-called Pugachevsky oak tree, under which, according to legend, the formidable ataman-impostor was resting. </p><h2>  Sheremetyev Castle </h2><p>  If you are interested in the sights of Mari El, you will like the description of the next palace.  In the village of Yurino there is a magnificent <span>Sheremetev castle.</span> </p>

    <p>  It is an ornate fairytale palace, with dark red walls and a green roof.  Windows and doors in a snow-white frame.  Graceful turrets in the old Russian style and battlements in the Gothic style.  The palace is difficult to attribute to any one architectural direction.  There is a successful combination of several.  Next, seven columns support the glass dome of the winter garden.  Peerless interior of the castle.  Particularly noteworthy is the sophistication of the “Eastern Cabinet”, “Picture Gallery”, and “Oak Room”.  And also there are magnificent fireplaces.  In one of them there is even a stove found during excavations in Pompeii. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  What other interesting sights of Mari El?  In the Italian park of Yoshkar-Ola, the sculptural composition “Lorenzo di Piero de Medici the Magnificent”, which symbolizes the triumph of science and art, has recently been installed. </p><h2>  Churches and cathedrals </h2><p>  The monument of Russian church architecture is the Church of the Holy Trinity.  With the advent of Soviet power, it suffered the same fate as many churches in the country.  It was closed and almost destroyed.  The restored temple impresses with its splendor and marvelous architecture. </p><p>  What other interesting sights of Mari El?  For example, the Orthodox shrine of the capital of the republic is the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ.  It is a building with sky-high towers, with reddish walls with white stripes that visually increase the height of the building.  Green roofs and golden domes attract the eye of a traveler struck by this beauty for a long time. </p>
