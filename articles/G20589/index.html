    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The four-star Crystal Sharm Hotel is located at the very end of the bay called Sharks Bay.  It is 20 kilometers from the center of Sharm el-Sheikh, and 15 kilometers from Naama Bay.  <span>The capital of Egypt,</span> Cairo, is 485 kilometers from the hotel.  The airport is located quite close.  So, the distance to it is only 6 kilometers.  Therefore, upon arrival, you can reach the hotel in a matter of minutes, which is very convenient after a tiring road.  With regard to proximity to the sea, the hotel under consideration is located on the second coastline.  Its own beach is 400 meters away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crystal sharm hotel 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/968434.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Crystal <span>Sharm Hotel 4 *:</span> reviews of Russian tourists </h2><p>  As you know, <span>modern travelers</span> in the process of choosing a hotel in a particular country in the world are doing everything possible to collect as much information about it as possible.  So, they study the official description of hotels, listen to the recommendations of managers from travel agencies.  In addition, our compatriots are trying to get acquainted with the comments of people who have already happened to stay in their place of interest.  After all, this allows us to put a picture more complete and closer to the real state of things.  We decided to save you time and effort and provide generalized reviews of tourists from Russia who recently recently stayed at the Crystal Sharm 4 * hotel (Sharm El Sheikh) during their vacation in Egypt.  Immediately, we note that most of the guests were satisfied with their choice.  In their comments, they note that the cost of living is consistent with the conditions of accommodation, hotel category and quality of service.  But we will understand everything in detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crystal sharm hotel 4 sharm el sheikh" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/968437.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  In general, according to our compatriots, the rooms they provided at the Crystal Sharm Hotel are quite spacious and clean.  Despite the fact that the hotel itself cannot be called new, the apartments are regularly redecorated.  According to the guests, you will not find modern furniture and appliances here.  However, everything is in normal working condition.  If something fails, then you need to contact the reception, and the problem will be solved as soon as possible.  Also, by the way, some hotel guests in their reviews mention the fact that if you do not like the room offered upon arrival, you can ask for a replacement.  Moreover, sometimes you have to pay extra for this.  The same applies to faster settlement.  If you arrive early in the morning, in order not to wait two in the afternoon, you can pay about $ 20 and check in early. </p><p>  According to tourists, when you check in the refrigerator you will find two half-liter bottles of water.  Subsequently, its supplies are not replenished, so you yourself will either have to collect water in coolers or buy it.  The latter option is quite expensive, so few people used it.  As for the cleaning of the rooms, the guests were generally satisfied with its quality.  Guests also note that several times during their stay the maids built funny figures from towels.  Especially such elephants, monkeys, swans and other living creatures rejoiced children.  Moreover, as guests note, the quality of cleaning and the desire of the staff to create such jewelry did not depend on whether they left them a tip or not. </p><h2>  Hotel territory and location </h2><p>  Reviews of our compatriots describe the territory of the Crystal Sharm 4 * hotel complex as large enough, clean, green and well-groomed.  According to the guests, almost everywhere a beautiful view of the sea opens here. </p><p>  As for the location of the hotel, it is located on the second coastline.  You can literally walk to the beach in 7-10 minutes at a leisurely pace.  Tourists also mention that a shuttle service to the coast is provided here.  However, most of our compatriots did not see the problem of having to make a pleasant short walk to the sea. </p><p>  Since Crystal Sharm is located in a remote area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSharm El Sheikh, you can only drive to the city center.  You can do this by taxi or bus.  A public transport stop is located next to the hotel.  The journey to the center takes about 10 minutes.  In the vicinity of the hotel there are various shops and souvenir shops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crystal sharm hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/968438.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  As for nutrition, this issue always causes a lot of controversy among tourists.  And this is true for hotels not only in Egypt, but also in other countries.  The Crystal Sharm Hotel 4 * was no exception.  So, some of the guests in their reviews claim that the food was meager and monotonous.  However, most guests claim that this hotel is inexpensive and, therefore, you can‚Äôt count on a table full of exquisite dishes and delicacies.  According to them, in the hotel restaurant you will always find something to eat, but the choice of dishes, of course, cannot be called very diverse.  So, tourists note that for breakfast sausage, cheese, cottage cheese, cereal, yogurt, vegetables and herbs, milk, eggs, scrambled eggs, pancakes, a variety of delicious pastries, several types of sausages, grilled vegetables, various side dishes and snacks are offered.  Coffee can be drunk from the machine, and tea is offered in bags or already brewed.  For lunch, guests are offered two types of soup, side dishes, vegetables, meatballs, pancakes, as well as dishes of meat, fish and chicken.  For dinner, the menu is about the same, but grilled meat is added to it, which the cooks cook on the street.  In addition, you can always treat yourself to delicious desserts, including oriental sweets, as well as fresh fruits. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Impressions </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, as already mentioned, the beach can be reached in a few minutes.  It belongs to two hotels - Crystal Charm and Crystal Sirens, which is part of the same chain.  There is a sufficient number of beds, you can rent equipment for water sports.  The beach is sandy, entry into the sea too.  So it is quite possible to do without rubber shoes.  However, in their reviews, tourists pay attention to the fact that the reef is not alive here.  Therefore, here you will not find such a large number of aquatic inhabitants, as in many other hotels in Egypt.  But you can still enjoy beautiful fish and other marine inhabitants.  Also on the beach there is a large pool, where you can also have a good time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel crystal sharm 4" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/968432.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment at the hotel and beyond </h2><p>  The territory of Crystal <span>Sharm Hotel 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh,</span> Egypt) has several pools.  From morning to late evening, a team of animators works here.  They offer everyone to take part in competitions, do gymnastics, water aerobics, play water polo, etc. In the evenings, animators arrange funny shows in the hotel's amphitheater.  After that, everyone, accompanied by employees of the hotel complex, can go to one of the discos in the city. </p><p>  Family tourists claimed that their children also had something to do at the hotel.  So, in the afternoon they could attend a mini-club, and in the evening they organized a mini-disco. </p><p>  In addition, experienced travelers recommend that everyone staying on holiday in Egypt do not spend whole days by the pool, but be sure to go at least for a couple of excursions.  Indeed, in this country there are many places that are worth visiting.  Moreover, according to our compatriots, it is most advantageous to buy tours not from the guide at the hotel, but from tour agencies in the city.  This will save you a considerable amount of money. </p><h2>  The opinion of tourists about the staff </h2><p>  As for the employees of the four-star Crystal Sharm Hotel, on the whole, our compatriots were satisfied with them.  So, hotel guests note that the workers here are friendly and attentive.  They will always be happy to help and answer any question.  In addition, our compatriots were pleased with the fact that most employees understand Russian well.  So you will not have any communication problems here. </p>
