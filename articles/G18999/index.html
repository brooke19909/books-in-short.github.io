The design of this model went to her from the previous sixth version, but the technical characteristics improved markedly.  iPhone7 can not be called a revolutionary flagship, but it has a nice and necessary changes.  Information on the <span>appearance of the</span> ‚ÄúiPhone-7" at the back, a photo of the gadget and detailed specifications can be found in this article. </p><h2>  Famous iPhone </h2><p>  iPhone is a real phenomenon among other smartphones.  Its high cost and incompatibility with many systems, it would seem, should repel buyers, but everything happens exactly the opposite.  Buyers are attracted not only by technical specifications, but also by stylish design, a good camera and a recognizable brand.  Having an iPhone in your pocket has become prestigious; having such a phone is a sign of success.  A similar impression is achieved with the help of truly talented Apple marketers, whose ideas have won the hearts of millions of people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.frandroid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what iPhone 7 looks like in the back" class="if uuid-2878866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2878866.jpg"></div><p>  All Apple smartphones work on the iOS operating system.  It is she who becomes a stumbling block for many buyers, because it is incompatible with other OSs.  And it can‚Äôt be installed on devices of other companies with all desire.  But it works like a clock, quickly processes data and is protected from data theft much better than other other systems.  In the modern world, there are entire armies of Apple fans who buy all the company's products, from computers to wireless headphones.  But this article will talk about the iPhone 7, which is one of the latest products of the "apple" brand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  iPhone 7 </h2><p>  Every year, according to tradition, Apple announces a new iPhone model.  Of course, the models differ from each other: as a rule, most of the functions are improved in them and some new details are added.  The seventh model of the smartphone was presented in San Francisco, after which sales began around the world.  What does iPhone 7 look like?  The photo shows that this model is very concise and attractive, but the screen size does not differ from the previous, sixth version.  For fans of large screens, an additional iPhone 7 Plus was released, which combined a slim body and a large display. </p><p>  Buyers treat the seventh version of the iPhone differently.  According to the description and photo, "iPhone-7" is not much different from the previous "six", as a result of which they are easily confused.  But under the body, there have been many changes.  Be that as it may, the evolution of Apple has once again occurred, and this did not go unnoticed for owners of new smartphones.  This is especially visible to those who switched to the iPhone from other brands and operating systems.  What does the iPhone 7 look like?  Outwardly, it is as concise as the previous models, but has become much thinner. </p><h2>  Box </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.macworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 7 photo back" class="if uuid-2878865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2878865.jpg"></div><p>  Oddly enough, but the impression of the seventh iPhone model begins much earlier than you pick up the phone itself.  After the purchase, the first thing you see is the box.  It would seem so interesting in ordinary packaging?  But even over it, designers and marketers tried their best.  The standard white packaging with the logo of a bitten apple is decorated with a photo of ‚ÄúiPhone-7‚Äù on the back.  This is an interesting solution, since usually a photograph of a display with a color image is placed on it.  Packaging iPhone7 gives the smartphone a mystery.  Already from it you can understand how the iPhone-7 looks.  For example, <span>the iPhone</span> 7 Gold <span>model has a</span> golden smartphone on the lid, while the iPhone 7 PLUS Jet Black has the usual white color of the cardboard replaced with completely black.  Apple designers love to make models that are significantly different from everyone else, and the box from the smartphone was no exception. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  One of the main details of the attractiveness of Apple products is its minimalist design.  If you were the owner of the sixth iPhone, you are unlikely to notice any differences when you pick up the 7th version for the first time.  Compared to the iPhone 6S, it has exactly the same display, shape and size. </p><p>  IPhone7 is available in two versions: standard and Plus.  The latter has a significantly larger screen area.  The iPhone is available in five colors, each of which is attractive in its own way.  The case of the model is made of aluminum, which has increased strength, but it‚Äôs better not to drop the gadget on the screen, because the glass is not protected by anything. </p><p>  iPhone7 is the first model with which you can safely take a shower.  Its body is completely moisture resistant, so a short-term exposure to moisture can not cause any harm.  For comparison: models 6 and 6 S possessed such properties only partially.  You can even take calls if immersed to a depth of not more than 1 meter. </p><p>  If you pay attention to how the iPhone-7 photo looks, you will understand why it is considered one of the most successful options.  But still, the main trump card of the company is under the skin of the phone. </p><h2>  IPhone 7 at the back </h2><p>  When looking at the iPhone, it becomes clear that not only the inside of the smartphone has changed.  The back of the phone has also undergone changes.  What does the iPhone 7 rear cover look like?  The first thing that catches your eye is more elegant plastic stripes.  If you look at the back of other models, you can see subtle stripes that go at the top and bottom of the cover.  If you think that they are made for beauty, then they are fundamentally wrong.  Below them are the radio antennas that transmit waves.  But they can‚Äôt pass through the metal, so Apple designers came up with a solution to replace aluminum in these places with plastic.  However, by the way ‚ÄúiPhone-7‚Äù looks from the back, you can understand that the strips have been moved to the side of the gadget.  This greatly improves the look of the phone, making it even more stylish. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The back cover of the iPhone 7 looks different in another way because of the camera.  In the new model, it is made more concisely: in the form of a small "eye" and a small flash nearby.  From the photo of the rear view of the iPhone-7, it becomes noticeable that it does not protrude so much above the metal surface, so the phone gets an even smoother and more balanced body.  The 7 Plus models have a dual camera that allows you to take wide-angle shots. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.csmobiles.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 7 description and specifications" class="if uuid-2878872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2878872.jpg"></div><h2>  Differences in color options </h2><p>  The seventh version of the "apple" smartphone is presented, as we noted, in five colors.  In addition to the usual white, black, silver and gold, another shade called ‚Äúblack onyx‚Äù was added to the line.  It is made of the same high-strength steel as other models, but it looks much more spectacular.  When you hold a glossy black iPhone in your hands, thoughts of expensive sports cars come to mind. </p><p>  If you wish, you can see your reflection on the back of the iPhone 7.  But this coating has its drawbacks.  It is excessively easy to scratch, so immediately after the purchase it is better to put on a cover on the phone, otherwise by the evening the surface will not be so smooth.  In addition, fingerprints constantly remain on the aluminum surface.  Despite the oleophobic coating, the developers could not avoid this trouble. </p><p>  Another option is matte black, which also went on sale only in 2016.  It is more suitable for practical people.  This model is made of special brushed aluminum and looks very original. </p><p>  The golden and silver iPhone are qualitatively different from the appearance of other gajes.  What does the golden iPhone 7 look like?  Thanks to the metal back surface and a white rim around the screen, the phone looks very stylish, without a hint of vulgarity. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Description of the characteristics of "iPhone 7" deserves special attention.  Externally, the seventh model has not changed, which can not be said about the internal component.  The new model is supplemented with 2 GB of RAM.  For 7 Plus models, this amount is increased to 3 GB.  The internal memory of the phone also increased.  In standard models, it is now 32 gigabytes.  The maximum memory capacity for ‚ÄúiPhone-7‚Äù is 256 GB, which allows you to store enough pictures and programs for several years. </p><p>  Another detail of the phone has undergone changes - the Home button.  If before it had to be pressed to get a response, now all you have to do is touch your finger lightly.  The sensitivity of the button to touch, as well as the speed of reaction, is striking. </p><p>  If you like listening to music, then you should like the new stereo phone system.  Improved speakers are located in different parts of the smartphone, which makes the sound more surround. </p><p>  Another curious feature of the smartphone is the lack of a familiar round headphone jack.  Starting with the 7th model, Apple decided to gradually switch to wireless systems, which puzzled its customers.  In order for the changes to be not so shocking, the model comes with an adapter that allows you to adapt the airpods to the Lightning connector.  Unfortunately, now you can‚Äôt listen to music and charge your phone at the same time. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.phonecaseseurope.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 7 features description" class="if uuid-2878870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2878870.jpg"></div><p>  The most important thing that has changed in the iPhone7 is the processor.  This model is equipped with a F10 Fusion processor, which boasts four cores and a frequency of 1.4 GHz.  The new ‚Äúbrain‚Äù turned out to be much more agile than the old version, so programs and applications now open even faster.  On average, iPhone7 overtook its predecessor in performance by as much as 40%.  The system of operation of the new processor is also interesting.  For ordinary tasks, it uses only two cores, but if you need to increase power, it uses the rest.  This allows you to increase productivity when necessary, and the rest of the time it‚Äôs more economical to use a battery.  By the way, the battery of the seventh model of iPhone has also increased, so the gadget can now work all day on a full charge.  However, you should not count on more - the phone will not last longer than 12 hours.  If you play games and use resource-intensive applications, then the battery will last only 4-5 hours.  At the time of the release of the smartphone in 2016, the F10 Fusion was considered one of the most powerful in the world.  But now iPhone7 continues to be one of the best Apple phones. </p><p>  Description of the iPhone 7 features would not be complete without a new operating system that can be used on Apple brand smartphones.  In 2018, iOS12 came out, which impressed users with its speed and performance. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The iPhone7 display deserves special attention.  Despite the fact that the diameter of the screen has not changed, its brightness has increased.  Apple's pride is the Retina display in HD resolution.  It accurately conveys shades, striking with rich colors and realism.  This property of the iPhone makes it indispensable for bloggers, photographers and designers whose work is associated with graphic images and photographs. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The cameras in these phones have always been considered the standard for mobile shooting.  IPhone 7 has an impressive camera.  Its resolution is 12 megapixels, it even has a 1.8 aperture, which allows portrait shooting with a blurred background.  In addition, the smartphone is equipped with a stabilization system, so when taking a selfie, you will get an even picture without the effect of ‚Äúshaking hands‚Äù.  Like all iPhones, the 7th model has an adjustment to the ambient temperature, which is determined by a "smart" flash.  Therefore, you will not get photos with a strange green or yellow tint.  According to reviews of the gadget, in the dark iPhone7 still doesn‚Äôt take off, but a sufficiently powerful flash can fix the situation, which is half brighter than the previous model. </p><p>  The standard version of the Seven has a single camera, but the 7 Plus has a dual camera.  Both cameras have the same resolution of 12 megapixels.  ‚ÄúLenses‚Äù are capable of capturing different distances: the left - 28 mm, and the right - 56 mm.  This allows you to shoot both wide-angle and portrait shots.  Also on one camera is the standard aperture of 1.8, and on the other - 2.8, which allows you to zoom without loss of quality.  Thanks to the highest quality images of the seventh model, the Apple iPhone can not resort to the help of a digital camera: it is successfully replaced by the phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 7 features description" class="if uuid-2878868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2878868.jpg"></div><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost of the iPhone 7 smartphone was quite high right after the release in 2016.  But now other models have entered the market, so its price has dropped markedly.  New gadgets with a memory capacity of 32 gigabytes are sold for 40 thousand rubles.  If you need more memory, you can add 4 thousand rubles and buy a phone with 128 GB of internal memory.  At the moment, this is the maximum possible amount of GB that is on sale.  iPhone 7 Plus costs a little more: for a smartphone with 32 GB of memory you will need to pay 46 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Of course, Apple produces smartphones that are much more expensive than similar products from competitors.  However, from year to year, sales do not fall, and this is due to the high build quality and customer care.  When picking up an ‚Äúapple‚Äù smartphone, you experience only pleasure and no irritation, and for this, many are ready to give a large amount. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of the Phone </h2><p>  A new smartphone is a serious expense item, so people often read a lot of reviews, and only after that they choose an option that suits them.  The description of the iPhone-7 phone shows that it has its pros and cons.  The advantages include the following factors: </p><ul><li>  Great camera. </li><li>  Fast response and lack of ‚Äúhangs‚Äù. </li><li>  The ability to swim with an iPhone in the water. </li><li>  Display Retina, which has amazing realism. </li><li>  The increased amount of internal memory. </li><li>  More powerful battery. </li><li>  High quality guarantee. </li><li>  Famous brand. </li></ul><p>  But there are a lot of minuses: </p><ul><li>  Overcharge. </li><li>  The lack of a familiar headphone jack. </li><li>  Low quality pictures in the dark. </li><li>  Incompatibility with devices of other companies. </li><li>  Expensive accessories. </li></ul><h2>  IPhone innovative features </h2><p>  Apple's smartphone is known for its small highlights that make life easier for customers.  Therefore, if you decide to change the iPhone to a phone of a different brand, then this will not be so simple, because it will not have the usual functions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cultofmac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone description iphone 7" class="if uuid-2878874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2878874.jpg"></div><ul><li>  In the new 2016 model, it became possible to unlock the phone by simply lifting it from a horizontal surface. </li><li>  The Livephotos function is a unique development of Apple, which allows you to shoot small videos of 2-3 frames. </li><li>  Airdrop helps transfer files from one iPhone to another quite quickly. </li><li>  Siri's renowned artificial intelligence helps you quickly complete certain commands using voice input. </li><li>  Unlock system using fingerprint or retina scan. </li><li>  Memories.  A function is built into the iPhone operating system that independently mounts small memory clips based on photos of recent weeks. </li></ul><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  The seventh iPhone again split the ranks of smartphone users.  But, despite numerous criticisms, entire lines of it still lined up after the start of sales.  One of the main reasons for the popularity of the flagship is its focus on ease of use and convenience.  A smartphone with an apple on the logo is nice to hold in your hands, and a fast processor allows you to instantly open any application and game.  Customers are satisfied with the ability to synchronize between different devices.  With the right settings, important events, contacts and notes are automatically transferred from iPhone to iPad or Mac.  The seventh model of the smartphone is often chosen by people who like to take good photos.  You can even take portraits with iPhone7: a special program recognizes the face and blurs the background around it, creating the appearance of real professional shots. </p><p>  Outwardly, ‚ÄúiPhone 7‚Äù has not changed at all, except that a new model with a black glossy finish has appeared.  But if you look at the iPhone-7 photo at the back, you will notice an improved camera and the absence of plastic bands in a prominent place.  By cons, buyers most often include the price and isolation of the iOS system.  Due to the company's policy, many products need to be purchased exclusively under the ‚Äúapple‚Äù brand, otherwise they simply will not work with the smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ticbeat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 7 features description" class="if uuid-2878873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2878873.jpg"></div><h2>  Summary </h2><p> The iPhone 7 is not in vain still considered one of the best smartphones on the market.  The battery, display and camera distinguish them from competitors, and the convenient interface makes them even more popular.  At the same time, each buyer can choose a suitable phone for their size: the usual 7 or 7 Plus.  The first fits comfortably in the hand, and the second attracts with a large and colorful display.  Overpayment for the brand is almost not felt, especially since after the release of subsequent models, the iPhone-7 has become much cheaper. </p><p>  Buying an iPhone, you can count not only on the quality and power of the phone, but also on the pleasure of using it. </p>
