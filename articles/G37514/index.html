    <p>  In the center, island groups are separated by the Salt River Strait.  On the map of Guadeloupe, it is practically invisible; several bridges cross it, allowing you to easily cross from one part of the archipelago to another.  Bas-Ter is considered the administrative center of the region, but the largest city is Pointe a Pitre. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General information </h2><p>  The people of Latin America are more aware of where Guadeloupe is located: their continent is closer to the islands than Eurasia.  The shores of the islands are washed by the <span>Caribbean Sea</span> and on the opposite side of the Atlantic Ocean.  The population is approximately 400 thousand people.  Most residents are blacks or mulattos.  There are also white people, Chinese, Arabs, but in general there are no more than 10 percent of the total.

    <p>  French authorities are authorized to appoint the prefect of Guadeloupe.  A separate elected body, the General Council, also participates in the adoption of decisions important for the region.  The climate in these parts is marine tropical, in summer and autumn there are frequent rains and in general it is very humid.  The air temperature practically does not drop below 17 degrees Celsius, even in winter.  Hurricanes are a common occurrence for these places.

It is called Atlantic time, designated as UTC-4.  Consequently, in France, the day comes 5 hours earlier.

There are not many rivers in these parts, but here and there you can see waterfalls.  Some of the islands are of volcanic origin.  The relief here is quite hilly, there are mountains, significant elevations. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  Due to the island location and remoteness from the mainland of Guadeloupe, France, the vegetation and wildlife are not very diverse.  Distributed tropical trees, ferns.  Of the birds you can find a unique species that is not found anywhere else - the Guadalupe melanerpes, belonging to the order of woodpeckers.  The animal is small in size, feeds mainly on termites. </p><p>  In the 19th century, rats began to breed on the islands, which destroyed sugarcane in the fields.  In order to exterminate rodents, mongooses were introduced into the overseas department of France.  Now their number in the territories has also increased significantly.  As for other types of animals, you can also see rabbits, iguanas.  In some areas, there are especially many birds. </p><p>  Island territories, like other similar ones in the world, are rich in fish and other inhabitants of the seas: mollusks, crustaceans. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Tourists often come to see the <span>capital of Guadeloupe,</span> Bas-Ter, as there the area is famous for interesting landscapes, amazing nature with waterfalls, rivers and tropical forests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is guadeloupe" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2100687.jpg"></div>  Nearby is the national park of the region, an excellent area for walking.
