  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vietnam, amazing and unexpected. Resorts and hotels in Vietnam.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Tours to Vietnam</span> are only gaining popularity, and the possibility of a trip here does not come to mind in the first place, and in vain.  It is an amazing and hospitable country with a wonderful climate, friendly residents and magnificent nature.  The tourism industry of the country is only developing, and therefore you do not have to wait from Vietnam for a vibrant entertainment program and developed infrastructure - you should go here for a calm and meditative vacation away from the hustle and bustle.  The main resorts of Vietnam are Phan Thiet, Vung Tau, Dalat, Nha Trang, Fukuong.  The most popular among tourists is Phan Thiet.  It is located 210 kilometers from Saigon, but the road from the airport usually takes 4-5 hours due to the abundance on the way of settlements.  Vacation in Vietnam itself is very inexpensive, but the flight is quite expensive, and it accounts for most of the cost of the trip. </p><p>  Vietnam hotels are pretty decent, especially 3-4 *.  Many note that 3 * hotels are actually equipped in such a way that they can claim to be a higher class - sometimes you can even find air conditioning in rooms there.  The rooms are very clean with a beautiful design and decoration.  Almost all hotels have Wi-Fi and Internet.  The only five-star hotels in Vietnam often do not reach their category, apparently due to a lack of experience and knowledge among staff and owners, so there is no point in overpaying.  Accommodation and meals in hotels is inexpensive, but it will be much more profitable to eat in street cafes.  European food is prepared here so-so, but the local one deserves attention.  Here, very cheap seafood, presented in a wide variety.  The abundance of exotic fruits also deserves attention - they are even sometimes left free in rooms.  Many hotels have beautiful gardens, mainly from mango trees and palm trees. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For travelers going to <span>Vietnam, the reviews of</span> tourists who have already been there are best studied in advance.  Most often they are enthusiastic, but there are also those who are unhappy - those who were bored here, because the nightlife does not boil here, and the infrastructure is not well developed yet, so if you expect a fun pastime from your vacation, then it is better to opt for neighboring Thailand .  But what is noted by all, without exception, even those who did not like it - this is the amazing <span>nature of Vietnam</span> and the amazing climate: the heat here is absolutely not felt, especially by the ocean.  True, you have to pay for it with constant excitement on him.  In some places there is no calm, and a bizarre underwater topography amplifies the waves, and swimming is forbidden there - it is better to find out this point in advance.  In this regard, many hotels in Vietnam are equipped with saltwater pools.  One of the most peaceful places is Nyachang - there is a very calm ocean, but here, mostly, the <span>most expensive hotels in</span> Vietnam are located here. </p><p>  The excursion program is quite rich and interesting, but often you have to travel far, but there is something to see.  It is better to ride in an organized manner, because there is trouble with transport, and local residents do not understand either Russian or English.  Speaking of English: no one here knows him, not even the hotel administrators - most likely, this is due historically.  Even a Russian-speaking Vietnamese is easier to find, especially since there are enough of our compatriots among the vacationers here, and in some <span>hotels the administrators</span> decently speak the Russian language. </p><p>  Vietnam is a very interesting country and it deserves to be visited.  It has amazing nature, wonderful climate, magnificent beaches, friendly residents, delicious cuisine, and in the tourist plan this country has a great future. </p>
