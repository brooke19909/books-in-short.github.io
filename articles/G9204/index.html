Beautiful sea and spacious beaches are not the only pride of the village.  The most famous was brought to him by the famous Genoese fortress (Sudak).  It is about her that we want to talk in our article. </p><h2>  The most famous Crimean fortress </h2><p>  The Genoese fortress in Sudak has the status of a world-class monument.  But for all its significance, it has been little studied.  Historians still can not give a definite answer as to when the fort was founded.  The fortress dates from approximately XIII-XIV centuries.  It is worth noting that in Crimea there are many architectural monuments and attractions.  But the Genoese fortress (photo is given in the article) is a special and very impressive complex.  Of course, it was not fully preserved, and traces of destruction are visible on the walls, but the power of the defensive structure of the Middle Ages is still visible.  The Genoese fortress is the largest fortification that has survived on the Black Sea coast.  It is of interest not only as an object of archaeological research, but also as an outstanding cultural monument. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vhodv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Towers and walls of the fortress" class="if uuid-2283200" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2283200.jpg"></div><p>  Which side does not approach Sudak, from the sea or land, the fortress impresses with its grandeur. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where is the Genoese fortress located? </h2><p>  The fort is located on a high mountain, which is called the Fortress.  Standing on its top, you can see the sea between Cape Ai-Fok and Cape Megan.  Sudak Valley, surrounded by mountains, stretched along the coast for more than eight kilometers.  In the north rises Mount Ai-George, in the south - Sokol, and in the west - Perchem-Kaya.  Since ancient times, this area has been a fertile land for viticulture, horticulture and agriculture.  An interesting fact is that the architecture of the fortress itself very harmoniously looks against the background of the surrounding nature and as if is a single whole with it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turisticum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fortifications" class="if uuid-2283210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2283210.jpg"></div><p>  In the west and east, natural beams approach the Fortress Mountain, which were used as defensive ditches during the Middle Ages.  By the way, not only the Genoese used local reliefs for defensive purposes.  Before the appearance of their fortress, there were earlier fortifications erected by the Byzantines, which was proved during archaeological excavations. </p><h2>  Sudak during the Crimean Khanate </h2><p>  In 1223, the city was captured by the Mongol-Tatars.  Locals scattered into the mountains.  The subsequent invasion of the Mongol Tatars occurred in 1239 under the leadership of Batu Khan.  Genoese appeared here after the influence of the Tatars was weakened.  Finally, they secured Sudak after the defeat of the horde of Mamaia in the Kulikovo field. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description of the ancient fortress </h2><p>  All Crimean regions where Italians lived were called Genoese Gazaria.  The center was in Kaffa.  Typically, the Genoese built their fortifications in the form of walls consisting of two rings.  Behind the first ring there were usually workshops and workers' houses, but behind the second - warehouses, a consul's house, administrative buildings, dwellings of nobles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vhodv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View from the fortress" class="if uuid-2283202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2283202.jpg"></div><p>  The Genoese fortress in Sudak occupied a fairly large area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 30 hectares.  But despite this, she was almost impregnable because of her incredibly good location.  The height of the fortress walls reached six meters.  And in some areas and seven meters.  In addition, the fortress was equipped with fifteen-meter towers. </p><p>  The Genoese fortress in Sudak occupied a rather large area: about 30 hectares.  But despite this, she was almost impregnable because of her incredibly good location.  The height of the fortress walls reached six meters.  And in some areas and seven meters.  In addition, the fort was equipped with fifteen-meter towers. </p><p>  Cogs protruded from the walls, guarding against enemy shelling.  In the outer ring there were fourteen towers located on Fortress Hill, the fifteenth was located in the port area.  By the way, to this day, the twelve towers rises above the fortification.  One is located separately, only two more remain from the ruins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Three gates led to the Genoese fortress.  To date, unfortunately, only the Main survived.  The walls and towers are made of local gray limestone, shell rock and sandstone.  Experts believe that the nature of the masonry gives reason to say that the construction was carried out by local craftsmen.  Apparently, there was a water supply system on the territory of the fortress, which delivered water from a spring located on Mount Perchem.  Unfortunately, the only building that is well preserved in the territory of the Genoese fortress is a mosque. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.84166620000001" data-lng="34.95849010000006" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/1/5/1015.png"></div><p>  After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the Turks sent their forces to the Crimea.  Under their onslaught gradually fell all the possessions of the Genoese on the coast.  Including Sudak. </p><h2>  Fortress during the period of the Russian Empire </h2><p>  During the Russo-Turkish war, Russian troops occupied the peninsula.  Nevertheless, the Ottomans did not lose hope of regaining their influence in the Crimea.  Many times they tried to land on the coast.  To combat them, Suvorov ordered to strengthen the coast.  And on the territory of the Genoese fortress an artillery redoubt was built.  A little later, barracks were erected for soldiers and officers of the Cyril Regiment.  These were the last construction events held on the fortress territory.  Subsequently, after the withdrawal of Russian troops from it, the fortress completely lost its purpose and gradually began to turn into ruins.  This is the history of the Genoese fortress. </p><h2>  Historical Museum </h2><p>  It is worth noting that serious damage was done to the fort in the middle of the nineteenth century by the German colonists, who founded their village right at the ancient walls.  On the territory of the fortress they grazed cattle and broke vineyards.  By the end of the century, the destruction was so significant that the question arose about the need to preserve the architectural ensemble.  After the establishment of Soviet power, the Genoese fortress in Crimea received the status of a historical monument.  She was taken under state protection.  And already in the middle of the twentieth century, an intensive architectural and archaeological survey of the complex began.  Local restoration work was also carried out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turisticum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Consular castle" class="if uuid-2283204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2283204.jpg"></div><p>  But after the Second World War, a historical and archaeological reserve was organized on the territory of the fortress.  And in subsequent years, much has been done in terms of studying the architectural monument. </p><p>  In 1968, serious restoration work was begun.  Their main goal is to restore those parts of the walls that were in disrepair at that time.  This is part of the western wall, the upper defensive ring, the Corner Tower, Bezymyannaya and Corrado Chicalo, as well as the eastern walls. </p><p>  Already in our time, the Genoese fortress in Sudak (photo is given in the article) turned into a museum.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe protected area is about 30 hectares.  Currently, Portovaya and Patrol towers, defensive walls, the Consular Castle, the Church of the Twelve Apostles, a mosque, the Catholic Cathedral of the Virgin Mary, coastal fortifications and the remains of urban buildings have survived from the buildings of the X-XV centuries. </p><h2>  Tour of the Genoese fortress </h2><p>  Resting in the Crimea, it is worth paying attention to the numerous attractions of the beautiful peninsula.  Of course, most of the architectural monuments are concentrated on the South Coast.  Regarding them, the fortress is located to the side.  But all the same, the distances are not so significant, and therefore you should definitely allocate time to visit this stunning historical complex. </p><p>  Sightseeing buses bring tourists to the gates of the fortress.  Further groups lead eastward.  Inside the fort, the ruins and the remains of some buildings are immediately evident.  The towers that miraculously survived to our days attract the most attention.  To the west of the gate is one of them - Jacobo Torsello.  And on the east side you can see the tower of Beriabo di Franchi.  The ancient mosque is very interesting in architectural terms, well preserved to this day.  Its building is made in compliance with all proportions, as a result of which the interior is spacious and light. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vhodv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mosque building" class="if uuid-2283208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2283208.jpg"></div><p>  Just behind the mosque is the consular castle, which is a whole complex of buildings.  Here is the main tower and the battle.  Both of them are connected by powerful walls, between which there is a courtyard. </p><p>  Inside the Consular Tower there is a basement, which can be reached by stairs.  One of the rooms of the building is lined with smooth, hewn stones.  It is believed that once it served as a water tank.  Nearby is the St. George Tower, on which you can see the image of St. George the Victorious, from where the name of the structure came from. </p><h2>  Barbican </h2><p>  Walking around the fortress, pay attention to the Barbican.  This is nothing but a defensive fortification built in front of the main entrance.  At one time, the barbican was surrounded by a deep moat, it was possible to get into it only via a drawbridge.  This complicated the task for the attackers.  Once near the barbican, the soldiers came under fire from the walls and towers. </p><h2>  Water tanks </h2><p>  We have already mentioned that water was laid on the territory of the fortress.  Water flowed into special facilities used to store water.  The tanks survived to this day.  One of them had a volume of 185 cubic meters, and the second - 350 cubic meters.  One of these rooms currently houses a museum of numismatics. </p><h2>  Pasquale Judicz tower </h2><p>  On the way of tourists on the territory of the fortress, the tower of Pasquale Dzhudice will certainly meet.  It preserved a heraldic plate with the name of the consul and the date of laying the building.  There are similar slabs in every tower, since they were all built at different times. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turisticum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Viewpoint" class="if uuid-2283207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2283207.jpg"></div><p>  Such structures usually had several levels.  At the bottom, ammunition was stored, at the second there were loopholes for carrying out archery, at the third level there was shooting from ballista.  All towers of the fortress had similar premises. </p><h2>  Viewpoint </h2><p>  There is an observation deck on the territory of the fortress, from which a stunning panoramic view of the Sudak Bay opens.  This place is an obligatory point of the excursion program.  Here you can take unique pictures in memory of such an exciting walk.  On the way, of course, you will see a wish tree.  There are a lot of such people throughout the peninsula.  However, it is this tree that is colorful.  If there is a cherished desire, then by all means buy a ribbon and tie it on a tree.  Believe it or not, you really want to. </p><h2>  Trade fairs </h2><p>  Currently, various events, exhibitions, festivals, concerts and more are held periodically on the territory of the historical complex.  Every year there is an international festival called the "Genoese helmet."  It is worth remembering that the fortress was repeatedly shot in films.  On the territory of the complex you can make stunning frames for memory. </p><h2>  How to get to Sudak? </h2><p>  If you plan to visit Sudak, then you should know that the working hours of the Genoese fortress are from 10.00 to 18.00 every day, without days off.  In every resort village and city on the Crimean coast, a variety of excursion programs are offered, including a visit to the fortress.  Therefore, you can use the services of local travel companies.  Also possible boat trips to Sudak on a boat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turisticum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple decoration" class="if uuid-2283211" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2283211.jpg"></div><p>  If you have personal transport, then you can easily reach your destination on the highway.  In Sudak, everyone will show you where you need to move on.  You will have to leave the transport at the stop "Village Cozy".  And then, to explore the ancient ruins, you need to walk. </p><p>  How to get to the Genoese fortress by public transport?  Arriving at the Sudak bus station, you need to transfer to a fixed-route taxi No. 6 or 5. The landmark "Village Cozy" should be the reference point. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Genoese fortress is one of the brightest sights of Crimea.  A unique historical building and an endlessly fascinating place for a family visit.  Here you can not only see the historical buildings of great interest, but also enjoy the beauty of the scenery.  In the evening, although the complex is closed to visitors, special lighting is turned on.  At such a time, the fort looks even more impressive and mysterious. </p>
