It all started with small circles of socialists who were persecuted within the Russian Empire.  All this resulted in a powerful and well-organized mass party, which in the final was called the CPSU.  The decoding of this abbreviation is sufficient, simple and means an ideological and geographical component.  However, first things first. </p>

    <h2>  The formation of socialism </h2><p>  The nineteenth century is generally very rich in various kinds of protests against the authorities for political and civil rights.  The Decembrists began this battle, and then they picked up numerous university circles and public organizations.  The ideas of socialism are actively promoted and promoted during the reign of Alexander II.  The liberal-democratic attitude of most of the society was fertile ground for the development of the ideas of liberalism and social-democratic views.  Populism has also contributed to the spread of socialist ideas in the vast expanses of Russia.  The organization "Land and Freedom" purposefully engaged in popularizing the ideas of socialism in our country.  All these organizations were, so to speak, the forerunner of the huge and influential CPSU.  The decoding of the word sounds like the Communist Party of the <span>Soviet Union.</span>  However, before its occurrence was still quite far.  In the 80s of the nineteenth century, Georgy Plekhanov founded the first Russian organization, which stood on the positions of socialism and Marxism, to which communism was subsequently equated with minor modifications. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The ups and downs of the formation of socialist organizations </h2><p>  However, the ‚ÄúEmancipation of Labor Group‚Äù was not numerous and did not enjoy much influence among Russian socialists.  Georgy Valentinovich intensified his activity and got acquainted with similar groups from Kiev and Minsk; on the basis of this activity he met with V.I. Ulyanov.  Initially, the views of both leaders of the socialist movement coincided, and by mutual efforts they did everything possible to ensure that these scattered groups and cells in all the cities and regions of the Russian Empire formed one party.  What happened at the constituent congress in Minsk is the very party on the basis of which the CPSU is formed with ideological and personal changes in the future.  The decoding of the party created in 1898 was significantly different from the usual CPSU, when it was formed, it was called the RSDLP, which means the Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party. </p><h2>  Ideological and organizational differences </h2><p>  However, this was not the only metamorphosis that occurred with the name of the party.  As mentioned above, the founding fathers of the new political institute, Georgy Plekhanov and Vladimir Ulyanov, later quite diverged in their views on the future of Russia, its reorganization and methods for carrying out these transformations.  This resulted in open skirmishes of supporters of the first and second leaders, and then reflected on the organizational order of the party.  Already at the next congress (after the founding congress), the party was divided into the Mensheviks led by Plekhanov and the Bolsheviks headed by Lenin, but the party's external unity still remained until 1917.  Nevertheless, ideological and methodological disagreements led to the withdrawal of Lenin from the party‚Äôs main publication - the Iskra newspaper.  The split within the party was growing stronger, Plekhanov and his supporters held moderate social democratic positions, choosing reform as the main method of transformation, and the Bolsheviks differed in their radical attitudes and recognized the violence as the proletarian revolution as the main method of social change. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Creation of the Russian Communist Party </h2><p>  In April 1917, a long overdue event occurred.  The Bolshevik faction finally dissociated itself from the RSDLP, the basis of which was represented by moderate Mensheviks and created its own RCP (b), which will form the basis of the future CPSU.  The decoding of this new Bolshevik organization accurately characterizes its ideological views and reads as follows: Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks).  The clarification with the letter ‚ÄúB‚Äù in brackets further emphasized the difference between the party and the classical Western European teachings of social democracy and even communism. Lenin made some changes to the concept developed by Karl Marx, adapting it to Russian realities, but this was not the final name of the party.  Already after the victory in the armed uprising in October 1917, the RCP (b) again changed its name, thereby wanting to emphasize its universality and becoming a ruling party.  Since 1925, it began to be called the CPSU (B.), And already this name was transformed in 1952 into the Communist Party.  The decoding of the name of 1925 changed only slightly, the word "Russian" was replaced by "All-Russian", and everything else remained unchanged. </p><h2>  The irony of the people and the official abbreviation </h2>

    <p>  Like any other political organization, it had governing bodies, which also received the abbreviation.  In our case, this is the Central Committee of the CPSU, the decoding sounds like the Central Committee of the party.  During the presidency of Yuri Andropov, who until then was the head of the State Security Committee, the people jokingly renamed the main body.  He was called the Cheka of the CPSU.  The decoding of this name was ironically interpreted as the Chekist committee of the party.  And they called security officers of the USSR security officers.  Thus, the decoding of the word CPSU shows us the historical evolution of the name, the change in ideological concepts and the expansion of the influence of this political institution. </p>
