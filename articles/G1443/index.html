    <p>  First of all, many guests celebrate the hospitality and friendliness of the staff.  The staff is very caring for hotel guests.  Many even try to communicate in Russian.  A big plus is nutrition.  The food is varied and very tasty.  A huge assortment of fruits (watermelons, pineapples, bananas, cherries, plums and melons). </p><p>  The beach is a bit far from the hotel.  Perhaps that is why not many Russians are resting here.  But a walk to the sea is a pleasure.  The surrounding nature gives unique emotions and impressions. </p><h2>  About location </h2><p>  The hotel is in a very good location.  Fenals Beach is within walking distance.  The promenade is 10 minutes away.  The bus station is 7 minutes away.  Near the hotel there is a bus stop with buses to Blanes.  There are supermarkets across the road. </p><p>  The hotel occupies a large territory, which is simply surrounded by green spaces. </p><h2>  Room Service </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel is not new, the rooms are very clean and well maintained.  You don‚Äôt even need to leave a tip for cleaning, they do everything with high quality.  Some floors have already been refurbished.  Everything is working properly. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  Breakfast is included in the price.  Lunches and dinners are not distinguished by an abundance of delicacies, but all dishes are prepared with a soul and of high quality.  Daily served dishes of meat and fish, side dishes to choose from, soups, salads, desserts and pastries, fruits.  Drinks are available at an additional cost.  The prices are reasonable even for a person with a small income.  When checking into a hotel, the restaurant serves a cold appetizer dinner. </p><p>  The service is at a decent level, but without much emotion.  Work is done "in good conscience."  In the afternoon, guests are entertained by animators near the pool. </p><p>  The hotel is designed for people of all ages.  Here you can meet young people, family people with children, and even senior citizens.  The hotel is almost always full of guests.  This indicates its worthy position in the field of tourism. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The nearest beaches to the Samba 3 * hotel (Spain) are Fenals and Lloret.  But a little stroll, you can be on the ‚ÄúBodella‚Äù and ‚ÄúSanta Cristina‚Äù. </p><p>  Boadella Beach is located directly behind the garden of St. Clotilde.  This beach is intended for nudists, but the middle part is occupied by ordinary vacationers.  Unlike the Fenals zone, there is a sand cover and convenient entry into the sea.  If not for naked people in sight, this beach would be ideal for families with children. </p><p>  Of the minuses, it is worth noting the lack of a refrigerator in the rooms.  Use of appliances and a safe is available at an additional cost. </p><h2>  General impression </h2>
