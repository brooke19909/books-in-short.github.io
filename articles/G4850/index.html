  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The structure of the brain. Functional load on some elements</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The activity of the central nervous system is inextricably linked with the brain.  The structure of the brain largely determines its functions and properties.  The place for placement of the brain with its surrounding membranes by nature is defined in the cavity of the brain skull.  It is possible to trace the complete correspondence of the surface of the inner vault of the skull with the shape of the upper ventral surface of the brain.  In the lower surface at the base of the brain, the relief is complex, and corresponds to the cranial fossae on the inner base of the skull. </p><p>  The brain weight of an already fairly adult person ranges from 1100-2000 grams.  From the age of 20 to the age of sixty, both the brain mass and its volume remain unchanged and maximum for each individual. </p><p>  Considering the structure of the brain, we single out its most prominent elements, which are the three major components.  These are the paired hemispheres, the brain stem and the cerebellum. </p><p>  The most burdened functional element is the hemisphere of the human brain.  In adults, this is the most powerful and most important element of the central nervous system.  The hemispheric departments are arranged so that they are able to cover with themselves all the other components of the brain.  To separate the right and <span>left hemispheres,</span> a deep longitudinal slit of the cerebrum serves, it reaches the cerebral commissure or the so-called <span>corpus callosum.</span>  In the region of the posterior sections, the longitudinal fissure reaches the transverse fissure of the large brain.  It serves to separate the cerebellum from the hemisphere. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All that is lower than the cerebellum is the constituent parts of the brain stem, they are called: the <span>medulla oblongata, the</span> posterior, middle and intermediate sections.  But this is closer to the section studying the structure of the spinal cord of a person. </p><p>  To answer questions about the nature of the emergence of the central functions of the central nervous system, which worried scientists and physicians, allowed their work on the study of human physiology.  Only by understanding the structure of the brain can an explanation be given for a wide range of processes that arise as a result of human life.  As a complex mechanism in which individual parts are responsible for different functions, the central <span>nervous system</span> distributed functional loads to its various components.  For example, the structure of the cerebral cortex gave an answer to the question about the localization (location) of the areas responsible for performing the most basic functions. </p><p>  The motor functions are controlled by the cortical department of the analyzer responsible for this function.  It is located in front of the central gyrus, in the part of the front central groove.  This area has become the location of nerve cells, which are responsible for even the smallest movement of the body with their activity. </p><p>  Large nerve cells with their processes, which are located in the cortex, its deep layers, stretch into the medulla oblongata, at this point there is a crossing of a significant part of them, i.e.  there is a process of transition to the opposite side.  Finishing the transition, they descend along the spinal cord, where their remaining fragments already intersect.  In the front of the spinal cord, they find contact with the nerve cells that are located here.  The signal that arose in the cortex, as if by wire reaches the <span>motor neurons,</span> through their fibers reaches the muscles. </p><p>  The auditory region located in the <span>temporal lobe of</span> the cortex under consideration is responsible for the performance of auditory functions.  Visual functions are assigned to the occipital lobe in the cerebral cortex.  Damage to any of the above sites leads to certain violations of the central nervous system. </p><p>  The structure of the brain tends to be divided not only by elements.  The brain, like the spinal cord, is surrounded by three membranes.  They are divided into inner (soft), middle (spider web) and outer (hard) shells.  Each of them is a direct continuation of the <span>membranes of the spinal cord.</span> </p><p>  Despite the deep knowledge of this important organ, he is in no hurry to reveal all his secrets.  But the painstaking work of doctors and scientists does not stop to this day.  Their assertiveness and determination are aimed at achieving a noble goal in the struggle for human health. </p>
