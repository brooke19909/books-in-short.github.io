  <section class="page js-page"><h1>City Krefeld, Germany: photos, description, attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The historic city of Krefeld (the administrative district of Germany - D√ºsseldorf) is located on the territory of the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia.  Its population is more than 236 thousand people. </p><p>  The history of this city is rich and rich.  The first mention of it was back in ancient Rome.  Located in the lower reaches of the Rhine River, the city of Krefeld (Germany) was of no small importance as a fortification point of defense. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.krefeld.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Krefeld Station Building" class="if uuid-3242756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3242756.jpg"></div><h2>  Short story </h2><p>  For the first time the name is mentioned in the written sources of 1105.  In the XIII century, the city was almost completely destroyed by floods (the Rhine spill), and it was rebuilt. </p><p>  Once again, the city was destroyed in 1584 during the period of hostilities, and for almost 20 years remained uninhabited.  At the turn of the XVI-XVII centuries, during the outbreak of the plague epidemic, many found refuge in this particular locality.  At the end of the XVII century, some families left Krefeld due to disagreements.  After moving to America, they founded their German city in Philadelphia. </p><p>  Almost the entire central part of the village was destroyed during the bombing by Allied aircraft in 1943.  It is worth noting that the city of Germany Krefeld (photo presented in the article) after the death of Wilhelm von Oranin at the beginning of the 18th century, was given to Prussia.  In order to relieve some tension among residents, the Catholic Church and schools were built on the orders of Frederick the Great.  And further throughout the century, the city expanded, thanks to the help of the King of Prussia.  Even a long (7 years) war with Austria and France could not prevent the development of the city.  And today, the production of velvet and silk, begun in the 17th century, glorifies this city.  In addition, a harbor was built here at the beginning of the last century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Architecture features </h2><p>  Among the many historical cities of Germany, Krefeld stands out for the fact that it is not just a settlement.  It contains 3 of these.  The reason for this is that three different eras and three styles are interwoven here.  This is a medieval site - the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Lynn fortress, areas of the Classicism era and the Uerdinger quarter in the Baroque style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ostwall.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Krefeld" class="if uuid-3242738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3242738.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the city has Romanesque and Gothic churches in the Fisheln district.  The latter are in marked contrast with the large country houses and luxury villas in the Bokum area, as well as the lovely and rustic village of H√ºls.  Previously, all these territories were separate villages surrounded by the city.  All this has come together today in Krefeld.  However, today each district retains its own unique style. </p><h2>  Historic and Cultural Attractions </h2><p>  Krefeld (Germany) is administratively divided into 9 districts.  It should be noted that the settlement is a twin city of the Russian city of Ulyanovsk. </p><p>  It was here that the rock band Blind Guardian was created - one of the most famous in Germany.  The famous artist Josef Boyce (postmodernist) was born in this city.  Among the most famous attractions, one should especially note the Art Museum, famous throughout the world for its collections.  He posted in his rooms a huge number of paintings.  The museum consists of three parts located in different buildings - in the Houses of Lange and Esther, as well as in the Museum of Kaiser Wilhelm.  The latter is decorated with a bronze sculpture (late 19th century) depicting the winged Genius of art.  Each hall has its own interior and collections of individual genres and eras. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="de.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="One of the buildings of the Art Museum" class="if uuid-3242751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3242751.jpg"></div><p>  As noted above, the city has long been famous for its textile manufactories.  The Museum of Silk Culture and the German Textile Museum are located here. </p><p>  There are also ancient castles in Krefeld Germany.  This is Burg Lynn and Krakow Castle.  Which is located east of Krefeld 800 meters.  It was first mentioned at the beginning of the 15th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.krefeld.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lynn Castle" class="if uuid-3242736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3242736.jpg"></div><h2>  Other attractions </h2><p>  There are only two of them: </p><ol><li>  The favorite vacation spot of locals and residents of the surrounding area is H√ºlser Berg, which is a hill of glacial origin. </li><li>  Monument to the toothbrush (1983), having a height of 6 meters. </li></ol><h2>  Events held in the village </h2><p>  The historic city of Germany Krefeld is famous for its old part, where many 18th-century houses and craft workshops are located.  The unprecedented atmosphere of the Middle Ages is felt here thanks to the special design that has been preserved to this day. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.3387609" data-lng="6.585341699999958" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/8/0/0/5/18005.png"></div><p>  In the very first months of autumn, a fashion festival is held in the city.  Defile with a demonstration of original outfits is held right on the central square of Krefeld. </p><p>  Every year near the walls of another attraction - Lynn Fortress, the Flaxmart Fair is held.  On it you can buy interesting gifts and valuable souvenirs made by hereditary artisans and craftsmen.  Here you can enjoy all kinds of national German dishes, exquisite varieties of Rhine wine and beer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.krefeld.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The modern part of the city" class="if uuid-3242737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3242737.jpg"></div><h2>  Famous people of Krefeld (Germany) </h2><p>  These are: </p><ol><li>  The footballer of the Bayer Uerdingen club (from 1982 to 1989), who was a player of the German national team from 1983-1988, was Matthias Herget (born in 1955). </li><li>  A popular German singer is Berg Andrea (born in 1966). </li><li>  The artist (engraver, painter and landscape painter) - Holler Alfred (period of life - 1888-1954). </li><li>  The artist, a native of the city, one of the most famous theorists of the postmodernism trend is Boyce Joseph (life period - 1921-1986). </li></ol><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  As in most German cities, the weather in Krefeld has a mixed type: periodically sunny calm days are replaced by winds and rains.  In general, the climate in the city is quite mild, marine.  In summer, the air temperature is + 13-22 degrees Celsius, in spring and autumn - plus 5-15 degrees, and in winter it practically never drops below 0 degrees. </p>
