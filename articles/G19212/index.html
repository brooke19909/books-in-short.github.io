On the 28th, the Italian army launched an invasion from the territory of Albania.  After the Khalkhin Gol conflict, it was the Greek army that was the first among the anti-Hitler coalition to defeat the aggressor, forcing the Italians to retreat.  Only in April of the 41st did the German government independently attempt an occupation.  This time the invasion was successful. </p><h2>  Invasion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="historyimages.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Capture of Greece" class="if uuid-3005067" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3005067.jpg"></div><p>  The history of Greece in World War II began on October 28, 1940, when Italian troops invaded the republic.  At first, only the border units provided resistance, but that was not enough. </p><p>  The Greek covering forces, reinforced by one cavalry and five infantry divisions at once, launched a counterattack on the left flank of the enemy.  In just two days they managed to oust the Italians back to Albania. </p><p>  By November 6, it became obvious that the initiative was completely on the side of the Greeks.  The situation changed when a coup d'etat took place in Yugoslavia in March 41, as a result of which the pro-German government of Tsvetkovich was overthrown.  This forced the Germans to step up, accelerating the implementation of their plans in the Balkans, moving from political pressure to open aggression. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  An occupation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ww2wrecks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece in the war" class="if uuid-3005078" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3005078.jpg"></div><p>  In April, German troops crossed the borders of Greece, by mid-May the country was completely occupied.  The Nazis themselves established control over Thessaloniki and Athens, the rest of the regions were divided between the satellites of Germany - Bulgaria and Italy. </p><p>  The occupation led to disastrous consequences for the civilian population during the capture of Greece in World War II.  In Athens alone, about 30 thousand people died of starvation, several tens of thousands more due to repression by collaborators and Nazis.  The economy was completely destroyed.  Most of the Greek army emigrated to the Middle East. </p><h2>  Resistance Formation </h2><p>  At the same time, a Resistance was formed against the occupation regime, which became one of the most effective in Europe.  Regular guerrilla attacks and battles against collaborators were carried out.  A large-scale intelligence network has been created. </p><p>  In the fall of 1943, Italy and Bulgaria signed a truce with the anti-Hitler coalition, declaring war on Germany.  Bulgarian and Italian troops began to fight on the side of the Greek partisans. </p><p>  It was possible to free the occupied territories by October 1944.  Largely thanks to the local Resistance, as well as to the British troops who landed as part of Operation Manna. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The troubles of Greece in the Second World War did not end there.  The country was in political polarization, which led to the outbreak of civil war. </p><h2>  Great famine </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gallimafry.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece losses" class="if uuid-3005077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3005077.jpg"></div><p>  Speaking briefly about the history of Greece during the years of confrontation with the Nazis, it is necessary to mention the Great Famine.  He broke out in 1941-1942 during the occupation by the forces of the Nazi coalition.  In large cities, up to 300 thousand people died.  The largest number was recorded in the very first winter of occupation.  The Axis countries began the systematic looting of the occupied territories, considering them exclusively as a source of food, raw materials and labor. </p><p>  Almost immediately after the occupation, the collaborationist government of Tsolakoglu was created.  The new authorities could not stop the uncontrolled confiscation and hyperinflation. </p><p>  By the end of May 1941, the Wehrmacht‚Äôs Department of War Economy confiscated all vital industrial and food products, sending them to the Third Reich.  In violation of the rules on confiscation under the Hague Convention of 1907, the Nazis regarded goods and products as war trophies.  For the purchase of food, a violent loan was concluded between the banks of Greece and Germany.  The German side has not repaid it so far.  Almost completely destroyed infrastructure and transport. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Humanitarian disaster </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ww2today.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Occupation regime" class="if uuid-3005069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3005069.jpg"></div><p>  For Greece, in the Second World War, one of the most severe blows was a humanitarian disaster.  The famine struck all the major cities of the country - Athens, Thessaloniki, Piraeus, as well as the islands of Chios and Syros.  The poorest classes were at risk: pensioners, unemployed, state employees. </p><p>  I had to cook food from improvised means.  A variety of seeds, corn bread were used, mules, hedgehogs, turtles were cooked. </p><p>  The scale of the humanitarian catastrophe was even more dramatic, it was announced, since many of the deaths were deliberately hidden by relatives in order to receive rations on food service coupons. </p><p>  Humanitarian assistance was initially provided only on the steamboat Kurtulush, which flew under the neutral Turkish flag.  In fact, he performed only five flights through the Red Cross.  After the Swedish-Swiss committee was formed, which began to supply food to Greece to save the situation. </p><h2>  Jewish Genocide </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ww2wrecks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of Greece" class="if uuid-3005068" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3005068.jpg"></div><p>  Considering briefly the history of Greece, it is necessary to note the Holocaust, which also existed in the country.  Almost 13 thousand Jews fought on the side of the Greek army.  These included Lt. Col. Mordechai Freezis, who successfully resisted the Italian invasion. </p><p>  During the occupation of the country, 86% of Jews were killed in the occupied territories.  This happened even though many Greeks and the Greek Orthodox Church sought to shelter them. </p><p>  In the summer of 1942, all Jews in Thessaloniki were ordered to be deported to Nazi concentration camps.  The local Jewish community paid two and a half million drams, but at that expense it was only possible to postpone the deportation for several months.  More than 46 thousand Jews were sent to Auschwitz.  Of these, only less than two thousand returned alive. </p><p>  In June 1944, the Allies launched the bombing of Corfu.  It was a false maneuver to distract the Germans from landing in Normandy, where a "second front" was opened.  At this time, the Gestapo decided to assemble a Jewish community, which was temporarily transferred to Fort Palayo Frorio for subsequent deportation to Auschwitz.  Almost 2 thousand Jews who escaped were saved.  Many of them have been granted asylum by local residents. </p><p>  According to various estimates, from one and a half to two thousand Jews joined guerrilla groups to resist the invaders.  In Thessaly and Thessaloniki even separate Jewish partisan units existed.  In Athens and many other major cities, the Jewish underground operated.  135 Jews from Greece revolted in a concentration camp in Auschwitz, blowing up two crematoriums.  The Germans with great difficulty managed to suppress this rebellion, had to resort even to call aviation.  Greek Jews who managed to escape participated in the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. </p><p>  Many Greeks saved Jews by risking their own lives. </p><h2>  Economy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="historyimages.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Army of greece" class="if uuid-3005073" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3005073.jpg"></div><p>  After the occupation, the Greek economy was in fact in ruins.  A significant blow was dealt to agriculture and foreign trade relations, which were two key components of the local economic system. </p><p>  The Germans' demands to pay the so-called ‚Äúcosts of the occupation‚Äù led to hyperinflation.  Inflation doubled every 28 hours.  By 1944, notes in the amount of 100 billion drams appeared in circulation.  One of the most significant effects of hyperinflation was hunger.  Post-war economic development was greatly hampered by the existence of the black market and the stratification of monetary accumulations. </p><p>  During the economic recovery, the main condition was the rejection of the monetary system.  This meant that at first it was decided to create an organizational and production infrastructure, only then to establish production itself. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thoughtco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Occupied Territories" class="if uuid-3005070" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3005070.jpg"></div><p>  Losses of Greece in the Second World War amounted to 60 thousand deaths only among soldiers and officers. </p><p>  In total, more than 400 thousand soldiers were mobilized, taking into account the total population of Greece at 7.2 million people.  Another 55 thousand soldiers were injured, about 120 thousand were captured. </p><p>  Losses among civilians (for various reasons) amounted to 375 thousand people.  In total, 435 thousand Greeks died in the Second World War. </p>
