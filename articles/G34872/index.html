After all, everyone wants to rid themselves of any negative influences of the world and attract love, health and good luck in business.  A talisman is a specific item that gives its owner protection and patronage of supernatural powers.  In antiquity, our ancestors for years noticed the features of certain objects in relation to the impact that they can have on human life.  And some of them eventually turned into amulets.  Of course, today no one arranges ritual dances with totems around bonfires, invoking the mercy of the gods to help in this or that sphere of life.  But many believe things that bring good luck.  Amulets of our time most often have the form of jewelry.  In this article, we will consider the most common talisman - a wonderful bracelet-amulet. </p><h2>  What bracelets can be amulets </h2><p>  By and large, a mascot bracelet can be created from any material.  Such jewelry can be sewn, embroidered, glued or woven.  And here it is all about symbolism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wonderful bracelet amulet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/713923.jpg"></div>  There are certain symbols, inscriptions, or even methods of tying knots, which carry a certain meaning.  There is an unwritten rule stating that <span>a do-it-yourself charm bracelet</span> should be made for someone with best wishes.  If such things are created for themselves, then they no longer carry the necessary energy in themselves.  Things are somewhat more complicated with the found bracelets.  It's impossible to guess here.  Such things can carry a charge of both positive energy and negative.  In addition to home-made bracelets, you can also find factory-made products, and there is, for example, even a gold and <span>silver charm bracelet.</span>  In jewelry, symbols are also used, applied to various pendants or pendants.  They can be decorated with precious or semiprecious stones and can be very expensive.  In addition, the stones used also have certain protective properties to the same extent as the metal itself from which the jewelry is made.

The Slavs worshiped various pagan gods and applied their symbols to household items and jewelry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself bracelet" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/714294.jpg" width="418"></div>  Such things as bracelets, talismans, charms created in the form of figures, garments, as well as other similar products, were created with their own hands and presented to loved ones.  Most often, ancient masters liked to portray a <span>symbol of the sun</span> and well-being.  The wonderful bracelet-amulet occupied a special place among the Slavic ‚Äúdefenders‚Äù.  This jewelry was worn by both men and women.  The mistress of the house created bracelets for the whole family.  And it was necessary to do this all alone.  It was believed that if the sleeves of the shirt were not fastened with bracelets on the wrists, then <span>unclean power</span> penetrated through them <span>.</span>  Any material was used to create jewelry.  It could be wood, fabric, or even bone.  The most important thing is what kind of pattern the Slavic charms of bracelets were decorated with.  And also - with what wishes are made.  Such a bracelet was called a "hoop", that is, what surrounds the hand.

    <h2>  Color magic </h2><p>  In talismans and charms, a significant role is played not only by the sign or pattern, but also by color.  Each of them has its own meaning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic amulets bracelets" class="if" height="258" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/713916.jpg" width="366"></div>  The yellow thread will relieve envious people, the green one will help in financial matters, and the blue one will strengthen intuition.  One of the most popular ‚Äúprotectors‚Äù is a red bracelet amulet.  Because the color itself carries protective energy.  It is believed that this thread protects against the effects of evil people and removes all sorts of troubles.  Therefore, even the newly born babies were endowed with such a talisman.

    <h2>  Tibetan philosophy </h2><p>  Another common and at the same time original and attractive is a wonderful charm bracelet called shambhala.  This amulet comes from Tibet.  It is recommended to wear it constantly.  It is also important to respect him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bracelets charms amulets" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/713921.jpg" width="600"></div>  In fact, it consists of a large number of nodules, each of which carries a particle of the general meaning embedded in the amulet.  According to Tibetan philosophy, if you are facing severe upheavals, then such <span>a charm bracelet</span> can help you <span>.</span>  <span>How to do</span> such a thing?  Yes, in general, completely uncomplicated.

    <h2>  The process of creating Shambhala </h2><p>  To weave such a bracelet, you will need a <span>waxed cord</span> and beads.  Take nine beads, one hundred eighty centimeters of a blue cord and sixty centimeters of black.  Beads can be either ordinary plastic or made of semiprecious stone.  Here, everything will depend on your capabilities.  Tie a blue cord around black and start tying knots.  After you have made five knots, begin to put on the beads, alternating them with tying the following knots.  At the end, as many knots are executed as at the beginning.  Two beads are left at the ends.  To make the clasp, you need to separately tie a few more knots at both ends of the bracelet.  Such a bracelet can also be supplemented with interesting pendants with the image of various symbols. </p><h2>  Features of silver amulets </h2><p>  Amulets made of gold and silver were revered by our ancestors most of all.  It was believed that such talismans have special power because of the magical properties of the metal itself.  Gold was associated with the power of the Sun, and silver was considered endowed with the magical powers of the night luminary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="silver bracelet amulet" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30716/714288.jpg" width="600"></div>  That is why ritual objects and jewelry, which were of particular importance, were made exclusively of silver.  Women who preferred to wear jewelry made only of this metal were considered the guardians of secret knowledge.  They had a particularly strong intuition.  Therefore, some female symbols, such as, for example, the Lada Cross, were made only of silver.

    <h2>  Using silver charms </h2><p>  How the wonderful charm bracelet or any other silver talisman works, the speed of its darkening when worn will tell.  It is believed that if silverware quickly darkens, then its owner is exposed to the negative effects too often.  But such amulets can be cleaned and charged with positive energy.  To do this, put a bracelet or any other silver product on the window.  Leave it there until dawn.  You need to do this on the growing moon.  After such manipulations, the jewelry should be placed in a container with salt water and left there for several days. </p><p>  Various amulets were very popular among the population.  Silver and gold jewelry in ancient times were made by blacksmiths, which made them especially respected.  Such talismans were available to people of high affluence. </p>
