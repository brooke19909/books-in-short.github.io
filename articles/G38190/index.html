Aliexpress: refund to card or wallet</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  People may differ in their attitudes toward shopping.  Someone goes to the store with a clear purpose and a deferred amount of money, while someone likes to make spontaneous purchases and has in reserve a special pocket with a large bill.  But those and others can not rarely deny themselves the pleasure of wandering around the expanses of stores on the Internet.  Why do shopping enthusiasts voluntarily refuse a fascinating shopping trip to boutiques in favor of a no less exciting viewing of the Aliexpress website? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to return money with aliexpress" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/437429.jpg" width="580"></div>  There may be many reasons: saving time, more affordable prices, convenience of choice (you can sit on the couch or even in the bathroom, while the gadget demonstrates possible acquisitions) and affordable feedback from the seller.  It would seem that here they are - shops of the future!  But there is one nuance that the happy owners of new things do not think about - how to return money from Aliexpress if the thing did not fit?

    <h2>  Ordering Issues </h2><p>  Of course, no one provides for the possibility of disagreement at the time of euphoria from ordering a new thing, but what to do when an unexpected problem arises?  If there are problems with the order, the first thing it is recommended to contact the seller.  This is the same person as you, who is probably interested in further cooperation and the growth of his rating, which allows you to attract more new customers.  To communicate with him, you should use messages to order, since this correspondence can be considered by the administration, if the case cannot be settled peacefully and the presence of an arbitrator is required.  When the supplier enters into a dialogue, and together you analyze the problem, the situation can still be resolved.  But what if the supplier does not respond, or conversations with him do not lead to a solution to the problem?  And such cases are provided for by "Aliexpress".  The administration recommends opening a dispute in your order. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  <span>What is a dispute?</span> </h2>

One has only to say that the dispute involves early completion of the order with the stipulated full or partial return of funds to the buyer.  In the process of resolving the dispute by peaceful means, it is proposed to carry out monetary settlements between the buyer and the supplier by mutual agreement of the parties.  If the offer is accepted, then the order is considered completed, and the re-challenge is not provided. <br>  Except in those cases when the order came with a defect or the wrong product was ordered, the opening of a dispute can be used for emergency protection of your money in the absence of contact with the seller and the completion of the order time.  The button for opening a dispute is not unlimited.  It becomes available only six days after the publication of the order number and becomes inactive with the end of the automatic confirmation of the order.  After that, a refund with "Aliexpress" becomes impossible.

Until the end of the timer, you can open a dispute.  The maximum time for a dispute may take 15 days, and the buyer can independently transfer the dispute to a claim three days after it begins, if it becomes clear that the dispute cannot be resolved without involving the administration.  The dispute automatically becomes a claim after 15 days.  Next, the claim is considered by mediators.

The Claims Manager is suitable for this. It is indispensable for those who think how to return money from Aliexpress.  What can be the status for claims?  Initial familiarization and decision-making, for which the administration is responsible, are not time-bound and are not subject to requests.  This status is Processing.  The supplier’s response time — awaiting the other party`s response — is limited to seven days.  If during this period the supplier does not respond and does not provide documentation upon request, then the money is returned to the buyer.

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Waiting for a response from the buyer or “awaiting my response” does not allow ignoring, since the claim will be closed.  Waiting for a response from all parties to the conflict or “awaiting the other party`s response” occurs with an e-mail notification, but still it is recommended to monitor the status of the claim so as not to miss the response time. </p><h2>  Where is the money returned from Aliexpress? </h2><p>  When making a purchase, payment occurs immediately.  To do this, use electronic wallets, cards or a mobile phone balance.  When resolving a dispute in the interests of the buyer, a refund is made from Aliexpress to a card or <span>electronic wallet.</span>  You can use Qiwi wallet as a means of payment.  Then there is a refund for "Aliexpress" to "Qiwi."  There may be delays in the return of money depending on the distance of sending and on the currency exchange.  You can track the return of money to "Aliexpress" by calling the support service and find out the status of the request. </p><h2>  Refund Efficiency </h2>

As soon as the return is agreed upon, its very fact becomes accomplished.  But before the money appears on the buyer's card or wallet, it can take up to two weeks.  At the same time, the buyer should not perform any more actions, and he does not affect the implementation of the return.  But according to the rules of Aliexpress, the seller has the right not to confirm the cancellation of the paid goods and to continue sending the parcel.

    <p>  In any case, "Aliexpress" offers the most favorable prices for the desired goods and the ability to assert their rights in situations where the received goods are not satisfied with the quality or appearance.  Always remember that on the other side of the computer there are living people who are interested in mutually beneficial cooperation and meeting the needs of the buyer.  The administration of the site is also responsible for protecting the rights of all participants in the trading process, which intervenes in disputes and gives advice on how to return money from Aliexpress.  A personal account has been created specifically for the buyer, where information is available on all available, completed or potential transactions. </p><p>  In general, finding information on how to return money with Aliexpress is quite simple, but I would like to wish all potential and real buyers not to encounter situations when it is necessary. </p>
