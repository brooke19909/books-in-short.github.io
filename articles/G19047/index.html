Therefore, those who drive their car all year round have to regularly lay out a round sum.  Russia has set a tariff framework for the policy, but not all companies follow it and often charge unrealistic prices for their services.  You can find out how OSAGO insurance is considered, and what is the decreasing and increasing coefficient, in this article. </p><h2>  What is CTP? </h2><p>  MTPL is considered the same binding document for driving as the driver‚Äôs license itself.  Without this policy, you will not have the opportunity to register a new car, and on the road, driving without compulsory motor third-party liability insurance will face a fine and significant material costs.  After all, CTP is a policy of compulsory liability insurance, i.e.  in the event of an accident caused by your fault, the costs of the repair are compensated by the insurer, not you.  Obligatory presence of compulsory motor liability insurance is regulated by the law of the Federal Law No. 40.  According to him, in the absence of a driver‚Äôs policy, a traffic police officer has the right to fine him.  What does OSAGO cover in case of an accident? </p><div class="photo" data-original="chicagoinsuranceonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="according to total liability insurance" class="if uuid-2936223" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2936223.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Payment to victims in case of your fault.  This applies not only to material damage, but physical and moral. </li><li>  If your car is crashed, then you can legally be compensated even if the culprit does not have the means.  In this case, payments will come from the insurance company. </li><li>  In the event that both drivers are recognized as the cause of the accident and the wine is distributed between them, half of the damage will be compensated to them. </li></ul><p>  The maximum amount of compensation in the event of grievous harm to the property or health of a participant in an accident is 400 thousand rubles.  But what do OSAGO insurers think?  After all, it is far from always possible to get the amount of money needed to repair a damaged car.  When calculating the cost of compulsory motor liability insurance, such terms are used as the bonus-malus coefficient, power, length of service, etc. It is important to know them in order to determine in advance how much you will have to pay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Is it worth it to draw up a policy? </h2><p>  Although the insurance policy is compulsory, many drivers still prefer not to apply for it, saving on the cost of several thousand rubles.  Is car insurance necessary?  On the one hand, the penalty for the missing policy is only 250-500 rubles, so some people think that it turns out really more profitable.  Especially when you consider that for new drivers, insurance can be very expensive.  However, if you look at the statistics of accidents, it becomes clear that an accident can happen to anyone.  Even if you are an experienced driver with great experience, no one will insure you from a novice who can perform a careless maneuver.  And if this newcomer does not have a CTP policy, then you will most likely have to restore the car yourself.  Of course, there is also CASCO, which insures the car, regardless of the reason for the damage.  But the cost of voluntary insurance is much higher - on average, the CASCO price is from 4 to 12% of the cost of the car per year, which not every driver can afford.  The main advantage in favor of acquiring OSAGO still remains that a few thousand rubles spent on the policy will ultimately cost you much less than participating in lawsuits and subsequent compensation for damage to another driver. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.scottinsurance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to count forfeit" class="if uuid-2936224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2936224.jpg"></div><h2>  According to OSAGO </h2><p>  When calculating CTP, a number of increasing and <span>decreasing factors are used</span> that affect the final cost of the service.  What do OSAGO insurers think?  The price of the policy is added by multiplying all the coefficients: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The base rate set by the state. </li><li>  Coefficient of the region. </li><li>  Bonus Malus Ratio.  This is an individual indicator that depends on the history of your driving. </li><li>  PIC depends on age and driving experience.  The more driving experience, the higher the reduction factor. </li><li>  The COP determines the seasonality of car use.  As a rule, for people who use the car only in the summer, it is lower than for those who drive it all year round. </li><li>  The coefficient of an open policy increases the cost of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance if several drivers are entered in it. </li><li>  Power factor of the machine. </li><li>  Violation rate, which depends on the number of fines issued to you. </li></ul><h2>  Bonus Malus Ratio </h2><p>  Each driver who uses the services of an insurance company has a certain ‚Äúclass‚Äù.  Currently there are 15 classes that can both increase and lower the cost of insurance.  How to count KMB CTP?  To calculate, you need to know only two factors: driving experience and the amount of insurance payments that were made earlier.  For example, for a novice driver who has just got behind the wheel, KMB will be 2.45.  If the owner of the policy is 5 years old and at the same time he did not participate in any accident, then the coefficient will decrease to 0.9.  Thus, the more carefully you drive, the more profitable it is for you to buy an insurance policy.  However, if you suspend the CTP policy for 1 year or more, then all the coefficients will be reset.  If you do not know how CBM OSAGO is considered, then you can check its size on the website of the <span>Russian Union of Auto Insurers.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="nodepositautoinsurance.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="as damage is considered by OSAGO" class="if uuid-2936233" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2936233.jpg"></div><h2>  Base rate </h2><p>  One of the most basic coefficients for calculating the cost of a policy is considered a basic coefficient.  It directly affects how OSAGO is considered.  It does not depend on external factors and is determined by the legislation of the Russian Federation.  Changes in the base rate were recorded in 2014 and 2017.  After the latest price corrections, the base tariff for cars is 3432 rubles.  This is the minimum amount that you have to pay regardless of the power of your car, experience and the number of accidents.  For truck drivers, the rate is slightly higher - about 4 thousand rubles.  Compared to previous years, the base ratio has almost doubled, but there is an explanation for this.  After all, the payment corridor has also increased, so insurance companies need to set such a price so as not to work at a loss.  The rise in price of insurance policies in 2018 has already been noticed by most motorists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imoney.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="according to the uts of the car" class="if uuid-2936228" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2936228.jpg"></div><h2>  Experience </h2><p>  The next important criterion for determining the cost of the policy is the coefficient of age-seniority or FAC.  How to count seniority for compulsory motor liability insurance?  If the driver has not reached 22 years, and his experience does not exceed three years, then the PIC is set to the maximum.  Accordingly, with each subsequent year it decreases.  The most profitable is the purchase of OSAGO after 10 years of experience.  If the policy is open or several drivers enter it, the coefficient can significantly increase in price. </p><h2>  Territorial coefficient </h2><p>  The coefficient for the territory is set separately in each region and is regulated at the legislative level.  It may depend on the number of registered residents, traffic accidents and other factors.  In general, this parameter ranges from 0.6 to 2. The regional centers of Buryatia, Altai, Krasnoyarsk and Primorsky Territories are considered the lowest regions in terms of territorial coefficient.  The highest ratios are awarded to passenger cars in cities such as Murmansk, Nizhny Novgorod, Chelyabinsk, Moscow and Tyumen. </p><h2>  Car power </h2><p>  An important factor in the formation of the cost of OSAGO is considered the power of the car.  Naturally, the more horsepower in the engine, the higher the power factor.  The more power the machine has, the faster it can accelerate, respectively, and the risks increase significantly.  For the smallest cars with 50 to 100 horsepower under the hood, the KM is 0.9.  If from 100 to 150 hp, then the coefficient rises to 1.4.  For motors with a power of 150 horsepower and above, the power factor is 1.6.  It turns out that it is much more profitable to purchase low-powered cars that not only consume less fuel, but also allow you to save on the insurance policy. </p><h2>  Other odds </h2><p>  Other factors have a smaller impact on the final cost of the policy: coefficient of insurance period, coefficient of violations and seasonality of car operation.  For example, if you intend to use the car only for trips out of town in the summer, then you can take out insurance during this period.  There is no point in overpaying for the time at which you are not going to use your personal vehicle.  You can get seasonal insurance for up to three months.  If CTP is issued for this period, then <span>the seasonality coefficient</span> will be 0.5.  If for a longer period - then 1. </p><p>  The violation rate depends on the number of traffic rules that you violated.  This includes such serious violations as drunk driving and driving at a red light, as well as all speeding, hiding from the scene of the accident and other violations that were recorded.  In these cases, the SC can reach a value of 1.5. </p><p>  The insurance term coefficient applies only to non-residents of Russia who use cars on its territory.  If a person is in the territory of the Russian Federation for less than 15 days, then the coefficient will be 0.2.  If you stay more than 10 months, it increases to 1. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thestar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ak consider the uts of a car for cTP" class="if uuid-2936226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2936226.jpg"></div><h2>  Tariffs in 2018 </h2><p>  It is not necessary to know how OSAGO insurance is considered.  Many insurance companies have a service "CTP calculator", with which you can find out the cost of the policy in advance.  In addition, you can focus on average rates, which are approximately the same for all insurers. </p><ul><li>  The average cost of the policy is 5800 rubles. </li><li>  For beginners who recently got behind the wheel, the price of compulsory motor liability insurance will be 9-10 thousand rubles. </li><li>  For experienced drivers for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance they will have to pay only 3-4 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  On average, in the field of car insurance, sales and premiums are falling.  Premiums in this area decreased by almost 5%, which indicates the reluctance of drivers to pay the increased cost of policies.  But at the same time, it is worth considering the fact that the amount of compensation for damage has also increased, which provides customers of insurance companies with additional protection. </p><h2>  CTP payments </h2><p>  Many customers of insurance companies are worried, according to payments for compulsory motor liability insurance.  Everyone wants to have a guarantee that, having spent a decent amount on an insurance policy, they will not have to pay the damage caused in an accident on their own.  The amount of compensation depends on the following factors: </p><ul><li>  The behavior of the culprit of the accident.  If he disappears from the scene of an accident, then the probability is high that the company will refuse to fulfill its obligations. </li><li>  Make and year of the car, its power. </li><li>  Region. </li><li>  Depreciation of parts at the time of the accident. </li></ul><p>  How do you consider CTP?  To begin with, an employee of the insurance company assesses the damage caused and determines the amount of compensation.  In order for the company to reimburse all expenses for you, you need to adhere to the correct procedure during the accident.  If the damage is small, and none of the passengers was injured, then with the consent of the other party, you can issue Europrotocol without calling the traffic police.  If the situation is more serious, then you need to wait for the traffic police and arrange an accident with all the damage.  In no case should you leave the scene of the accident, as this threatens with the deprivation of rights and a large fine. </p><p>  The repair cost consists of the following factors: </p><ul><li>  The cost of damaged parts, taking into account their wear and tear; </li><li>  Consumption of materials; </li><li>  Repair work. </li></ul><p>  Often, companies try to underestimate payments and compensate only for the low cost of the damage actually caused.  In this case, you can take the following actions: </p><ul><li>  Contact an independent appraiser; </li><li>  Check the car for hidden damage; </li><li>  See in the PCA reference whether the prices for spare parts of the machine are taken into account correctly. </li></ul><p>  In addition, you can refer to the experience of other drivers who compensated for similar damage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zooaction.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="as damage is considered by OSAGO" class="if uuid-2936225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2936225.jpg"></div><h2>  The loss of the commodity value of the machine </h2><p>  When calculating payments under the insurance policy, one of the main criteria is TCB.  What it is?  <span>The loss of the commodity value of a</span> car is a decrease in its price after repair work as a result of an accident.  As a rule, such cars are on the market much cheaper than similar ones, but not in an accident.  The injured can demand from the insurance company the culprit not only to repair the damaged car, but also to compensate for this difference in price.  According to TCB car insurance?  The calculation can be carried out by various methods. </p><ul><li>  The guidance document method is considered the most accurate.  The calculation formula is the sum of the total loss of the commodity value, the cost of repairing the body frame, removable fragments, staining, as well as replacing individual fragments for the symmetry of the car. </li></ul><p>  If the car is older than 5 years, then the TCB does not compensate, since the car by this time loses an average of 40% of its original cost. </p><p>  Unfortunately, very serious accidents often happen that do not allow to restore the car.  In this case, the cost of repair is often equal to or exceeds the cost of the car, so the company must reimburse its owner.  What do ‚Äútotal‚Äù in OSAGO consider?  The market value of the car at the time of the accident is determined.  As a rule, an expert is involved for this, who calculates the amount based on the following factors: </p><ul><li>  Vehicle age; </li><li>  The presence of an accident; </li><li>  Mark; </li><li>  Initial cost. </li></ul><p>  Often, insurance companies try to underestimate the cost of a car by any means, so victims often have to turn to third-party appraisers and even tie legal proceedings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ambassadorins.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="as OSAGO insurance" class="if uuid-2936230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2936230.jpg"></div><h2>  Forfeit </h2><p>  <span>The CMTPL penalty</span> may be recovered from the insurance company if it does not pay the victim the statutory funds required by law within 20 days from the date of the decision.  But not all people know about this, so many companies continue to break the law and delay payments.  How to consider a penalty for compulsory motor third party liability insurance?  The Supreme Court of the Russian Federation clearly determined the amount of the penalty: </p><ul><li>  Violation of the terms of restoration repair is punishable by a penalty of 1% of the insurance payment, which was determined. </li><li>  If the company does not comply with the deadlines for the payment of monetary compensation, then this also implies a penalty of 1%. </li></ul>
