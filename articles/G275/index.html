The price is usually not too high.  But there are factors that influence the price tag.  It‚Äôs hard to say the exact cost.  The question is individual. </p><p>  Nevertheless, factors of influence on this indicator should be highlighted.  It: </p><ul><li>  region of the transaction; </li><li>  location of the garage building; </li><li>  garage condition; </li><li>  size of the building. </li></ul><p>  That is why in different cities there are a variety of price tags for similar properties.  How to accurately evaluate the garage?  The price can be determined by inviting special workers - real estate appraisers.  It is worth paying attention - if the seller turns to a real estate agency, then they make a certain margin on the established price tag.  Accordingly, the value of the property in the ad will be increased.  And this must be taken into account. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="garage price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1455238.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Nevertheless, as practice shows, rarely there are garages worth more than 1,000,000 rubles.  Most often, the price tag varies between 100-500 thousand.  It is recommended to focus on such indicators. </p><h2>  Documents for an independent transaction </h2><p>  How to sell a garage?  We‚Äôll have to not only make an announcement, but also collect a certain list of documents.  To begin with, it is worth considering the situation in which the building is located on the land allocated for individual housing construction.  This is a fairly common situation. </p><p>  Suppose a garage purchase does not take place through a real estate agency.  Then the seller must provide the buyer with: </p><ul><li>  your identity card; </li><li>  documents permitting the construction of a garage; </li><li>  cadastral passport of the property; </li><li>  certificate of ownership of the land and construction; </li><li>  certificates and statements indicating the presence of other owners; </li><li>  permission to deal from other owners; </li><li>  certificate of absence of encumbrances; </li><li>  Payments indicating payment of the state fee for the transaction; </li><li>  contract of sale. </li></ul><p>  Usually this list is enough.  Further, the buyer will get acquainted with the previously listed securities.  The parties come to a notary public, sign a contract of sale.  The buyer transfers the money to the former owner of the property, he issues a receipt on receipt of funds.  A notary certifies the deal - that's all.  No problem.  Now it‚Äôs clear how to sell the garage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="garage purchase" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1455227.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  For a cooperative </h2><p>  The following situation is an independent conclusion of the transaction, but only if the garage building is located in the cooperative community.  Documents may vary.  The thing is that the presence of real estate plays a huge role.  Today, there are two situations: when there are garages registered in the GSK and when there are none. </p><p>  How to sell a garage in a cooperative?  In order not to have unnecessary problems, a citizen must first obtain ownership of the property.  Only then can a deal be made.  To get a garage building in GSK ownership, you need: </p><ul><li>  identification; </li><li>  certificate indicating the full payment of the share; </li><li>  real estate passport (cadastral); </li><li>  receipt of payment of state registration fee. </li></ul><p>  In addition to these and previously listed securities, the seller applies a certificate indicating membership in the cooperative.  Only in this way is it possible to buy a garage without any problems.  Or rather, the sale. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sell a garage in a cooperative" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1455228.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Without property </h2><p>  It happens that GSK is completely new, and there is not a single garage registered in it yet.  This is not a hindrance to the deal!  Then you need to additionally bring to the Rosreestr the following documents for the garage: </p><ul><li>  all previously listed extracts and documents; </li><li>  cooperative charter; </li><li>  certificate of tax registration of the community; </li><li>  extract from the register; </li><li>  documents that confirm the allocation of specific land for garages; </li><li>  permission for the construction of these properties; </li><li>  Acts on constructed and commissioned garages. </li></ul><p>  As practice shows, it is in such cases that sellers are in no hurry to conclude deals.  After all, buying a garage will be difficult.  Neither the buyer nor the seller needs this. </p><h2>  About the contract </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what documents for the garage are required for the transaction in one case or another.  This information is useful to both buyers and sellers.  It is worth paying a little attention to the contract that is concluded between the parties. </p><p>  It is drawn up and signed in duplicate.  If the transaction is accompanied by a real estate agency, then they may require three.  The text should describe in detail the object of the transaction, as well as indicate the exact cost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="garage documents" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1455231.jpg"></div>

Now it‚Äôs clear how to sell a garage without problems and in the shortest possible time. </p>
