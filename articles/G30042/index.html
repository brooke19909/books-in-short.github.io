    <p>  At the local pass there is a unique architectural monument, the Baydar Gate, whose history is quite interesting.  It was created in 1848.  The project was created by architect Karl Ashleyman.  The kaydar gate was erected, timed to the opening date just at the end of construction work on the road from Yalta to Sevastopol.  And the result truly anticipated all expectations. </p><h2>  Structure </h2><p>  Over time, this point has become one of those attractions with which Yalta attracts tourists. </p><p>  Kaydar gates look like a large portico, the components of which are blocks.  The main building material for them was chosen limestone, which is very common in this area. </p><p>  The cornice of the gate is complex in structure.  On both sides, the portico is surrounded by rectangular cabinets built from the same material.  By the way, thanks to them, the example of the classical type of structure acquired monumentality.  The cabinet on the right has a space of 30 square meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can admire the surrounding landscape from two viewing platforms, climbing them to the top of the propylaea - you will pass through a magnificent <span>flight of stairs.</span>  The view that the Baidar Gate provides its visitors is beautiful.  The church and the village of Foros, as well as the local valley will be at a glance, capturing the imagination with its beauty.  This is a grandiose panorama - in few places you can get in touch with such magnificence. </p>

    <h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  In the period until 1917, with subsequent resumption in the 1920-1930s, two rather inferior hotels worked here.  The first was on the left side of the gate, and the second was directly behind them.  Nearby it was possible to find a post station, where in a special room, travelers could be accommodated for some time.  Now the need for an overnight stay at this place has disappeared, and there are no more hotels. </p><p>  On the other hand, the Baidar Gate near you has the popular restaurant complex ‚ÄúShalash‚Äù, where you can have a tasty meal after you sweeten your aesthetic and cognitive needs. </p><h2>  Road </h2><p>  You can get to the Baidar Gate pass if you follow between the mountains of Celebi and Chhu-Bair, whose height is 647 and 705 meters in the eastern part, respectively.  The point itself has a height of 503 m, if you count from sea level. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Observation platforms open a beautiful landscape to the eyes of tourists.  In ancient times, wanderers often made stops at the local hotels, since the path at that time was quite long, and for those traveling to Yalta the Baidar Gate was the resting place. </p><p>  How to get from Sevastopol to the famous pass, and now many know.  From the route leading to Yalta, you need to proceed to the Vorontsov highway from the church building of Christ Sunday.  Then it remains only to rise. </p><p>  When you make this journey, you will definitely want to eat some local pasties from the famous ‚ÄúHut‚Äù.  In summer, you can buy souvenirs here.  You are waiting for wooden crafts and stone work, sets of essential oils, interesting literature, beautiful postcards and much more. </p><h2>  Stunning beauty </h2><p>  This place can be considered a precious pearl of the Crimean mountains, despite the fact that this point is not so high.  However, this cannot be called the most important criterion for assessing attractions.  What is more important is the <span>aesthetic pleasure</span> that you get when you climb the pass. </p><p>  Many people come to look at the gates themselves.  On paper, this item was never recognized as an architectural monument, however, having been here, it is difficult to agree with this.  After all, everything seen here is deeply admired. </p><p>  The most important highlight can be called a layout that allows indescribable sensation to capture the souls of those who come here to relax on the observation deck. </p>

    <p>  Standing next to the fence, you can feel as if the earth is leaving under your feet, and you are floating in the air, looking to the sides.  All this is due to the <span>height above sea level, the</span> wind, as well as the stunning landscapes of the Crimea. </p><h2>  Strategic importance </h2><p>  Previously, these gates were closed when the earth was shrouded in darkness or bad weather.  Also in the 19th century, robbery, which was made by lovers of easy money on the roads, was quite commonplace.  Few wanted to meet them, so such a barrier was very helpful. </p><p>  This item was also strategically important during the Second World War.  In the fall of 1941, a detachment of <span>border troops</span> commanded by Terletsky kept fascist soldiers here for 24 hours.  Thus, the forces of the Red Army were able to withdraw to Sevastopol.  And those border guards who survived joined the partisan detachment, however, the command fell into Nazi captivity and was shot. </p>

    <p>  Terletsky was an outstanding warrior, in whose honor the monument was erected in the village of Foros.  The German invaders matured a plan for blowing up the gates.  Fortunately, for some reason, it never got to the point. </p><p>  Now the local attractions can enrich the minds of visitors in cultural and historical terms.  A lot has happened here.  Once here, you can feel like part of the tsarist time with its beautiful palaces and picturesque estates. </p>
