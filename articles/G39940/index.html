Judging by the reviews of travelers, a trip to Greece is something special, memorable for many years.  Relaxing in this sunny country, you get a unique opportunity not only to have a wonderful time on well-groomed beaches, but also to touch the ancient history of the country. </p><p>  Greece is located in southern Europe, on the Balkan Peninsula.  It consists of more than two thousand islands, which are washed by five seas: the Mediterranean, Ionian, Cretan, Libyan, Aegean.  The best resorts of the country are located on the largest islands: Corfu, Rhodes, Crete, Kos, Halkidiki, Peloponnese, Samos, Chios, Mykonos. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="36.4340533" data-lng="28.2176379" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/2/6/1/17261.png"></div><p>  Today we will talk about the best resorts of Rhodes, as this island is one of the most visited and popular among Russians.  If you have already been here, we will be interested to know your opinion about the rest, which you can leave in the comments to the article.  It is possible that you will give a couple of practical advice to novice travelers. </p><h2>  Rhodes Resorts: Description and Comparison </h2><p>  The southernmost island of the country, which is located next to Turkey, is shrouded in myths and legends.  They say that Helios, the god of the Sun, once lived here.  In addition, the island is the seventh wonder of the world - a statue of the Colossus of Rhodes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Rhodes is famous for its mild Mediterranean climate, a huge number of sunny days and numerous forests: cypress, coniferous, citrus and plane trees.  Two seas wash it: the Mediterranean in the east and the Aegean in the west, mountains rise in the center of the island. </p><p>  Rhodes resorts in Greece, despite the fact that the island is quite modest in size, are very popular among tourists from Europe.  They are attracted by the long beach season, which lasts from April to October, freshness in the hot summer, light sea coolness and comfortable conditions for swimming and sunbathing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.greece.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Which Rhodes resort to choose?" class="if uuid-3212362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3212362.jpg"></div><p>  Holidays in the resorts of Rhodes are suitable for fun youth companies and couples with children.  Even people of advanced age who prefer to combine sea baths with wellness treatments in the spa sources of the island will feel comfortable on the island. </p><p>  Fans of antiquity will certainly be interested in the ancient capital of the island.  The city of Rhodes remembers the Knights Hospitallers and the ancient Romans.  Once in antiquity, it was protected by the Colossus of Rhodes, later fortifications of the city, which were over 14.5 km long, and the wise rule of the Grand Masters, who led the island from a magnificent palace that has survived, were saved from enemy raids. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Which <span>resort of the island of</span> Rhodes to choose?  Keep in mind that from the east the island is washed by the Mediterranean Sea.  The resorts located here are dominated by sand-pebble and sandy beaches.  In these resorts it is quite hot, the sea is calm and quiet, there are practically no winds, since the mountain hills reliably protect the beaches. </p><p>  On the west coast, washed by the Aegean Sea, in comparison with the resorts of Rhodes in the east, the beaches are a bit windy, the dry northern meltemi often blow here, the sea is restless.  In the west, the beaches are pebble and more deserted than in the east.  In addition, on the west coast, the resorts of the island of Rhodes are little known to Europeans, so we think that it will be interesting for you to learn about them. </p><h2>  Resorts on the west coast of the island </h2><p>  As we have said, they are not yet sufficiently developed by tourists from Europe.  The places here are quite wild and underpopulated.  In just a few coastal villages, tourist infrastructure has been created, a high level of service has been organized, and excellent conditions for recreation are provided.  The rest are just developing - their finest hour is yet to come. </p><h2>  Cremasty </h2><p>  The small resort town of Kremasti is located 12 km from the capital of the island of Rhodes.  Tourists come here who prefer to relax on a pebble beach, which is a long coastal strip of pebbles and sand, which stretches along the entire length of the town.  In the center of the city is the central square, on which there was a place for countless shops and several taverns.  One of the main attractions of the resort town is the Valley of the Butterflies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Pastida </h2><p>  A small quiet Greek village whose whole life revolves around several taverns surrounding a quaint central square.  There are practically no cars in the narrow streets, everything here is intended for pedestrian tourists and the local population - a leisurely flow of life, fragrant citrus and olive groves.  Locals and few tourists relax on the beach Kremasti. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pastida in Rhodes" class="if uuid-3212370" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3212370.jpg"></div><h2>  Ialyssos </h2><p>  Charming little beach resort of Rhodes on the west coast.  The windows and balconies of comfortable hotels overlook the promenade.  In the evenings, Greek taverns filled with mouth-watering aromas await tourists in the center of the town.  It offers gourmet Mediterranean cuisine. </p><h2>  Ixia </h2><p>  A very picturesque beach resort of Rhodes in Greece, created relatively recently.  The tourist infrastructure is beautifully arranged along the coastline of the Aegean Sea, which forms the Ixia Bay.  Magnificent multi-story hotels and restaurants, in which tourists admire the quality of the offered dishes and services, rise along the promenade of the town. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.justgreece.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Ixia" class="if uuid-3212376" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3212376.jpg"></div><p>  Ixia is the recognized maritime center of Rhodes, where surfers love to relax.  For water sailing, a pebble beach is superbly equipped. </p><h2>  Rhodes Resorts on the Mediterranean Sea (East Coast) </h2><p>  These are small coastal villages in which entertainment and tourist infrastructure is well developed.  The most popular of them is the capital of Rhodes - the city of the same name, followed by the noisy and cheerful resort of Rhodes Faliraki, the delightful antique Lindos, ideal for families with children Kolymbia and the beaches of Tsambika.  To improve your health, we recommend that you go to the Mediterranean Kallithea.  Those who want to enjoy an unhurried and secluded vacation should go to the beaches located in the south of the island. </p><h2>  Rhodes city </h2><p>  At the northern tip of the island is its capital.  The city is both a resort and a center of historical heritage.  It is divided into two parts - the perfectly preserved Old Town and New, in which the influence of European civilization is felt.  There is everything for relaxation: luxurious restaurants, designer boutiques, traditional Greek taverns and modern bars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.elounda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rhodes city" class="if uuid-3212366" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3212366.jpg"></div><h2>  Kallithea </h2><p>  The beach area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis city is often visited by photographers from Europe to capture the stunning beauty of this place.  Many tourists believe that here is the best sandy beach.  The resort of Rhodes is famous for its wellness Italian spas and baths, where both locals and foreigners like to visit. </p><p>  The town is located in the sea bay.  Numerous underwater sports enthusiasts from around the world seek to get here.  In Kallithea, it‚Äôs quite calm, it‚Äôs quiet and comfortable here - on the beach, in bars, and in taverns.  The resort is located between the cheerful Faliraki and the island's capital. </p><h2>  Faliraki </h2><p>  If you prefer a vacation in the resorts of Rhodes on the Mediterranean Sea and love a fun nightlife, then you will find Faliraki.  Perhaps this is the most active and advanced beach resort of the island: there are many discos, bars, nightclubs.  It is interesting that families with children buy tours to the resort of Faliraki on the island of Rhodes.  What to see here?  Near the town, the largest water park is always happy for guests, and the beaches located on the coast are among the best on the island - they are ideal for bathing children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mitsishotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Faliraki" class="if uuid-3212383" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3212383.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to have fun and spend nights in peace and quiet - book a hotel located north of the center of the town: it is calmer there than in other areas.  It seems to us that the undoubted advantage of Faliraki is its close proximity to most of the ancient sights of the island. </p><h2>  Lindos </h2><p>  Narrow, stone-paved streets, neat white houses, smiling and welcoming citizens, peacefully walking donkeys - such an atmosphere awaits you in the resort of Lindos on the island of Rhodes.  All architectural structures of the town are protected by the state, so your comfortable stay is nothing and nobody will disturb. </p><p>  However, at night the situation in the town changes - taverns and bars, restaurants and cafes open, a bright and noisy resort life bursts into the seaside quiet night.  When planning your vacation in this resort of Rhodes, do not forget to visit the ancient Acropolis and see the majestic columns of the recently restored Temple of Athena. </p><p>  Close to the well-kept beach of Lindos there is another natural attraction - St. Paul's Bay.  Judging by the legends, an apostle once visited this region.  The chapel built in his honor bears the name of the saint. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelmagazine.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lindos in Greece" class="if uuid-3212364" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3212364.jpg"></div><p>  Experienced travelers advise travelers traveling for the first time to Lindos to purchase ceramics as souvenirs.  She is amazing, one of the best on the island. </p><p>  In the vicinity of the resort is an interesting natural attraction - the Valley of the seven sources.  Here, according to legend, everyone who seeks to be cleansed of sins in the spring of life-giving water comes here. </p><p>  South of Lindos - from Plymiri to Lardos Bay - the best beaches of the island.  They are very clean, quiet and picturesque.  A little further, in the south, tourists will find the wonderful resorts of Plymiri and Lahanya, which invite lovers of a relaxing holiday on the quiet sandy beaches. </p><p>  Each hotel is allocated a large territory.  They are located a little apart, but the tourist infrastructure is able to satisfy the most demanding travelers. </p><h2>  Afandou </h2><p>  We continue to acquaint you with the best resorts of Rhodes.  Afandou village is conveniently located on the northeast coast of the island - this is one of the largest village villages on the island.  Its courtyards and streets are amazed by the number of olive and citrus trees, which emit a stunning aroma during flowering.  In Afandou is the longest beach on the island of Rhodes, stretching for about seven kilometers along the coast.  The territory is covered with pure golden sand, smoothly turning into a pebble layer, and then again returning to sandy gilding.  Tourists not only consider this beach an ideal place for sunbathing, but also appreciate it for a wonderful island golf club. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelpassionate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Afandou Resort" class="if uuid-3212389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3212389.jpg"></div><h2>  Kalatos </h2><p>  An elegant Greek village located in the eastern part of the island is famous for its huge beach, which is never crowded.  Rest here is preferred by those who want to get to know the island better.  It is an ideal place to explore its main attractions and history.  Six kilometers away is Lindos and its archaeological sites, and the village itself has a wonderful atmosphere for relaxation. </p><h2>  Kolymbia </h2><p>  One of the best resorts in Rhodes.  Although we called the best of many parts of the island, most tourists think so.  The coast of Kolymbia lies between ancient Lindos and the vibrant Faliraki.  For a long time the resort remained little known.  Probably, thanks to this, even now the beaches of the resort, even in the high season, are not crowded and incredibly clean. </p><p>  Kolymbia beach is awarded the Blue Flag, which indicates the environmental friendliness of this section of the island.  A little further from the sea is the main street of the town - the famous Eucalyptus Road, where you can sit in a cafe after sunset, have a refreshing drink in one of the restaurants or bars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vacation-in-greece.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Kolimbia" class="if uuid-3212395" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3212395.jpg"></div><h2>  Pefkos </h2><p>  A quiet village is located five kilometers from Lindos.  It is surrounded by fragrant pine groves.  At this resort come connoisseurs of a relaxing holiday, tired of the noise of the city.  Travelers prone to depression and stress, or longing for peace, the azure waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the sandy beach will give everything you need.  The pine trees that surrounded the resort gave it a name. </p><p>  It used to be a tiny fishing village, but recently everything has changed.  Cozy restaurants and bars, the color of narrow streets, fresh, air saturated with needles and warmed by the sun - this is how Pefkos greets vacationers. </p><h2>  Kiotari </h2><p>  Couples with children should visit the new resort located near South Rhodes.  So that you decide, we will provide undeniable arguments: </p><ul><li>  the resort was created specifically for the family segment of tourists; </li><li>  here you can engage in various water sports; </li><li>  in the evening, vacationers are waiting for coastal restaurants and bars, interesting places for walking along the cozy promenade; </li><li>  almost all resort hotels are concentrated near the sea on the coastline. </li></ul><h2>  Gennadi </h2><p>  A small fishing village in the south of the island is nestled along the east coast of Rhodes.  The resort is not as popular as the neighboring Pefkos and Lindos.  True, thanks to this, Gennadi retained her charm of a colorful Greek village - narrow, stone-paved streets and ancient taverns are adjacent to modern European-style houses.  How do you find such a combination? </p><p>  The beach of the village is covered with small smooth pebbles, it is slightly removed from the village, but this is even more attractive. </p><h2>  Tsambika </h2><p>  Speaking about the best resorts in Rhodes, one can not help but mention this, if only because it is not only an amazing place for a beach holiday.  Near the beach of Tsambika there is an ancient monastery, which gave the name to this place.  In the days of religious holidays held in honor of the Virgin, women come from all over the country to the monastery, passionately dreaming to experience the joy of motherhood. </p><p>  Pilgrims make the ascent to the monastery on the mountain, overcoming 300 rather steep steps to pray in front of the miraculous icon stored in the monastery and ask the Mother of God for the joy of motherhood.  Judging by the reviews, after the pilgrimage, many manage to experience great joy - the birth of a baby. </p><h2>  Lardos </h2><p>  The resort in the southeast of the island is visited by tourists who want to enjoy the local flavor - breathe the aroma of cypress trees warmed up in the sun, walk along the old square, listen to the murmur of an Italian fountain, and make a prayer in the Orthodox Church. </p><p>  At lunchtime, the bars and taverns offer gourmet Mediterranean cuisine.  We recommend spending free time exploring the monastery and the ruins of an ancient Byzantine castle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rhodos.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lardos in Rhodes" class="if uuid-3212411" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/3212411.jpg"></div><h2>  Prasonisi </h2><p>  The name of this cape is translated as "Green Island".  It is located in the south of the island, 90 km from the capital.  Connoisseurs and fans of windsurfing come here from July to August, when the northern dry meltemi winds blow, which is very appreciated by professionals seriously involved in sailing.  On this cape you can see the unique natural attraction of the island.  Here the temperamental and stormy Aegean and warmed by the gentle sun, slightly relaxed, the Mediterranean Sea merge together. </p><p>  If you have not yet decided which Rhodes resort to choose, we suggest that you get acquainted with the reviews of tourists about holidays on this wonderful island. </p><h2>  Opinion of vacationers </h2><p>  All resorts of this wonderful Greek island are beautiful in their own way.  Experienced tourists recommend choosing a vacation destination to decide how you plan to spend your vacation.  If you want to combine a wonderful beach vacation with an informative excursion, you better go to the capital of the island, if you are interested in nightlife, then you can not find a better resort than Faliraki.  And with children it is better to relax in Kiotari or Kolymbia. </p>
