    <h2>  Themed outdoor shooting </h2><p>  Wide open spaces of fantasy open spring photo shoots on the street.  To get excellent shots, you will need to choose a suitable costume, decide on the location of the photo shoot and choose a shooting theme. </p><p>  The choice of clothing for shooting on the street is huge: for this, both unusual and original outfits, and ordinary casual clothes.  The photographer will help you choose the right props and decorations.  You can choose any image for photography, the main thing in this matter is fantasy and professionalism. </p><p>  There are several options for posing on the streets of the city: </p><ol><li>  Shooting near tree trunks. </li><li>  Photoshoot on the background of flowering shrubs or trees. </li><li>  Posing with a book on a bench. </li><li>  Shooting at the wall of the building. </li></ol><p>  These images reflect the sunny and light spring mood. </p><h2>  Focus on decoration </h2><p>  The scenery can be beautiful places of nature, interesting and unusual landscapes, for example: a large tree, a large green field, an old overgrown pond.  In such frames, where scenery plays the main role, the model fades into the background.  It can be located on the side or in the middle of the picture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spring photo shoot outdoors ideas" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/1873500.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  To convey the beauty of the chosen landscape, the <span>pose of the model</span> should convey the mood of the place itself.  An option that reflects the whole spectrum of feelings during the shooting: the model becomes half-face to the photographer, folds his hands on his chest with his palms to his neck, his eyes look down and are half-closed.  You can throw your head back so that your face is better visible. </p><h2>  Focus on the model </h2><p>  To focus on the model itself, it is better to choose portrait poses and full-length poses at close range.  Such a spring photo shoot is used to hide flaws and emphasize their unique features. </p>

Or a pose in profile to the photographer: throw one hand behind your head and put the other on your knee.

    <p>  For portrait shooting, you do not need to look directly into the lens, it is better to lean your head slightly back or turn it to the side.  You can also tilt your head forward, put it on your knees, lean it with your forehead or cheek against a tree.  In addition, shooting from behind is very effective.  In this case, the model can turn to the photographer in the waist or neck.  In this case, it is better to look into the distance so that it seems more mysterious. </p>
