Because it is not only the heart of Russia, the soul of the great and largest country in the world, but also one of the most beautiful complexes in the world. </p><h2>  The oldest settlements </h2><p>  Excavations showed that settlements on the territory of the Kremlin existed 5,000 years ago, and in the VI century AD, Slavic tribes lived here.  In the center of Moscow itself, the remains of a settlement belonging to the Dyakovo culture were found. </p>

In ancient times, for reasons of convenience and safety, the hills on the river bank were the first to settle in the district.  It is advisable at the mouth that the water enclose the settlement from two sides.  The water artery served as a communication with neighbors and allowed for more intensive trade, and the hills were not so accessible to enemies and made it possible to view a large territory.

    <h2>  The birth of Moscow </h2><p>  And when the Moscow Kremlin was built, <span>Borovitsky hill,</span> surrounded on both sides by the Moskva River and the Neglinnaya flowing into it, as well as the settlement located on its top, turned into an impregnable fortress.  The first mention of the Kremlin dates back to 1147.  Then there were not even walls erected in a tree.  They appeared only after 9 years - in 1156.  The heart of Moscow was first mentioned in connection with the invitation by Yuri Dolgoruky to the newly erected khromins of his ally Svyatoslav Olgovich, the Novgorod-Seversky prince.  The arrival of a future relative (their granddaughter and son - the famous Igor and Yaroslavna - will get married) at a feast and is considered the date of the <span>founding of Moscow.</span>  This is exactly the time when the Moscow Kremlin was built. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Great builder </h2>

Here, the inhabitants of these settlements found shelter during the invasion of enemies.  Gradually, the importance of this fortress increased, and the territory expanded.  And now, under the <span>son of Alexander Nevsky,</span> Prince Danil Alexandrovich (1261‚Äì1303), the ancestor of Moscow princes, the city that grew around the Kremlin becomes the capital of a small Moscow principality.

    <p>  At the time the Moscow Kremlin was built, Yuri Dolgoruky founded Pereyaslavl-Zalessky and Yuryev-Polsky.  This prince, who ruled the Rostov-Suzdal principality and died there all his life, was engaged in active urban planning.  In addition to the above cities, he founded Dubna, Kostroma, Dmitrov, the village of Senyatino, flooded during the construction of the <span>Uglich reservoir</span> , and, according to one legend, Gorodets.  In addition, he built many fortresses and fortified areas.  So when the Moscow Kremlin was built (year 1147), other strategic points were also laid.  And nothing said that it was from this fortress that the capital of the largest state in the world would grow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Future Capital Improvements </h2>

Prince Ivan Kalita (1283-1341) builds the first white-stone cathedrals.  And with him, in 1340, the old <span>wooden walls were</span> replaced by powerful oak.  And his grandson Dmitry Donskoy (1350-1389), the son of Moscow Prince Ivan II of Krasnoye, replaces the oak walls with white stone.  This was the reason to call Moscow "white stone".  It is such a beauty that is depicted in a painting by <span>Vasily Vereshchagin,</span> written in 1879, entitled "View of the Moscow Kremlin from the Stone Bridge".  The capital of Russia, a city with a terrific history, cannot but arouse increased interest.  Any major city in the country is loved and respected by its inhabitants.  But Moscow is much more for a Russian person.  And quite naturally, the desire to find out the details of the emergence of the city, with what it began, how and when the Moscow Kremlin was built, the year of its occurrence and under which prince this miracle was erected.

The Ipatiev Chronicle is considered the first reliable source mentioning the town of Moscow - the place of a great feast in honor of the meeting of friends and allies of the Rostov-Suzdal and Novgorod-Seversky princes.  To the question of what year the Moscow Kremlin was built, there are several answers.  You can specify a specific date in connection with which the Kremlin is mentioned for the first time - on the day ‚ÄúHeel for the Praise of the Virgin‚Äù, that is, on Saturday, April 4, 1147.  And you can talk for a long time about how the Kremlin was built over the centuries.  Can you imagine this complex without the Assumption Cathedral or the Grand <span>Kremlin Palace?</span>

    <h2>  The Kremlin was built and rebuilt </h2><p>  The answer to the question of which year the Moscow Kremlin was built will completely depend on what is meant by this name - a modern whopper, the residence of the President of the Russian Federation, or a small wooden structure from which it all began.  There is not enough page to simply list all the chambers, cathedrals, buildings, squares, gardens and monuments of this main socio-political and historical-artistic complex of Russia, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã27.5 hectares.  The territory of the Kremlin resembles an irregular triangle. </p><h2>  One of the pearls of the Kremlin </h2>

It was built in 1479.  The history of the beginning of its creation dates back to 1326. The Great Moscow Prince Ivan Kalita, together with St. Peter, laid the foundation for the first stone cathedral in Moscow this year.  The main altar city (namely, Moscow had such a status) was obliged to have the main church of Holy Russia.  It is St. Peter who plays a key role in the fact that Moscow becomes the throne.  Therefore, after death, the first Metropolitan of Moscow was buried in the still unfinished main cathedral of Russia.  His relics and the list of the icon ‚ÄúOur Lady of Peter‚Äù, the original of which was made by the apostle Peter himself, are one of the main shrines of Russia.  The cathedral was rebuilt.  This happened during the reign of the unifier of Russian lands under the rule of Moscow, Grand Duke Ivan III.  Under him, the Kremlin launched a large construction - all the buildings were rebuilt in stone.  And in this case, when answering the question about when the Moscow Kremlin was built, the year can be called completely different - 1485. For a decade (1485-1495) unique battlements were erected, which are the hallmark of the great complex.

    <h2>  A priceless treasure of world architecture </h2><p>  As noted above, Dmitry Donskoy rebuilt the original wooden detinet in stone (the Kremlin was also called in Russia).  Actually, he built a new stone "cremator", and the year the construction was completed, 1367, can rightfully be considered the date when the Moscow Kremlin was built.  Later, during the reign of Ivan the Terrible, who became the first Russian Tsar (he took the title in the Assumption Cathedral of the Kremlin), the complex itself was also intensively completed. </p>

However, the first Moscow Kremlin was built in 1147 by decree of Yuri Dolgoruky.  The fortified part of the city was also called ‚Äúchrome,‚Äù which is more suitable for a wooden tower surrounded by a wooden fence.  The one and only, legendary and impregnable, the Kremlin is the personification of the power and uniqueness of Russia.
