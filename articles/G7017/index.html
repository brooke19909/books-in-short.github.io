    <p>  By the way, even in a seasonal decline in the real estate market or during a crisis, you can sell your living space, because the buyer will be able to borrow money from a bank, rather than rely on his own strength.

    <p>  When preparing a property for sale, you will have to sweat both the buyer and the seller.  The bank will require a solid package of documents with data on the purchased apartment.  When deciding how to sell an apartment through a mortgage, you will first need to prove that it meets the stringent requirements and conditions of mortgage lending of this particular bank. </p><p>  When submitting documents for registration, as well as when submitting an application to the bank, the package should contain all the real estate papers.  The <span>bank</span> does not issue a loan for illiquid <span>assets</span> , and housing should be sold at a market price.  So to profit from square meters of indecent quality at an inflated price will not work for you. </p><p>  It is quite possible to sell an apartment on a mortgage of Sberbank, despite the opinion that it is the most picky lender in the country.  But he has every right to be so, as he offers the lowest cost of borrowed funds and ensures high reliability of transactions. </p>
