    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  The hotel was built in 1988, but the last restoration was carried out in 2007.  The Golden Port Salou SPA is located in the city of Salou, which is part of the province of Tarragona (Catalonia).  This is not a very big place.  The population is slightly less than 30 thousand people.  But there are many holidaymakers here.  After all, the city is located right on the Gold Coast!  So its main distinguishing feature is the endless stretching line of beaches, which is periodically replaced by bays and caves. </p><p>  To the sea here - within easy reach.  But the airport will have to go about an hour and a half, as it is in Barcelona (~ 100 kilometers distance). </p><p>  But not so far from the Golden Port Salou SPA there is the famous amusement park called ‚ÄúPort Aventura‚Äù, Cala de la Font bay, Aquopolis water park, etc. A bus stop, by the way, from where the routes depart for various directions, is a 5-minute walk from the hotel complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  2-seater standard </h2><p>  Golden Port Salou SPA 4 * Foundation (Spain) includes 345 rooms.  And the most budgetary of them are standards, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã15 square meters.  There are two options - either with one large bed for 2 people, or with two standard, separate. </p><p>  The air-conditioned apartment is cozy and comes with a plasma TV, a private bathroom with a hydromassage shower and a furnished balcony.  There is also an electric kettle with tea and coffee making facilities.  A hairdryer, safe and fridge are also provided. </p><p>  So, the price of a weekly stay with breakfast will be 32 tons for two people.  If you need half board, you will have to pay about 35 tons.  But living with breakfast, lunch and dinner will cost 45 tons.  Which, however, is also a small price. </p><p>  By the way, the same rates are set for absolutely similar apartments, but only in which you can still live with a child.  Such standards have an extra bed. </p><h2>  Other options </h2><p>  Golden Port Salou SPA 4 * <span>(Spain, Salou)</span> also has other apartments.  But all of them are practically identical in terms of facilities and the aforementioned standards. </p><p>  Take, for example, a triple room overlooking the pool.  It can accommodate three adult guests.  The price of a week stay is 46 tons.  with breakfast, 53 t.  with half board and 62 t.  with three meals a day.  By the way, to go on vacation three together is most profitable.  After all, then only 20 tons will leave a person  per week with accommodation and good nutrition.  By the way, if you take a simple room with a view of the surroundings, and not the pool, you will pay even less.  With full board, for example, about 55 tons will be released. </p><p>  However, the cost may be even lower.  Depends on the presence or absence of discounts, as well as on the season. </p>

    <h2>  Important information </h2><p>  Registration of guests at the hotel starts from 14:00, and departure - from 7:00 to 11:00.  The hotel allows children, but everyone here is considered to be under 11 years old.  If the child is older, then he is already registered as an adult guest.  But for two children under the age of 2 years, accommodation is free.  And for them, cradles will be installed in the apartments.  If they are necessary, it is best to inform the administration in advance so that they can prepare everything. </p><p>  During reservation, personal credit card details will be required.  The hotel accepts seven different options.  These are ‚ÄúVisa‚Äù, ‚ÄúMaster Card‚Äù, ‚ÄúAmerican Express‚Äù, ‚ÄúDiners Club‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlue Card‚Äù, ‚ÄúMaestro‚Äù and Euro 6000. </p><p>  It is important to know that cash payments at this accommodation facility should not exceed an amount of EUR 2,500 - this is established by law.  If you have to pay more for accommodation (for example, a person plans to stay there for a long time), then it is better to contact the administration directly about this.  By the way, a city tax is paid separately - 1 euro per night for each person over 17 years old (if the length of stay is less than 7 days). </p><h2>  Impressions of tourists </h2><p>  People who have been to Golden Port Salou SPA leave reviews rather detailed.  Many describe their vacation in detail, dwelling on any important nuances. </p><p>  Take, for example, the beach.  It is within walking distance.  It seems to some - far away.  But for those who do not want to spend 10 minutes each time going to the sea, it is better to book a room at a resort hotel located on the beach.  True, the prices there will be an order of magnitude higher - people who have something to compare with, confirm this fact. </p><p>  You should definitely visit the nearby water park and Port Aventura.  Moreover, it is in such a sequence as to double impressions.  And it's worth a trip to Barcelona.  At the reception, administrators will give a train schedule, and the station can be reached in half an hour. </p>

Tipping is not required here, so the service is of equal quality - both with and without staff encouragement. </p><p>  By the way, the hotel takes part in a program called Travellife Gold, which assesses the environmental impact of the hotel, as well as its cultural heritage and local economy. </p><p>  It is important to note that the hotel is especially popular among people taking children with them on holiday.  There are many of them, and most are very small.  Accordingly, on the territory of the hotel there is no perfect silence and peaceful atmosphere.  Unless in winter, when the number of visitors is less than in the holiday season. </p><p>  Many more note the extremely favorable location of the hotel.  It is in the immediate vicinity of numerous shops, boutiques, where at extremely low prices you can buy great shoes, clothes, jewelry and much more. </p><p>  In general, if we conclude, then we can say with confidence: if you want to get a lot of impressions from the rest, enjoy a beach pastime and pay a small amount for all this, then you should go to Golden Port Salou.  Surely you will not have to regret - this is confirmed by the reviews of grateful guests. </p>
