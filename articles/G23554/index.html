How to get to Kolomna from Moscow?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Very close to the capital is a city that has preserved the spirit of antiquity, provincialism.  It is strange to discover a river called Moscow.  In this small picturesque city, which once lay on the path of the Mongol invasions, there are a lot of temples and monasteries.  It's about Kolomna.  How to get from Moscow to this city is described in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="meros.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kolomna Kremlin" class="if uuid-2480080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2480080.jpg"></div><h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  The city is located in the southeast in the Moscow region, 113 km from the capital.  The population is about 150 thousand people.  How to get to Kolomna from Moscow?  There are several ways: by train, bus, car.  This city is located on the rivers Moscow, Oka and Kolomenka.  That is, you can make a cruise.  But this is far from a budget option. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.089036348288765" data-lng="39.20007517890622" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="7"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/4/1/1/3411.png"></div><h2>  Silent story </h2><p>  Kolomna, like many ancient Russian cities, burned more than once.  A great fire happened in 1293.  In ancient times, the city played the role of an outpost - it defended Moscow from enemy raids from the southeast.  The question of how to get from Kolomna to Moscow was not before Genghis Khan.  He had at his disposal only one type of transport - a zealous horse.  But only the Kolomna fortress was not easy to overcome.  By the way, it was Genghis Khan who burned the city in 1293. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When the Russian princes were sent to a far from diplomatic meeting with the Golden Horde warriors, they gathered in Kolomna.  How to get from Moscow to this city?  By taxi or own car.  Travel time (in the absence of traffic jams on the MKAD) is one and a half hours.  In the XIV century, Russian princes spent much more time on the road. </p><p>  The answer to the question of how to get from Moscow to Kolomna by train depends on the plan.  The city has many interesting sights.  There is something to see here.  If you plan to start a city tour with a visit to the Kremlin, you should go to Golutvin station.  In other cases, at the station Kolomna.  From Moscow it is sometimes faster to get by bus.  We list the main attractions of Kolomna. </p><h2>  Bobrenev Monastery </h2><p>  This architectural and historical monument is located opposite the Kremlin, on the other side of the Moscow River.  The monastery was founded in 1381 by Dmitry Donskoy.  The prince made a vow according to which he had to build it in case of victory over Mamai. </p><p>  The name of the monastery is associated with one of the participants in the significant battle, with a certain governor Dmitry Bobrok-Volynets.  This man took an active part in the construction.  The governor‚Äôs estate was not far ‚Äî four miles away.  In the 14th century, the monastery was surrounded by a strong wall, which became one of the links of the defensive line. </p><p>  In the XVIII century the monastery was in ruins.  In the XIX century, his situation improved due to donations from Khludov.  In 1929 the monastery was closed and used as a warehouse.  Recovery began in the early nineties. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="raven-yellow.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="reborn monastery" class="if uuid-2480087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2480087.jpg"></div><h2>  Kolomna Kremlin </h2><p>  After the devastating invasion of the Crimean Tatars, the inhabitants of the city began to build a fortress.  The process was led by Italian masters.  Construction began in 1525 and lasted six years.  Here in the middle of the XVII century traveler P. Aleppo visited.  In his opinion, the walls of the Kremlin were of "terrible height", and the towers were "surprisingly unshakable and strong."  To people in those days, this building really seemed huge.  However, the Kolomna Kremlin makes a strong impression on modern people. </p><h2>  Brusensky Monastery </h2><p>  The first building on its territory appeared under Ivan the Terrible - in the middle of the XVI century.  It was the Assumption Church, which the king ordered to erect in honor of the capture of Kazan.  The monastery reached its peak during the abbess of the Olympics - in the middle of the 19th century.  The Bolsheviks in the late twenties of the last century thoroughly looted the monastery.  Recovery began after the collapse of the USSR. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rv-mo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Kolomna" class="if uuid-2480094" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2480094.jpg"></div><h2>  Staro-Golutvin Monastery </h2><p>  This attraction is also associated with the Battle of Kulikovo.  According to legend, Dmitry Donskoy received a blessing for the construction of this monastery near St. Sergius of Radonezh.  Then the legendary hieromonk came to Kolomna on foot.  Sergius of Radonezh was accompanied by the monk Gregory - his student, who became the first rector of the Old-Golutvin monastery. </p><p>  Another legend is associated with this historical and architectural monument.  In Soviet times, a certain organization here on excavators was looking for underground passages.  But the old man in black suddenly appeared before the workers.  He so scared them that they rushed away from the monastery, leaving the equipment. </p><p>  Pyatnitsky Gates, Holy Trinity Monastery, towers of the architect Kazakov, St. Philaret‚Äôs Church, memorial park, Saucer Square - other Kolomna sights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yapet.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bus Moscow Kolomna" class="if uuid-2480097" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2480097.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get from Moscow </h2><p>  It is more convenient to go to the Moscow region by train.  From the Kazan station, trains go to Golutvin and Kolomna stations.  A ticket costs 250-300 rubles.  Travel time is two hours.  At the metro station Shchelkovskaya, buses regularly leave for Kolomna.  The fare is 250 rubles.  Travel time 1 hour 40 minutes.  But in the event that there are no traffic jams on the roads.
