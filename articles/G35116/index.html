    <p>  Beach holidays on Varadero are developed like nowhere else.  A huge number of island guests come there only to soak up the gentle sun and feel the gentle touch and rustle of coastal waves.  Each beach in this area is equipped with everything necessary: ​​sunbeds, deck chairs, parasols, locker rooms and other necessary devices for comfort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The color of the sea is extremely unusual and ranges from sky blue to emerald green.  It simply cannot but fascinate at first sight, forcing you to return to the beaches again and again. </p><h2>  Resort Orientation </h2><p>  The western part of the coast of Varadero is boiling with life.  There is a great variety of beach sport competitions, discos and other holidays.  This allows the territory of Varadero not to shut up for a minute. </p><p>  If we talk about the eastern half of the coast, there, on the contrary, life flows more measuredly and calmly, which is suitable for couples with young children and senior citizens. </p><p>  Fans of not just sunbathing and swimming in the sea, but outdoor activities will also find for themselves a way to have fun on Varadero.  In addition to the water sports presented, it is surprising, but the island has its own golf course.  Also, diving lessons with an experienced instructor are very popular among vacationers of any class, since the Caribbean underwater world is amazingly diverse. </p><p>  In addition to diving, the autumn months allow those who wish to conquer the waves at windsurfing lessons and ordinary surfing.  This is no longer popular with middle-aged vacationers, but among young people. </p><h2>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  The cultural industry of Cuba is primarily related to the Indians of the era of the colonies.  The most ancient Havana, for example, is filled not only with Native American architecture, but also with buildings made in pompous Spanish style. </p><p>  Havana is literally teeming with the mansions of influential Spanish masters, who are now turned into museums of the local culture.  And, of course, at almost every step within Havana, monuments are installed, which are a kind of symbolism of freedom and independence of this territory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many visitors to the island note that Varadero is one of the best places for both single and romantic (in pairs), and for family tourism.  Not only native Cubans come here to relax, but also representatives of other countries.  Russian citizens also with great pleasure fly there to relax and enjoy the natural beauty. </p><p>  The island is replete with a variety of clubs, bars, hotels and other entertainment facilities for every budget and taste.  As for the level of service in all the listed places of leisure, this indicator is on a par with Europe. </p><p>  The temperature values ​​of the island all year round do not fall below 30 degrees, however, staying in this place does not become painful, since the island is blown by the sea breeze from all sides.  That is why vacationers always visiting this place will be able to understand that life was not wasted.  Especially if you have at hand a glass of the famous Cuban-made rum.  You can get a particularly pleasant vacation experience if you opt for Gran Caribe Villa Tortuga 4 (Varadero). </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2>

    <p>  Hotel Gran Caribe Villa Tortuga really deserves positive reviews.  Tourists who are fortunate enough to relax at the hotel, note the following points: </p><ol><li>  Check in at the hotel, having previously examined the room.  For a small surcharge (about 40 euros) they can offer a chic room with a luxurious view.  Populate instantly.  It is better to choose rooms in the building, which is located near the ocean.  A breathtaking view from the window will definitely be provided. </li><li>  About the rooms.  The apartments are not large in size, but they are cozy and have everything you need: a huge bed that can even accommodate three people, a pair of nightstands, a chair, a table, a refrigerator (it doesn’t always work), a TV, air conditioning (you need to ask beforehand cleaned), sockets.  In the toilet room there is a bathroom, bath, washbasin and hairdryer. </li><li>  Room service.  Cleaning is carried out daily.  Tipping can be left after a day, although this is not necessary.  This does not affect the quality of service.  The staff shows imagination in everything, even in folding towels and rugs into various figures.  Dirty towels must be laid on the floor.  Of the toiletries there is only soap.  Everything else is better to bring with you.  Here, even in the bathroom comfort reigns.  There is a small window overlooking the back yard.  The rooms near the beach can be somewhat noisy, as people relax on the beach until late in the evening.  But after 20.00 there is silence and you can relax.  A safe is available for a fee. </li><li>  Pool.  The water in it is cold.  Almost no one bathes, as there is a warm ocean nearby. </li><li>  Beach.  The huge coastal zone is fully equipped with everything necessary.  There are plenty of sun loungers.  On the beach is allowed to be not only residents of the hotel.  Outsiders can use the sunbeds for a fee.  Locals are extremely sloppy.  After them, a huge amount of garbage remains on the beach and in the water.  Unfortunately, no one cleans the coastal zone. </li><li>  Entertainment.  On the beach you can play volleyball and other entertaining games.  There is also a bar.  In the evening, guests are entertained by dancing and even small concerts.  If you are in the evenings at the hotel, then you can even watch rehearsals and preparations. </li><li>  Gym.  There are practically no people here.  Everyone prefers to spend time on the beach or on excursions. </li><li>  Bars  There are several establishments.  The bar near the reception is open all the time, even at night.  Poolside coffee is available.  There is also another bar, open from 10.00, where you can have a delicious meal with sandwiches, pizza or hamburgers.  The restaurant on the beach is open from 10.00. </li><li>  Nutrition.  Breakfast at Gran Caribe Villa Tortuga 3 (Cuba, Varadero) is served with omelettes, pancakes, vegetables, fruits, various pastries, bread and breakfast cereals.  Eggs prepared in various ways are also often served.  From drinks - fresh juices, tea and coffee.  The hotel offers lunch and dinner.  The food is quite varied.  Garnish with potatoes, rice, spaghetti or pasta.  Large selection of meat dishes and seafood.  For dessert, ice cream and sweet pastries.  Sometimes the restaurant plays live music. </li><li>  The Internet.  There is enough speed to check mail, view news and chat in social networks.  To access the Internet, you must take an hourly payment card at the reception.  Computers do not support Russian.  Wi-Fi is not supported. </li><li>  Territory.  In addition to people, the hotel has many friendly animals.  The local gift shop is a bit overpriced.  Near the Gran Caribe Villa Tortuga 4 hotel (Cuba) there is a shop with various goodies, cigars and other goods necessary for a vacation.  There are also bus stops nearby.  For 5 Cook you can ride a panoramic double-decker bus all day.  With the same ticket, you can transfer to another bus, without paying anything.  On the right side of the complex is a 10-minute walk there is a cozy restaurant.  <span>Al Capone</span> once lived here <span>.</span>  To the left of the hotel almost immediately begins the city with many souvenir shops, markets and shops. </li></ol><h2>  General impression </h2>
