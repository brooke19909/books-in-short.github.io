The amusement park has a large number of attractions: carousels, roller coasters, Ferris wheel and much more.  ‚ÄúByzantium‚Äù is especially impressive in the evening, when it is lit by millions of lights.

The attractions of this place are interesting and unique.  Currently, in Russia, no other water park can boast of such entertainment that is available here.  The water park was built according to the Canadian project and began to work only in 2012.  Fans of extreme sports will surely like a slide, on which you can go down only in a special capsule.

    <p>  In the center of the village, not far from the central alley, there is a large platform for musical performances.  Here very often ensembles perform and rock festivals are held. </p><h2>  Healing procedures </h2><p>  Do not forget that Vityazevo is not just a seaside resort, but also a medical center with sanatoriums.  In this unique region there are healing springs that have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, biliary tract and gastrointestinal tract.  The doctor schedules the intake of water, as a rule, the treatment course is two to three weeks. </p><p>  In addition, mud volcanoes are of particular interest.  Homer also mentioned them in his Odyssey.  Not only are the volcanoes themselves - this is an unusual sight, but also the mud in them is healing.  They can treat many diseases: from infertility to skin ailments.  In Vityazevsky district, in the crater <span>of the Tizdar volcano,</span> up to two dozen people take mud baths at the same time. </p><h2>  Hotel Emerald (Anapa): reviews </h2><p>  Hotel Emerald is a new modern complex on the Black Sea coast.  According to guests, this is an acceptable place to stay.  The complex has nice rooms and good infrastructure.  The hotel has everything you need for a good rest. </p><p>  Rooms are cleaned daily; towels and bed linen are changed every three days.  The service staff is friendly, the settlement is quick, without a hitch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Emerald Hotel 3 Anapa Vityazevo" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1454186.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Conflicting reviews are expressed by hotel guests regarding food.  Not everyone is satisfied with them, complaining about the lack of diversity.  It is difficult to judge how fair such remarks are.  For breakfast, the hotel serves milk porridge, cottage cheese casserole, pancakes with meat and cottage cheese, scrambled eggs, sausages, sausages, cheeses, dumplings, dumplings.  At lunch, on the tables there are soups, chicken stock, side dishes, salads, meat, vegetables, stuffed peppers, compotes, pastries and some fruit.  Between lunch, breakfast and dinner, you can grab a bite to eat at the poolside bar.  It's simply impossible to stay hungry.  The restaurant is not allowed to drink alcohol.  According to vacationers, food is aimed at children, which is very convenient.  The all-inclusive system is fully justified. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the hotel does not have its own beach, so you have to go to the public.  But it is not fully equipped, and not very clean.  In addition, in the season on the coast a huge number of people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Emerald Anapa Description" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1454189.jpg" width="600"></div>
