    <p>  Have you ever wondered how many states are in the USA?  It seems to me that this is a logical and logical question for those who are fond of American culture, cinema or the English language. </p><p>  In my article, I will try to tell in detail not only about how many states are in the USA, but also explain why this is exactly what happened from a historical point of view.  In addition, readers will learn many new and interesting facts about an amazing and huge country called the <span>United States of America.</span> </p><p>  <strong>Number of states in the USA: 50 or 51?</strong> </p><p>  The United States is a huge state located in the central part of the continent of <span>North America.</span>  And today the country consists of 50 states, one federal district of Columbia, which is considered an independent federal unit and several island territories, also not belonging to any state. </p><p>  Each federal unit is divided into districts managed by city municipalities, and rural territories can, among other things, be divided into town-houses. </p><p>  <strong>Why do states in the USA sometimes have such strange names?</strong> </p><p>  Those who speak English probably know that the word "state" itself can be translated as "state", but at the same time as "state or country."  In 1648, when the United States was in the colonial period of the formation of the state, separate colonies were called mainly with this word.  And since 1776, after the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, the word "state" began to appear in the official name of 46 states (for example, Texas or Idaho).  Although it should be noted that the flag of, say, California, to this day, you can read the "Republic of California". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is believed that the basis for the origin of the names of the federal units of the state became eight major sources.  Let us dwell on each in more detail: </p><ul><li>  26 states have names of Indian origin, although most likely, "Idaho" was coined.  This conclusion was reached by modern linguistic scientists, since they still have not been able to find out its significance to this day; </li><li>  the name of the northernmost state (Alaska) came from the ancient <span>Eskimo language</span> ; </li><li>  the word "Hawaii" belongs to the language of the local population - Hawaiians; </li><li>  eleven states are of English descent, six are of Spanish and three are of French origin; </li><li>  Rhode Island State name taken from (allegedly) Dutch; </li><li>  and only Washington has purely American historical roots. </li></ul><p>  <strong>What is the likelihood of a 51st state?</strong> </p><p>  We seem to have received a fairly comprehensive answer to the question, how many states are in the USA, but why then from time to time we have to hear about some 51st?  What is this mythical federal unit and why is it called that way? </p><p>  The thing is that this is a kind of term that is commonly used to refer to territories claiming such a status (Guyana, Haiti, <span>Philippines, the Republic of</span> Rio Grande, Sonora, Yucatan).  In addition, the so-called countries in which the United States of America have a strong cultural, political or economic influence.  For example, Australia, Great Britain, Georgia, Israel, Iraq, Mexico and other countries. </p><p>  Also, the following proposals were repeatedly received by the US Government: </p><ul><li>  On the establishment of Lincoln State in eastern Washington and northern Idaho. </li><li>  On granting for purely economic reasons to New York the status of a separate state called New York City. </li><li>  On the allocation of parts of the <span>states of Oregon</span> and Idaho in a separate state of Eastern Oregon. </li><li>  About attempts to separate regions on the peninsula of Michigan to a separate state Superior.  Supporters came up with this proposal because  It is believed that the current government does not pay enough attention to the inhabitants of this area. </li><li>  About the hypothetical merger of several former and present Pacific territories of the United States and the creation of a unified federal unit of Pacific. </li></ul><p>  That is, based on the foregoing, the question of how many states in the United States remains open.  One thing can be said with full confidence - today there are 50 of them, but in the very near future the situation may well change. </p>
