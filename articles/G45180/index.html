But there are places on the Anatolian Riviera where you still need to know foreign languages.  A reward for this will be a club holiday.  What it is?  This is when you feel like a member of a privileged club - and such a feeling lasts from the first minute of your stay at the hotel until you leave this place.  In this article we will consider Club Nena 5 HV.  We built a review of the hotel solely on the reviews of those who have already visited there (especially in the summer of 2016).  This elite hotel has a narrow specialization - children's recreation.  For younger guests there is just paradise.  It will also be comfortable for their parents.  But the irrepressible youth, eager for drive and discos, it seems boring here.  But what a freedom to shopaholics!  Directly opposite the hotel is a huge shopping center.  Many tourists noted that it is very convenient: to take the child to a mini-club, where he will be entertained by animators, and go shopping and go to the traditional Turkish market.  But let's look at the characteristics of the Club Nena hotel point by point. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Nena 5 HV" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1435804.jpg" width="600"></div>

The nearest settlement claiming the title of the town is Manavgat, with a waterfall famous throughout the country.  It is located thirteen kilometers from the hotel.  And Kyzyladzhak is a small village on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  Look for historical sights in the former fishing village is not worth it.  It is better to immediately go to Side, which is fifteen kilometers from the hotel.  What distinguishes Kyzyladzhak is its picturesque nature.  Everywhere pomegranate and citrus orchards, coniferous forests, fields with cotton.  This place is chosen by families with young children and lovers of a quiet holiday surrounded by nature.  The distance from Antalya Airport, where most flights from Russia land, is quite significant - eighty kilometers.  If you have a shuttle service to the hotel, be prepared for the fact that you will be brought to Club Nena 5 HV last.  But all compatriots, most likely, will be unloaded on the road in hotels of other settlements.  There are very few Russians in Nena Club.  The Germans, the inhabitants of the Scandinavian countries, mainly rest here, there are few citizens of the former socialist camp.  If you must get to the hotel on your own, you should first take the shuttle bus to Side.  From this ancient city go dolmushi (minibuses) to Kyzyladzhak.  Travel time is about fifteen minutes.  Stop - near the shopping center, which is opposite the described hotel. </p><h2>  Resort specifics </h2><p>  Kyzyladzhak is chosen for the sake of the sea and beaches.  All of them are marked with a blue flag for the cleanliness of the coast and water area.  Club Nena 5 HV (Side) is a first-line hotel, which is important.  But in Kyzyladzhak there are steep places and pebbles.  But this hotel has an excellent beach, which we will describe in detail below.  The rest of the village is not much different from other Turkish resorts that grew out of former fishing villages.  There is a lot of entertainment - both on the territory of hotels and beyond.  There is also a mini water park in the Club Nena 5 HV hotel itself.  And on the beach line of the village you can ride horses or donkeys, go on a boat trip on a boat or yacht, ride on the "bananas" and other types of motor activities on the water.  But here you can‚Äôt call Kyzyladzhak ‚ÄúAlania in miniature‚Äù.  Disco bars, nightclubs and similar noisy establishments are simply not here.  But there is a typical Turkish bazaar where you can buy not only souvenirs, but also excellent textiles and products from it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Nena 5 HV Side" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1435812.jpg" width="600"></div>

Tours there are quite rare with Russian operators.  But in vain.  After all, there are excellent conditions for family vacations.  Since the hotel is suburban, it has a huge, one hundred thousand square meters, territory.  Landscape designers and gardeners did a great job - reviews say that the hotel buildings are simply buried in lush greenery and flowers.  Walking in such a territory with children is a pleasure.  There are males and hens everywhere, in the enclosures you can see dogs, pet cats and the like, cute and harmless animals.  The Club Nena 5 HV Hotel is one three-story building, which houses the reception and the main restaurant, and fifteen bungalows in Turkish architectural style.  Tourists recommend booking rooms in the latest buildings.  They are two-story, and are located so that you do not see and do not hear the neighbors.  It seems that you are an elite member of the club, and the entire infrastructure of the hotel is created exclusively for you.  The hotel was built at the end of the last century.  But do not be afraid that you will be settled in a dilapidated building with shabby furniture.  The last repair, according to reviews, was held last year.  The decor of the guest rooms shines with novelty, everything is working properly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Club Nena 5 HV" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1435813.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Room Categories </h2><p>  Hotel Club Nena 5 HV (Turkey, Side) places its guests in spacious and comfortable rooms.  Most of them (four hundred and twelve) are located in the bungalow, and only one hundred and seventy-eight are in the main building.  Seven rooms are fully adapted to the special needs of people with disabilities.  The simplest ‚ÄúStandards‚Äù are located in the main building.  Now it's time to decipher the full name of the hotel - Club Nena HV-1 5 *.  The abbreviation stands for "Wanted Village."  The number "1" means the first category.  This means that in the hotel complex tourists are accommodated both in the building and in the cottages.  But in the last two-story buildings, rest, as the reviews claim, is much more pleasant.  Moreover, some of them are almost on the beach.  The rooms in the bungalow are also a bit more spacious than in the building (thirty-two square meters versus twenty-eight).  The cottages also house the Family Rooms.  These family rooms consist of two bedrooms connected by a common door.  But, noteworthy, they all have one category - ‚Äústandard‚Äù.  The hotel has only one suite reserved for honeymooners. </p><h2>  What's in the rooms </h2><p>  What conditions in the rooms does Club Nena 5 HV hotel provide to its guests?  Description of the hotel by tourists usually begins with the praise of room decoration.  All the equipment is of a new design: split-system climate control, a TV with a plasma screen (at least a dozen Russian-language channels), an electronic safe.  True, this last convenience in the room was for a fee.  But wi-fi was in the public domain, pulled at a decent speed in the room and by the pool, in a word, throughout the territory.  Separate praises were given to beds.  Even an extra bed (in some double rooms it is possible to share a third tenant) was with an orthopedic mattress.  Five pillows to choose from, two additional warm blankets in the closet, new snow-white bedding.  It was changed three times a week, and towels - every day.  The decoration complements the wardrobe with hangers and shelves, bedside tables, chairs.  There is also a free minibar in the bedroom.  Every day it was replenished with three small bottles of sparkling water and a half liters of the dining room.  At the expense of bathrooms, reviews say that most of them have a shower behind a glass partition.  Upon arrival, guests are offered a complete set of hygiene products, with ear sticks and caps for the shower inclusive, but then every day they bring only soap, shampoos and shower gels.  Bathrooms also include a hairdryer and slippers.  The flooring in the rooms is tiled.  Reviews also mention that all rooms have spacious balconies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Nena 5 HV reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1435806.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  What kind of vacation in Turkey without "all inclusive"?  And, of course, in the Club Nena 5 * HV Side hotel this food program is implemented in its most ideal form.  The hotel‚Äôs website says that meals are scheduled.  However, this is not quite true.  There is an early breakfast that runs from two nights until six in the morning.  Then comes the time for the usual morning meal.  It is followed by a brunch for those who like to sleep long.  And so on: coffee breaks, ‚Äúnight soup‚Äù ... On the territory there is one main restaurant, in which all these endless meals are held in buffet style.  But there are also institutions where they serve √† la carte.  These are restaurants of Turkish, Italian and fish cuisine.  And besides them, nine bars serve guests.  In them you can not only refresh yourself with soft drinks or treat yourself to alcoholic cocktails, but also have a bite to eat.  Paid bar only on the platform at sea.  They serve imported alcohol.  In all other institutions - at the reception, by the pool, in the spa area, on the beach - drinks and snacks are freely available for all-inclusive owners.  Reviews notice that the newlyweds wear bracelets of a different color.  The staff constantly makes pleasant surprises and compliments from the hotel.  There is also a special children's restaurant.  For those who need diet food (diabetes, allergies), a special menu is available on request. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Club Nena 5 HV Photos" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1435808.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What nutrition reviews say </h2><p>  Even particularly picky tourists could not find a single minus at this point.  Vegetables and fruits are served from an organic farm owned by Club Nena 5 * HV.  Reviews say that even in the midst of the tourist season, when the hotel is one hundred percent full, there are no queues in the main restaurant (except for small ones for grilling - it‚Äôs very tasty to bake meat and trout).  A lot of vegetables - both fresh and fried, stewed, steamed.  Fans of the ‚Äúbreakfast in Russian‚Äù were pleasantly surprised to see a large selection of cereals on the tables, including semolina.  Reviews say that even in the main restaurant, seafood was served several times a week for dinner.  Also in the evening there are several types of ice cream.  Tourists showed special respect to the bars of the Club Nena 5 * HV hotel.  The reviews recalled the aromatic coffee and delicious Turkish cakes served at the Sultan, praised the pizza at the Green and Guzlem on the beach.  The sweet tooth was delighted with the cakes served at the bar near the reception.  At four o'clock in the morning, Belgian waffles begin to bake at Green; by the way, queues also line up behind them.  But standing in them, say reviews, is worth it.  Tourists liked all three a la carte restaurants. </p><h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  Hotel Club Nena 5 * HV advertises itself as a place of family relaxation.  And just paradise conditions were created for children here.  You can come here even with newborns: on request they will give you a bath for bathing the baby, playpen, put a crib.  You can rent a stroller.  The restaurant has a free blender to grind food for the kids.  There is also a children's restaurant.  Moms can warm their baby bottles there.  Dishes there are such that children usually like: meatballs, pancakes, chicken, curly pasta.  The food is very healthy - not overcooked, not oily.  Lots of fruits and desserts.  And most importantly - the form of presentation: the same "buffet" as in adults.  Only tables in the height of the child, so that the baby could normally see and choose dishes.  The plates are multi-colored, the cheerful design of the children's restaurant contributed to the appetite of the most capricious "sick".  The kids were delighted with the diverse living creatures in the cages - especially the talking parrot.  The administration conducts recreational activities for children.  Every night there are mini discos.  And even at the pools, Club Nena 5 * HV hotel takes care of its young guests.  Along with adult sun loungers, there are also children's ones.  There are also two playgrounds (on the beach and in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe mini-club).  They are under sunshades, and their floor is rubber so that children are not injured. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Nena 5 HV hotel Turkey" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1435810.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mini club </h2><p>  It would seem that this service is difficult to surprise the tourist who has seen the Turkish and Egyptian resorts.  But the Club Nena 5 * HV hotel was able to do this.  Photos of tourists very often do not represent the beach and not the green territory, namely the mini-club of the hotel.  And it is easy to understand.  The mini-club of this hotel is a real hotel for children who are already four years old, but have not yet turned twelve.  The building of the mini-club is two-story.  On the first level there is a games room.  Upstairs are small bedrooms.  There is also a mother and baby room with a changing table and the ability to warm up the bottle.  The children's hotel is adjacent to a separate fence: a playground with swings, a shallow pool with slides.  Parents were especially surprised by the restaurant for kids and ... the toilet.  Absolutely everything is done in miniature: toilet bowl, washbasin, mirror.  The administration of the Hotel Nena Club hotel ensures that the child does not feel inferior in the adult world.  Naturally, professional educators and animators are constantly with children.  They are patronized and entertained all day.  And, as the parents admitted, the children quickly overcame the language barrier (after all, the hotel has few Russians, and the animation is conducted in an amazing mixture of English, German and Turkish).  The kids attended the mini club with great joy.  There they will feed the child and put to bed, as in kindergarten. </p><h2>  Pools </h2><p>  A total of six.  Three are for adults.  The main pool is located by the restaurant and the sea.  Near the building next to the reception are four slides that descend into the tank with clean and fresh water.  Another pool has the eloquent name "relaxation".  The depth of all three water areas is shallow - one hundred and forty centimeters, so even adults who do not know how to swim will not drown there.  For children, the Club Nena 5 * HV hotel (Turkey) has equipped three more pools.  One of them is located next to the adult slides (for kids, their own are offered, not so steep and high).  The second pool is located at the mini-club.  And also the "frog zone" with a depth of only forty centimeters is available near the "Relax".  By the way, it is there that there are children's sun loungers.  Naturally, sun loungers and beach umbrellas on the terraces near the pools were given for free use to the guests of the Club Nena hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Nena 5 HV Turkey Sydn Kyzyladzhak" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1435805.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Hotel Club Nena 5 * HV reviews are called first-line hotel.  For the convenience of guests, a soft sand was brought on which there are sun loungers, deck chairs and sun umbrellas.  The sea here is very clear, turquoise.  Unrest is rare.  It‚Äôs not windy here.  Sunset at sea is very smooth, which is just perfect for kids who love to splash around in shallow water.  By the way, for her the administration of the Nena Club hotel has allocated a special place on the beach.  This is a real town with a playground, located at the very edge of the water.  Sun loungers near this area are reserved for those tourists who rest in a hotel with young children.  But, reviews say, there is enough space for everyone under the sun on the hotel's beach.  Pebbles are found, but small, and a little further from the coast.  Special beach shoes are not required. </p><h2>  Services at the hotel Club Nena 5 * HV (Turkey, Side) </h2><p>  This hotel has a mini water park.  For adults, four slides are offered here.  But Nena Club can also be called a spa hotel.  A visit to the Finnish sauna, Turkish hammam and fitness center is free for all guests.  Much attention is paid to sports at the hotel.  Animators for adults conduct water aerobics classes, offer guests to play beach volleyball, basketball, darts, futsal, table tennis.  There are also courts - you will have to pay only for their coverage in the evening.  Each guest is offered a complimentary drink upon arrival.  Every evening guests are entertained.  Discos, lotteries, sweepstakes, shows and concert programs are held.  Parking, bicycle rental, as well as Internet access are also free for guests.  Especially praise reviews for amazing discounts for children.  If the child is not yet twelve years old, he can stay for free in the existing bed.  Two Russian-speaking girls work at the round-the-clock reception. </p>
