Many tourist portals offer detailed reviews of the sights and life in different cities.  Of course, viewing colorful photos and videos will not replace live impressions.  Nevertheless, it is better to accumulate the necessary amount of funds for the trip and see with your own eyes unique architectural monuments and unusual <span>natural phenomena.</span> </p><p>  A trip to Elista will be interesting to those who are fond of Buddhism.  Most residents of the region are representatives of this particular religion, so in the city you can find incredible beauty of temples.  The first Buddhist temple - Syakyusn-Sume, the money for which the believers themselves raised - was opened relatively recently - in 1996. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Elista hotels" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/757701.jpg" width="550"></div>  In addition, ten years ago, the largest temple in Kalmykia, the Golden Shakyamuni Buddha Monastery, was consecrated.  The huge building houses not only two prayer halls, but also the residence of the Dalai Lama, a library, a conference room and the largest Buddha statue in Europe.

    <h2>  New story </h2><p>  It is interesting that in Elista there are practically no ancient monuments or fortresses.  The history of the city originates in 1845 - then <span>Nicholas I</span> decided to diversify the Kalmyk steppes with forests.  A settlement was organized for the workers, which began to grow slowly.  By 1907, a hospital, a boarding school and a local government building were built in Elista, and a telegraph was summed up five years later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During the Patriotic War, the Kalmyk city was occupied by the Germans, and during their retreat almost completely burned.  The restoration of Elista began only in 1957, and the main construction of cultural centers, monuments and temples took place in the early 1990s. </p><h2>  City Chess </h2><p>  One of the most famous objects of Elista is considered City Chess.  In 1998, a unique complex was designed and built specifically for the Chess Olympiad. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="white lotus elista hotel" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/761351.jpg" width="600"></div>  On the territory of 594 hectares is the Chess Palace, a large number of sculptural compositions, the <span>Museum of Chess</span> Glory and a European-style residential complex.  Today, various forums, exhibitions, competitions, business and scientific events are held on the territory of the City of Chess.

    <h2>  Where to spend the weekend </h2><p>  Very often, tourists choose the largest city in Kalmykia for small trips.  Two or three days is enough to appreciate all the sights, admire the temple complexes and get acquainted with the traditions of the local population.  Before the trip, carefully study the Elista hotels, their location and prices. </p><h2>  In the center of events </h2><p>  “White Lotus” (Elista) - a hotel located ten minutes from the city center.  Guests can choose from one of twenty comfortable rooms.  The technical support of the hotel guarantees the absence of problems with water or electricity supply. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The cost of a standard double room is approximately 3800 rubles.  The most expensive accommodation option in the White Lotus is apartments for 10,000 rubles.  All rooms are equipped with air conditioning, TV and essential toiletries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Elista hotels prices" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/757708.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The list of additional services includes a sauna, billiards, as well as rental of rooms for negotiations and conferences. </p><p>  Most guests agree that the “White Lotus” (Elista) is a hotel with inflated prices for accommodation, but the service is considered one of the best in the city.  According to reviews, the condition of the furniture and the situation in the rooms are not satisfactory.  Of the minuses, the need to order breakfast in the evening and an unstable Wi-Fi signal are noted. </p><h2>  A chance for a great experience </h2><p>  Hotel “Chance” (Elista, 6th microdistrict, 2a) offers small, but very comfortable options at an attractive price.  A double room will cost 1,500 rubles per night, and 3,000 rubles will have to be paid for a suite or apartment.  This hotel is valued primarily for its good location - in a quiet residential area you will not be bothered by city noise.  Walking distance to grocery stores and cafes, shopping centers and major attractions. </p><p>  Many Elista hotels, the prices of which are at an average level, receive negative reviews from guests.  In contrast to them, “Chance” pleasantly surprises with a high level of service.  Tourists are advised to book rooms in advance, because the hotel is popular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel chance elista" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/757702.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Polite staff, new furniture and repairs - these are perhaps the main advantages that are noted in the reviews.  As for the shortcomings, Wi-Fi outages are the main problem that Elista hotels are facing.  In addition, guests note the lack of air conditioning in some rooms. </p><h2>  Three in one </h2><p>  Mini-hotel "Alpha" (Elista, Station Square, 7b) is suitable for independent travelers.  In a small building, in addition to seven rooms for living, there is a car wash and a cafe. </p><p>  The cost of living for two people is from 1000 to 1200 rubles per day.  The hotel has its own parking.  The guests agree that “Alpha” represents the best price-quality ratio in Elista.  Surprisingly, even Wi-Fi is not satisfactory. </p><h2>  Other Elista hotels </h2><p>  In every Russian city, the central hotel is always reminiscent of the Soviet past.  It’s not difficult to imagine the interior of the rooms: old televisions, shabby furniture and poor-quality cleaning.  “Elista” is a hotel, reviews of which are mostly negative, and the atmosphere is fully consistent with the description above. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels Mr. Elista" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/757703.jpg" width="280"></div>

    <p>  The largest number of disappointed guests are those who paid for a “suite” (3000 rubles) or apartments (3300 rubles).  At this price, a large number of breakdowns and a lack of cleanliness were noted.  At the same time, “Elista” offers other accommodation options: single (1500 rubles), double (2400 rubles) and a room for 10 people (1000 rubles for each). </p><p>  The guests agree that the hotel requires urgent overhaul and development of a modern concept.  Note that the first steps in the right direction have already been taken.  “Elista” provides a large number of related services: a grocery store, a restaurant, laundry and dry cleaning, a souvenir shop and a clothing boutique, as well as its own taxi service. </p><h2>  In the world of chess </h2><p>  During the planning of City Chess, architects provided for the construction of a magnificent residential complex.  Other Elista hotels do not have at their disposal convenient cottages such as the City of Chess hotel. </p><p>  The concept involves the combination of work and leisure.  Guests do not have to leave City Chess.  Two restaurants with a summer terrace and pool, billiards and a bar, <span>sports grounds,</span> laundry and a shop are all within walking distance. </p><p>  The cost of living in the “City of Chess” corresponds to a high level of service.  The minimum price for a double room is 4000 rubles.  Each cottage has an equipped kitchen, air conditioning, telephone and TV, necessary utensils. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel alpha elista" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/757720.jpg" width="280"></div>

    <p>  The complex can accommodate up to 200 people, but in the absence of major events, the number of guests is small.  For this reason, the territory seems deserted, and some institutions do not work at all.  Guests compare the “City of Chess” with a foreign hotel - indeed, such an infrastructure is uncharacteristic for Russian cities.  Some reviews indicate the convenience of living with children. </p><p>  Are you going to have an interesting weekend and study hotels?  G. Elista offers many options for accommodation - from inexpensive roadside motels to spacious apartments in the center. </p>
