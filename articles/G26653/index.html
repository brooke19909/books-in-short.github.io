    <h2>  Homemade modification </h2><p>  Making a USB car charger with your own hands is quite simple.  The trigger is more appropriate to select a single-pole type.  The <span>maximum voltage</span> parameter for it is required to be no more than 12 V. A USB port is used to connect the model to the plug.  The transistor for it is used in binary type. </p><p>  The rated resistance in the circuit must not exceed 20 ohms.  Before connecting the expander, a zener diode is installed.  If we consider modifications to 2 A, then they have a tetrode.  Most often, this element is used with a beam filter. </p><h2>  Choosing a good model </h2><p>  How to choose a car charger for your phone?  First of all, the buyer must pay attention to the compatibility of the model.  If we consider phones with batteries for 800 Ah, it is more appropriate to select models for 12 V. They use expanders of both capacitive and operational types.  On average, the overload parameter fluctuates around 2 A. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Filters must be installed inverting type.  They handle voltage overloads well.  Devices with display systems are considered very useful.  Specialists recommend direct triggers to be watched with individual adapters.  If necessary, they can be replaced. </p>
