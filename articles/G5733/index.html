  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a dollhouse for your daughter with your own hands?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you have a little daughter, then you probably know what toys she and her peers love to play.  These are dolls and all that is necessary for them is clothes, utensils, furniture and, of course, a house in which all this needs to be nicely placed. </p><p>  In today's children's stores you can find everything you need to ensure that your child is satisfied and happy.  The world of toys is a welcome fairyland for our children.  Of course, you can, having collected the necessary amount of money, buy a big house for dolls to your little beauty.  If the family budget does not allow you to make such a purchase, then do not be upset by yourself and spoil the mood of the child - make a doll house with your own hands <strong> </strong>  to every adult. </p><p>  It is worth connecting imagination, taste and try to make a beautiful house with your own hands. </p><p>  So what do we need for this?  First, ask your daughter what house she would like for her dolls - small or large, from several rooms and floors, where there will be a kitchen, a bathroom, a bedroom, a dining room, and a relaxation room.  If the child wants you to make him a small dollhouse with your own hands, consisting of one room, then the usual box is suitable for the frame - a block of durable cardboard.  Depending on the wishes of the child, it will be necessary to remove one or two walls, so that it would be convenient for the girl to play and arrange a home for the doll.  Choose a place for the door and windows and cut them with ordinary scissors.  Well, if the house will consist of several rooms, then its frame is better to make of plywood.  This will have to be entrusted to dad.  When the frame is ready, invite your daughter to do an interesting job - designing rooms for the future house. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A dollhouse with your own hands is very easy, but it will take a lot of time.  So, we divided the house into rooms and proceed to the arrangement of furniture in the rooms of the house for a start on paper.  Everything needs to be well thought out and drawn.  Colored pencils will make this process more vivid and interesting.  When the scheme is ready, you can begin to equip the dollhouse. </p><p>  You can also make home-made furniture and home decorations with your own hands from everything that comes to your hand. </p><p>  The walls can be decorated with original wallpaper made of colored paper, scraps of real wallpaper or printed on paper pictures pre-selected on the Internet.  When the window openings are ready, you need to hang the curtains.  To do this, we take some beautiful piece of fabric, divide it into several curtains and collect it on a string.  We fix all this above the windows. </p><p>  What else can you do in the house for <span>dolls with your own hands?</span>  Decorate the room with flowers and beautiful bright rugs.  We make the TV and other furniture from boxes of different sizes and decorate it with watercolors so that the craft resembles a real household item.  If you are not a very good artist, you can find the image of the TV and refrigerator on the Internet and print it.  Then stick it all on the boxes - the furniture is ready.  For the doll, the mistress of the future house, you need a crib.  This item is often used during the game, therefore, the material for it needs stronger.  It can be a wooden block, plywood, polystyrene.  When the crib frame is ready, you need to sew a mattress, pillow and beautiful bedding.  You can connect mom to this work. </p><p>  <span>How to make a dollhouse</span> with your own hands <strong>-</strong> depends on your imagination and the ability to create beautiful and original gizmos from improvised materials.  When everything that you designed is ready, you can present this product to the customer - your daughter. </p><p>  It‚Äôs very easy to make a dollhouse with your own hands, and if your daughter also participated in the ‚Äúconstruction‚Äù, the gift will be more pleasant and more expensive for the whole family. </p>
