On the outskirts of the once great state small feudal principalities develop.  Such polycentrism contributes to the emergence of several cultural centers, which have already significantly departed from the influence of Kiev and developed their distinctive directions.  The north of Russia was represented by the Vladimir-Suzdal and <span>Novgorod principalities, the</span> west - by Galitsko-Volynsky.  Painting, architecture, literature, natural sciences - these are the main directions that characterized the culture of Russian lands 12-13 centuries.  We briefly discuss these trends below. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  Each of the <span>Russian principalities</span> claimed a leading role in cultural development.  In imitation of the capital city of Kiev, in each of them cathedrals are built like Sophia of Kiev, the Golden Gate is installed.  Over time, imitation arises its own special style, characteristic of ancient Russian architecture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="culture of Russian lands in 12 13 centuries" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/858696.jpg" width="440"></div>  The <span>Assumption Cathedral of</span> Vladimir <span>, the Church of the</span> Intercession on the Nerl, the Dmitrievsky Cathedral are the most famous architectural masterpieces, which were famous for the culture of Russian lands of 12-13 centuries.

    <h2>  Literature.  Birch bark letters </h2><p>  The first letters on the birch bark were found in Novgorod in 1951.  They date back to the 11-12th century.  Later <span>birch bark letters</span> were discovered in Pskov, Vitebsk, Staraya Russa and Smolensk.  Mostly letters describe the social aspects of people's lives in those days.  There are lawsuits, wills and administrative orders, orders.  Among the valuable finds were letters describing training in Ancient Russia.  As it became known, the vast majority of Russian residents from various social strata in that era were able to read and write.  Moreover, not only men but also women studied literacy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="culture of Russian lands 12 13 centuries briefly" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/859076.jpg"></div>

The culture of Russian lands in the 12-13 centuries is replete with the works of translators from all known languages.  A huge number of theological treatises have been translated into Russian.  Over time, secular literature began to be translated.  Biographies of great people, their covenants and aspirations.  At this time in the monasteries various chronicles and chronicles are written.  A new type of literary work — “teachings” —was spread.  The most famous written monuments have survived to our days: “The Monomakh’s teaching”, “The Word about Igor’s regiment”. </p>

    <h2>  Natural Sciences </h2><p>  The expansion of scientific knowledge about man and the Universe is one of the main directions that characterized the culture of Russian lands in the 12-13 centuries.  Foreign manuscripts explaining the structure of the world and the Universe, the diversity of the animal and plant worlds, were actively translated and distributed.  Of course, in those days all natural phenomena were interpreted from a religious point of view, but the texts provided the necessary material for future scientific research. </p><h2>  12-13th century painting </h2><p>  The culture of Russian lands is characterized by the formation of Russian icon painting.  This religious direction in painting came to us from Byzantium, but later transformed into a purely Russian direction of art.  The strict asceticism of the Byzantine icons did not suit the cheerful outlook of the Eastern Slavs.  The main plots of Russian icons preserved Byzantine names.  For example, the most common images of the Virgin remained Byzantine: "Oranta" - praying, "Hodehydria" - holding the Baby in her arms, "Eleusa" - clutching the Baby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="12-13th century painting; Russian land culture" class="if" height="477" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/858728.jpg" width="377"></div>  Two main areas of icon painting have already been identified - Novgorod, in which bright, saturated colors are used, and Kiev, using more delicate shades and halftones.

    <p>  At the same time, applied crafts - stone and wood carving - became widespread.  Temples and palaces decorated with <span>stone carvings</span> , and wooden patterns were found even in everyday life: they decorated everyday objects and kitchen utensils. </p><p>  Despite the feudal fragmentation, the culture of Russian lands in the 12-13 centuries was at a high level.  Its further development was hindered by the offensive of the Tatar-Mongol troops on Russian lands and the establishment of the Horde yoke. </p>
