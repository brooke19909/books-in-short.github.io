Tours to Montenegro</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Regardless of whether you get to the Boka Kotor Bay by land or sea, the experience will be unforgettable, Boka will certainly captivate you!  This region looks as if the mountains were hacked and the sea is let in between the rocks.  It is believed that this is the southernmost fjord and the largest bay in Europe.  Here, high mountains approach a thin coastline, protecting it from harsh northern winds.  That is why Boka Kotorska has become an oasis with Mediterranean vegetation.  At every step, agaves, palms, mimosas, oleanders, kiwis, pomegranates and various herbs grow.  When the mountain peaks in this marvelous country are covered with snow, roses bloom violently in the foothills. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Boka Kotor Bay" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38683/978946.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A little about Montenegro </h2><p>  This is one of the <span>most beautiful countries in Europe:</span> almost the entire territory of Montenegro resides under the protectorate of UNESCO.  The main wealth of the country is the <span>Adriatic coast</span> and small sandy or pebble beaches and, of course, its people.  More recently, war was taking place in neighboring countries, and Montenegro was closed to tourists.  Now everything is different.  People from many corners of the planet seek to rest in this land.  There, tourists will see not only the sea, but also the most beautiful lakes, mountains, covered with green vegetation, waterfalls.  For those who are just going to buy tours to Montenegro, it will not be out of place to find out that most of the hotels and beaches here belong to the state or to foreign citizens and companies.  But, for example, in Budva there is a large share of the private sector, the conditions in which are no worse than in hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tours to Montenegro" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38683/978942.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of beaches and shops in Montenegro </h2><p>  When buying a <span>tour to Montenegro,</span> do not forget that in the south of the country beaches are sandy or with small pebbles.  In the north of Montenegro, the coast is rocky, and you can plunge into the sea only in a specially designated place.  These beaches are fenced off from casual visitors, and will be allowed there either staying at the hotel, or for admission.  Therefore, residents of the private sector must be prepared to bear such costs.  Shops operate at convenient times and open at 6 am, close at 22-23 hours.  Most outlets are ready to serve customers any day of the week.  In every village there is always a convenience store. </p><h2>  Car rental, independent trips during the holidays in Montenegro </h2><p>  The legislation of the country and the reviews of travelers note that you can rent a car for trips around Montenegro only to those who are already 21 years old, and besides, the driving experience must be at least two years.  When concluding a car rental agreement, in addition to payment, an additional security deposit of EUR 100-300 is taken.  The main violation for which a tourist can be fined is <span>speeding.</span>  Unfortunately, not all the necessary signs are installed on the roads, in addition, they can be sealed with advertising information, which also complicates their readability. </p><h2>  Boka Kotorska Bay according to tourists reviews </h2><p>  Anyone who visits Boka Kotorska (as the locals of Montenegro call this bay) will certainly feel its atmosphere and greatness in a special way.  And no matter who these travelers who make tours to Montenegro - artists, scientists, businessmen or people of other professions, Boka Kotorska will make a strong impression on all the feelings of a person.  Boca is a place where differences and contrasts meet and mix, which creates a very special atmosphere.  Tourists, for example, say that in one part of the bay you can see steep rocky mountains descending to a calm and smooth sea surface, while the botanical gardens bloom in the other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Boka Kotor Bay Montenegro" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38683/978943.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, two civilizations at once - eastern and western - harmoniously met here.  Tourists will be able to notice the influence of the Renaissance, Baroque and Gothic style, having arrived in the Boka Kotor Bay in Montenegro. </p><h2>  Climate Boka </h2><p>  Boka Kotor Bay (Montenegro), located between the Adriatic Sea and the mountains, is heavily influenced by the Mediterranean and mountain climate.  This mixture creates mild weather inherent in the south of the Mediterranean, which greatly distinguishes the bay from the rest of the Montenegrin coast.  A unique feature of Boka Kotorska is early spring, when all the surrounding mountains are still covered with snow, and flowers bloom on the coast and trees turn green.  Travelers say that even in winter you can enjoy the pleasant sun and calm weather on the coast, when the mountains are covered with snow.  The summer season in the Boka Kotor Bay is pleasant to spend, at this time sometimes it rains lightly.  Most precipitation falls here in late autumn and winter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Boka Kotor Bay excursion" class="if" height="438" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38683/978949.jpg" width="584"></div>

    <h2>  The vegetation of the coast of the Kotor Bay </h2><p>  The entire coast of the Bay of Kotor is densely covered with Mediterranean, continental and exotic vegetation, such as laurels, palm, olive, orange, lemon and pomegranate trees.  You can easily find agave, camellia and mimosa.  The Boka Kotorska Gulf is rich in flora. </p><h2>  The largest cities of the Montenegrin Boka Kotorska Bay </h2><p>  Tivat is located in the heart of the bay and is ready to offer travelers the best places to relax.  <span>The Boka Kotor Bay</span> here is famous for its beautiful coastline with numerous beaches, bays and harbors, most of which are of great depth.  Rich archaeological finds and cultural and historical heritage confirm the very early emergence of settlements on the territory of modern Tivat.  The Boka Kotor Bay, a tour of which will help to better understand this, will be an interesting educational event.  Various cultural programs, public holidays and sports competitions have become an integral part of the cultural life of the city.  A feature of Tivat is the locals, hospitable and open to all tourists who come here.  And they are very happy when foreigners return to Tivat again and again, some for the sake of a good beach holiday, and others because of the special atmosphere of hospitality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Boka Kotor Bay hotels" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38683/978948.jpg" width="521"></div>

    <h2>  Perast </h2><p>  Boka Kotor Bay cuts deep into the coast of the southern part of the Adriatic, creating four bays in the mountains.  The small town of Perast is located at the foot of the hill of St. Elijah (873 m), on the opposite side of the narrow Verige Strait, where the Risan and Kotor bays converge.  This easternmost coast was inhabited earlier than all in the Boka Kotor Bay.  The remains of the Neolithic culture (3500 BC) were discovered in the caves of Spila above the city of Perast.  Various archaeological finds testify to the existence of civilization from the time of the Roman Empire and the early Christian periods here.  Two islands are located very close to Perast in the Boka Kotor Bay: Gospa od Shkrpela (Madonna on the Reef) and St. George. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best places to relax Boka Kotor Bay" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38683/978947.jpg" width="600"></div>
