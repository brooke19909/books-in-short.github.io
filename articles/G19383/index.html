  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sberbank cash withdrawal limit: conditions, features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sberbank card holders regularly use self-service areas.  The most common service is to withdraw cash from an ATM.  Depending on the type of card, the amount available to the client is significantly different.  To always have money in their wallet, card account holders want to know the cash withdrawal limit at Sberbank. </p><h2>  How much can I take with the instant card? </h2><p>  Cards of an unnamed type - Momentum - are distinguished by free service and quick release.  But these advantages cannot cover the disadvantage associated with the low cash withdrawal limit at Sberbank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thesun.co.uk" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/6659541/atm-cash-withdraw-uk-bank/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank card" class="if uuid-2872913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2872913.jpg"></div><p>  With instant cards per day, customers can receive up to 50 thousand rubles at ATMs.  They have the right to withdraw another 50,000 without a commission at the bank office. </p><p>  On a Sberbank instant card, the monthly cash withdrawal limit is 100 thousand rubles.  Exceeding the withdrawal limit will cost the cardholder 0.5% at the bank's cash desks and 1% (minimum 100 rubles) in other financial organizations. </p><p>  The conditions are relevant not only for plastic products of international payment systems, but also for debit cards of the Russian payment system MIR. </p><h2>  Social card: cash withdrawal options for beneficiaries and retirees </h2><p>  Similar to the standard Instant Momentum cards, the limit for cash withdrawals at Sberbank ATMs on the Social card is limited to 50 thousand rubles.  But the monthly threshold is much higher: up to 0.5 million rubles is available to owners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since 2017, Sberbank PJSC has been issuing the Social card of the MIR payment system only. </p><h2>  Restrictions on classic cards of Sberbank </h2><p>  Classic / Standart cards have the same conditions for receiving funds from ATMs.  For the entire line, the threshold is 150 thousand rubles a day and up to 1.5 million monthly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gobankingrates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank cash withdrawal limit" class="if uuid-2872901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2872901.jpg"></div><p>  This category includes cards with a standard and individual design. </p><h2>  Cash withdrawal terms on a Sberbank youth card </h2><p>  Youth cards are intended for customers from 14 to 25 years old.  Despite the preferential service, the Molodezhnaya card does not differ in the possibilities of making expenditure operations. </p><p>  Clients can receive 150 thousand rubles per day.  The monthly cash withdrawal limit at Sberbank is 1.5 million rubles.  The conditions are also valid for cards with individual design as well. </p><h2>  Terms of service at ATMs on Gold privileged cards </h2><p>  Cards with an increased cash withdrawal limit "Gold" are popular with customers with high earnings.  They allow you to receive cash at an ATM in the amount of 300 thousand rubles per day.  At the box office of Sberbank, customers can receive another 300 thousand rubles without commission. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The monthly limit for withdrawing cash from Sberbank with Gold cards is 3 million. </p><h2>  Limits on co-branded cards </h2><p>  Plastic products that provide customers with a certain type of bonus, co-branded, allow not only to perform a standard set of operations, but also to accumulate points for subsequent debiting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="politis.com.cy" data-author=": " data-source="http://politis.com.cy/article/atm-rosikis-trapezas-ekteloun-sinallages-me-viometrika-dedomena"><img itemprop="image" alt="photo sberbank" class="if uuid-2872938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2872938.jpg"></div><p>  In 2018, only a card with the ability to accumulate miles for Aeroflot is co-branded.  The limits on such a card correspond to the type of plastic: for gold - 300 thousand rubles per day, for classic - 150 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Can I change the conditions of Sberbank plastic cards? </h2><p>  Customers who are not satisfied with the restrictions on spending transactions on the card have repeatedly wondered how to change the terms of service at ATMs. </p><p>  Currently, Sberbank does not have the technical ability to adjust the limit on a bank card.  By choosing the type of product, the customer has the right to withdraw funds only within the specified amount. </p><p>  If this is not enough to meet the needs of the account holder, the client can open one or more accounts with a plastic carrier.  It is allowed to open up to 8 cards of various types to one client of Sberbank.  In addition, users can order an additional card to the main name card, which can be used by their relatives or relatives. </p>
