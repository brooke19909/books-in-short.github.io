This is a very easy workshop to familiarize yourself with volumetric weaving.  You won‚Äôt surprise anyone with parallel, flat beadwork, but a three-dimensional figure will be very useful.  Let's try to weave a snake together, you will find many ways to use this product: it perfectly complements the composition, it can be placed under a tree or used as a decoration - a bracelet or necklace. </p><p>  What material will we need for weaving a snake from beads? </p><div class="photo" data-original="beadsmagic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bead snake weaving" class="if uuid-2659559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2659559.jpg"></div><h2>  Material </h2><p>  Our main material is beads, in order to weave a green snake with stripes, we need: </p><ul><li>  dark green beads; </li><li>  yellow or light green; </li><li>  orange or red for the tongue; </li><li>  gray, purple or black for the eyes. </li></ul><p>  You can use any other colors to weave a snake with different patterns.  Look at the schemes and the necessary colors for examples, draw an example scheme of a snake from beads. </p><p>  And also we need a fishing line or wire if you need a stable figure.  We will weave our snake on a wire: </p><ul><li>  0.3 mm diameter wire; </li><li>  thick wire 1-1.5 mm. </li></ul><p>  The thick wire will serve as a kind of spine for the snake, thanks to which the figure will be stable and bend as you like. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Let's start weaving a snake from the beads according to the pattern that we have prepared for you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.mx" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful snake" class="if uuid-2659774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2659774.jpg"></div><h2>  Start weaving </h2><p>  To weave a snake from beads, you will need a lot of wire, it will be difficult to work with a long one.  Measure 320-330 cm. The snake has 85 rows of two tiers, and so that the snake is even and neat, it bends well, you need to weave it on a continuous segment, and do not add a piece of wire as necessary.  This weaving requires utmost care. </p><p>  Weaving should be familiar to you.  If you had experience in weaving three-dimensional figures, excellent, if not, don‚Äôt worry, our snake bead weaving scheme is quite detailed to understand all the nuances.  In fact, the weaving is very simple, it resembles a parallel, the main difference between it and the volume is the placement of rows in one plane.  When creating a three-dimensional figure, alternate rows: one up, one down.  So you get an excellent, dense, voluminous snake. </p><p>  Pour the beads into different small containers in equal amounts. </p><p>  Having familiarized with the process, we begin to weave. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="weaving pattern" class="if uuid-2663040" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/2663040.jpg"></div><h2>  Tongue </h2><p>  Snakes have a forked tongue, so that our figure is as realistic as possible, we cannot deprive it of this tongue.  Therefore, weaving begins with it.  How to weave it?  First, outline the middle of the length of wire.  Collect 3 red beads and place on the mark. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Holding the last bead, pull the same end through two in the same direction.  You can simplify this action.  Dial one bead, place it on the mark, fold the wire in half, thread two beads at two ends. </p><p>  It is not difficult to start weaving a snake, but the length of the wire is inconvenient. </p><p>  On one end, type three more beads, pass the same end through the first two.  So you get small horns. </p><p>  Connect the two ends together and put on them 3 beads. </p><p>  The tongue is ready, now we can weave the head of a snake. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.beadcrochetsnakes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jormungand bead" class="if uuid-2659577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2659577.jpg"></div><h2>  Head </h2><p>  The weaving of the body begins from the head.  Let's start from the bottom row.  To do this, put 2 light green beads on one end of the wire, pass the other end through them in the opposite direction.  Tighten the row, pressing it firmly to the beginning of the tongue.  This is the first bottom row. </p><p>  The next row is woven with dark green beads, this is the first top.  Pick up three beads, also pull the other end through them.  Tighten the wires, slide the beads over the bright row. </p><p>  Thus, you need to make a few more rows.  The scheme of weaving a snake from beads looks like this: </p><p>  2 row: </p><ul><li>  upper tier - 4 dark green beads; </li><li>  lower tier - 4 light green beads. </li></ul><p>  Remember that weaving starts from the bottom row, therefore, having completed the dark green tier, start the bottom, gaining a light shade. </p><p>  We weave the head of the snake to the eyes according to the pattern: </p><p>  3 row: </p><ul><li>  B. - 5 beads; </li><li>  N. - 5 beads. </li></ul><p>  4 row: </p><ul><li>  B. - 6 green beads; </li><li>  N. - 6 yellow beads. </li></ul><p>  In the process of weaving, do not forget to correct the figure, giving volume to the snake.  For these purposes you can use a pen, pencil or felt-tip pen.  Insert it inside the weave and twist a little so that the beads and wire themselves take a three-dimensional shape. </p><p>  Do not try to weave on the handle, it is inconvenient and not always even.  Some rows are already, some are thicker, having fixed a row, in the next you will have to dissolve the weaving in order to correct the error. </p><p>  On the 5th row, the eyes begin.  First weave the lower tier of 7 light beads, then dial 1 dark green bead, 1 purple bead (eye bead), 3 green, another eye and 1 green bead.  Fasten the row. </p><p>  Weave the head of the snake from beads according to the following pattern: </p><p>  Weave the 6th and 7th row, adding 1 bead on each tier, that is, the 6th row - 8 beads, the 7th row - 9 beads per each tier.  Then the 8th, 9th and 10th row goes to decrease.  Weave minus 1 bead on each row in each tier.  As a result, the head ends with 6 beads. </p><p>  The head is ready, proceed to the torso. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bead Snake Harness" class="if uuid-2659574" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2659574.jpg"></div><h2>  Snake torso </h2><p>  Next, the snake must be decorated with an ornament.  You can choose any color of your bead snake, but we will take the simplest one - a strip.  Choose one end of the wire, for example, the right, so as not to stray, working on a further weaving pattern.  The first row of the body will look like this: </p><ul><li>  Weave the lower tier of 6 light beads.  The bottom row always corresponds in the number of beads to the top row; it is always woven with a light shade of green.  Do not forget about him. </li><li>  The upper tier is dialed to the selected end of the wire, for example, to the right.  We put on 1 light green bead and 5 dark ones.  Tighten.  11 row is ready. </li></ul><p>  Since weaving diagonal stripes, weaving the lower row of the belly of the snake, put 1 dark green bead, 1 light and 4 dark ones on the right end.  This is the 12th row of a snake. </p><p>  Weave the following rows according to the scheme: </p><ul><li>  11 row - 1 light green bead (s), 5 dark (t); </li><li>  12 row - 1 t, 1 s, 4 t; </li><li>  13 row - 2 t, 1 s, 3 t; </li><li>  14th row - 3 t, 1 s, 2 t; </li><li>  15 row - 4 t, 1 s, 1 t; </li><li>  16 row - 5 t, 1 s. </li></ul><p>  The last row is done without a pattern, that is, the 17th row will consist of green beads.  Before each new upper tier, do not forget to weave light beads on the tummy. </p><p>  Weave a snake according to this pattern, repeat this pattern to 44 rows.  You will get 5 light diagonal stripes. </p><p>  Next, the snake from beads must be reduced in volume.  From each row we remove 1 bead, that is, 5 beads per tier, continue to weave out 2 more diagonals. </p><p>  On the 63rd row, we remove another bead, leaving 4 per tier.  And weave another 1 diagonal.  The snake is coming to an end, soon we will be able to finish the figure with its tail. </p><p>  After finishing the diagonal, remove another 1 bead, weave strips of 3 beads per tier.  There are 2 such bands. </p><p>  If you want to get a stable figurine from a figure, draw a thick wire into it, close the weaving.  Weaving ends with a tail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.underangelswing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful, long snake" class="if uuid-2659570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2659570.jpg"></div><h2>  Tail </h2><p>  The tail is woven from 77 rows of 83 to 2 beads without a pattern.  84 row consists of 1 lower bead and 2 upper, and the last (85) completes figure 1 with a dark green bead. </p><p>  The snake is ready, twist the segments to fix the weaving, cut off the excess.  Hide the twisted tip of the wire between the beads. </p><p>  Give the snake a shape and boldly put it on a shelf.  Your figure is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="beadsmagic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What a beautiful bracelet!" class="if uuid-2659566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77227/2659566.jpg"></div><p>  Here is a bead cord snake.  Take courage for creativity!  You will get a great decoration and an interesting addition to other compositions.  Experiment with drawings on the backs of your snakes. </p>
