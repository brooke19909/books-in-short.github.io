Assign it only once, however, of course, there is the possibility of obtaining a TIN again, but in this case, often after numerous problems with the tax inspectorate, you have to submit an application for the elimination of the second TIN.  However, sometimes there are cases of loss of a document indicating the TIN, or it simply has not been issued, since its receipt is voluntary.  And on the other hand, because without this number, nowhere, in some cases, the question itself arises of how to find out your TIN.  Often it is required for admission to an educational institution, to work.  In addition, without a TIN, entrepreneurship cannot be formalized.  And in some cases you only need to name your TIN.  How to find out your TIN? </p><p>  Not so long ago, in order to find out the TIN, I had to go to the tax office at the place of residence with the application, taking my passport and a copy with me, and after a while I got a certificate of assignment.  If you just needed to be reminded of you, you had to present your passport in tax.  That is, before you know the TIN number, you had to spend your time.  But there is another way, which takes much less time than going to the tax.  Today the answer to the question "how to find out the TIN number?"  somewhat easier.  In most cases, you don‚Äôt even need to leave home for this. </p><p>  How to <span>find out your TIN</span> using the Internet?  On the website of the <span>tax service of the</span> Russian Federation or the portal of public services, this can be done without much difficulty and delay by entering the details of your passport, date of birth in the necessary fields.  You can find out whether the number is assigned to you or not, as well as the number itself.  Most often it takes very little time - you will see the result after you enter the necessary data, and this service is carried out completely free of charge.  If the database gives out the absence of your TIN, but you know for sure <span>that such a number</span> exists, then most likely this is the result of an error in the database due to a lack of information on all TINs.  In this case, you can no longer try to find out the number on this server, but contact the tax office so that the TIN information is corrected.  By the way, using these services, you will not only recognize this number, but you can issue both a Russian passport and a foreign passport, and not only that.  In a word, these sites are very useful, because they will save a lot of your time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth saying that the most reliable of the available methods of storing your taxpayer number is a note about it in the passport.  To get it, file an application with the appropriate request to the tax.  This mark can be made on the eighteenth page. </p><p>  <span>How to find out the TIN number</span> if you are in another country?  A few years ago, this was a time-consuming issue.  Many are still wondering how to find out the TIN while not in Russia.  But now, after the appearance of the portal of the federal tax service, it is not difficult.  You will need to go to the main menu, submitting an application, indicate in it all your data, and you will be able to receive notifications of the processing of your application to your mail.  As a result, you will be able to find out everything that is necessary, not only by TIN. </p><p>  So, today it‚Äôs not so difficult to find out your tax number.  However, how to find out the TIN of another individual?  This is already a little harder.  At the very least, finding out another person‚Äôs identification number is not as easy as finding your TIN.  First, on the tax service portal, you will find out whether the intended physical person has a TIN (moreover, the service is not free).  Further, directly how to find out the TIN of an individual you are interested in?  Turning to the tax office, ask for this data by providing those documents that prove your identity, a copy of the document that will certify the credentials of the representative and a receipt that you will have to pay in advance.  So, before you find out the TIN of another person, you will need to fill out a request form on the website, then provide documents proving your identity in the tax.  And only then can you get the information you need. </p><p>  You have received an answer to the question of how to find out the TIN number.  We hope this information helps you. </p>
