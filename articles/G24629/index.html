Today we will talk about a company called Troika Red.  Reviews are not too numerous, but generally positive.  That is, the company implements all stages of its own construction projects, starting from the study of market demands and ending with the technical operation of commissioned facilities.  Dates are carefully observed, which is rare today.  In addition to the commissioning of the facility itself, the territory does not go unnoticed, as reviews also note.  Troika Red landscapes the territory of the residential complex, and also creates the necessary infrastructure inside the complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="troika red reviews" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1961457.jpg" width="380"></div>

In 2017, most of the facilities were commissioned.  There are houses of different levels and green courtyards with playgrounds.  All of them are decorated according to the latest ‚Äúyard fashion‚Äù.  Near the complex, a new school and a kindergarten with a swimming pool and private territory were laid.  A little later, new stores will appear, where fresh products will be sold. </p><p>  Future residents who have already begun to buy up apartments note the convenient location, as well as the proximity of the picturesque river, on the banks of which the embankment is being built.  Now it will be an ideal place for walking citizens.  Judging by the reviews, the place to live is quite comfortable.  Ecology is medium level, there are green areas, but construction is very active. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ooo troika red reviews" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1961454.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  LCD "Novokraskovo" </h2><p>  Another new housing quarter, which is going to be commissioned by Troika Red LLC in the near future.  It‚Äôs difficult to find reviews yet, because the residents did not have time to call into their housing.  However, there is an opinion of outside observers who live near the construction site.  They emphasize that construction goes on non-stop, in full swing.  The project of the <span>residential complex is</span> very impressive.  A sales office was organized on the territory, and for this a special one-story building was built. </p><p>  Residential complex "Novokraskovo" is being built in the Lyubertsy district, near the village of Kraskovo.  The project provides for the integrated development of the district, that is, six houses of varying storeys, as well as social facilities.  This is a school with 700 seats and a kindergarten, a clinic and two parking lots.  On the first floors, there are areas for rent for various shops and offices.  The complex was conceived as an object of comfort class with reasonable prices, but the developer did not stint on the architectural concept. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ooo troika red employee reviews" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1961453.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  May resort town </h2><p>  And again, the current project, which will be commissioned in 2018.  It is being built in the Moscow region, in Gorki, just 11 km from the Moscow Ring Road.  The village consists of ten multi-section buildings.  In addition, there will be recreation areas and playgrounds on the territory.  Very close is the Kashirskoye highway.  In addition to transport accessibility, good ecology attracts buyers.  There are forests and a pond.  But the social infrastructure in the area is clearly not enough.  It‚Äôs difficult to call the Gorki village developed, which means that you have to go to the city of Vidnoe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="troika red company reviews" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1961452.jpg" width="380"></div>

    <h2>  LCD "Kraskovo City" </h2><p>  A huge area of ‚Äã‚Äãnew buildings, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is more than 140 thousand m <sup>2</sup> .  Today, work is underway, the commissioning is scheduled for the second half of 2018.  The project plans houses with a height of 7 to 17 floors.  The total housing stock - more than 3000 objects.  Kraskovo is a holiday village, there is no modern infrastructure here, so the developer promises to fully provide it with a new district.  The ecology is wonderful, around forests and large bodies of water.  Difficulties will be with transport.  The railway line is relatively close, but you need to get to the nearest station by public transport.  For car owners, this is a great place to live.  Quiet, comfortable, with great outdoor play areas.  Of course, he has yet to become one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="builder three red" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1961451.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <h2>  Inside look </h2><p>  The success of the company begins with staff loyalty.  However, this is a serious task, which usually begin to solve the firm held, entrenched in the market.  Now the management has time to think about its employees, and not just about the interests of customers.  Apparently, the Troika Red company is following the same path.  Employee reviews are mostly either neutral or with a negative connotation.  Studying the content, it becomes clear that this company is an established system, quite effective, perfectly working.  However, people are just the mechanisms of Troika Red LLC.  Reviews of employees not understood and not heard by the management, of course, can be taken into account, but they are unlikely to be objective.  There are management requirements that must be followed.  I do not agree - you can look for another job.  Of the pluses noted the convenient location of the office, timely accrued wages, normal working conditions. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, the Troika Red company is developing and gaining momentum today.  The reviews emphasize the high confidence in the developer, since he even carried out state projects, handing over the objects on time.  The largest realtors are also advised to cooperate with this company, since the risks in this case are minimized.  If you want to live in the suburbs, then pay attention to the abundance of offers in this sector.  New housing estates are currently in the final stage, the delivery of finished apartments will begin soon, so it's time to choose a cozy nest for yourself.  At the sales office you will be able to offer a large number of options for applying for a loan, installments, and will also introduce you to programs for a young family.  Managers work daily, so you can come and ask questions of interest. </p>
