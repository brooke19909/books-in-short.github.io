At present, Vnukovo is in 3rd place in Russia in terms of the number of passengers served.  Not so long ago, the airport terminal has gained unprecedented popularity regarding the opening of a new international and domestic air service, the transportation of which is engaged in "Victory".  For the <span>Aeroflot subsidiary</span> , Vnukovo Airport is the base airport in Moscow, and the flow of tourists who want to fly abroad at a favorable rate is simply endless.  Because of this, many passengers who are accustomed to Domodedovo, and who have not been to the capital before, the question arises: "How to get to Vnukovo?" </p><div class="photo" data-original="akuaku.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of Vnukovo Airport from a height" class="if uuid-2408174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2408174.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The beginning of the history of Vnukovo Airport can be considered 1936, when its construction had just begun.  The official opening of the airport took place on July 2, 1941.  During the war years, Vnukovo Airport served as a strategically important facility, where the Moscow Special Purpose Aviation Group was located.  It is also interesting that it was precisely at the Vnukovo airport that the plane landed on May 9, 1945, flying on a Berlin-Moscow flight and delivering the Act of Unconditional Surrender of Hitler Germany. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="corp.vnukovo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vnukovo Airport from the inside" class="if uuid-2408153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2408153.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The main feature of the Vnukovo airport terminal is its good geographical location.  It is worth noting that it is located at a distance of only 27 kilometers from the historical center of the capital. </p><p>  An equally important feature of Vnukovo is its location above sea level at an altitude of 205 meters - an additional bonus in case of adverse weather conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="360tv.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of Moscow" class="if uuid-2408168" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2408168.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to Vnukovo airport? </h2><p>  There are several ways to get to this point from Moscow: by express train, bus or taxi.  Of course, there is the option of renting a vehicle, but it is likely that you will stand in traffic jams. </p><h2>  Aeroexpress </h2><p>  High-speed trains and trains are the most reliable form of transport in this case.  Having resorted to the services of the railway, you will not only save time, but will not worry in vain because of road traffic in the capital.  Trains from the Kievsky station are regularly sent to Vnukovo between 6 a.m. and midnight.  Travel time by aeroexpress will be about 40 minutes, which can be considered a very profitable option in a metropolis.  It is also necessary to carefully plan the trip, as the express trains have non-working hours, which you should learn about in advance on the official website. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aeroexpress in Vnukovo" class="if uuid-2408165" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2408165.jpg"></div><h2>  How much does Aeroexpress to Vnukovo cost? </h2><p>  The standard fare for a high-speed train is about 500 rubles when buying at the box office or 420 rubles through a specialized mobile application.  Today it‚Äôs not so much money that almost every traveler will find, and the conditions and time of the trip definitely justify their price: </p><ul><li>  The tariff "Full" is 500 rubles. </li><li>  Tariff "Business" - 1000 rubles. </li><li>  The tariff "Family" - 950 rubles. </li><li>  Tariff "Children's" - 150 rubles, with the exception of children under the age of five. </li></ul><p>  Now you know how much the <span>aeroexpress train to Vnukovo</span> costs and where to find it. </p><p>  Tickets can be purchased both online and directly at the station.  Kiev station is equipped with various cafeterias, ATMs and coffee kiosks, which contributes to an excellent pastime while waiting for your train. </p><h2>  By personal transport or taxi </h2><p>  How to get to "Vnukovo" without any extra problems?  Of course, on one of the authorized city taxis.  This type of transport has its advantages, but despite this there are many disadvantages.  Let's get it together. </p><p>  Prosperous passengers mostly resort to taxi services, since taking into account Moscow prices the trip can cost a tidy sum.  Rather, this option is more suitable for driving in the opposite direction from the terminal.  A taxi or private car is always a huge risk of getting stuck in traffic jams.  You can not only delay, but even be late for the flight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When driving on a car yourself, use the Yandex.Navigator application, but do not forget to check the box that takes into account traffic jams - you will get a real picture of the situation on the roads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="urbankiev.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Airport Taxi" class="if uuid-2408167" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2408167.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of driving on your own car </h2><p>  You can move on your own by car along the Kiev, Minsk or Borovsky highway.  On the Kiev highway, it is recommended to stick to the left side and follow the signs for Vnukovo.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãterminal "A" there is a free overpass and <span>multi-level parking.</span>  You can leave your car for some period free of charge only in a special parking lot at a distance of 1 km from the terminals. </p><h2>  Public transport </h2><p>  Can I save money to get to the Vnukovo airport?  You can - take a bus or taxi.  However, despite the budget of this option, it should be understood that the bus can get stuck in traffic and get stuck there for a long time.  In good time, you can get to the terminal without traffic jams in 30-40 minutes, but always have behind you a couple of hours of emergency reserve.  So, how to get to Vnukovo by public transport? </p><p>  Public transport runs regularly, but from a specific point on the map.  One of these points is the metro station "South-West". </p><p>  Which bus goes to Vnukovo?  From the Teply Stan metro station, city buses at number 611 and minibuses at number 611 depart, but with additional letters. </p><p>  Bus number 566 makes over 40 stops, so the travel time can be about 1.5 hours without traffic jams.  It comes from: </p><ul><li>  metro station "Rumyantsevo"; </li><li>  metro station "Salaryevo"; </li><li>  metro station "Troparevo". </li></ul><p>  At these stations, you can catch 611 buses following the metro station Yugo-Zapadnaya. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelask.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Airport Bus" class="if uuid-2408162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2408162.jpg"></div><h2>  Parking spots in Vnukovo </h2><p>  A rather problematic issue of parking spaces is how a heavy load falls on the drivers head.  When traveling by car, keep in mind that Vnukovo is an integral part of Moscow, which means that fines are imposed for violating parking rules. </p><p>  Parking at the airport is paid and hourly.  The cost of one hour of parking space is 100 rubles.  If you plan to leave the car for a longer period, then it is better to use special daily rates after acquiring a club card.  For boarding or disembarking passengers, you can enter the territory for free for a short-term period. </p><h2>  The road to Vnukovo from various railway stations </h2><p>  Many users on the network ask themselves: "How to get to Vnukovo if you arrive at Leningradsky, Paveletsky or some other train station?"  Unfortunately, there is only one answer - through Kievsky.  Wherever you go, you will have to use any of the methods described above to reach the checkpoint.  In the daytime, passengers should not have any problems with the transfer in the city metro, but you can‚Äôt use the metro at night, there is only one way - to call a taxi.  Decide how it will be convenient for you: either straight by taxi to Vnukovo, or to the Kiev railway station or any other station from where a night bus or minibus to Vnukovo runs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bilet-avia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vnukovo Airport in Moscow" class="if uuid-2408159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2408159.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost of services </h2><p>  As we said earlier, the choice of a vehicle is a matter of taste and financial viability.  Let's look at each method individually. </p><p>  The most profitable option is city buses and minibuses, the fare on which varies from 50 to 150 rubles.  The last figure applies to fixed-route taxis, in addition, the passenger will be forced to pay about 10 rubles for public baggage for baggage.  How to get to "Vnukovo" using this type of transport, we described above. </p><p>  For high-speed trains departing from the Kiev railway station, the pricing policy is quite different and depends directly on the type of ticket chosen and the age of the passenger. </p><p>  The cost of a taxi will depend on your specific location.  Taxi travel varies from 700 to 1,500 rubles.  It is worth noting separately that if you travel a small group of people, then the cost can be divided equally, and this will significantly reduce personal expenses. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.6059954" data-lng="37.28856870000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/4/5/2/2452.png"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The road to the airport is always an exciting period, because you can not be sure of the situation on the roads, the punctuality of the electric train and other trifles.  Which airport you would not follow, always very carefully approach this issue and leave in advance at the appointed place. </p><p>  We considered all possible options for how to get to Vnukovo by transport.  Everything else directly depends on the financial capabilities and preferences of each passenger individually. </p><p>  We hope that our article was useful, and you were able to find answers to all your questions.
