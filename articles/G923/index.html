Debit cards from 14 years old</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  More than a third of parents regularly give out pocket money to their children for personal expenses, another third do it from time to time.  Pupils and students up to 17 years of age receive most of the money in cash, but very few people use plastic cards. </p><p>  At the same time, even some psychologists and financial experts point out the need to introduce the child to financial matters from school age.  So, by the time he’s a student, he will learn how to correctly manage his earnings, make savings and spend money wisely, and parents will be able to control how much the child spent money and in which stores. </p>

    <h2>  Features of Russian legislation </h2><p>  How many years can I get a bank card?  In accordance with current Russian legislation, a minor citizen has the right to keep his funds in a financial institution without the consent of his parents or other guardians from the age of 14, to independently manage his own earnings (scholarship, salary, or other income).  This means that the issuance of an ordinary bank card attached to a separate account should be a normal service for banks for customers 14 years and older, but so far this is possible only in Sberbank of Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In some financial organizations, you can open not only a student, but also a student a bank card.  At what age is such a service available?  Sberbank offers the “7+” card from seven years old, and “Binbank” - “Junior” even from six.  True, such a credit card will be attached to the account of one of the parents.  You can set a spending limit, often there is a cashback or other accumulation system, for example, interest on the balance on the card.  All conditions on the main card, including service fees and bonus programs, apply to the nursery. </p>

    <h2>  Bank offers for schoolchildren and students </h2><p>  In most major banks, you can open a card for a student, but only to an existing account and with the written consent of parents or other legal guardians.  From any age of the child, you can order the issuance of an additional card to the account at Alfa Bank, VTB or Otkritie Bank, Russian Agricultural Bank and Sberbank.  But here are special offers for children (including name cards) only at Binbank or Sberbank. </p><p>  But students already have plenty to choose from.  From the age of fourteen, a teenager can already issue his own bank account.  Young people offer quite profitable options with an increased cashback, high interest on the balance, bonus programs and low cost of service.  At eighteen, a student can order the issuance of almost any plastic card (except for platinum or gold, and even then not everywhere) at any bank in Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Visa Junior" from "Binbank" for students from six years old </h2><p>  How many years can I get a bank card?  Binbank offers even first-graders a plastic card.  The Junior card is a special banking product that will allow children from school age to learn how to manage pocket money, and parents can unobtrusively control spending. </p>

    <p>  The card design is made in the form of bright comics with superheroes.  Service is free only if the card is not registered, and the issue costs 250 rubles.  For registration, a passport of one of the parents and a birth certificate or passport of the child - the cardholder are required.  Also, the child must have its own mobile number. </p><p>  When a Junior is issued, a Platinum card is issued to the parent; if this card already exists, no additional issues are required.  The child’s credit card is not tied to the parent’s account, but the parent can set limits, allow or prohibit the possibility of payment via the Internet, replenish the child’s card with his own or through an ATM, as well as see information about all expenses (SMS message comes). </p><p>  Binbank also regularly publishes on the official website of Junior fascinating comics that teach financial literacy, special promotions and contests for cardholders. </p><h2>  Card "7+" from Sberbank for children from seven years </h2><p>  How many years can I get a bank card?  If at least one of the parents is a client of Sberbank, he can open limited access to his account to a child or order the issuance of an additional card.  An additional credit card is issued in the name of the child, and the cost of service, currency and validity period depend on the main one.  Changing spending limits, as well as ordering the issuance of an additional card for a child, is possible only at a branch of Sberbank. </p>
