    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Some negative points you may encounter while relaxing at Atlantica Sancta Napa Hotel.  Reviews say the following: </p><ul><li>  the juices in the bars and the restaurant are half diluted with water (although the fact that they are natural and not powder is already pleasing); </li><li>  ashtrays are on all tables in the restaurant, and therefore, most likely, tobacco smoke will ruin your meal; </li><li>  old furniture in the rooms; </li><li>  the hotel does not have its own beach; </li><li>  the rooms (and the hotel as a whole) have not seen repair for a long time; </li><li>  at lunch, at the distribution in the restaurant, large lines gather; </li><li>  the hotel is very boring, the animation is practically absent; </li><li>  tennis court and golf course in disrepair; </li><li>  the hotel has problems with accommodation (even if you have booked a room in advance, it is quite possible that you will have to spend the night in a room on the ground floor until other guests evict; </li><li>  animation is in English only; </li><li>  a small area with no places for walking; </li><li>  low-quality local alcohol (information about it is impossible to find out, since drinks are contained in large containers without labels); </li><li>  during dinner, all drinks are paid (you need to pay an additional 2 euros). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  A good option for a sea holiday can be considered Atlantica Sancta Napa Hotel 3 *.  Cyprus will make a favorable impression on you if you stay here.  Perhaps the most significant shortcomings can be considered problems with the placement, as well as the lack of active animation.  But the location of the hotel is its main advantage.  It is impossible not to say about nutrition.  Despite the fact that the buffet is not full of variety, the food does not bother during the whole rest.  The dishes are delicious and homemade. </p>
