At one time, the device was the first in terms of equipping a megapixel camera.  However, the model has several more technical (and not only) features that stand out from the competition.  Some improvements are also present.  But for some reason, the Finnish manufacturer did not decide to advertise such moments, which seems to remain a mystery forever.  Well, we will skip the history of the device, moving on to consider the technical parameters. </p><h2>  Nokia 7610. Specifications </h2>

    <p>  The phone entered the international arena of mobile devices in 2004.  The device works in cellular networks of the GSM range.  The second generation C60, the first package, is installed as a hardware platform.  The operating system is represented by ‚ÄúSymbian‚Äù 7th version.  The processor is the ARM family.  Its clock frequency is 123 megahertz.  The dimensions of the phone are as follows: in height - 108.6, in width - 53, in thickness 18.7 mm.  The mass of the device is 118 grams.  A lithium-ion type battery is built into the device as an autonomous power source.  It is rated at 900 milliamps per hour.  If we talk about working in standby mode, then the maximum figure can reach 240 hours.  If you talk without a break, the phone will last about 3 hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Housing for Nokia 7610 is presented in the classic tube form factor.

    <p>  The Nokia 7610 smartphone, programs for which you can find by contacting the official website of the Finnish manufacturer of mobile devices, has an original and sophisticated design.  Here the features of many other products were collected and displayed, and together they gave a very interesting result.  The corners are a little rounded, in the form of drops.  And this cannot but point to the application of the ideas embodied in the 7600 model. At the same time, glossy plastic, or rather its use, is quite characteristic of the image-making apparatus of a Finnish company.  Another point that positively affects the style of the device is a silver border that runs along the perimeter of the screen.  Such a peculiar chic, frankly speaking. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Color schemes </h2>

    <p>  Nokia 7610, the firmware of which may be needed to ensure the correct operation of the device, was released on the mobile phone market in two colors.  We are talking about red, as well as milky white options.  Both of these modifications look good in their own way.  Probably, the latter will still have less intrigue than in dark red.  However, it is impossible to unequivocally answer the question of for which group of users which color option is intended.  Probably both solutions belong to the unisex group.  Special thanks to the engineers and designers of the company must be said for the possibility of installing interchangeable panels.  Thanks to their presence, the device is very easy to upgrade externally.  This helps in situations where the phone fell to the ground and the panels were damaged as a result.  By the way, these elements lack backlash, everything is assembled quite well and efficiently. </p><h2>  Keyboard </h2>

    <p>  This is nothing more than a design element of the model.  However, the desire to sit on two chairs at once few ends successfully and well, and now the Finnish manufacturer, when trying to do this, still had no luck.  Yes, the keyboard may have turned out to be original, but I had to sacrifice the functionality of the unit for this.  A huge number of questions and user complaints are associated with this particular hardware.  Often ask their questions and those who are just going to purchase this unit.  They again ask about the features of the keyboard unit.  Probably, to say that the keyboard is inconvenient to use, nevertheless, is impossible.  Here, a lot depends on the habit.  Perhaps, at first, working with her will not be very comfortable.  Nevertheless, after a certain period of operation, it will be difficult to refuse such a decision.  Here the keyboard is made an order of magnitude better and more convenient than in the same ‚ÄúNokia 3650‚Äù.  A parallel can be drawn with the model 6000. Only already in the opposite sense.  The main drawback lies in the vertical row on the right.  Here the buttons are small, and their course is not so great.  When pressed, there is a certain discomfort, as with a set of voluminous text messages. </p><h2>  Backlight </h2>

    <p>  The backlight is blue.  If the phone version is localized (that is, the buttons indicate two languages), then it will be difficult to notice all the characters under certain conditions.  The letters of the secondary language, due to the peculiarities of applying the paint, as well as due to some features of the backlight, will merge into one.  These are the problems that appeared in the corresponding modifications of the phone.  Another question remains why designers and engineers did not foresee the possibility of such a flaw and did not take action to resolve this problem. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The display matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using TFT technology.  Color rendering - at around 65 million colors.  The 6600 model has similar parameters. The screen resolution is 176 by 208 <span>pixels.</span>  <span>In centimeters</span> this is 35 by 41. On the display you can display the service line, and even 8 lines of text.  In fact, the screen is made quite high quality, especially if you compare the device with its closest competitors in this parameter.  However, there are some disadvantages.  Although the picture is lively, there is a little lack of saturation.  The brightness is not that, maybe.  The colors seem muted in some way.  In general, certain problems (though not critical) with contrast exist.  Note that the display is not bad for its segment.  But now we are talking about a smartphone, so we should not compare the subject of our today's review with ordinary mobile devices.  Although it is possible to read information in sunlight, the picture on the device screen fades very, very much.  This can be written in the list of disadvantages of the device. </p><h2>  Top end </h2>

    <p>  Here is the key that is responsible for turning the device on and off.  It is made of rubber, has a small size.  Clicking on this control is quite difficult and problematic.  This, of course, negatively affects the quality of work with the smartphone we are considering.  On the other hand, this has its advantages.  For example, a similar design saves from accidental button presses. </p><h2>  Bottom end </h2><p>  Here we have the PopPort interface connector.  Not far from it there was a port designed to bring a charger to the smartphone.  A jack for a wired stereo headset or computer headphones is not provided in the device.  That is why listening to music, if you want, you have to use an ordinary speaker. </p><p>  We remind readers that cool themes for Nokia 7610 can be found on the official website of the manufacturer of mobile phones of the corresponding brand, and we move on to the results of the article.  Now, based on the feedback from the owners of the device, we will try to highlight the key advantages and disadvantages of the device. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  So, among the strengths, users note the camera, as well as the good quality of communication.  This also includes the presence of a port for installing external memory drives.  Among the shortcomings, the reviews highlight a weak vibrating alert and a poor-quality speaker, the absence of a special jack for connecting a wired stereo headset. </p>
