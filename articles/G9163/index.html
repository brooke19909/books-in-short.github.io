  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do-it-yourself jumper: how to make an egg jumper</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any child, without exception, likes to play with a skipper.  This is such a funny ball that, when it hits the floor, bounces cheerfully from it to a rather high height.  Kids really like it.  This funny toy is familiar to several generations.  Yes, our mothers and fathers, grandparents did not know the jumpers, which are made of rubber or rubber, they did not buy them in special slot machines.  The older generation made them with their own hands.  Interestingly, do they know how to make a jumper out of an egg?  Or did they make this toy from another material? </p><p>  It is necessary to consider the basics of manufacturing methods.  Making a bouncer is not at all difficult.  You should stock up on only some consumables (depending on what the hopper will be made of), unprecedented patience and zeal, as well as great accuracy. </p><h2>  The value of do-it-yourself work </h2><p>  DIY creations are always sweeter and closer to the heart.  In his craft, a person puts not only labor, but also an emotional message with a piece of soul.  The process of creativity and work with small details allow you to relax, escape from daily worries and problems, restore emotional balance.  After all, the benefits of creativity have been proven for a long time. </p><p>  Every person has a creative beginning, it should only be developed.  To reveal and liberate a person is easier, of course, in childhood. </p><p>  Have you ever wondered how to make an egg hopper?  Be smart and think a little. </p><h2>  What material can I make a bouncer with? </h2><p>  The material, as a rule, is the simplest, what is usually found, as they say, "at hand": </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  stationery glue; </li><li>  egg; </li><li>  stationery erasers and paper. </li></ul><p>  Of course, the main materials are listed here.  It does not take into account, for example, a stick for stirring glue, a brush, etc. </p><h2>  How to make a bouncer out of an egg </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.saba.com" data-author=": Melany Gallant, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chicken Egg Jumper" class="if uuid-2471944" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/83584/2471944.jpg"></div><p>  The easiest way is to use a chicken egg. </p><p>  You will need: </p><ul><li>  1 chicken egg; </li><li>  1 bottle of table vinegar (1 liter). </li></ul><p>  The jumper can be made on the basis of raw or boiled eggs.  However, a boiled egg skipper is more resistant to shock, so it is recommended to use it. </p><p>  Manufacturing Method: </p><ol><li>  It is necessary to boil the egg and place it in a glass jar with a capacity of one liter. </li><li>  Fill the jar with vinegar (right down to the neck), close the lid and place in a cool dark place for three days. </li><li>  Rinse the egg in cool water.  The shell on the egg will completely dissolve (vinegar will actively eat it).  The egg should visually become a little transparent and very elastic, tight (resembling a rubber ball).  In addition, it will significantly increase in size (compared with raw). </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="totsoffuncrafts.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Egg Leader Hardness" class="if uuid-2471936" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/83584/2471936.jpg"></div><p>  That's all.  It turns out that the answer to the question: "How to make a jumper from eggs and vinegar?"  simple enough. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Attention!  A jumper from an egg (even from a boiled egg) is quite brittle, so you should not beat it too hard on the floor. </p><p>  Interestingly, with what other ingredients can an egg be combined in order to get a bouncer?  On the Internet there are a lot of recipes for making jumpers.  The main one, of course, is vinegar.  Interesting, but how to make a jumper out of eggs and butter?  Unfortunately, there is no such recipe.  The oil does not have the property of protein compaction and will not be able to corrode the shell. </p><p>  Do not be afraid of experiments, create and be happy with your activities!  And remember that on the topic of how to make a jumper out of an egg, now you can not only tell a lot in the company, but also show it with an example. </p><h2>  Remember! </h2><div class="photo" data-original="parentsavvy.com" data-author=": Brigette, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Egg Jumper: Fun and Fun" class="if uuid-2471938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/83584/2471938.jpg"></div><p>  To make a bouncer, you need ingredients that, if used improperly, can harm the baby!  In this regard, do not allow children to the process of making a jumper.  You need to create on your own, or agree that the child will only observe the process of making the toy.  If you trust your child and consider him old enough, then once again warn him about the dangers of some components. </p>
