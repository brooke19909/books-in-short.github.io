Travel tips come in handy.  According to them, Cuba is beautiful at any time of the year.  She beckons and admires her identity.  This is not a place where you can go just to lie on the beach.  Although the beach holiday is unforgettable, postcard views are guaranteed.  However, in this country it is definitely worth wandering around the streets, talking with locals in order to feel the full flavor.  In any case, it will be unusual and unforgettable.  Cubans amaze with their hospitality and cordiality.  In their garden under the window you can find avocados, coconuts and even bananas.  For us it is exotic, and for locals it is the most familiar fruit. </p><p>  Of course, you should not expect anything supernatural from the service: Cubans are not particularly quick and may not live up to the expectations of a spoiled audience.  Prices are sky-high in places, if you go on tourist routes.  Therefore, it is better to look at the locals - they will show and tell you where to eat cheaper and tastier, and you can buy cigars as a souvenir.  By the way, as it turned out, the most delicious cigars are those that the Cubans themselves smoke, and not those that sell to tourists an order of magnitude more expensive. </p><p>  A little advice: it’s better not to change money at the airport, there the rate is far from the most profitable.  And yet, despite all the shortcomings, Cuba is worth visiting at least once in a lifetime. </p>
