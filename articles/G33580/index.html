  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a box of paper using gluing and 'castle' methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  From an early age, children should develop <span>spatial thinking,</span> which they will need in the future when studying trigonometry and simply in practical life.  All these skills are developed when performing simple work on making simple designs from paper, for example, when cutting a rectangular box, a glass for pencils, a triangular prism or a box with a hexagonal bottom. </p><p>  Since <span>it</span> is not difficult <span>to make a box</span> of paper, you need to start with this model.  First you need to make a <span>box pattern.</span>  If the child is already in elementary school and knows how to work with a ruler and pencil, then you can entrust this work to him.  If the baby is still very small, then the adult himself will have to draw the pattern.  However, it is best to do this in front of the child, explaining his actions aloud to him.  Children have very developed visual memory, and pretty soon he will understand how to make a <span>box with his own hands</span> without the help of an adult or to glue a cardboard cube for various board games on <span>his own</span> . </p><p>  If you plan to use this item for storage of accessories in the future, there is nothing better than making a box of thick cardboard with a lid, and then pasting it with colorful pictures or old postcards.  After the child understands <strong> </strong>  as <strong> </strong>  make a box of paper, you can teach him how to sew beautiful <span>boxes from cards.</span>  But first you still need to learn how to make a pattern of plain paper. </p><p>  So, we begin the construction by building a rectangular base - the bottom.  Draw a rectangle with a width of "A" and a length of "B".  On both long sides of "B" we attach rectangles - walls so that the sides of the bottom equal to "B" belong simultaneously to the bottom and the walls of the future box.  The width of the rectangles - the walls (the height of the box) will be equal to "C".  To one of the walls also on the side "B" we attach the rectangle of the lid.  It should be identical to the bottom. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now you need to build the end walls of the box.  To do this, attach the rectangles to the sides of the bottom, equal to "A".  For these rectangles, all sizes have already been set, since its second attached side (box height) should be equal to the second side of the wall "C". </p><p>  The main drawing is ready.  The moment has come when you should think about the last stage of construction.  It is necessary to provide places on which glue will subsequently be applied.  To do this, to both sides of the end walls, which are equal to the height of the box "C", it is required to make trapezoidal auxiliary constructions.  It is thanks to these glue ‚Äúlocks‚Äù that the box takes and holds its true shape. </p><p>  The last steps in the manufacture of this model are cutting the outline of the model, bending the drawing along the lines and direct gluing. </p><p>  And you can also learn how to make a box of paper in a glueless way.  This method is often used to make various boxes for New Year's gifts.  Modeling of the drawing of the pattern remains the same.  Only you should add on the sides of the walls of the box (not end) with a height of "C" two additional "locks".  They need to be built not in the form of a trapezoid, with a base resting on the entire side of the wall, but only two small trapeziums on each side of the "C" - on top and bottom of the side.  When cutting, you need to make small cuts on both sides of the castle trapezoid so that the middle of the base they firmly held on the wall.  If the free parts of the ‚Äúlocks‚Äù are bent inward, then they can be inserted into the hole of an appropriate size.  If then the ends of the ‚Äúlocks‚Äù are unbent, then the wall will be tightly fixed in this position. </p><p>  Now it is necessary to modify the end ‚Äúlocks‚Äù of the box.  Along the line of the box‚Äôs contour, between the ‚Äúcastle‚Äù trapezoid and directly the end wall itself, it is necessary to cut the entrances for the ‚Äúlocks‚Äù of the walls - they must exactly match the location and size of the folded ‚Äúlocks‚Äù. </p><p>  Now everyone understands how to make a box of paper using gluing and without glue?  Indeed, the most important thing in this process is perseverance and accuracy, and this, of course, cannot be taught in the article! </p>
