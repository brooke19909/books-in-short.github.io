  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rating of banks by mortgage: rates, conditions, documents</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Mortgage - an event of more than one day and not even a year.  According to special resources, Russians prefer to take a mortgage on average for a period of 5 to 12 years.  There is a small share that expects to repay the loan in record time, or another category that prefers maximum terms.  True, the longer the period, the longer the overpayment.  But the maturity of the loan is considered depending on the level of income and other individual conditions of the borrower.  Planning to take a mortgage?  Which banks are more profitable, we will tell in the article. </p><h2>  Comparison Bids </h2><p>  According to data for 2018, rates in Russia averaged 9.88% for new housing and 10.14% for secondary housing.  Is it a lot or a little?  To understand this, it is recommended to take an interest in rates in other countries. </p><p>  To date, the highest rates are fixed in Vanesuel - almost 22%.  Following is Ukraine, with about the same indicators.  Another country with an expensive mortgage is Argentina.  There rates reach up to 27% per annum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bitcoinist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Communication bank mortgage rating" class="if uuid-3229580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/3229580.jpg"></div><p>  And there are still countries in which a mortgage can be obtained at symbolic interest.  For example, the Japanese pay only 0.72%.  But at the same time, the cost of a 3-room apartment reaches almost a million dollars.  The same prices for real estate and 1.58% apply in Switzerland.  The Swiss can expect to cover the bank up to 80% of the value of the object.  There is an option to buy a three-room apartment a little cheaper - in Finland - almost half a million dollars, and the mortgage rate will be about 1.07%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you look in a comparative vein, Russia is somewhere in the middle of these indicators.  The cost of real estate is the same picture.  But over the past few years, the trend in mortgage rates has been declining.  Now consider the rating of banks by mortgage for 2019. </p><h2>  1. Sberbank </h2><p>  Domestic financial colossus accounts for almost 62% of the total mortgage portfolio in the country.  By the way, the second role in this list is assigned to VTB 24.  And this is not surprising, since Sberbank offers a very wide range of services specifically for the purchase of real estate: </p><ul><li>  Mortgages for secondary housing for up to 30 years on the terms of a 10.2% rate, the down payment is only 15%.  The minimum loan amount is 300,000 rubles, the maximum - no more than 85% of the value of the purchased property. </li><li>  Buying a home in new buildings is also funded for up to 30 years.  The minimum amount is 300,000 rubles, the maximum is not more than 85% of the price of the apartment.  It provides rates of 8.5%. </li><li>  If you pay high interest rates, then the law allows you to transfer your mortgage to any other bank, where they are less.  This procedure is called mortgage refinancing.  Using this system, you can also request from 300,000 rubles to 85% of the remaining mortgage amount in another bank.  New interest rates actually have every chance of being profitable - only 10.9%. </li><li>  Mortgage for the family with state support.  This product is distributed to all families in which a second or third child was born or will be born between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2022.  Under this program, citizens can count on a loan of up to 12 million rubles, which can be repaid within 30 years.  At the same time, a minimum rate of 6% is provided.  A great option for those who are looking for where to get a low interest mortgage, since no bank offers more below the rate. </li><li>  To become a client of Sberbank, it is not necessary to buy an apartment.  There are offers for those who value space and territory.  A mortgage for the construction of a residential building for a period of up to 30 years and at a rate of 11.6% is an interesting proposal.  You can qualify for amounts from 300,000 rubles to 100% of the cost of construction costs. </li><li>  Unlike other lenders, Sberbank is also ready to support the purchase of a summer house or a country house.  Overpayment in the form of interest rates will be only 11.1%, which can be paid within 30 years. </li></ul><p>  In addition, Sberbank is a reliable partner of the state in implementing various programs supporting young families, the military and other categories.  Sberbank also works with maternity capital.  It can be used as a down payment or to repay a loan.  In such cases, it is sufficient to submit a certificate of maternity capital. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.independent.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to get a low interest mortgage?" class="if uuid-3229582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/3229582.jpg"></div><h2>  2. "VTB 24" </h2><p>  Over the past years, it has been confidently holding high positions in the rating of banks for VTB 24 mortgage.  To date, proposals for the purchase of housing are as follows: </p><ul><li>  An apartment in a new building where ownership is not yet registered can be bought at a rate of 10.1%.  You can request any amount within 60 million rubles.  The term is up to 30 years. </li><li>  For secondary housing, a rate of 10% is offered, and you can also request up to 60 million rubles.  The term is similar.  Moreover, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe purchased apartment should be at least 65 square meters.  m. The option is considered even without proof of income. </li><li>  If the rates on the current loan rates are high, then they can drop to 10.1%.  On this line, you can purchase both finished housing and housing in a new building. </li><li>  Mortgage over a large area.  This product implies reduced rates for the purchase of an apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã65 square meters.  m. Revenue is not required to confirm, you can use maternity capital.  In fact, you can count on a rate of -0.5% in comparison with other rates. </li><li>  One of the most profitable offers of VTB 24 Bank is a mortgage for the military.  You can request up to 2.5 million rubles.  The return period is up to 20 years.  The rate is 9.8%. </li><li>  A mortgage with state support extends to the same category as in Sberbank: for families with a second or third child born from January 1, 2018 until the end of 2022.  Such families can count on rates in the region of 6%.  A down payment of 20% of the cost will be required. </li><li>  VTB 24 is also considering the purchase of mortgaged property.  Its value should be within 60 million rubles.  You will have to give a loan within 30 years.  And the rates are 10.6%. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.kiplinger.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mortgage Rating of Russian Banks" class="if uuid-3229583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/3229583.jpg"></div><h2>  3. "Unicredit Bank" </h2><p>  The rating of banks by mortgage will be incomplete, if you do not mention the role of Unicredit Bank in it.  In recent years, this bank has successfully entered the front ranks, and today you can count a lot of citizens who want to get their help.  Mortgages at Unicredit Bank are diverse.  Each product deserves special attention: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Refinancing mortgages for secondary housing at 10.20%. </li><li>  Refinancing mortgages for primary housing at 10.25%. </li><li>  Buying an apartment in a new building at 10.25%. </li><li>  Loan for an apartment at 10.75%. </li><li>  The program "Mortgage is calling!"  at 10% per annum. </li><li>  Mortgage at 6% per annum or state subsidies. </li><li>  Purchase of a cottage on credit at 13.25%. </li><li>  Targeted loan, including for the construction of a house or cottage, at 13%. </li></ul><p>  Each type of mortgage "Unicredit Bank" is issued for a period of up to 30 years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankrate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mortgage Bank Rating" class="if uuid-3229584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/3229584.jpg"></div><h2>  4. Alfa Bank </h2><p>  At Alfa Bank, a housing loan is issued in two directions: issuing a mortgage directly for purchase and servicing a loan issued as part of affiliate programs.  The following conditions await customers: </p><ul><li>  For the purchase of finished housing, you can request any funds in the amount of up to 50 million rubles.  The refund period is 30 years.  You must have at least 15% of the cost of housing with you.  The interest rate is 10.19%, and the bank's salary customers can expect -0.3%. </li><li>  A housing loan is inappropriate financing for a period of up to 30 years at 13.49% per annum.  Amounts of at least 600,000 rubles are issued.  This service is valid not only for Russians, but also for citizens from Ukraine and Belarus.  Of course, registration of a citizen can be any, but real estate must be registered in the territory of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  What are the mortgage conditions at Alfa Bank when buying a home in a new building?  Here you can count on similar amounts - up to 50 million rubles, which can be returned within 30 years and at 10.19% per annum.  The down payment is 15% of the total cost of housing. </li><li>  Another reason why Alfa Bank is included in the rating of banks by mortgage as the best is the refinancing conditions.  If the client decides to transfer his financial obligations from another organization, then he will expect a pleasant 9.99% - one of the lowest in the country.  There are practically no restrictions on the amount of the request - you can claim amounts in the range of 50 million rubles with very decent terms - up to 30 years. </li></ul><p>  In addition, preferential rates are provided for salary clients and for participants in other bank programs.  Alfa Bank is the best solution for those who are looking for where to get a low interest mortgage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thefinancegenie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank is the leader of the rating" class="if uuid-3229586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/3229586.jpg"></div><h2>  5. Bank Uralsib </h2><p>  Uralsib is also ready to fulfill the dream of its own apartment.  The proposals are very diverse: </p><ul><li>  The purchase of finished housing will cost overpayment in the form of rates of 10.7%, the down payment is 15%.  The mortgage term is up to 30 years. </li><li>  Similar conditions await those who prefer housing in a new building.  The only difference is lower interest - 10.5%. </li><li>  When refinancing a mortgage of another bank, you can count on amounts up to 50 million rubles.  The procedure is simple and without commission.  The minimum rate will be 10.9%. </li><li>  If there is housing, and funds are needed for another significant event, it is recommended to take a mortgage for it.  Mortgage in the Bank Uralsib in this case does not require a down payment, and the rates will be about 12%, which can be repaid within 30 years. </li><li>  In the same way, you can mortgage an existing apartment and get a loan of up to 6 million rubles at 13.5% per annum. </li><li>  Many military men also prefer Uralsib, since they have a separate financing program.  Under the program, you can request an amount of up to 2.8 million rubles.  The fixed rate is 10.9%. </li></ul><p>  Another difference between Uralsib Bank and its competitors is the provision of mortgage vacations to its customers.  They are relevant for customers who bought housing in a mortgage at the construction stage.  Thanks to the mortgage vacations during the construction phase, they can pay a smaller part of the mortgage, which is very profitable, since many of them at this stage are forced to combine the repayment of the mortgage and the payment of rental housing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thebalance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mortgage agreement" class="if uuid-3229587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/3229587.jpg"></div><h2>  6. Gazprombank </h2><p>  The mortgage at Gazprombank is divided into two types: within the framework of affiliate programs and current promotions.  Total offers - about 20. Consider the most interesting: </p><ul><li>  Family mortgage - gives the right to use funds in the amount of up to 8 million rubles.  Down payment - from 20% of the value of the object.  Interest rates are only 6%.  You can pay off obligations within 30 years. </li><li>  Mortgage with a grace period.  This product offers a chance to get up to 45 million rubles at 6.7% per annum.  The down payment amount is only 15%.  The repayment term is similar - 30 years. </li><li>  Also, many are concerned about documents in the bank for a mortgage, as they may be required from various sources and in large numbers.  Gazprombank has simplified the terms as much as possible, and now you can apply for two documents.  Simplified documentation conditions do not affect other nuances: rates are still acceptable - 11%, the maximum amount is very substantial - up to 10 million rubles.  The down payment amount is relatively higher - 40% of the value of the object. </li><li>  The terms of purchase of the primary and secondary markets are similar.  In both cases, you can count on rates of 10.5%, and you can apply for amounts up to 60 million rubles.  The down payment amount is also symbolic - 10%. </li><li>  When refinancing a mortgage at Gazprombank, you can count on amounts of up to 45 million rubles at a rate of 10.5%.  Similar conditions are expected when buying a home from official partners of the bank and when buying a place for a car. </li></ul><p>  When considering mortgage rates, the rating of banks plays an important role, since this is an event for many years.  From this point of view, Gazprombank is on the list of the best at present. </p><h2>  7. Svyaz Bank </h2><p>  He is ready to finance a wide range of types of real estate, ranging from apartments to land plots.  Another noteworthy point is the lack of need to confirm income.  Consider the most interesting offers from Svyaz Bank: </p><ul><li>  Buying a finished home using Svyaz Bank will cost 10.25% more than for cash.  But unlike a cash purchase, it is not necessary to have 100% of the cost of the object with you, 15% is enough. </li><li>  If you plan to purchase a residential building with a land plot, then only the rates differ - about 11%. </li><li>  It also provides special conditions for a military mortgage: a simplified documentation system, free review and 54 regions of operation.  The funds received are charged at 9.4% per annum.  You can request an amount from 400,000 thousand to 2.5 million rubles.  The term of financing is from 3 to 20 years. </li><li>  Also, Svyaz Bank can arrange mortgage refinancing for all types of real estate at a rate of 9.75%.  The requested amount should be within 30 million rubles. </li><li>  Also, in Svyaz Bank, a mortgage is provided for measures to improve housing.  The line is called ‚ÄúLarge Collateral Loan‚Äù and provides for rates from 16 to 17.5%.  Residents of Moscow for this product can claim up to 10 million rubles, residents of the regions - up to 5 million rubles. </li></ul><p>  Another feature is a mortgage in the regions of the country where Svyaz Bank branches are present. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.housingwire.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rating of Moscow banks by mortgage" class="if uuid-3229588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74171/3229588.jpg"></div><h2>  Rating Criteria </h2><p>  Different resources determine the rating of banks from different points of view.  From an economic point of view, an indicator of the reliability of a financial organization is the volume of its financial portfolio - the more funds it has, the more customers it can serve.  The attractiveness of the bank for customers is assessed by several other criteria.  Especially in such a long format of cooperation as a mortgage.  The rating of Moscow banks from this point of view comes down to a comparison of such indicators as the size of rates, terms of financing and a package of documents. </p><p>  Many people remember the bureaucracy in the banking sector, when, in order to receive financing, clients had to run for months, collecting a pile of documents and certificates.  Today's trend is more positive: banks are moving away from these difficulties and are increasingly striving to simplify the acceptance of applications. </p><p>  If we take interest rates, then today Gazprombank is the leader, offering almost 6% per annum.  However, the role of market leadership belongs to Sberbank.  This suggests that both the rates and the reliability of the institution itself are equally important for the population. </p><p>  As for the submission of documents, banks are now in demand, ready to consider applications for a minimum of securities.  This is usually a passport and income statement.  But the second document is also less and less mentioned in the list of documents of the bank, since now it takes into account not only regularly incoming income, but also other types of assets, such as a deposit in a bank, shares or income-generating property. </p><h2>  What documents do you require? </h2><p>  The list of documents depends on the individual conditions of the client and on the type of lending.  The standard set consists of the following: </p><ul><li>  Proof of identity. </li><li>  Certificate of employment or documents on entrepreneurial activity. </li><li>  The documents of the spouse. </li><li>  Certificate of family composition. </li><li>  Certificate of residence. </li><li>  Documents for the acquired object: technical passport and title document. </li><li>  If we are talking about buying a new building, where there are no documents, it is necessary to submit an agreement with the developer. </li><li>  Other documents at the discretion of the bank. </li></ul><p>  If maternity capital is involved in lending, then a certificate is attached.  The review procedure usually takes from 2 days to 1 week.  A mortgage loan agreement is signed after the bank makes a positive decision on the application.  During the term of the contract, the property will be pledged by the bank as security. </p>
