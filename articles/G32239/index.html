This is one of the most important indicators of a TV device, which you must pay attention to. </p><p>  Let's try to figure out <span>what a matrix is</span> in a TV, why it is needed and what types of systems can be found in stores.  We will consider the most common types of devices working on LCD technologies LCD, LED and "plasma". </p><h2>  What is the matrix in the TV? </h2><p>  Such systems are a set of thin and transparent electrodes located in vertical and horizontal planes parallel to each other.  If we transfer the design of the matrix to paper with a simple drawing, then we will see the usual square-nested grid. </p>

    <p>  The system is located between glass plates or, in some cases, films.  Electrodes located perpendicular never touch each other.  If you give a simple definition of what a matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãin a television set, then this is an ordinary sheet with tiny lights that give an image. </p><p>  Systems of such a plan can be conditionally divided into three types - LCD, LED and "plasma".  All of them work on liquid crystals (LC) and differ from each other in some physical characteristics.  For a complete understanding of the differences and the answer to the question of what a matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãin a TV, we will consider each technology in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  LCD </h2><p>  Today, LCD technology is the most popular among TV manufacturers.  Such systems are a flat container with a viscous liquid, where the crystals can change synchronously under the influence of an external energy source.  In the case of a TV, this is an electrical voltage.  The internal optical characteristics of the container can go from one state to another - from transparent to opaque. </p>

    <p>  LCD elements are evenly distributed throughout the container, and their position is leveled using special films.  In the place where the conductors intersect, there are cells responsible for the passage of light.  They can display only three colors - blue, red and green.  Combining the range, you can create any color, including white.  Three such cells form one pixel in the matrix of the LCD TV. </p><h2>  Technology features </h2><p>  Behind the entire system is a mirror film and a light source.  In our case, these are tubes with a ‚Äúcold cathode‚Äù.  After applying voltage to the TV, they light up constantly.  The light falling on the cells ‚Äúenlivens‚Äù the pixels and the user sees the image. </p><p>  There are not so many manufacturers of such systems, but they are all by ear.  Companies producing matrices for TVs: Samsung, LG, Hitachi, Dell, Fujitsu and NEC.  It is these brands that supply other manufacturers of equipment with LCD matrices around the world. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  LED </h2><p>  The LED matrix TV differs from the LCD only in its luminous flux characteristics.  Instead of the usual ‚Äúcold glow‚Äù lamps, LED systems use groups of LEDs.  Moreover, they, unlike the LCD, can be completely turned off, transmitting a deeper black color to the screen. </p>

    <p>  In turn, LED technology can branch into several subspecies.  For example, in the most low-cost matrices for LG TVs, LEDs are distributed along the entire rear plane of the screen.  A similar technology is called Direct. </p><p>  In expensive models, more modern lighting is used, scattered around the entire perimeter of the device.  Marketers firmly assigned her the name EDGE.  This technology has allowed not only to improve the image, but also significantly reduce the dimensions of the device.  The vast majority of examples can be seen in expensive matrices on Samsung TVs. </p><p>  Advantages of LED technology: </p><ul><li>  noticeably greater contrast, brightness and color saturation of the image in comparison with LCD-models; </li><li>  expressive black color due to the complete shutdown of unused LEDs; </li><li>  ultra-thin body can only be created using LED technology; </li><li>  replacing lamps with LEDs has significantly increased the operational life of the TV; </li><li>  cost-effectiveness of models (power consumption is 30-40% less than that of LCD). </li></ul><p>  The price of the matrix for TVs with LCD and LED technology varies greatly, as well as the total cost of the models.  Devices with <span>LED backlighting</span> are noticeably more expensive than their tube counterparts, but they also show better, and last longer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Next, we consider the types of matrices for TVs from LG, Samsung and other venerable brands. </p><h2>  TN </h2><p>  Literally, the abbreviation TN stands for ‚ÄúTwisted Nematic‚Äù.  Here, all the elements in the cells are arranged in a spiral.  The technology is distinguished by its comparative cheapness, so the price of replacing the matrix on the TV, as well as its cost, does not hit the pocket so much. </p>

    <p>  Benefits of VA Technology: </p><ul><li>  The highest contrast in comparison with other types of matrices; </li><li>  rich and deep black color without a hint of grayness; </li><li>  excellent color reproduction and natural gamut. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  colors begin to ‚Äúdance‚Äù even with a slight change in the viewing angle. </li></ul><p>  A couple of years ago, VA technology got a receiver - MVA.  She absorbed the positive features of the base matrix, and the viewing angles increased markedly. </p><h2>  Plasma panels </h2><p>  The picture on the screen near the ‚Äúplasma‚Äù appears due to the glow of the phosphor, which, in turn, is heated by ultraviolet rays.  Here, each cell is a separate light source, independent of other elements.  That is, as such, the "plasma" simply does not need illumination.  Only three brands are engaged in the production of such panels - Samsung, Panasonic and LG.  They also repair broken TV matrices in their official service centers. </p><p>  Advantages of plasma panels: </p><ul><li>  excellent color rendering and gamma depth; </li><li>  the presence of 3D 2D effect; </li><li>  natural black color; </li><li>  excellent display of dynamic content; </li><li>  minimum screen response; </li><li>  maximum viewing angles; </li><li>  slim body. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  plasma technology has an afterimage, which means the TV will not work normally with a PC; </li><li>  mediocre display of static backgrounds (not for viewing photos); </li><li>  high power consumption; </li><li>  high price, even on a budget segment model. </li></ul><h2>  How much does the matrix cost on a TV? </h2><p>  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe main element of any TV.  It breaks extremely rarely, unless, of course, you tried to save money and bought an openly cheap Chinese consumer goods.  The matrix can fail for various reasons, but mainly due to mechanical damage or some external influences. </p><p>  It happens that TVs fall, they get water or you just got a factory marriage.  In the latter case, there are no problems: we carry the warranty to the store where they bought the model, and they are required to replace it.  All other options imply a complete replacement of the display system.  The new matrix will cost about 40-50% of the total cost of the TV itself.  That is, if you bought a model for 50 thousand rubles, then be prepared to pay about 20-25 thousand rubles for a brand new system. </p><h2>  Matrix replacement </h2><p>  The replacement process itself is more like a complex organ transplant surgery.  It will be necessary to carefully disassemble the case, disconnect the old matrix from all the modules, then put and connect a new one, and then assemble the case.  At first glance, it seems to be simple, but in fact there are a lot of pitfalls, starting from small inconsistencies due to the difference in revisions and ending with the coordination of the new system with all modules. </p>

    <p>  There is no right to make a mistake here, because buying another matrix instead of a damaged one will cost the same TV cost.  Experts in this area strongly recommend contacting a service center with this problem.  The work of replacing the matrix will cost you one or two thousand rubles, depending on the model, but specialists will do everything quickly and competently, while an ordinary user will have to sweat over it all day, and the results are not always positive. </p><h2>  Which matrix to choose? </h2><p>  If you really want to buy a TV with LCD technology, but there are not so many funds, then you can look in the direction of TN-matrices.  They cost significantly less than their more technological counterparts, in addition, they consume the least amount of electricity, which will also save. </p><p>  As a compromise for the average budget, you can recommend models with VA technology.  Almost all manufacturers focus on this particular segment, so there are plenty to choose from.  Serious models with IPS-matrix are expensive, but also give a lot.  You will get the best picture and excellent viewing angles - what you need for a large family.  In addition, IPS technology allows you to get rid of the effect of pixelation on televisions with a large diagonal. </p><p>  If you want to use the device not only to watch TV shows, but also to access the Internet, or plan to connect it to a computer, then you need to choose a model exclusively with an LCD matrix.  This technology is not burdened with the memory effect, when the screen freezes from time to time with a picture, therefore, LCD models will quite fit as a second monitor. </p><p>  Plasma panels, although considered the pinnacle of technology due to their amazing color reproduction and realistic 2D image, are still in little demand due to their fastidiousness to related equipment.  If you have at your disposal an intelligent prefix broadcasting high-resolution content, and you like to watch TV with the lights dimmed in the room, then the ‚Äúplasma‚Äù will become an expensive but excellent help in a pleasant pastime. </p><p>  It is also necessary to pay special attention to the manufacturer of the TV and matrix.  The NoName companies from the Middle Kingdom stamp devices as laces and on the shelves of even reputable stores you can often see some frankly cheap models from the next Shaolin.  Buying such TVs is more expensive for yourself: breakdowns, frequent defects, lack of service centers and other problems will make you nervous.  It‚Äôs better to dig up and buy a budget model from a venerable brand and enjoy buying, and not go to the workshops with your ‚Äúprofitable‚Äù device. </p>
