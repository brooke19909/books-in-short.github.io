Sights of the Ryazan region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The ancient Russian city of Spas-Klepiki, the sights of which we will consider in the article, is first mentioned in chronicles in the middle of the seventeenth century.  The title is interestingly interpreted.  "Rivets," scientists say, is a knife for cutting fish.  And the word ‚Äúsaved‚Äù was already attached to the name after the construction of the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord in the nineteenth century.  Some folk legends claim that the robbers built the church as a sign of remorse for the crimes committed.  Other legends say that the temple was built by local merchants for a miraculous deliverance from the persecution of robbers.  Since ancient times, one of the main industries of the inhabitants was fish.  No wonder the fish, along with a cross and a feather, is depicted on the emblem of the city. </p>

    <h2>  Spas Klepiki Attractions </h2><p>  In addition to the wonderful nature, there are archeological monuments in the park.  This is Deulinsky burial ground and Tyukov town.  Even tourists can admire the well-preserved churches built in the nineteenth - early twentieth centuries.  Now they are part of the National Park.  The park staff developed several tourist routes.  Those who wish can choose a route not only by topic, but also by way of transportation: on foot, by boat or by car.  In addition, for the convenience of holidaymakers, several tourist camps have been created where people can relax in nature and put up a tent.  At the service of those who love a comfortable stay, a number of tourist centers and pensions.  For example, Sergeevo, Meshchera, Polushkino and others.  The park has a healing spring. </p><h2>  Sights of the Ryazan region </h2><p>  The amazing story of the Church of the Trinity Life-Giving in Tuma.  Like the vast majority of churches, it was closed in Soviet times.  But it was returned to believers in 1945.  The church building dates from the mid-nineteenth century.  The architectural style of the temple is mainly classicism, with rich decor of walls and windows.  The spire of the multi-tiered bell tower is about eighty meters.  The interior of the temple is very rich.  It contains the work of Italian masters, as well as ancient paintings, icons and frescoes, made according to the sketches of outstanding Russian artists of the century before last. </p><p>  At the entrance to Tuma, you can see <span>a worship cross.</span>  It was installed recently, but a hundred years ago such crosses were not uncommon at the entrance to the village.  They appeared before the weary traveler as a symbol of the fact that he had safely reached his destination and could give praise to the Almighty for this. </p><p>  In the village of Ilyino, travelers can see a small, surprisingly beautiful church of the Icon of the Mother of God ‚ÄúSmolenskaya‚Äù, built back in 1838.  The building is wooden, with an iron roof and domes.  One can say about the nature of the structure that simplicity and dignity prevail in it. </p><p>  While in Spas-Klepiky, you should definitely visit the village of Ushmore, which is nearby.  There is a very well-kept park complex.  Its pearl is a round beautiful rotunda surrounded by neat lawns and beautiful flower beds.  It is the place for honeymoon photo shoots.  And not in vain.  This private estate will satisfy the most sophisticated esthete. </p><h2>  Aircraft L-29 and the narrow gauge railway museum </h2><p>  In Spas-Klepiky near the old buildings there is an unusual monument to the plane.  It was installed in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Victory.  On the pedestal is the Czechoslovak training aircraft L-29. </p>

The depot in the village of Bologne is just an operating museum of this endangered mode of transport.  A museum of narrow gauge equipment was founded at the Tumskaya railway station.  Tourists will be able to see with their own eyes a plow snowplow, an old passenger and freight wagon, a platform wagon that are no longer used for modern railways.  All these technical innovations are now forgotten and preserved only in this museum.
