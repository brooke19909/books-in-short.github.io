  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Neon ribbon: applications, connection and installation options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  According to experts, a good repair in an apartment is only half the battle.  The main task is to correctly set the lighting so that it does not emphasize, but hides the flaws of the finish, which are almost inevitable.  At the same time, beauty and aesthetics are important.  A neon ribbon or tube can help with this, the glow of which not only favorably emphasizes an interesting design, but also ennobles it.  Today we will focus on this particular product. </p><h2>  Neon: what is he like? </h2><p>  Such lighting was very popular in the 80s of the last century.  It is a tube that is filled with a monatomic inert gas, which does not have a smell.  When current passes through it, a soft glow appears.  The principle of operation is similar to a fluorescent lamp, but neon is completely harmless to humans. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.genkiwear.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flexible neon in the bay" class="if uuid-2982795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2982795.jpg"></div><p>  Today, such a backlight is made a little differently.  Inside the silicone sleeve there is a LED neon strip, which is more practical, it can be laid in any direction, regardless of bends.  There is no need to use specialized tools and burners that can soften the glass. </p><h2>  Neon ribbon switching: how does a similar lighting fixture connect? </h2><p>  The voltage of a regular home network 220 V will not work here - the lamp will instantly fail.  A special high-frequency converter is required for connection.  Depending on the characteristics of the device, it can operate on a 220 or 12 V. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If such a backlight is made on the basis of LEDs, an individual power supply unit of the required power is used for connection.  Its output voltage may be 12, 24 or 36 V. Such tapes or tubes are specially marked in places where it is allowed to cut them.  It turns out that if the flexible neon ribbon 5 m long is too large, you can remove the unnecessary part without any damage to the functionality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.swedbrand-group.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Neon tubes - color scheme" class="if uuid-2982813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2982813.jpg"></div><h2>  Nuances of installation and scope </h2><p>  Similar illumination is applied everywhere.  This applies not only to decorating walls, ceilings or floors in the apartment.  Motorists also use it - neon under the bottom of the car in the dark creates the impression that it is floating above the ground.  Such lighting on wheels of bicycles also looks good.  Many people ask how to connect a neon ribbon so that it glows on a vehicle without a battery.  Everything is quite simple - the batteries are AA or AAA batteries. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="jPXkoFuYPXw" data-url="https://youtu.be/jPXkoFuYPXw" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/2/2/4/4/12244.jpg"></div><h2>  Application for decorative lighting in an apartment </h2><p>  There really is where to go for a fantasy.  Soft, as if spreading light will create a romantic atmosphere or, on the contrary, will place emphasis on certain objects.  The main convenience of neon ribbons or tubes is that it is very easy to mount them and even a home master who has absolutely no such experience can handle such work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are a lot of advantages of such a backlight.  It can be placed in the most inaccessible places, choose any colors, it is safe for sight.  The main difference from the usual LED strip can be called the fact that when working between the elements are not visible gaps, dark areas.  A huge plus is that during operation the handset practically does not heat up. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.campuswheelworks.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.campuswheelworks.com/supacaz-supacaz-supa-sticky-3mm-neon-bar-tape.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="flexible neon ribbon" class="if uuid-2982816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2982816.jpg"></div><p>  It is worthwhile to warn those who want to mount a neon <span>light in the bathroom.</span>  Such actions are justified only if the tubes are placed on the ceiling - they can not stand the ingress of water.  For such purposes, you can use an adhesive strip that accumulates light, which does not require a network connection, but it will only be visible in the dark.  Otherwise, there are no restrictions on the method and place of installation, and this is what contributes to the continuous growth of the popularity of neon ribbons. </p><h2>  Wire is another kind of neon </h2><p>  More recently, a product appeared on the Russian market that was slightly different in appearance from tape.  <span>This is a neon</span> wire that distributes the glow around, over the entire area.  It is a copper core coated with a phosphor layer and a sheath.  Under the influence of a high-frequency converter, an electric field arises around it.  It makes the phosphor glow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.keribrownhomes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Neon light" class="if uuid-2982818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/2982818.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Every year, engineers create new light sources that are used to create various room designs.  It is possible that tomorrow something new will appear, but today neon ribbons and tubes can be called the most acceptable for repairing an apartment or making a car unique. </p>
