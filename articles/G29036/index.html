    <h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century in the city of Sochi, the port, which can be observed now, was absent.  Then ships and other vessels were forced to stop at the raid.  Cargo and passengers were transported ashore through a boat crossing.  The building of the marine station, which exists today, in Sochi appeared in 1995.  The project was led by architect K. S. Alabyan.  The building, adjacent to the sea port of Sochi, reaches a height of 71 m. It is crowned with a spire with a <span>five-pointed star.</span>  In general, I want to note the original design in which this project was implemented.  One cannot help but pay attention to the following: sculptures set in three tiers flaunt around the tower.  They represent 4 seasons and 4 cardinal points.  Symbolically enough.  There is also a fountain on the territory, next to which there is a sculpture of the goddess of navigation.  The sea port of Sochi is very beautiful, especially at night - in the dark, it is illuminated from all sides by bright lights.  Many photographers are inspired by the views from these places.  Therefore, they remove the port of Sochi - the photos are extraordinary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The only one in all of Russia </h2><p>  It's true.  Sochi Seaport is the only specialized passenger port in the entire Russian Federation.  It was created in 1934.  Full name - Sochi Commercial Sea Port.  This is a commercial enterprise that works towards the development of regular passenger shipping.  His activities also include cruise tourism, carried out along the Black Sea coast of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Citizens arriving at the seaport of Sochi to go from there on water transport are served at the passenger terminal.  It consists of an international modern pavilion with a capacity of up to 350 people in one hour.  Passengers are given the opportunity to visit a restaurant or cafe.  There is also a duty free shop.  And it should be noted that the port of Sochi Imeretinsky has immigration, customs and border services.  Vessels from other cities of Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Greece, France, England, Panama, Malta and even the <span>Bahamas</span> come here all year round <span>.</span>  All ships are serviced around the clock.  The port service is at the highest level, the staff provides all types of services that passengers need. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Port infrastructure </h2><p>  So, the total length of the two passenger berths is 330 meters - they can receive ships, the length of which reaches 220 m!  The maximum permissible draft is 8.5 m. Thanks to such indicators, the port can accept vessels of various sizes, and that is why the most diverse water transport comes there.  Sochi is a city that can offer any coastal entertainment to guests of the resort.  The most popular are boat trips ‚ÄúMikhail Svetlov‚Äù and ‚ÄúGagra‚Äù.  Also regularly runs a catamaran ‚ÄúDagomys‚Äù and small yachts, which conduct excursions.  For the reception and subsequent processing of incoming cargo around the clock, a ferry and dry cargo berths operate in the port.  By the way, I must say that there is not much to go from the airport to the sea harbor - only 35 kilometers.  And to the railway station only a couple of minutes by taxi or even on foot. </p>

    <h2>  The objects </h2><p>  Sochi port has fifteen berths.  1,450 meters - that‚Äôs how much the total length of the mooring front is.  There are also protective structures, which include the South and North breakwaters (349 m and <span>968 m,</span> respectively).  To date, port berthing facilities are in quite satisfactory condition.  The port is constantly undergoing reconstruction - this is necessary to improve the international center for cruise and passenger transportation.  Thus, it will be possible to ensure a decent reception of large-scale cruise ships. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure development </h2><p>  The seaport should be constantly developed, because, as you could already understand, this is an object of international importance, and therefore must be in an appropriate state.  It is for this reason that it is constantly planned to build new hydraulic structures.  This is necessary to create the appropriate infrastructure.  For the same reason, cargo areas are being created in the Sochi port.  In general, the city has many opportunities and potential for its development, this also applies to the seaport.  Why?  Everything is simple.  To make sure Sochi has a powerful infrastructure, it is enough to recall what work was carried out before the 2014 Winter Olympics.  By the way, most of the building materials are imported, starting from the simplest, inert ones (for example, sand, gravel or gravel) and ending with more expensive and rare ones.  The seaport is a promising project that looks complete, but it can and should be supplemented.  The construction of a large shopping and entertainment center will unfold on its territory.  And this, by the way, is far from the ceiling.  In the near future, in the seaport of Sochi, there will be a lot of different interesting places - shops, boutiques, cafes and bars.  In general, everything that is necessary for tourists and visitors. </p>
