Therefore, many are interested in the question, what kind of reviews does the solar house have from those who were lucky enough to live in it. </p>

    <p>  In all likelihood, reviews should be good, because these houses are designed taking into account the laws of natural harmony, respect for the health of residents, respect for local traditions and love of nature.  Each individual project includes developments in the field of alternative <span>energy sources</span> and energy conservation.  Schematically, the concept of a solar building is presented as follows: the space is protected from the wind and open to the sun thanks to the radial windproof wall formed in plan, collecting solar radiation energy.  The building is protected from the summer high sun by a visor giving a shadow.  Finishing materials and the shape of the inner surfaces of the walls contribute to the concentration of solar energy and its conversion into heat for additional heating of the premises. </p><p>  The Solar House receives positive reviews, as its solar architecture is a kind of long-term financial investment.  Such buildings have almost no competitors.  Their full payback on energy costs occurs within five to six years.  According to reviews, a sunny house allows its lucky owner not to invest significant financial resources in heating and hot water supply, since it </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about Solar House" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11467/41623.jpg" width="600"></div>  The design focuses on alternative resources.  The premises are heated by <span>solar panels that</span> never emit <span>carbon dioxide</span> and other products of combustion and decay, and this will positively affect not only local environmental conditions, but also the health of the entire planet, especially if there are many such buildings.

A sunny house will be an excellent and affordable home for you. </p><p>  Of course, the initial cost of such houses is slightly higher than usual, but low <span>maintenance costs</span> quickly pay off this difference, and the house itself is more comfortable and environmentally friendly. </p>

    <p>  In recent years, Russia has already begun construction of not only single-storey buildings, but also <span>multi-storey buildings of</span> this type.  In most cases, a sunny house receives positive reviews, since people completely trust completely new dwellings.  The advantage of solar houses is that they are actually ordinary buildings that use solar plants, which are fully responsible for heating water and heating due to solar heat.  Savings in heat supply up to 45%. </p><p>  Those who decide to build such a home for themselves should pay special attention to what kind of solar house has reviews from residents who have already lived in it for several years.  So it will be easier to decide whether it is suitable for you or not.  People who know how to look ahead and think prospectively, when building their own housing, will certainly consider the option of a solar house.  So they will be able to take care of the future of their own children and grandchildren in advance.  It is very important at the same time that the microclimate of solar buildings is the main guarantee of the health and comfort of the people living in it. </p>
