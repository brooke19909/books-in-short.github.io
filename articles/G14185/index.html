The village has existed since 1921, and probably there was not a day when it did not develop.  Over time, ski slopes were laid here, hotels, restaurants and cafes were built, in general, they did everything to get what they have today. </p><p>  One of the popular places to stay is the Grand Hotel (it‚Äôs worth saying right away that this is not the Grand Victoria Hotel (Dombay), you should not confuse them).  If it was decided to relax here before booking a room, you should get to know this establishment closer in order to understand whether it is worth going here. </p>

    <h2>  Grand Hotel (Dombay): reviews of tourists </h2><p>  According to the ratings of one popular system of online reservation of rooms, the hotel scored 8.5 out of 10 points, which equals the mark "very good".  But if you read the reviews on other sites, the picture appears less rosy.  The main complaints of the guests are related to poor-quality plumbing, which the administration indicated as ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù, almost complete lack of heating, cold towel rails and the refusal of service personnel to accept the shortcomings and correct them.  Other guests defend the hotel and write that some guests themselves were disgusting, and then left negative reviews.  As a result, everyone remains of their own opinion: someone is satisfied with the rest, and someone is upset.  Some also emphasize that in the village of Dombay ("Grand Hotel") the price is too high, although other vacationers consider it quite normal for a hotel of this level. </p><p>  What are the reasons for such different opinions - it is not clear.  Perhaps someone was too biased in evaluating the work of the maintenance staff and the administration, or, conversely, positive reviews were written by the representatives of the complex themselves.  And to go to the "Grand Hotel" or choose another hotel for relaxation, you should decide on your own, depending on the overall impression and your own desire. </p>
