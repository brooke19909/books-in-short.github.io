They are called "My baby", "Baby and I", "Parents are our everything." </p><p>  Insurers note that not all parents have a real opportunity to constantly monitor and control their child.  But turning to them, they can be sure that they will receive reliable financial support and will be able to compensate for expenses even for expensive treatment.  The use of this insurance becomes especially relevant during the school holidays, when most children get into trouble, remaining unattended while their parents are busy at work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Under this program, three types of insurance are established, which include traumatic injuries, disability, assistance with hospitalization.  Each has a standard and full rate.  The minimum insurance amount is 750 rubles for three months.  For this money, you can count on a maximum of 100 thousand rubles for injuries, 500 thousand rubles for disabilities and to pay for hospitalization at the rate of 1,000 rubles per day. </p><p>  Under the program "Kid and Me", both a child and an adult are immediately insured against an accident.  The minimum cost of the policy is 999 rubles for one year. </p><p>  In the framework of the program "Parents - our everything" is proposed to insure their fathers and mothers from any unforeseen life troubles.  The minimum amount is 999 rubles for one year. </p><p>  Cardif Insurance Company LLC offers mortgage insurance services.  For example, a mortgage loan of up to one million rubles will cost 5,500 per year.  In case of early repayment of a mortgage loan, as in other companies, insurance can be returned to the Cardif insurance company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.track2realty.track2media.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Property insurance" class="if uuid-2919986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2919986.jpg"></div><p>  Under the program "Home" you can insure your property.  You can do this with an apartment or a house online.  So you will be financially prepared for fires, public accidents, thefts and other disasters.  When an insured event occurs, they can even help with rental housing worth up to 60 thousand rubles.  In this case, you insure your home from a lightning strike, fire, gas explosion, aircraft crash, water damage from sewer, water, heating systems, as well as fire extinguishing systems, natural disasters and burglaries.  Your civil liability will also be insured for the same amount in case of damage by steam, water or other liquid substances, explosion of steam boilers, fire, gas, other substances. </p><p>  The main condition for insurance is that the programs take effect on 31 days after the date of payment.  It is worth noting that these are only online insurance options, in the office you will have access to additional features and programs, in addition to larger amounts.  In this case, you will be advised at the insurance tariff rate, which depends on the period of insurance. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.8048025" data-lng="37.59018029999993" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/6/1/7/10617.png"></div><p>  The address of the Cardif insurance company: Moscow city, Novodmitrovskaya street, building 1. It is easiest to get here by public transport by metro, reaching the Dmitrovskaya station.  If you decide to use your own car, then from the third ring turn onto Butyrskaya street. </p><p>  In the immediate vicinity of the company‚Äôs office are the Apple Museum of Technology, the Flacon design factory, the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center, Novoslobodsky Park, and Maryina Roshcha district.  Arriving at the address of Cardif Insurance Company, you can solve any problems and disputes.  The office is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., except for weekends and all official holidays. </p><h2>  Insurance case </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.videoblocks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance case" class="if uuid-2919988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2919988.jpg"></div><p>  All clients are well aware of how to act in the event of an insured event in the Cardif insurance company.  The sequence of actions depends on which particular insurance event has occurred.  In most of them, the first thing you need to do is go to the Cardiff Insurance Company hotline.  So you need to do this if you have a car breakdown, events have occurred under the insurance programs for household appliances and personal electronic devices. </p><p>  So, in the event of a breakdown of your vehicle, you are informed by a phone call of the Cardif insurance company what happened, and the operator will tell you the contacts of the nearest dealer center. </p><p>  In case of theft of a car or the occurrence of another event stipulated by your insurance policy, you should carefully read the list of documents that must be provided.  It will be indicated in your insurance contract.  After that, the client fills out an application form to Cardif Insurance Company.  Scanned copies of the application and all required documents are sent to the email address or feedback form. </p><h2>  Customer Impressions </h2><p>  Clients who really worked with this company leave a variety of reviews about the Cardif insurance company.  Most of the negative is associated with the imposition of insurance when applying for a loan in a bank, usually on a car.  As a rule, in such situations, bank employees refuse to approve a loan if the lender does not insure their life and health.  In this case, the insurance company IC Cardiff is obliged to repay its loan in case of illness, death or disability. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ceafu.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Imposing insurance" class="if uuid-2919987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2919987.jpg"></div><p>  There is a practice in which, in case of early repayment of the loan, the unused balance is returned.  However, customers of credit institutions in reviews of the Cardif insurance company note that this company does not fulfill these obligations.  Even with early repayment of the loan, it is not possible to get back the unused insurance money. </p><p>  The company notes that in this case, refusal of insurance at the Cardif insurance company cannot be applied.  Based on the terms of the agreement, the client has the right to demand the return of his money only within 5 days from the date of conclusion of the contract.  Subsequently, the contract can be terminated only if the probability of the occurrence of the insured event has ceased.  Such is the provision of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, which guides the insurance company LLC SK Cardif.  In this case, when insurance is associated with life and health risks, early repayment of a loan cannot be the basis for a refund.  In this case, the Cardif insurance company in Moscow is advised not to give up such an opportunity.  And when an insured event occurs, apply for payments. </p><p>  It is worth noting that most of the reviews, questions and problems that you have to deal with are precisely connected with the desire to issue a waiver from the Cardif insurance company.  This happens when additional services are imposed by bank employees, which is currently a common practice that is used everywhere. </p><h2>  Online Insurance Opportunities </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.rightawayquote.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance Payments" class="if uuid-2919990" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2919990.jpg"></div><p>  Cardif is one of the companies that provide online insurance or telephone insurance services.  In this case, you do not need to personally come to the office, draw up additional documents and even send photos of the insured object.  Many are still wary of this type of insurance, doubting that in this case they will be able to quickly receive full payments, and some are convinced that they will not be able to receive them at all. </p><p>  However, judging by the reviews, the company strictly fulfills its obligations, even if the insurance was issued remotely.  For example, many are faced with the peculiarities of family insurance when they expect to receive payment in case of harm to their health.  In fact, this work has been maximally adjusted: when the application form and all necessary documents are sent in a timely manner, the required payment in full is provided within a few working days. </p><h2>  Disability </h2><p>  One of the most common insurance cases that customers have to deal with is temporary disability.  At the same time, there are times when insurance, as is usually the case, was imposed when applying for a car loan, but the company refuses to pay.  In fact, it turns out that they remain within the framework of the law, without violating anything.  Therefore, you should know in advance and be prepared for the fact that not in every case you can receive the payment you are counting on, even if, from your point of view, everything necessary has been met. </p><p>  We will explain this situation in more detail using a specific example.  When applying for a car loan in a bank, a traditional insurance policy is imposed on the client in case of illness or death.  The contract states that you can rely on an insurance premium in case of illness and temporary disability.  When a heart attack occurs with a client, followed by an operation, it is likely that he will be denied payment on completely legal grounds. </p><p>  The thing is that under the terms of the standard insurance contract, which is concluded in such a case, illness is understood as a health disorder not caused by an accident and diagnosed for the first time after the entry into force of this contract.  If the disease due to which the heart attack occurred was first diagnosed before the conclusion of the contract, then this event, unfortunately, is not considered an insured event.  Such tricks are used today by most companies operating in this market.  Thanks to them, it is possible to minimize the number of payments, so getting a real insurance payment is not so simple. </p><h2>  Prompt reaction </h2><div class="photo" data-original="theconversation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hot line" class="if uuid-2919985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2919985.jpg"></div><p>  Of the positive reviews that are found about this insurance company, most often there are impressions of how quickly and efficiently the employees of the Insurance Company worked out under the strict observance by the client of all the conditions specified in the contract. </p><p>  If the contract is read carefully, and then all the requirements are fulfilled, then the money is reimbursed in full, insurance premiums are paid in case of insured events. </p><p>  In general, if necessary, most of the issues related to the activities of this company can be quite successfully resolved remotely - by telephone or via the Internet.  The insurer has a hotline, and there is a special customer service that responds promptly to any calls.  It is noteworthy that the client can get an informative and detailed answer not only if he addressed directly to the official website of the insurance company itself.  Cardif‚Äôs employees carefully monitor the most popular and visited resources, on which users leave feedback on the work of banks and insurance companies.  As soon as an appeal appears in the relevant topic regarding the work of this insurance company, a full and comprehensive answer immediately appears.  As a rule, this happens the very next day after treatment.  If the appeal contains incomplete information, the amount of data provided does not allow to locate the problem on the spot, then the user is asked to clarify the information to help him figure it out, find the best solution. </p><p>  After reviewing the reviews about the Cardif company, we can conclude that the main product that it deals with is the imposed insurance policies at VTB and Pochta Bank when applying for loans.  Almost all reviews in one way or another are related to this topic.  At the same time, there is simply no information about how the company works on other products that it offers. </p>
