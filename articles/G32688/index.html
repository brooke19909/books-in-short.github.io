A large tourist center, where not only foreign guests, but also residents of the state are in a hurry to rest, is famous for its magnificent beaches and unique attractions. </p><h2>  Some facts about the city </h2><p>  The green city of Trincomalee (Sri Lanka), immersed in greenery, has always delighted with its amazing beauty.  Its modern name comes from the word Tirukonamalai, which is translated from <span>Tamil</span> as "lord of the sacred hill."  The administrative capital of the eastern province of the country is the main center of Tamil language culture.  In the vicinity of the village, which was first mentioned 2500 years ago, there are many holy places for Hindus and even Buddhists.  Having connected Ceylon and Southeast Asia, it has long hosted foreign ships. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Trincomalee Sri Lanka" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1769010.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The famous resort of Trincomalee, located 250 km from the unofficial capital of the state of Colombo, has been ruled by Europeans since the 17th century: it was owned by the Portuguese, British, Dutch and French.  And only in the middle of the last century did the situation change when it finally gained independence in Sri Lanka.  Trincomale is currently a modern city with a developing tourist infrastructure.  The colorful resort already has loyal fans who, if possible, come here again. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Weather and climate </h2><p>  Warm tropical climate allows tourists almost all year round to have a carefree vacation in Trincomalee, Sri Lanka.  The weather from May to October pleases with sunny days, and throughout the year the average air temperature changes little (from 27 to 30 degrees).  The rainy season begins in November and lasts until April.  However, do not worry, because the rainfall is short-term in nature and will not prevent you from exploring the ancient city. </p><p>  Only two months of the year (November and December) are heavy rains.  Unbearable heat, creating monsoon waves and a large number of fumes do not allow you to feel comfortable, and it is best to postpone the trip to another time. </p><h2>  A resort combining several cultures and religions </h2><p>  The many faces of Trincomalee (Sri Lanka) is a city in which several religions coexist at once, although it is not always peaceful.  And this circumstance has left its mark on the appearance of the popular resort.  Here you can find a Muslim mosque, Protestant, Catholic and Buddhist temples, as well as the remains of an ancient Hindu settlement.  The city has more than twelve religious monuments dedicated to various deities, very colorful, with original decor and drawings that are not repeated. </p><p>  The most beautiful temple of Sri Patrakali, whose photo flaunts on all postcards dedicated to the resort, stands out against the general background.  The facade of the Hindu attraction is decorated with many colorful sculptures depicting the deities worshiped by Tamils. </p><h2>  Thiru koneswaram temple </h2><p>  The majestic Koneswaram Temple, which appeared even before our era, attracts pilgrims from different parts of India.  The shrine was destroyed by the Portuguese, who fortified their fort with materials.  Thus, powerful columns serve as the basis for a defensive structure that protected the city from attacks.  In the XVII century, the religious monument was partially restored, and the locals who hid the relics returned them to the temple, which is visited by both Buddhists and Hindus.  Now in Koneswaram, at the entrance of which there is a huge statue of Shiva, painted blue, you can see many fruit baskets brought by believers as a gift. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sri lanka trincomalee reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1769059.jpg" width="500"></div>

One of the most interesting exhibits is a stone inscription engraved with a prophecy that in the 16th century people with colorful eyes will come to the earth and will rule the state for about 500 years, and after that the power will return to the inhabitants. </p><h2>  Fort fredrick </h2><p>  Fort Frederick, with which many historical events are associated, is considered an important architectural monument of Trincomalee (Sri Lanka).  Curiously, the road that leads to Koneswaram is the entrance to the fortified fortress built by the Portuguese on the site of the ruined <span>Hindu temple.</span>  In the XVII century, an important building equipped with cannons was captured by the Dutch, and the new owners restored it.  And after 33 years, the fort, inside which there was a Catholic church and a soldiers garrison, began to belong to the French. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sri Lanka Trincomale" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1769074.jpg" width="591"></div>

    <p>  Now a dilapidated defensive structure is not used for its intended purpose, but is a tourist attraction, the entrance to which is open to all comers.  Next to it is Fort Ostenberg, which now houses a naval base closed to the public. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Seruwawila Rajamaha Viharaya </h2><p>  The Buddhist temple complex, located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã35 hectares, appeared in the II century BC.  In addition to the monastic sketas and the Bo tree <span>(sacred ficus),</span> it includes a stupa, into which the frontal bone of the Buddha was laid during construction.  After the Tamil invasion, the building was destroyed, and only in the 20s of the last century the archaeological group found it, for several decades now restoring the shrine. </p><h2>  Trincomalee harbor </h2><p>  The former British military base, transferred to the government of Sri Lanka in the 50s of the last century, was soon converted into a trading port.  The deep-sea inner harbor, protected from monsoon winds, accommodates a huge number of vessels of various sizes.  It is curious that there is a cemetery of old ships that look creepy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trincomalee sri lanka weather" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1769076.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This is the only port in the Indian Ocean available for ships in any weather. </p><h2>  Fiery hills </h2><p>  The picturesque landscapes of Trincomalee (Sri Lanka) are simply amazing, the so-called fiery hills, which are visible from afar, are especially beautiful.  Stunning panoramas of a natural miracle with winding trenches resemble a Martian surface.  Nearby is a small village, the inhabitants of which turned the land of unusual color into fertile soil. </p><h2>  Trip to the hot springs </h2><p>  Talking about popular excursions from Trincomalee (Sri Lanka), one cannot but mention the trip to the Kanniya Hot Springs, which were created by order of the god Vishna to defend themselves from demons.  In any case, as the ancient legend says, passed down from generation to generation. </p><p>  Hindus sacredly believe in the sacred power of this corner, therefore, along with tourists there are a lot of pilgrims.  I must say that the springs about a meter deep are more like miniature baths and made in the form of small wells.  Guests of an amazing place, which is part of an ancient Buddhist temple, which dates back to the era of King Devanampiyatissa, are bathed in thermal water from buckets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sri lanka trincomalee hotels" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1769009.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursion to the Pigeon Island </h2><p>  Another excursion that is very popular among tourists is a trip to a tiny coral island called Pigeon Island.  It‚Äôs best to go here early in the morning before the sun fries so much.  One or two hours spent in a picturesque corner is enough to swim with a mask, admire the coral reefs and soak up the local beach. </p><p>  You can get to the islet, which is a national park, only by boat.  Access is paid (about $ 10), and tickets are sold at the box office located on Pigeon Island. </p><h2>  Corners of paradise </h2><p>  Perhaps the main attraction of the resort are long and clean beaches with white sand.  They are of interest for diving enthusiasts as well as for those who appreciate peaceful relaxation who have arrived with young children.  The thirty-kilometer coastline is divided by three beaches located outside the city of Trincomalee (Sri Lanka).  Photos of heavenly corners that look very attractive are unlikely to convey their fantastic beauty. </p><h2>  The three main beaches of Trincomalee </h2><p>  The small and well-kept Marble, located 20 km from the resort center, is always crowded, especially on weekends, and it is not very comfortable to relax here because of the close attention to Europeans.  The beach belongs to the country's air force, so a significant part of it is closed to visitors. </p><p>  Lovers of secluded relaxation come to the village of Nilaveli, located 12 km from the resort.  However, tourists counting on luxury will be disappointed.  There are no luxury hotels and entertainment clubs, but this is a wonderful corner, where the <span>local flavor is</span> fully felt <span>.</span>  Guests enjoy water sports and relax on the beaches considered the best in the resort.  This is a very picturesque place, and since there are very few people, everyone will feel like Robinson Crusoe on a desert island.  In addition, here you can wander through the ruins of the hidden military bases of Britain during the Second World War. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trincomalee sri lanka photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1769063.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A little closer, just four kilometers from the resort, is the small village of Uppuweli, which has received the unspoken name of "paradise for budget travelers."  You can get to it by regular bus, which runs once every half an hour, or a taxi.  Developed infrastructure attracts guests who dream to soak up on the sandy beaches: there are many cafes, shops, cozy bungalows on the beach, inexpensive guesthouses and mini-hotels where you can comfortably stay.  Uppuveli is perfect for snorkeling, and very close is the diving center, which is famous throughout the world of Sri Lanka. </p><h2>  Trincomalee: hotels </h2><p>  A popular resort is considered one of the best places for vacationers who are not ready to give in to money.  Along with luxury apartments in luxury hotels, there are inexpensive bungalows where tourists can comfortably accommodate.  Each guest will find a room with all amenities and excellent service.  The staff, according to vacationers, is very helpful and friendly. </p><p>  There is no doubt that Trincomalee and Sri Lanka hotels fully comply with European standards.  Guest reviews are full of positive emotions: the price of one person does not exceed five thousand rubles a day, and the hospitable attitude and the picturesque panoramas that open make the vacation unforgettable.  At the resort itself, you can rent both rooms and houses, but there are not as many offers as we would like. </p><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  So, where do tourists who choose an excellent holiday on the island of Sri Lanka stay?  Trincomalee, whose hotels are best booked in advance, offers too few options for accommodation, so seasoned tourists recommend staying on the beaches of Uppuveli and Nilaweli. </p><p>  Aqua Hotel Trincomale is located 6 km from Koneswaram Temple and offers free parking and luggage storage.  A cozy hotel in Uppuveli will be enjoyed by those who are forced to save on housing, but dream of a price-quality ratio. </p><p>  Hotel Coral Bay is a budget hotel located in Nilaweli, with rooms equipped with every comfort.  Cute houses on the coast will delight tourists accustomed to coziness and comfort. </p><p>  Jungle Beach Resort 5 (Trincomalee, Sri Lanka) is a luxury eco-hotel for those seeking privacy.  Consisting of a complex of one- and two-story cottages, it is located in a very picturesque place, and its rooms are surrounded by tropical greenery.  A huge complex with a spa, gym, swimming pools, laundry, conference room, restaurant, 24-hour room service is chosen by wealthy tourists.  Guests of a wonderful place, rested from the bustle of the city, celebrate an unforgettable vacation and admit that they finally found a real paradise on earth - the sunny island of Sri Lanka. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jungle beach resort 5 trincomalee sri lanka" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1769064.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Trincomalee: reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Some tourists who visited the resort remain disappointed, because a calm city is more suitable for those who like a secluded vacation and do not favor noisy companies.  There are no entertainment facilities and large shopping centers, and lovers of parties and noisy parties go to other resorts, because there is no nightlife here.  People who are tired of people and city bustle come here to lie on the beaches and wander around the hospitable Trincomalee (Sri Lanka). </p><p>  Guest reviews of the genuine pearl of the country, who came with children, are full of enthusiasm.  Tourists are happy with their pastime and believe that the quiet resort is simply created for comfort and a relaxing holiday.  Connoisseurs of natural beauty also admit their love for this picturesque corner, devoid of ostentatious gloss. </p>
