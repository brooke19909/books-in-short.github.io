    <p>  For the layout, decks of 36 and 52 cards are used.  To expand solitaire (36 cards), as in every other card game, you need to know the rules.  There is a variant of a big deal for 104 cards from two decks (52 cards).  For this version of the game, lay out 10 rows, for playing on one deck in 52 - 6 rows, for a regular playing deck (36 cards), the rows are reduced to 5. The cards are laid out face down.  The first row is laid out on 1 card in each column, in the 2nd row they are laid out on the map in only 5 columns, in the third - in 4 columns and so on.  <span data-num="1">The last</span> card in each column is turned face up. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The remaining cards are postponed and used when the options for moving the deal end.  You can scroll through the deck with three cards.  The <span data-num="2">extreme</span> in the top three is considered active, you can take the middle only after the one closest to the player.  In the Big deal, you can flip the deck only once, in the 36-card deal, the use of coupon cards (from the deck) is not limited.  To simplify the game, beginners can take one card from the coupon. </p>

    <p>  Game rules (36 cards), how to lay out the Solitaire Solitaire: </p><ol><li>  Aces serve as a base for collecting suits.  <span data-num="3">At the opening of the</span> ace, it is laid out separately, the further collection of suits is carried out in ascending order, from lower to higher. </li><li>  After moving the active map, the <span data-num="4">next</span> column must be turned face up. </li><li>  Only cards of different colors can be laid out on top of each other in playing columns, for example, peaks on worms or tambourines on crosses. </li><li>  The layout of cards in columns is carried out in a downward direction - from the king to the sixes. </li><li>  The king of any suit can be moved with the whole stack to the place of the freed column. </li></ol><p>  That's all the rules.  Solitaire is considered to be spread out when all the cards of the <span data-num="5">corresponding</span> suit are collected on aces. </p><h2>  How to decompose Spider Solitaire into 36 cards </h2><p>  Spider Solitaire rarely uses a playing deck.  It can be laid out with one, two or <span data-num="6">four</span> suits.  For the game, take 2 or 4 decks at once, depending on the desired difficulty. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Step-by-step instructions for 4 decks of 36 cards, how to expand Spider Solitaire: </p><ol><li>  Put cards in 6 pieces in the first 4 rows and 5 pieces in the rest.  In total, there should be 54 cards on the playing table. </li><li>  Put the last row face up - these are the active cards. </li><li>  The remaining 80 cards can be folded with a deck - a coupon, or can be laid out aside in 8 lines with 10 cards face down. </li><li>  Cards are laid out on top of each other in order from oldest to youngest of the same suit.  Ace is considered the youngest card! </li><li>  If there are no more options for moving cards, you need to take one of the delayed lines and put one card face up on each row in the game. </li><li>  In place of an empty column, you can move any card or a continuous combination of them, starting with the oldest. </li><li>  If in a column it turns out to collect a sequence from a king to an ace of the same suit, such a combination is removed in a pile away from the alignment.  The goal of the game is to free the field from cards. </li></ol><p>  You can play with fewer decks, then the number of rows must also be reduced.  So, for 3 decks (36 cards) you need to make 8 columns, one half of which is 7 cards and the second - 6 pieces.  Playing fewer decks is not so interesting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  "Grandmother's alignment" </h2><p>  A very simple but interesting version of 36 card solitaire.  The deck is laid out in 3 identical columns of fans of 3 cards, as shown in the photo below.  The goal of the game is to collect sequences of each suit from ace to six. </p>

    <p>  Each fortunetelling deck should have its own storage place, for example, a beautiful velvet pouch.  You should not ask all the questions in one scenario, many answers will not even be approximately correct.  Also, do not seek the help of cards for nothing and ask the same question twice.  The most accurate layouts are made for a period of no more than 3 months. </p><h2>  The alignment of desire </h2><p>  There are very simple fortune-telling solitaire games (36 cards) for desire.  How to lay out one of them is described below.  Before the beginning of the deal, you should hold the deck in your hands, thinking about your desire.  Then it‚Äôs worth mixing the deck well and putting two cards face down next to each other.  The remaining cards are evenly laid out in 2 rows with the suit facing up, you need to start the deal with the last ones laid out. </p>

    <p>  The first four are considered, if in each column there is a card of one face value they are put aside, attention goes to the next four.  For example, in the first column there is a nine peak, and in the second nine crosses, they can be located opposite each other or diagonally.  The end result should be two cards facing up and two cards face down.  The wish will come true if paired cards are in the same column.  If the alignment comes to a standstill earlier or the cards with the same face value appear in different columns, you should not expect the execution of the plan. </p><h2>  Enchantment Solitaire </h2><p>  ‚ÄúEnchantment‚Äù is another way to decompose solitaire (36 cards) into a wish.  You need to make a wish and mix the deck.  Cards are laid face-down in 5 piles of 7 pieces, the last one is opened.  An open card becomes the intended suit. </p>

    <p>  Next, the stacks must be sequentially opened on one card.  A suit that does not coincide with the hidden one, and cards with a value of less than 10 of any suit are removed from solitaire.  For example, crosses fell with the last card, the stack opens until a dozen, jack, queen, king, or ace of crosses are found.  The action is repeated with each column.  Found and not open cards are collected from the end - from the last to the open, the deck is laid out already in 4 columns without mixing.  The whole sequence of moves is repeated until 5 cards are left in the hands.  Solitaire converged if all five cards of the desired suit and dignity are higher than 10. In any other case, there are <span data-num="23">obstacles</span> to the fulfillment of desire. </p><h2>  Solitaire "Loves - Doesn't Love" Solitaire: Layout </h2><p>  Very popular modern fortune-telling solitaire.  Before you begin, you need to share with the cards the name of the young man on whom fortune telling is carried out.  A deck of 36 cards is shuffled and laid out in 2 rows of 6 pieces.  Next, you need to remove all pairs of the same value on the diagonal.  The remaining cards are moved one at a time to an empty place, starting from the first ones laid out, the cards of the lower row are moved up.  From the deck you need to lay out the number of cards eliminated, repeat the selection.  If there are no more matches, one more row is laid out below. </p><p>  When the deck ends, the remaining cards are collected in order from the last laid out to the first.  Then the layout is carried out on 5 cards in two rows, without interfering.  Actions are repeated sequentially, reducing the number of cards in a row to two. </p><h2>  Solitaire: Loves - Doesn't Love Solitaire </h2><p>  The result of fortune-telling depends on the number of pairs left on the table.  If there are two cards left, you can order a dress and look for comfortable wedding shoes.  Two non-retired couples speak of a strong feeling, three indicate interest, four indicate a young man‚Äôs longing for fortunetelling, five pairs indicate a slight interest, six indicate treason.  If there are seven or more pairs left on the table - the solitaire has not converged, you must try to decompose it again. </p>
