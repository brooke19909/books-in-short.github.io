And now a huge number of people not only follow fashion, but also carefully study each new trend.  One of the latest trends has been knitted oversized pullover.  And all because it is ideal for those who want to dress fashionably and comfortably.  For this reason, in the article we will talk in detail about how to make this wardrobe item yourself. </p><h2>  What is a conceived thing </h2><p>  Oversize pullover can be made in different versions.  Popular are both simple models connected by front stitch or garter stitch, as well as more complex ones decorated with unusual patterns, braids and plaits.  Nevertheless, they have a common feature.  It becomes apparent if you study the name of a fashionable pullover.  The thing is that the term "oversize" is used to denote loose clothing and one that is a little large.  Therefore, those who want to make an oversized pullover with knitting needles actually dream of a jacket that is somewhat not suitable in size. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit a pullover" class="if uuid-2971510" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2971510.jpg"></div><h2>  Proper material selection </h2><p>  In most cases, the product under study is intended for the cold season.  Therefore, it is more reasonable to perform it from yarn that will warm.  The best option will be different types of wool.  However, the budget option may not be suitable for those who are prone to allergic rashes.  And then it‚Äôs wiser to consider more expensive yarn.  For example, merino wool.  Experienced craftsmen do not give strict recommendations regarding color.  However, they clarify that monophonic models look most interesting.  In extreme cases, you can use two colors.  But motley yarn for knitting a pullover with oversized knitting is not suitable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Finding the perfect tool </h2><p>  In principle, you can implement the idea with absolutely any knitting needles.  However, it is better for beginners to consider those made of metal.  Moreover, it is important to note that for knitting the main part of the pullover, circular knitting needles are more suitable, rather than hosiery.  But the latter can be used to make sleeves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.postila.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make an oversized pullover" class="if uuid-2971526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2971526.jpg"></div><p>  The ideal size of the needles is indicated on the label of the selected yarn.  Knitting an oversized pullover with knitting needles requires tools equal to the thickness of the thread in diameter.  If the needlewoman wants to decorate the pullover with large loops, she needs larger knitting needles - two to four times thicker than the chosen yarn.  Also, when buying, you need to evaluate the appearance of the knitting needles.  Their tips should be well polished. </p><h2>  Pattern matching </h2><p>  As we wrote earlier, it is better to knit the studied garment with plain yarn.  However, this does not mean that the product will be boring.  After all, it can be revived with an interesting pattern.  Although, in fact, professional craftsmen recommend that you think through the design of the desired pullover in advance, and only then pick yarn and knitting needles for it.  However, many beginners often change the sequence of actions.  Experts say that when making an oversized knit pullover with knitting needles, such violations are permissible, because simple patterns are more suitable for this model.  For example, scarf knitting (1), front surface (2), various types of elastic bands (3).  As a last resort, you can also include bundles (4) and braids (5) in the design. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knit pullover" class="if uuid-2971499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2971499.jpg"></div><h2>  Taking measurements </h2><p>  Experienced masters strongly advise beginners not to use the standard parameters.  After all, measuring your own is not at all difficult.  And the reader will be able to verify this if he reads the following description.  Oversized knitting needles pullover is based on several values.  To find out, you need to prepare a centimeter tape, pen and notebook.  After that, the model on which it is planned to knit the intended product should undress to underwear.  When all of the above actions are implemented, proceed to take measurements.  We measure: </p><ul><li>  product length - the distance from the lower edge to the base of the neck; </li><li>  chest girth; </li><li>  armhole level - the distance from the lower edge to the armpit; </li><li>  neck circumference; </li><li>  sleeve length - the distance from the shoulder to the cuff. </li></ul><h2>  Features of the calculation of loops and rows </h2><div class="photo" data-original="juliehoover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="loose pullover" class="if uuid-2971525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2971525.jpg"></div><p>  In this paragraph, we will study another important stage in the implementation of the women's pullover oversized knitting.  The description of the necessary actions implies the translation of the taken measurements into the parameters necessary for knitting.  In this case we are talking about loops and rows.  After all, constantly checking with a centimeter is not only inconvenient, but also not always accurate.  Knitted fabric has the ability to stretch, which significantly changes the values.  This is not to mention that it seems possible to get the right number of loops far from the first time.  Therefore, we are preparing a calculator, a sheet with calculations and a pen.  Then we knit a pattern.  For knitting a conceived wardrobe item, a square with a side of ten centimeters is enough.  After that, we divide all the measurements taken by 10. Then we count the number of loops and rows obtained in the sample.  And multiply the numbers obtained by dividing: </p><ul><li>  girth of the chest, girth of the neck on the loop; </li><li>  product length, armhole level, sleeve lengths in rows. </li></ul><p>  In conclusion, we fix five new parameters.  They will help us to connect the conceived product, which will certainly fit in size. </p><h2>  The implementation of the main part </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="pullover oversize" class="if uuid-2971482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2971482.jpg"></div><p>  Having dealt with the preparatory phase, we move on to the main one.  Professional masters note that knitting an oversized pullover with knitting needles is not as difficult as it seems at first glance.  Especially for those who have already managed to complete at least one model of sweatshirts.  However, it is important to consider that the specificity of the product under study involves a set of more loops than was obtained from the calculations.  Therefore, it is further required to consider another important point - how free should be a pullover.  Traditionally, the total number of additional loops is 50-60.  However, there are also wider models.  Nevertheless, experienced needlewomen say that the permissible maximum is two chest girths.  In any case, each craftswoman has the right to decide independently. </p><p>  Having determined the width of the desired product, we collect loops and distribute it to the circular knitting needles.  Next, we knit in a circle, as a result of which the pullover will turn out seamless.  However, if it is executed by any pattern, it is important to follow the rapport so that the picture looks finished.  When it is possible to reach the desired height of the armhole, we divide the resulting "pipe" into two parts - the back and the front.  We raise each to the desired height, focusing on the estimated length of the product.  The aperture and the gate are not knitted, therefore, having reached the upper edge, we simply close the hinges.  The main thing is not to delay too much.  Then we separate on each side half the number of loops needed to girth the neck, thereby forming a collar.  Finally, we sew the main part of the pullover along the shoulder seams and go to the next stage of the instruction. </p><h2>  Sleeve design </h2><div class="photo" data-original="stranarukodelija.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fashionable pullover oversize" class="if uuid-2971522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2971522.jpg"></div><p>  If the reader has safely reached this point, then all the most difficult is behind.  Now it remains only to finish the women's pullover oversize.  We put the knitting needles to the side and take any convenient hook.  The main thing is not to use too small.  It is wiser for beginners to choose one that slightly exceeds the thickness of the thread.  Then we turn the pullover to the front side and add loops along the entire armhole line.  In the course of work, we transfer part to hosiery knitting needles.  When it is possible to walk in such a way throughout the armhole, remove the hook and proceed to knitting the sleeves.  At the same time, we are moving in a circle.  Since the oversized pullover is a warm product, the sleeves are tied to the wrists or slightly lower below. </p><p>  This is where our master class ends.  Good luck with the execution. </p>
