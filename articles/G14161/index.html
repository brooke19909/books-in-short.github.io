    <p>  Haruni shawl - a shawl of a triangular shape with a rounded bottom corner - will become a real decoration of delicate female shoulders.  It begins with a variation on the theme of the traditional ‚Äúfern‚Äù pattern, which smoothly transforms into a leafy border and ends with crochet hinges.  If you clearly follow the description and pattern, shawl "Haruni" will be a real work of art and the pride of its creator. </p><p>  For the first time, science fiction lovers learned about the intricate word from Tolkien's works ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings‚Äù.  Translated from the elven language - Quenya - "Haruni" means "grandmother."  Indeed, this makes sense, simple grandmother's knitting secrets are embodied in the extraordinary beauty of shawls, which will not only warm you on a cool evening, but will also add uniqueness to your everyday look. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General information </h2>

    <p>  In the past few years, the model has gained serious popularity.  A sickle-shaped canvas can be made arbitrarily large depending on the number of attached rapports.  Experts say: when a master class, knitting pattern and description are at hand, the Haruni shawl will be simple and understandable even for beginners.  In reality, not everything is so rosy, especially for those who do not have enough experience with knitting needles. </p><p>  The difficulties are caused by the unusual beginning of the knitting process - from the middle of the wide base of the shawl.  No less difficult to adapt to the features of the mirror "body" of the shawl.  So that even a beginner needlewoman could realize the dream of a soft, intricate decor item, the diagram and detailed description of the Haruni shawl are presented as intelligibly as possible. </p><h2>  Knitting principle </h2><p>  The first thing you should focus on: the shawl does not fit from the corner, as is the case with scarves or other types of shawls, but from the middle of the wide edge that acts as the center of the base of the triangle. </p><p>  The whole knitting process can be divided into 3 main stages: </p><ol><li>  A set of loops.  There is no need for a circuit as such.  And the description of the Haruni shawl for knitting the initial ribbon and forming the hem edges will be enough. </li><li>  The main pattern.  Here you will already need a diagram and description of the Haruni shawl to create a ‚Äúbody‚Äù - an extraordinary openwork drawing. </li><li>  Border.  At this stage, another scheme will be used.  And the description of the Haruni shawl for knitting a part with a leafy pattern - the visiting card of this accessory, giving it refinement and uniqueness, will be presented below. </li></ol><p>  Please note: like all openwork, the pattern of the described shawl provides an unmistakable adherence to the technique of knitting loops.  No amateur methods, captures to the rear wall with the front technique are prohibited.  Allowed to use only the classic front loop and the same wrong side. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Yarn Guidelines </h2>

    <p>  Light, almost weightless varieties of shawls, which are more an object of decoration than reliable protection from the cold, involve the use of thin airy threads.  Yarn denser will give the product more weight and will become a shield from the piercing autumn wind.  To knit a Haruni shawl with a crochet, the scheme and description require the use of mohair, however, as with work with knitting needles.  Today you can see many masterpieces made from sectional dyeing yarn.  In the past few years, Kauni yarn has been popular, 800 meters of which weigh only 100 grams. </p><p>  In general, the product is universal, most of the existing types of threads are suitable for its creation. </p><h2>  Tools and materials </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the description and layout of the Haruni shawl for beginners should be as detailed as possible.  In the case of yarn, you should look at the slippery varieties, they are more malleable and easily untangled. </p><p>  In the arsenal of the needlewoman there should be three knitting needles for a set (the size should be selected based on the type of yarn) and a circle of the same size for direct knitting.  Threads should be relatively thin. </p><p>  Product dimensions will be determined by the amount of yarn.  It is important to understand that the border will take 45-50% percent.  Based on this, it is worth planning the size of the body of the shawl. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Loop set </h2><p>  The description and layout of the Haruni shawl, knitted with needles, begins with a definition of the center of knitting.  If you imagine an isosceles triangle, the lower point of the median, dropped from the top of the figure to the base, will become the starting point of the work.  From it should be directed up and to the sides - to the right and left. </p><p>  From the central loop, the yarn loops branch.  They determine the dimensions of the future product.  With each new row, the triangle we need is formed.  The median is made of a thin ribbon, which will later become the loops of the beginning of the base of the shawl. </p><p>  How to make a set of loops of this tape?  Some experts advise crocheting braids from air loops, while others recommend using the junk thread method.  In the described embodiment, the most accurate and affordable way is presented - three spokes. </p><h2>  How to make the edge of the product with three knitting needles? </h2>

    <p>  It is enough to take two knitting needles and type them in three loops on each double set.  Three turns on one instrument remain unchanged, others are knitted with a third spoke with facial loops. </p><p>  Next 5 more rows are knitted with facial.  You should get a tape with a width of three loops with a garter stitch. </p><p>  The task of the contractor is to start the edge of the product and form loops to start the drawing.  For everything about all 9 loops: three hem, three workers (for the pattern), again three hem. </p><p>  Where will nine come from?  After creating the tape, three loops on the working needle are knitted with the front knitting needles, three loops from the edge of the tape are lifted with an additional tool (you need to use ribs - the result of shawl knitting).  Knit the three remaining stitches on the third spoke.  There should be nine on the workpiece. </p><h2>  The body is shawl.  Pattern </h2><p>  Photos, descriptions and patterns of the shawl "Haruni", which is not very difficult to knit, are presented below.  The diagram illustrates the main pattern.  It is worth noting that this is only one half of the shawl.  After knitting loops, a central loop goes along the pattern, and then the pattern is repeated in the second half in mirror image.  Three edge loops will be located on both sides, which are not indicated on the diagram.  They knit with a garter stitch - facial and underside. </p>

    <p>  It is important to understand that the edge loops should not be too tight, they should be as free as possible.  So the edge will be elastic and easy to stretch. </p><p>  Between the edge loops of the fern pattern will be located.  On the front side, all the loops are front, even those that are knitted double.  Accordingly, on the wrong side, all wrong, as well as a crochet of yarn. </p><p>  The notation in the diagram is standard: </p><ul><li>  empty cell - facial loop; </li><li>  circle - yarn; </li><li>  \ - 2 together with a facial broach; </li><li>  / - 2 together facial; </li><li>  3 rays coming from one point - 2 to remove, 1 front, broach (get a double reduction). </li></ul><p>  Good advice for inexperienced beginners is to mark the center loop with a marker.  If there is no desire to stain the shawl, it is enough to visually present the future pattern and navigate by the type of leaves.  So you do not have to recount the loops according to the scheme over and over, and the master will gain the skill to quickly read even the most complex layouts. </p><h2>  Work with a pattern </h2><p>  With seeming intricacy, it is simple.  The lower part of the leaflet - the stalk - is not highlighted in color on the diagram, the upper part is painted in yellow.  The sides are filled in red, they are the beginning of the next leaf.  New crochets contribute to the expansion of the pattern and the formation of new cuttings.  The height of one rapport is 8 rows. </p><p>  According to the scheme and description of knitting a Haruni shawl with knitting needles, it can be seen that the design consists of an alternation of leaves expanding due to yarn and tapering together by knitting three loops together.  It is not necessary to consider the cuttings, if you strictly follow the recommendations presented above, they themselves will expand the workpiece to the side to the desired size. </p><p>  Continue at the same pace until 12-14 cuttings are formed on the knitting needles on each side of the central loop.  10-12 is enough for a small shawl or a piece of thick yarn.  14 and more - application for the creation of a large cape.  A larger number of cuttings is created when working with thin threads.  The number of rapports must be necessarily even, this will avoid numerous errors when tying the border. </p><p>  The diagram illustrates the location of the cuttings one to one. </p><h2>  Border work </h2><p>  The description and outline of the Haruni shawl border - the most difficult part of the process - are presented as accessible as possible for ease of understanding of beginner needlewomen.  The guideline is the proposed scheme B. Attention should be paid to the first part of the figure - from rows 1 to 16.  From 17, changes will begin regarding the right side of the shawl.  After 3 loops on the left and up to 3 loops on the right, as well as in front of the central loop, there will be changes - this is how the shawl with a double border fits. </p><p>  An important aspect: the technology of creating edge loops remains unchanged - 3 garter stitches throughout the entire period of work.  In the diagram B, the edge ones are already indicated. </p><p>  When working with the second half of the border, the loops will have to be reduced for the correct formation of leaflets.  Now the loops will be between them.  A pair of leaves connected in a "twig".  On the right side after three loops of the border, and on the left to three loops there will be one leaflet.  This protects the edges of the shawl from rounding.  You can also knit a couple of leaves, but this will lead to a radical change in the pattern. </p><p>  In diagram B, you can see the new notation: </p><ul><li>  black box - the first time on each half of the product 2 persons together.  broach, then - 2 remove, 1 person., broach; </li><li>  black rhombus - 2 to remove, 1 person., broach, in front of the central loop and at the end of the row - 2 persons together. </li></ul><p>  This is a short description.  The double border of the Haruni shawl is shown in the figure below.  At the disposal of the master are the first rows with minor changes.  The subsequent ones remain the same. </p>

    <h2>  Completion: closing loops </h2><p>  When the last row is finished, you need to close the loops correctly.  You can do this in one of the ways - with a lace or crochet.  The second yarn is spent more.  If the thread is thin, choose either the second option, or use two threads in the first. </p><p>  Option number 1. Crochet 4 facial loops together.  This is followed by a chain of 6 air and 3 on the left knitting needle (crocheted together with the front ones).  One loop is closed by throwing the first one, which is on the hook with a loop (the one that was just knitted).  Again the chain: 6 air, 3 facial together, closing 1. So the top of each leaf will be neatly closed. </p><p>  The described method of closing the loops can be modified.  In a pattern, knit another row, ending with a decrease in the tops of the leaves. </p><p>  Option No. 2. Two front loops together to return to the left knitting needle without twisting or turning.  Two loops again to return to the left knitting needle and knit with a facial pattern.  In total, the loops must be knitted 8 times, the output will be a thin cord. </p><p>  On the right knitting needle, holding 2 stitches, knit 3 knit together, close one stitch, throw the middle one over it and throw it off the knitting needle.  Return the two remaining loops to the left knitting needle, knit two front ones.  Perform similar actions around the edge of the shawl.  In order for the shawl edging to be neat, it is important to ensure that 3 together the front ones cover the tops of the leaf. </p><p>  A useful recommendation: no matter how the needlewoman decided to close the loop, this should be done as freely as possible. </p><h2>  Stretching the finished product </h2><p>  When the shawl knitting is finished, all remaining ends of the threads should be hidden.  The product itself should be moistened in water, stretched, fixed in this form with pins and so dried. </p><p>  In order for the accessory to take the correct shape, and the pattern of each pattern to be clear, shampoo should be added to warm water when wetted, then rinse the product in clean water and soak for half an hour or an hour in warm water with the addition of a small amount of smoothing hair balm.  At the end of the indicated time, Haruni should be wrapped in a towel and squeezed carefully. </p><p>  While the product is still wet, a linen cord should be passed through the edges and the corners should be pulled with pins.  This will greatly simplify the layout process and make the shawl even.  When the wrap is dry, it will be ready for use. </p><h2>  What to wear a shawl with? </h2>
