But sometimes these facts are not enough, then the gaps are filled with hypotheses, opinions, speculation.  Different scientists put forward their versions, however, as you know, the truth is somewhere in between.  Many secrets are covered with the dust of centuries, which hides from us the essence of a phenomenon, question or event.  Today, one of the dark sides, which does not have an unambiguous assessment, can be considered the period of Mongol rule in Russia.  The difficult time for the Russian people for a long time stopped the development of the country and even threw it back.  Scientists still can not agree on what functions performed and in general, who are the Basques.  The picture seems to be clear: <span>these are the governors of the</span> khan in the conquered territories.  But it‚Äôs not so simple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baskak is" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/290317.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Chronicle was well developed and widely distributed in Kievan Rus.  However, the first chronicles spoke of the Rurikovichs: their arrival on the banks of the Dnieper, their resettlement and the founding of new cities, the struggle with troubled neighbors, nomads and settled tribes.  Since the second half of the thirteenth century, they have changed dramatically: the authors are sad, because the Russian lands have become dependent on the <span>Mongol Empire,</span> so the people have a very hard time.  And in them new terms begin to appear, for example, "Baskak".  This word denotes the Golden Horde official, who was necessarily present in every conquered capital city.  Over time, the rulers of the Jochi ulus, which turned into a separate state - the Golden Horde, recalled them.  The reason was the frequent unrest of local residents and their dissatisfaction with the presence of strangers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baskaki in Russia" class="if" height="205" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/290489.jpg" width="230"></div>

Some historians believe that their main (and only) duty was to command large detachments, ensuring the timely collection of tribute and humility.  Other scholars claim that the Baskak is an official authorized by the khan who controlled the policy of the Russian princes.  Still others are of the opinion that the Basques did not have their own troops, but had the right, if necessary, to call a punitive detachment from the Horde.  Military reinforcements were called up in cases of disobedience, failure to pay taxes, and so on. </p><p>  Almost all scientists agree in one, although they do not find confirmation of this: the Baskak is a person who was involved in collecting tribute.  Most likely, he performed several functions and represented the interests of the supreme khan.  But it is reliably known that tribute was collected by individual people, farmers, who were appointed in Karakoram, the capital of the empire.  At the same time, the facts of the uprisings against the Basques are unknown, but the people were going to fight against tribunals of tribute more than once. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baskaki painting" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/290490.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It can be concluded that the Baskak is a significant figure in the history of the Russian lands, which, however, insulted the locals because it reminded them of the yoke.  And the very fact of the removal of these officials from the cities was rated as positive.  He testified that the influence of the Golden Horde on Russia weakened, and then completely disappeared.  But only time and new research will be able to put an end to the long-standing dispute of many scientists. </p>
