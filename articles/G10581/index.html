    <p>  History names two names of the authors of this work of art: Isidore of Miletus and Anthimius of Thrall.  These are immigrants from Asia, with whom nearly ten thousand workers worked. </p><p>  In 324, Constantine the Great founded the city of Constantinople in his honor, which became the new capital of his empire.  And two years later he gave the order to build the church of Hagia Sophia, which in Constantinople became the first monument of Byzantine architecture.  Of course, first of all, he was supposed to personify the greatness of the emperor, therefore, from all ends, gold, marble, silver, ivory, precious stones were brought here.  Everything that could come in handy for the new cathedral was exported from the surrounding <span>ancient temples</span> . </p><p>  The Hagia Sophia is built from completely new </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hagia Sophia" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/40089.jpg" width="525"></div>  material belts: lime made on barley water, cement with the addition of oil.  However, his luxury was in the use of precious stones - topazes, sapphires, rubies.  Even the floors were made of jasper and porphyry.  Chroniclers of those times called the temple "a wonderful sight, soaring up to heaven, full of sunshine as if light was radiated from within."

For the first time during construction, the dome was made with triangular arches: it is supported by four pillars, while it itself is formed of forty arches with windows.  The sun's rays, falling into them, create the illusion that the dome is floating in the air. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 13th century, the church of Hagia Sophia was badly damaged by the crusaders: part of its wealth was taken to Europe.  Nothing is still known about the fate of the golden altar, which was carried out from the sanctuary. </p><p>  In the 15th century, after the capture of the city by the Turks, the cathedral, at the behest of Mahmad Fatih, was turned into a mosque.  And since, according to Islamic laws, animals and people cannot be depicted on frescoes, all its walls were barbarously covered with lime, a crescent moon was installed instead of a cross and four minarets were completed.  Inside the church of Hagia Sophia, now called <span>Hagia Sophia,</span> was supplemented by tombs and a luxurious Sultan's bed, and the name of the prophet Muhammad and the first caliphs was displayed on gold on the shields. </p><p>  Miraculously, a mosaic with the figures of Mary and the baby was preserved above the entrance, </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Interior of the Hagia Sophia Temple" class="if" height="258" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/40091.jpg" width="383"></div>  Constantine and Justinian.

    <p>  Hagia Sophia has one attraction: inside there is a column called fogging.  According to legend, all sore spots in a person are immediately cured if they attach to it. </p><p>  In addition, the temple has a mystery: in one of its niches on the right side, a noise is constantly heard.  Legend has it that in the church about a thousand believers hid from the Turks, and when the invaders burst inside, the priest recited a prayer.  When the Janissaries raised their swords above the clergyman, the wall of the niche suddenly opened and pulled him inside.  They say that noise is the sound of the prayer of the priest who is waiting for the time when, finally, the church of Hagia Sophia will again become Christian, to go out and continue the service. </p>
