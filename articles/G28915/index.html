The coast of Italy from all sides caressed by the waves of five seas: Tyrrhenian, Ligurian, Adriatic, Ionian and Mediterranean.  Today we‚Äôll talk not just about this amazing country, but also about the wonderful <span>Park Hotel</span> Rimini 4 * <span>hotel</span> (Italy, Rimini). </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  The hotel in question, which attracts a large number of tourists every year, has a very convenient location.

    <p>  This hotel is also designed for those wishing to soak up the sea.  It has its own restaurant, a huge beach with sun loungers, awnings and umbrellas, entertainment venues and a sports hall.  It is known that a vacationer spends most of his time either on excursions or on site.  Therefore, the Park Hotel Rimini 4 * hotel provides everything you need for a dream vacation, something that allows you to relax by the pool with a cocktail and forget about everything in the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel Benefits </h2><p>  As we have repeatedly noticed, Park Hotel Rimini 4 * is a four-star hotel.  Is this its advantage or, rather, a disadvantage?  In fact, this is a question that does not have a clear answer.  Every tourist and traveler who often stays in expensive hotels has his own opinion on this.  In fact, the main difference between a 4 star hotel and a five star hotel is the price.  Four stars make this hotel much more affordable for the average tourist, especially if he is from Russia.  Accessible by no means worse.  Getting the last star is not so easy, but for any self-respecting hotel this is a very strong motivation.  It is this little star that will make it possible to raise prices, bring the hotel and brand to a new level, and in some cases even get certain preferences from the state.  Therefore, the level of service and service in four-star hotels is even better than in five-star hotels, since the administration of the institution does everything to quickly reach the same new level.  The Park Hotel Rimini 4 * is no exception. </p><p>  As for the differences, there are very few of them.  There is a certain regulation, which was adopted by an international organization that deals with the evaluation of hotels, according to which all hotels in any country in the world are assigned a certain number of stars.  So the fifth star is the observance of trifles: a canopy over the entrance, waiting time for the elevator, the number of tables in the restaurant, the quality of the flooring or the cleaning time in the room.  The average guest is not aware of all these differences, since they are completely insignificant.  So if it is unprincipled for you to wait for the elevator, not 27, but 30 seconds (roughly speaking), then the Park Hotel Rimini 4 * in Rimini (Italy) was created for you. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The hotel in question in this article is located almost in the very center of the city, in close proximity to the sea and the beach.  Not far from here is the exhibition complex, which constantly hosts some events and interesting exhibitions, as well as a conference room.  The hotel itself is a low building, very stylishly decorated both inside and out.  Directly in front of the hotel is its own large swimming pool, where you can relax in the event of a storm at sea or if you come in low season, but really want to swim.  Here is a wonderful garden with incredibly beautiful compositions and relic plants that create a special microclimate and have a healing effect. </p>

    <p>  Of course, many potential guests may be concerned about the question: what are the prices?  Park Hotel <span>Rimini in Rimini</span> (Italy) is not the most expensive hotel.  If you translate the room rate into rubles, then it will cost from 3 to 20 thousand.  It all depends on the room category, view, food, desired service, number of guests, season and additional services.  From all this the final price is formed.  It is also worth remembering that early booking may be more profitable, because, as a rule, hotels offer discounts for those who buy a room for six months or another long period of time. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  As already mentioned, this hotel is a small and cozy oasis in the very center of a typical Italian resort town.  There are only 65 rooms.  All hotel rooms, including rooms, have recently been completely renovated.  In total, the hotel has several categories of rooms: standards, suites, VIP-class rooms.  Separately, it should be said about the Park Hotel Rimini 4 * Balcony rooms in Rimini, which, as the name implies, have their own balcony.  These are spacious rooms with their own small terrace and incredibly beautiful sea views.  All rooms, regardless of their category and area, are equipped with the latest technology: there is satellite TV, all the necessary equipment, a bathroom, hairdryer, air conditioning, safe, minibar, and a reliable pass system.  A separate highlight is the new exclusive furniture made to order from eminent Italian manufacturers.  Quality and a high level are traced in absolutely everything, and it immediately catches the eye. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="park hotel rimini 4 rimini reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58579/2054230.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  The hotel territory corresponds to the whole complex and is a real oasis island.  The paths paved with Italian stone, alpine hills, flower arrangements, coniferous plantings and carefully thought-out landscape design make this place truly cozy and attractive.  It has its own beach area with sun loungers and a warm pool.  Among other things, the hotel has dry cleaning, bike and car rental, parking, security, solarium, spa area, table tennis and 2 excellent restaurants: an American-style bar and the main large Regina restaurant, whose panoramic windows open directly onto the beach side and look at the Mediterranean Sea. </p>
