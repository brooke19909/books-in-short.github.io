  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Anomalous zones of Moscow and Moscow region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There is an opinion that the capital of Russia is literally teeming with such zones in which a person cannot fully live, work, and just be.  Such areas are called abnormal zones.  It is believed that they are formed as a result of the fracture of several tectonic plates on which cities stand and in the hollows of which wide and mighty rivers flow. </p><h2>  Why are abnormal zones dangerous? </h2><p>  Living near such places or directly at their epicenter, each person feels their influence on himself.  Often people complain of dizziness, apathy, weakness and nausea, a sharp decrease in performance.  It is dangerous to live in such places, because as a result of this, a person can sharply fall ill with serious ailments, sometimes even fatal. </p><h2>  Geopathogenic areas in Moscow </h2><p>  Some areas of Moscow in anomalous zones are considered the most dangerous for living.  One of them is the central part of the metropolis, located at the junction of river flows.  Inside this zone, as many as 5 <span>underground rivers flow,</span> originating in one place.  According to scientists, an extremely high concentration of negative energy was found in the Okhotny Ryad district, the Yugo-Zapadnaya metro station, not far from the Akademicheskaya metro station, near the State Duma department, at the Rechnoy Vokzal station, and also in Belyaevo and Khoroshevsky district .  As for the Moscow Zoological Park, it is known that this place is considered a real energy funnel, and the behavior of animals and visitors here causes mixed feelings.  Below will be listed the most dangerous anomalous zones of Moscow and black spots that are not worth visiting even out of great curiosity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Elk Island - a funnel into the unknown </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1672627" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/1672627.jpg?1540568861"></div><p>  A good example of the presence of an anomaly is a park called Elk Island.  Here, like the Bermuda Triangle, people disappear, and after returning to a state of complete amnesia.  Despite the most beautiful landscapes and landscape, in these places you can not hear the singing of birds, and people always go around this territory per kilometer. </p><p>  Very remarkable is the case of the disappearance of not one person in this park, but a whole group of 15 people and equipped with all means of communication with the outside world and excellent navigation.  On this day, the company was busy completing the orienteering quest, and unfortunately, it was not possible to establish the reason for the disappearance of all members of the group.  It is known that before the departure the group underwent a thorough briefing. </p><p>  Many scientists put forward the assumption that in this place even <span>time travel is</span> possible <span>,</span> but, anyway, it is not possible to confirm this with documentation and facts.  Today, scientists can only wait for new facts. </p><h2>  Patriarch's Ponds </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1672625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/1672625.jpg?1540568861"></div><p>  Extremely strange events take place on Malaya Bronnaya Street and Patriarch's Ponds.  According to some reports, these are the most terrible and terrible anomalous zones of Moscow.  Rumor has it that at night you can see various ghosts and entities, and especially sensitive people often experience panic attacks and fainting.  Failures here literally follow on the heels and motorists.  For example, according to one driver, in the same territory, his car crashed twice, and ominous black smoke poured from the engine.  These were not just puffs of smoke that had no shape; on the contrary, smoke took on a human shape.  Although this motorist considered himself a staunch atheist, he still dared to turn to a scientific institute, after which the professors began to examine in detail this area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As a result of the experiments, it turned out that the fears were not groundless, and this territory can safely be included in the list of anomalous zones of the capital.  As the locals said, in the past there were cemeteries, which over time were simply flooded.  The mystics and doctors are echoing, saying that people walking in this place, for no reason, had heart attacks, sometimes even leading to sudden death.  Perhaps such sudden bouts of heart failure appeared only because people saw ghosts that they were not mentally prepared to meet with. </p><h2>  Kutuzovsky Prospekt - the place of death of thousands of people </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1672646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/1672646.jpg?1540568861"></div><p>  Geopathogenic and anomalous zones of Moscow are represented by another unusual place.  Kutuzov burial, according to experts, is another rather strong pathogenic zone.  According to statistics, the largest number of traffic accidents occur here.  This territory, without any doubt, can be recognized as dangerous.  Every year, a huge number of perfectly serviceable cars are crashed on the road, while drivers never drive while intoxicated, and it is not possible to find another significant reason for all the accidents that occur.  It is noteworthy that the type of accidents that occur here are mainly frontal collisions.  According to many historians, this anomalous zone was formed due to the demolition of an ancient cemetery and the construction of a busy highway on this site.  Presumably, car owners see supposedly living people in the middle of the road and, trying to dodge the collision, fall into the oncoming lane, from where they no longer get out alive.  Of course, this information is very difficult to believe, but the fact, unfortunately, remains a fact. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The anomalous zones of Moscow and the <span>Moscow region</span> have become the subject of detailed research. </p><h2>  The village of Lytkarino.  Is the local elite so carefree? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1672623" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/1672623.jpg?1540568861"></div><p>  Another ‚Äúterritory of the devil‚Äù is the elite village of Lytkarino near Moscow, where, despite external calm, suicides occur almost weekly.  The fact that devilry is involved here can only be understood by the shape of centuries-old shrubs and trees growing there.  They grow in such a way that a cross-shaped crack forms in the trunk, causing terror in one look.  At the same time, the trunks grow not as usual, but parallel to the ground. </p><p>  The indigenous inhabitants of Lytkarino claim that the cause of the formation of an anomalous zone in this place is a disturbance in the peace of the dead and a boorish attitude towards tombstones and gravestones.  It is also known that during the Soviet Union, tombstones and monuments belonging to dead people were used by the authorities to build new multi-unit housing.  Is it true or false that dead people are paying for the misconduct of the living, it is impossible to find out, but from the fact of abuse of the holy concepts it becomes truly scary and disgusting. </p><p>  These are far from all the anomalous zones of Moscow and Moscow Region, about which whole legends compose. </p><h2>  Sertyakino - a real temporary portal </h2><p>  The village of Sertyakino is known for the fact that instant teleportations in time and space occur on its territory with enviable constancy.  People move very close, only 2-3 kilometers from the location.  Such cases have occurred repeatedly, and one man has teleported twice already.  Even the forest in the vicinity of Sertyakino cannot be called ordinary, because the trees growing on this territory always have spiral branches.  If you want to tickle your nerves, getting to the Sertyakino anomalous zone is very simple, just go by car along Simferopolskoye Shosse to Aleksandrovka, turn right to Klimovsk, and after reaching the village, turn to the Western point of Sertyakino, drive about 3 kilometers and turn into the thicket of the forest.  If you decide to take the electric train, you will need to get from the Kursk station to the Grivno station, after which you walk 3 kilometers on foot towards the West and 1 kilometer towards this forest. </p><h2>  Catoire - Alien Landing Site </h2><p>  The Catoire zone is characterized by the fact that, according to the stories of local residents, traces of the landing of <span>unidentified flying objects</span> on the ground can be regularly observed <span>.</span>  As you know from the stories of local patrons, very close to the railway station visible to the naked eye traces of the presence of UFOs.  Flying saucers are visualized as luminous balls, and some of the inhabitants even could see the aliens themselves in silver clothes.  The forest of this place, where residents periodically meet the goblin, is also notorious.  It is not difficult to find some anomalous zones of Moscow and the Moscow region.  So it‚Äôs very easy to get to this place by car, just turn off the Moscow ring road and drive about 29 kilometers along Dmitrovskoye Shosse. </p><h2>  Jesters stone </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1672633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/1672633.jpg?1540568861"></div><p>  Not all anomalous zones of Moscow, photos and descriptions of which are presented in this article, are notorious.  Jesters stone, unlike all the above zones, has a sharply positive aura and is even able to heal many diseases and heal immobilized people.  Water, which is collected in local lakes and sprinkled with stone, is required to wash a sick person with good wishes, after which an immediate cure will follow.  The stone is still very popular among tourists to this day, it is for this reason that a real path leading to this miraculous place is equipped in the forest.  Despite the marshland where the Shutovsky forest grows, this stone not only does not sink, but even periodically changes its location.  <span>True</span> or not, alas, it is impossible to verify.  You can get here as follows: you need to drive Rogachevsky highway by car, having reached Klusov, turn right and drive in the direction until the road turns left.  After that, you need to leave the car in the parking lot and walk about 150 meters to the destination. </p><h2>  The anomalous zone is located at 47 km of the Yaroslavl highway </h2><p>  This area is remarkable for its huge accumulation of unidentified flying objects in the shape of triangles. </p><p>  During the existence of the USSR, there was a rather curious case when a fighter sent to track an object did not reach the target, and the humanoids on the fabulous shuttle hid in an unknown direction.  This territory has won a huge stream of attention in the years 80-90, but to this day remains the subject of controversy among ufologists.  Oddly enough, but at the moment on the territory of the anomaly, you can find huge <span>campgrounds.</span> </p><p>  Professional ufologists can tell with great joy about UFOs, about the angle from which to look at them, and so on.  You can get there very easily, having reached 47 kilometers of the Yaroslavl highway.  By minibus you can get to Sergiev Posad. </p><h2>  Protasovsky district </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1672622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/1672622.jpg?1540568861"></div><p>  Protasovskaya anomalous zone is located between 3 villages, namely Protasovo, Ogudnevo and Dushonovo.  It is noteworthy in this place that in the distant 1990, on April 30, a UFO of a strange quadrangular shape sat there.  After the alien ship left the earth, it left traces of a triangular shape, which, according to the inhabitants of this place, are still visible.  This is not the only case of aliens invading the land of this village, because ufologists are still on duty there at night and in the daytime.  Getting to your destination directly is very easy, you just have to go along the Shchelkovo highway and then, having passed the New Town, move towards the Fryantsevsky highway.  It‚Äôs much more convenient to travel by electric train, since you just need to get from Yaroslavsky Train Station to Fryazin and catch a bus to Fryanova, after a bit of driving, you can get off at Protasov. </p><h2>  Shushmore - an ideal place for ceremonies </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1672626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39274/1672626.jpg?1540568861"></div><p>  The Shushmor tract is famous for the fact that nearby, in the Shatursky district of the Moscow region, there is an ancient place for pagan rituals and sacrifices.  This wonderful structure is made of granite and has a spherical shape.  The diameter of the structure is approximately 6 meters, and carved columns with the image of plots significant for residents surround it.  It is likely that these very pillars in antiquity played the role of the sacrificial.  In bygone times, Peter Semenov-Tian-Shansky mentioned this place. </p><p>  The most terrible anomalous zones of Moscow must be visited with extreme caution.  Firstly, you should not go here alone.  Secondly, you need to tell all relatives where to look for you if necessary.  Thirdly, you must have a fully charged phone, a flashlight, matches and a compass with you. </p>
