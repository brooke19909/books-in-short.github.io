History</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How many of us did not ask ourselves in childhood: why the seas were called White, Yellow and Red?  After all, even kids know that water has a color from azure to deep blue, so the strange names of the seas do not go out of their heads for a long time.  But over time, curiosity runs out, and the information received once is forgotten.  Today we decided to recall why the White Sea was called the White.  And also talk about the origin of the names of some other seas on our planet. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the white sea was called white" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/1787280.jpg" width="502"></div></h2><h2>  Location of the White Sea on a geographical map </h2><p>  This pond is one of the smallest washing the territory of our country.  It is located in the north of the European part of the Russian Federation.  It is interesting that the sea, on the one hand, cuts very deep into the land, but on the other hand, it belongs to the Arctic Ocean basin.  The fact that most of the reservoir extends beyond the Arctic Circle and is cut into land affects the fact that the White Sea is rightly called the warmest of all the northern waters of our country. </p><h2>  Short description of the White Sea </h2><p>  Hydrologists consider this reservoir to be very interesting, because the bottom topography here is heterogeneous, which makes the water area unique and one of a kind.  There are a lot of islands in the White Sea, the most famous are the Solovetsky Islands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Scientists divide the water area into several parts: </p><ul><li>  pool (it is the deepest); </li><li>  throat (narrow part connecting to the Barents Sea); </li><li>  funnel; </li><li>  lips - Mezenskaya, Dvinskaya and Onega; </li><li>  <span>Kandalaksha Bay.</span> </li></ul><p>  Interestingly, the climate within the White Sea combines several features: </p><ul><li>  sea; </li><li>  continental; </li><li>  oceanic </li><li>  mainland. </li></ul><p>  All of the above facts make the flora and fauna of this water area unique.  But they do not provide an opportunity to answer the question of why the White Sea was called the White.  Therefore, we will continue to search for truthful information in subsequent sections of the article. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="white sea why so called" class="if" height="248" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1787074.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The first annalistic mentions of the White Sea </h2><p>  If you are interested in why the White Sea was called the White Sea, history and chronicles will help you find information that shed light on this topic.  Scientists claim that for the first time about the northern body of water was mentioned in the eleventh century.  Novgorod merchants very quickly appreciated the possibilities of developing trade through the White Sea, in addition, these lands were rich in fur-bearing animals, and water - in fish.  All together began to attract people here, so the coastal areas began to develop rapidly. </p><p>  In the fourteenth century, the first large settlement was formed - Kholmogory, which served as an international port.  Merchants equipped from here numerous merchant ships to Denmark for two centuries.  But foreigners first entered the White Sea only in the sixteenth century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From that moment, trade between England and Russia began to develop along this waterway, and further trade relations were established with other foreign powers. </p>

    <p>  But over time, the White Sea (which, incidentally, was not yet the White Sea) lost its significance on the northern waterway.  The construction of St. Petersburg has significantly reduced the attractiveness of this region for traders.  Most merchant ships began to sail through the Baltic. </p><p>  Perhaps you ask, where is the answer to the question of why the White Sea was called the White Sea?  Facts and information on this subject we will provide.  Do not rush. </p><h2>  White Sea: why it is called and when </h2><p>  Scientists know that until the seventeenth century, the reservoir changed several names.  At one time he was called Studeny, and this is not surprising.  Indeed, for more than six months a year, the sea is completely covered with ice, and life around it freezes.  This was one of the main reasons for the transfer of the northern trade route to the Baltic waters.  After all, six months is a very big break in trade, during which many profitable offers and opportunities are lost. </p><p>  Sometimes the sea was called Solovetsky in honor of the largest islands in its basin.  Historians know the mention of this sea as the North.  This is due to its location and characteristics, because the reservoir is located in the most severe place of our country. </p><p>  In some annals it is noted that the sea was called Calm.  And this was also a very accurate description of it - it is difficult to expect storms and storms when more than six months the water is frozen in ice.  But still, why was the White Sea called the White?  And when did this happen?  In this regard, scientists have only one version. </p><p>  Near the end of the sixteenth century, the North Sea acquired two well-established names.  The Scandinavians called it - Gandvik (Bay of Monsters), and the Slavs - White.  On old maps, there is one and another designation.  But still, after a hundred years in use, only the Slavic name remained - the White Sea.  Under it, the reservoir fell on all the geographical maps of that time and retained its name to this day. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the white sea was called white story" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1787089.jpg" width="400"></div></h2><h2>  Why was the White Sea called White? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, in the scientific world there is no unity about the origin of the name of the White Sea.  Nowhere in the annals of sources this fact is not reflected, but each of the following versions is quite viable in itself, and all of them together: </p><ul><li>  The name is donated by ice.  Since for more than six months the sea is in icy shackles, it looks like a solid white stripe.  It is not surprising that our ancestors characterized the sea by the color that it has most of the year. </li><li>  Reflection of the sky.  Many hydrologists claim that even in summer the color of the White Sea water has a milky hue.  The northern sky reflected in the pond is of the same color.  Therefore, they began to call it in honor of the shade that is so characteristic of these places. </li><li>  <span>The value is white.</span>  Despite the fact that this version cannot be confirmed, for many it seems plausible.  For people, each color carries certain information.  For example, red symbolizes beauty, but white is a divine principle.  In the north, according to many scientists, was the ancestral home of all Slavs - the country of Hyperborea.  Its inhabitants were endowed with numerous talents, abilities and knowledge.  This allowed the Hyperboreans to become the most powerful people on the planet.  But as a result of natural disasters, their country perished, but the sea was called White in memory of their ancestors. </li></ul><p>  It is not known which of the versions is the most truthful, but everyone can choose from them the one that more closely matches his worldview.  But what do we know about other seas?  How did their names form? </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why the white sea was called white facts" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/1787075.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Red, Black and Yellow Seas: Origin of Names </h2><p>  No less interesting are the stories of other famous seas of the planet.  For example, the Black Sea got its name due to hydrogen sulfide, which is rich in its depths.  Even in ancient times, sailors noticed that almost any object that has been in the water for a long time is covered with a dense black coating. </p><p>  There are several hypotheses about the origin of the name of the Red Sea: </p><ul><li>  The sea waters are rich in microscopic algae, which at certain intervals acquire a brown color.  During this period, sea water resembles blood in color. </li><li>  Some scientists claim that the name of the sea was given by the rocks that surround it.  They have a brown color and a bright red tint at the break. </li><li>  Another hypothesis about the name of the sea is associated with the biblical Moses.  Indeed, according to history, leading the Jews out of Egypt, he managed to push the waters of the Red Sea and expose its bottom, along which all the Jews crossed to that shore.  But the Egyptian soldiers were buried under the thickness of the water when, at the command of Moses, it closed over their heads.  At this moment, the waters of the sea turned <span>brown with</span> the blood of the dead.  Since then, the name of the reservoir was assigned to him. </li></ul><p>  The Yellow Sea has very clay shores, therefore, periodically, eroding from the tides, they color the water in a yellow tint.  Ancient people noticed this and gave the sea an appropriate name. </p><p>  On our land, there are many places with unusual names that sometimes open up an interesting history of the land and water bodies here. </p>
