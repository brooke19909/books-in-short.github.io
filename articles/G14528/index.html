It all depends on the imagination of the master.  Each needlewoman at least once tried to use this material for their products. </p><h2>  Beadwork Methods </h2><p>  To create bead figures, wire is most often used.  It should be so thin as to go inside the ball at least 2-3 times.  There are many different ways to lower beads and beads.  Schemes and patterns, the lessons in the photo often look very confusing and incomprehensible.  There are times when different techniques for performing figures can look very similar.  In finished crafts, it is not always visible how exactly the material was located in the process of weaving. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="parallel lowering" class="if" height="473" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1922829.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The most famous weaving methods are: </p><ul><li>  parallel lowering; </li><li>  brick stitch; </li><li>  weaving with a cross; </li><li>  technique "canvas". </li></ul><p>  A popular type of needlework is embroidery and knitting with beads.  Of these elements, you can create crafts.  Patterns for them look similar to patterns for embroidery and knitting, with the difference that at the final stage there is the formation of three-dimensional figures.  Such products are most often created using the parallel lowering technique. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To create a bead, monofilament or fishing line is used as the basis, and not wire.  Strength bead gives the bead itself.  In workshops with parallel lowering beads, one of the basic options for creating a product is usually described. </p><p>  At each step of weaving, a certain amount of material is added and a series is obtained.  The process of creating a product often seems complicated, but usually it‚Äôs enough to master a few basic techniques to try to make a decoration or a toy.  You can start with parallel lowering or lowering by arcs, weaving loops or a chain.  Those who want to create sophisticated beadwork should study and try several different methods.  Then the master will be able to freely change the weaving technique right in the process, focusing on the pattern. </p><h2>  Parallel weaving </h2><p>  Parallel lowering with beads looks simple, but requires a careful approach.  There are several ways to weave this method, depending on the materials used. </p><p>  To weave animal figures in a parallel lowering, a wire is used that can hold a row or a circle of beads.  Such crafts will be strong and heavy.  Even a beginner in beadwork can master this technique, because the tension of the wire is not able to spoil the shape of the product, as is the case with fishing line or monofilament.  Parallel lowering with beads is more convenient to use for creating flat figures, but it can also be used for voluminous crafts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="parallel lowering with beads" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1922831.jpg" width="337"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are two main ways of parallel weaving: </p><ul><li>  stringing a number of immediately; </li><li>  weaving each bead separately. </li></ul><p>  In the first embodiment, the required amount of beads is strung onto the wire according to the scheme, and then each row is attached to the previous one.  In the second case, each ball is attached separately to the same bead in the previous row.  This method makes bulk bead toys.  Most often, an additional frame is used to give the products the necessary strength. </p><h2>  Brick stitch </h2><p>  Products created in brick technology look unusual and are often irregular in shape.  This method of beadwork has little to do with parallel lowering and is most often used to create jewelry, flowers and various decor. </p><p>  It can be used for weaving complex elements, with full confidence that the product will not crumble when damaged.  The material for this method should be perfectly smooth and high quality.  For weaving using the technique of brick stitch, all beads must be the same size. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="parallel beading master class" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1922832.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Weaving is carried out as follows: </p><ol><li>  Two beads are placed on the fishing line and passed through the central part of both so that a loop is formed that needs to be tightened. </li><li>  Then the next bead is strung and the end of the line is brought down through the previous bead. </li><li>  The tip of the fishing line is placed in a new ball and so continue the row. </li><li>  The second row is obtained using two beads, which are collected on a fishing line, and then they pass its tip under the loop between the beads of the first row, output through the first one and tighten the knot. </li><li>  The following beads are strung through nodules in the bottom row, passing through the center of an adjacent ball. </li></ol><p>  With proper weaving, the resulting product will resemble a brick wall. </p><h2>  Cross weaving </h2><p>  This method of weaving is also called monastic.  This is one of the basic techniques for working with beads.  Most often it is used to create jewelry and accessories.  For stringing material used fishing line or monofilament.  You will also need bead needles.  One or two can be used, but experienced needlewomen prefer to weave a chain with a single needle. </p><p>  Work begins with a set of 4 beads that need to be closed in a ring by threading a needle through the first, second and third ball.  Then 4 more beads are collected and the needle is inserted into the fourth ball of the previous row.  The link in the form of a cross should turn out.  A needle is inserted into its upper part, and weaving continues to the desired length of the chain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="parallel lowering or lowering by arcs" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1922830.jpg" width="279"></div>

    <h2>  Technique "canvas" </h2><p>  The technique of "linen" is often called "weaving" and is of two types: weaving on the machine and manual weaving.  This way you can create jewelry, belts and even paintings.  <span>Bead products</span> made in this way are dense, and each ball is connected to another. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="parallel lowering or lowering by arcs" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/1922828.jpg" width="373"></div>

    <p>  First, several beads are strung - their exact number depends on the size of the bracelet.  Then another ball is collected and the thread is threaded through the previous bead.  By repeating these steps, a series is formed. </p><p>  Having mastered the main techniques, you can begin to create products to your taste and delight loved ones with unusual gifts. </p>
