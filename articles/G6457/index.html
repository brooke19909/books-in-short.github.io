    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Quattro Beach Spa Resort will be able to please tourists with a wonderful vacation, favorable climate and affordable price.  The price of a tour to this magnificent five-star hotel depends on the category of apartments.  For five-day accommodation, meals, flights, transfers and insurance, you will have to pay from 19,300 rubles per person. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The Quattro Beach Resort Spa provides great opportunities for a comfortable stay, enjoying the warm waters of the Mediterranean and the gentle sunshine.  Guest reviews about the hotel are mostly positive, but negative ones can also be found.  However, this fact is characteristic of almost all new, recently opened hotels. </p><p>  Tourists note magnificent, clean and spacious rooms, beautiful interior decoration, modern infrastructure, good food in a variety of restaurants and bars, a large number of sun loungers and awnings.  Many emphasized the fact that you can always find a free place, which not all hotel complexes can boast of.  A well-groomed territory and a beautiful garden, a wide range of entertainment for children, and the presence of Russian-speaking staff deserve special praise. </p>

    <p>  As for the negative comments, they all boil down to the following points: inconvenient location of the hotel (considerable distance from the airport), poor entry into the sea from the coast, many plates and stone fragments, the ability to swim only from the pier, a small number of rooms with good views, poor insulation in apartments, a small inland area, poor animation program. </p><p>  Nevertheless, judging by the responses of the majority, the Quattro Beach Resort Spa Hotel can provide a wonderful vacation at affordable prices.  It is perfect for a calm and measured family vacation with small children, to enjoy the wellness spa-procedures, as well as for a variety of presentations and business meetings. </p>
