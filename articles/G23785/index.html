So you want to be irresistible!  So you want to see admiring glances on your figure and hear enthusiastic sighs behind your back.  Although a rare woman openly admits this. </p><p>  But don‚Äôt!  You just need to crochet a swimsuit, such ... Well, that all - all the men who met on the way fall and stack themselves by stacks, like this!  So, pick up a crochet hook, cotton thread and - for the cause.  <span>Crocheted knitted swimwear</span> is the first step on the podium of the ‚ÄúMiss Beach Season 2012‚Äù. </p><p>  First you should decide on the model of your bathing suit.  Crocheted swimwear can be separate, consisting of a bra and swimming trunks - bikini.  <span>Separate swimsuits</span> are also more closed.  Then the bra is like a short topic, and panties - like small shorts. </p><p>  Many ladies prefer <span>closed swimwear.</span>  Especially such models are suitable for women with a problematic figure or stretch marks on their stomachs.  Crocheted Swimwear <strong> </strong>  so good that they help to perfectly hide all the flaws, but at the same time emphasize the dignity of the figure. </p><p>  For example, closed swimwear can be performed by a technique of combining types of knitting.  By making the cups and the bottom tight, the part that is located directly on the stomach can be made with openwork knitting.  It is very beautiful when heat is crocheted at this place - a bird with a loose tail or a beautiful large flower. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, marine themes are in fashion in models of summer clothes.  Why not crocheted <span>knitted swimwear</span> in this style?  The marine theme can be expressed in the fact that swimwear is made striped using two colors: blue and white.  Some women go even further, using many different details in the model: octopuses, colorful fish, algae, jellyfish.  These small details after their implementation are laid out on a pattern, pinned with sewing pins and then connected to each other using an air chain of a neutral pale color resembling the color of water (blue or sea water), sometimes skin color (light beige or cream). </p><p>  The difficulty in manufacturing such models lies in the fact that the pattern can in no way give the opportunity to form the bulges on the chest properly.  Therefore, the needlewoman is forced to either constantly try on the product for herself or use the half-mannequins, which are often used by clothing sellers in the market.  Also suitable for these purposes are plastic cups designed to be inserted into the bodice of swimwear. </p><p>  How to tie a swimsuit?  Consider the simplest model that even a beginner can do.  To do this, you should connect two convex triangles - cups of the bodice with a normal single crochet or with one crochet, connect them in front with the corners.  To the remaining free corners, tie ribbons, which consist of two rows: an air chain of the required length and one row of single crochet posts. </p><p>  Swimming trunks have a pattern resembling an hourglass pattern.  Moreover, young people can make the smallest triangles so that they are tied on the sides.  Older ladies can think through this moment and make the side joints more modest. </p><p>  Swimwear looks gorgeous, in which the connection places of the parts (side on the panties and the connection of the cups in the front) are made using large rings.  Details are fixed to the rings with a regular sewing needle, thereby releasing another part of the body, which remains open to the warm sunshine and gentle men's glances. </p><p>  Rings can be bought in special stores or you can use plastic rings from baby's nipples - soothers, having removed unnecessary bulges from them.  You can also use <span>crocheted flowers</span> or butterflies to decorate, which should then be sewn on top of the product. </p><p>  And now, when the swimsuit is ready, boldly put it on and go out to charm, seduce, drive you crazy and just - with pleasure relax in the open air! </p>
