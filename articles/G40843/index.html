    <p>  How to charge iPhone 5S for the first time: </p><ul><li>  as soon as you pull your gadget out of the box, connect it to the memory for at least three hours; </li><li>  if the battery indicator is 100% full, you can safely use the device until the battery is completely discharged; </li><li>  after the device turns off, leave the iPhone alone for about two to three hours; </li><li>  after the specified time has passed, reconnect the phone to the charger and again wait until it is charged to 100%. </li></ul><p>  It is also worth noting one important nuance in the question: "How to properly charge iPhone 5S for the first time?"  During the first recharge cycle, you should never use the gadget, otherwise the new battery will begin to ‚Äúsag‚Äù and lose even a very small, but such an important amount of battery.  In addition, before properly charging the new iPhone 5S, that is, according to the above instructions, make sure that the charging place excludes any sources of moisture (bathrooms, vases with water, aquariums, etc.) and direct sunlight.  That is, in fact, everything that can adversely affect the first cycle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Charge at night or not? </h2><p>  In order to really figure out how to properly charge an iPhone 5S and leave it overnight, you need to clearly understand what exactly happens with our gadget after connecting to a charger. </p>

    <p>  It should be noted right away that, as in most other similar cases, the charging controller is responsible for the power supply process of the device, or in another way - the power management module.  This controller is directly related to the indication of the battery capacity, that is, it does not allow recharging the gadget and at the same time tries to fill the volume up to 100% faster in a reasonable amount of time.  It should also be noted that the first 80% of the battery capacity is filled up quite quickly, and the next 20% in gentle mode, that is, noticeably slower. </p><p>  After the battery is fully charged, the power management module cuts off the power supply without picking up and transferring charge to it.  The gadget itself will work at this time from the network, that is, in this case, the battery does not charge and does not discharge.  Keep this in mind before properly charging your iPhone 5S. </p><h2>  Features of continuous charging </h2><p>  Many become hostages to the myths that after reaching a 100% <span>charge</span> indication <span>, the battery</span> starts to work cyclically, discharging and recharging.  In fact, this is not so, otherwise it would lead to significant battery wear, which neither the manufacturer nor, of course, the user was clearly satisfied with. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Further, another fact in the question of how to properly charge iPhone 5S.  Surely every owner of a mobile gadget knows that any battery is subject to a self-discharge process.  And this is quite normal, if, of course, at this time it is not connected to the memory.  For lithium-polymer batteries, with which fifth iPhones are equipped, this indicator fluctuates within 5% per month, which is extremely small when compared with other types and types of batteries. </p><h2>  Charge cycle </h2><p>  The power management module periodically checks the remaining battery capacity, and if it encounters a significant loss of charge, it starts a new power-up cycle.  This need arises after the loss of at least 2% of the charge, and this does not happen more often than once every two weeks.  That is, if you forget your gadget connected to the network for a whole month, the controller will start recharging the battery once or twice. </p>

    <p>  Taking into account all of the above, we can safely conclude on how to properly charge iPhone 5S, and that leaving the gadget all night connected to the network, you absolutely risk nothing and do not damage the battery. </p><h2>  Power adapters </h2><p>  A standard charger (5V, 1A, 5W) will fully charge your gadget in about an hour and a half.  There is nothing to add about branded "apple" adapters - they are made with high quality, honestly and rarely break. </p><p>  Some ask a very interesting and quite logical question: ‚ÄúIs it possible to charge your iPhone 5S with charging from an iPad?‚Äù  Yes you can.  Some especially zealous admirers and commentators on specialized forums immediately parry that this is extremely harmful for the phone‚Äôs battery for one reason or another, but let's figure it out in order. </p>

    <p>  Firstly, on the official (!) Apple resource there is a corresponding topic, where it is written in black and white: ‚ÄúDespite the fact that the charger is designed for iPad, you can also charge it with any model of iPhone or iPod.‚Äù  And such a moment in the text is clearly not present in order to cash in on users by selling them new batteries. </p><h2>  Myths </h2><p>  Yes, there are no more myths that charging your iPhones with adapters from iPads is more than enough.  Such a procedure supposedly completely kills the batteries of the phones, significantly reducing the battery capacity.  Experts in this field (which you just need to listen to) unanimously assure that this is not so. </p><p>  Remember that the charger, as we used to call it, with which we feed the phone, is not a charger at all, no matter how puny it sounds.  This is the most common DC power adapter.  The phone's charging module is located in the gadget itself and represents the same power controller that was mentioned above.  It is this module that determines what kind of current to direct to the battery. </p><h2>  Chinese power adapters </h2><p>  <span>Chargers</span> from the Middle Kingdom should not be considered.  Almost all experts unanimously advise against using Chinese power adapters due to their dubious quality.  They just can completely ruin your battery. </p>

    <p>  Literally all field tests showed that the actual characteristics of Chinese chargers are significantly different from the declared ones.  Of course, due to the cheapness of these adapters, the temptation to buy is very high, but you will often remember these couple of paragraphs when your iPhone stops charging, so it‚Äôs better not to risk and stop at branded ‚Äúapple‚Äù memories. </p><h2>  Car adapters </h2><p>  In general, all car chargers are evil for your gadget.  You can use them only in the most extreme cases, because the risk of completely ruining your battery is very high. </p><p>  The thing is that the car power system is far from the standard for the stability of current and voltage, and the memory devices that we see on the shelves of car shops are simply not able to protect your iPhone from electrical surges.  Car adapters can easily disable the power management module of your phone, which in the best case will affect the charging time, and in the worst case, a complete refusal to power the gadget even with a proprietary charger from a standard 220 V network. </p>
