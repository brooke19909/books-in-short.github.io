  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Original do-it-yourself origami tree</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On the eve of the winter holiday, everyone is striving to decorate the house.  One of the main New Year‚Äôs attributes is the Christmas tree.  A green beauty is unlikely to surprise anyone, but a Christmas tree from origami modules is a rarity. </p><p>  Those who are familiar with the origami technique and know how its main element, the module, is formed, can safely undertake the manufacture of such a unique decoration.  However, modular origami (Christmas tree) is a painstaking task and will require a lot of patience from you.  Although to make such a forest beauty yourself is not at all difficult. </p><p>  Your tree <span>from origami modules</span> can have a wide variety of shapes and sizes.  Moreover, twigs can be used to compose a wide variety of New Year's compositions, and besides this, snowflakes, Santa Claus, and a snowman can be made from modules and supplement with them. </p><p>  Your origami tree can be made of modules of one or two colors.  I used modules made of 38 mm rectangles for my Christmas tree.  at 60mm.  Although the sizes can be absolutely any. </p><p>  Our <span>modular origami</span> tree will consist of 637 modules.  Of these, 391 modules are made of dark green paper, and 246 modules are made of light green paper.  Therefore, for starters, it is necessary to assemble the required number of triangular modules, and only after that proceed to assembly.  Our origami tree will consist of separate branches.  Let's start collecting the first one. </p><ol><li>  For a branch, you need to take two modules with the long side up and insert the two near corners into both pockets of another module.  So the first rows of our twig will be composed. <br>  The first row should consist of two modules, and the second one.  In the event that you plan to make short branches, then their beginning can be assembled from only one module, and for long ones it is better to start with two modules, as this will facilitate further assembly. </li><li>  For the third row, it is necessary to put on 2 more modules at the corners of the module of the previous row.  Corners need to be inserted into pockets located close to each other.  This will allow the outer corners to stick around on the sides in the form of needles. </li><li>  Further, the branch will be collected according to the same principle, based on the alternation of the number of modules in subsequent rows - then two, then one module. </li><li>  It is advisable to make 12 rows of modules of dark green color, and finish the twig with two rows made of light modules.  It is worth noting that, when assembling the branches, the modules do not need to be very deeply and firmly put on each other.  They hold much better if the modules are not fully worn, and the assembled branch is periodically compressed from the sides.  The main pressure is done at the junction points.  The assembled twig needs to be slightly bent, simulating the bending of the branches of a real tree. </li><li>  Next, we perform the lateral processes.  We collect a small twig, consisting of only five rows. </li><li>  We retreat from the beginning of the finished branch into three ‚Äúneedles‚Äù and put on the next needles two small side branches. </li><li>  For the bottom row, you need to make 5 of these branches, consisting of 35 modules each.  To connect them, you need to take the module and insert into the nearest pockets.  Thus, we connect in order all the branches and lock them in a ring. </li><li>  Next, you need to make an intermediate ring, thereby dividing the rows between the rings of large branches.  Take 7 modules for two adjacent rows.  Lock them in a ring.  We perform 4 rings in this way. </li><li>  In the next row, the length of the branch should be less than in the previous one.  For example, the central branch will consist of 12 rows, and the side branches of 3. </li><li>  We connect 5 branches in a circle in the same way as we did before.  Further intermediate circles should be smaller. </li><li>  Finally, our origami tree is almost ready for assembly.  It remains to make the crown.  We will assemble a branch of 8 rows by inserting 2 modules on each side to add splendor.  The blanks are ready. </li><li>  Take any skewer and stick it into the eraser.  Let's start the assembly: string a large circle, an intermediate ring, the next circle, a ring, etc.  to the top of the head.  At the last stage, we put on the crown and the origami tree is completely ready. </li></ol><p>  For greater strength crafts, during the assembly of parts, you can use paper glue. </p>
