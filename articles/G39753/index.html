Exhibitions at VDNH</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sights of VDNH attract thousands of visitors every year.  After all, this is the largest entertainment and educational complex in our country, located in the north-east of the capital.  Every day there are many visitors.  The exhibition has fountains and pavilions built at the very beginning of the Soviet era, they are located along wide paved alleys. </p><p>  There are more modern works.  They are dedicated to energy, space, cybernetics.  This is a very harmonious complex, in which ponds and park areas occupy a special place. </p><h2>  History of the complex </h2><p>  The sights of VDNH have been exhibiting for several decades.  The complex first opened its doors in 1939.  This has become a vivid advertisement of the victory of socialism.  Initially, there were many pavilions at VDNH that demonstrated the achievements of the socialist industry, which existed almost exclusively on the territory of the Soviet Union itself. </p><p>  During the Soviet era, many citizens sought to get to VDNKh to see the abundance from which they were so unaccustomed to in ordinary life.  Only here it was possible to consider obese animals, quality products, modern technology. </p><p>  Each of the pavilions represented one of the republics of the Soviet Union or a specific branch of the national economy.  In the very center was installed the Friendship of Peoples fountain and a pavilion dedicated to the Russian Federation.  Around the fountain stood out golden sculptures of representatives of all the peoples inhabiting the USSR in national costumes. </p><p>  In the 1990s, numerous merchants settled in the building.  For many years, the exhibition fell into decay, turning into a banal market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Exhibition Features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.2do2go.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions VDNH" class="if uuid-2952519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2952519.jpg"></div><p>  There are so many attractions at VDNKh that in one day all of them just might not have time to inspect.

Above their heads they hold a hammer and sickle.  The compositional concept and concept belong to the architect Boris Iofan, and the sculptor Vera Mukhina became the direct author of this work of art. </p><p>  The monument is made of chromium-nickel steel.  Its height without a pedestal is 24.5 meters, and the total weight is 185 tons. </p><p>  The sculpture was created for the World Exhibition in Paris in 1937, was presented in the Soviet pavilion. </p><h2>  Famous fountain </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.timeout.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fountain of Friendship of Peoples" class="if uuid-2952515" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2952515.jpg"></div><p>  The description of the Fountain of <span>Friendship of Peoples</span> fountain at VDNKh is known to everyone who has visited this complex at least once.  This is one of the symbols of VDNH, which was created in 1954 according to the project of Konstantinovsky and Topuridze.  It is located on the Central Alley, near the Main Pavilion. </p><p>  Initially, in its place were located recreation areas with several pavilions and cafes for children.  When designing a new exhibition, it was decided to build republican pavilions, and then place them along the central axis. </p><p>  Konstantinovsky and Topuridze by that time had already managed to build the Main Fountain near the pavilion "Ukraine". </p><p>  The hydraulic part and the design itself were developed by engineer Klyavin.  For the electrical part, the design office of Mossvetproekt was responsible. </p><p>  In the center of the octagonal pool is an oval fountain.  On a granite base there is a bowl-shaped sheaf of wheat, sunflowers and technical hemp of impressive size.  For example, the height of one stop is about seven and a half meters.  Around placed 16 female sculptures, which are made of bronze, and then covered with gold leaf. </p><p>  There is a version that, when implementing this project, Topuridze was guided by the sculptures of the "Guryev Service" by the representative of classicism Stepan Pimenov and the Peterhof fountains. </p><p>  16 female statues symbolize 16 republics that were part of the USSR (the last was Karelian-Finnish, which existed until 1956).  Each girl is dressed in a national costume, and holds a plant or fruit in her hands. </p><h2>  The layout of the capital </h2><div class="photo" data-original="stroi.mos.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow layout" class="if uuid-2952516" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2952516.jpg"></div><p>  The architectural model of Moscow at VDNH is a unique exhibit.  The central part of the city is represented on the territory of 369 square meters on a scale of 1: 400.  In total, it completed almost twenty thousand buildings located inside the Garden Ring, as well as partially beyond. </p><p>  Currently, a fragment of the layout from the north is limited to the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãThree Stations, from the south by the Youth Palace, from the east by the Hammer and Sickle factory, and from the west by the Belorussky railway station.  You can find the pavilion on the Lilac Alley. </p><p>  Visitors have a unique opportunity to examine in detail the historical center of the Russian capital.  Red Square, the House on the Embankment, the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, many important and iconic buildings and structures for the city were recreated in detail. </p><p>  The main distinguishing feature of this layout is its amazing detail, as well as the most accurate recreation of the relief and landscape. </p><p>  Every day at noon and at 6 p.m. they organize a lighting show in which special effects, light and sound are used. </p><h2>  Bringing Down the House </h2><div class="photo" data-original="xn----7sbh2dgdm.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Re-house at VDNH" class="if uuid-2952514" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2952514.jpg"></div><p>  The Changeling House in Moscow at VDNH is one of the most unusual objects in this complex.  The house stands upside down, all objects in it are also turned upside down.  Surprisingly, this is not a museum, not an illusion or an architectural monument, but a very unusual interactive attraction. </p><p>  The sensations that visitors experience are simply amazing.  In the interior of this house, the life of an ordinary European resident is simulated.  Around the dishes from the ordinary supermarket, wooden furniture, in the garage there is a small car. </p><p>  Just be prepared for the fact that the walk will last long enough, all this time you will not leave the thought that something heavy is about to fall on you. </p><p>  The cost of visiting this facility is three hundred rubles. </p><h2>  Port </h2><div class="photo" data-original="a-a-ah.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Port at VDNH" class="if uuid-2952520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2952520.jpg"></div><p>  The place of attraction for most visitors to VDNH is the port.  There are clean water pools, a real sandy beach, comfortable sun loungers, dance floors and food courts. </p><p>  Guests are constantly in an atmosphere of beautiful relaxation and serenity.  It is best to spend time here with children, for whom an interesting entertainment program is provided. </p><p>  Outreach parties with the participation of jazz musicians, games in the sand in frisbee and volleyball, painting workshops are constantly held, and group exercises in water aerobics, yoga, and group fitness training are held at the pool itself.  You can also just swim. </p><p>  It is especially worth noting that the port operates only on the hottest days, so it‚Äôs best to check in advance whether this site is open on the day you plan to visit it. </p>
