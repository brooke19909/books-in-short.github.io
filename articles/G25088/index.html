New devices were supposed to be as simple as possible to operate.  And it was this model that became the result of long painstaking work aimed at changing the functionality, interface, etc. </p><p>  The fact that periodically a company must completely update its products is known to all successful players in the market.  For example, another industry giant, Amazon, did the same. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  Since this is the second model in the series, comparisons with its predecessor are inevitable.  Appearance is practically no different.  True, various color schemes appeared on sale.  The case can be white, black and silver.  The front part of it is made of not glossy, but smooth plastic.  The back side is different from the front.  For her, another type of plastic is used, which is also called "soft touch".  Thanks to its structure, the device lies securely in the hand.  It is convenient and even pleasant to hold, so even a long reading process will not cause discomfort. </p><p>  The weight has not changed much and is equal to 198 grams.  The dimensions of the device are also selected with the expectation that it was easy and convenient to carry.  The lower part of the device body is thickened specifically for this.  The screen is protected by glass, which is standard for this type of device. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Most of the front panel is occupied by a touch screen, with which it is most convenient to interact with the functionality.  Another important element is the status indicator.  A block of keys is located under the screen.  These buttons allow you to turn pages or switch between sections of the menu.  The Home function is also available here.  If the book is open, then using the key block you can call the context menu. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the bottom of the PocketBook 623 are all the usual functional elements.  This is a mini-jack for connecting headphones, a USB connector, convenient as a way to interact with a personal computer and charge, and a device shutdown button.  There is also a slot for micro-SD cards.  But on the upper and side ends there are no ports and sockets.  Therefore, everything is conveniently located in one place, according to users. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The first innovation that catches your eye when you pick up the PocketBook 623 is, of course, an HD screen and a redesigned backlight.  Image quality has become an order of magnitude higher than previous models.  The included backlight makes the picture even more colorful.  It is pleasant and convenient to read on such a screen; buyers confirm this.  The text is smooth and expressive.  In addition, you can always change individual settings to make the letters the way you want.  The classic version of black letters on a white background may seem unnecessarily trivial to some users, so the options include a variety of combinations.  This allows you to make PocketBook 623 a truly personalized tool, which is adjusted according to the tastes and needs of the buyer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The device lacks the ‚Äúblinking‚Äù effect, due to which the text begins to blur when turning over.  Many critics of e-books refuse this format for this reason.  Now PocketBook 623 leaves this problem in the past, which prevents some from adapting to reading from electronic media. </p>

    <h2>  Backlight and brightness </h2><p>  For illumination, LEDs have become popular.  They are located under the bottom edge of the device.  The light spreads evenly thanks to the film that PocketBook 623 Touch 2 is equipped with. A similar technology is also designed to protect the reader‚Äôs vision. </p><p>  Brightness can be adjusted as you wish.  Sometimes intense backlighting is simply not needed, and it will only waste the device‚Äôs charge in vain.  It is in this case that you can change the brightness, for example, by 50% compared to the maximum value.  But at night, when it is especially important to clearly see the picture on the screen in front of you, the entire power of the LED is used.  The matte display is a feature of PocketBook Touch 2 623. Reviews of its properties are usually positive, many say that reading on such a screen is much more comfortable.  The capacitive surface is protected from <span>sun glare</span> and other image defects. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Inner filling </h2><p>  The new PocketBook Touch 2 623, reviews of which are often positive, received a high-quality processor.  Its frequency is 800 MHz.  4 gigabytes of internal physical memory is enough to adapt to the device and understand what it is capable of.  In the future, you can purchase an SD-drive, which will make the available amount of information even more.  RAM is 128 megabytes.  This is enough to ensure that a book opened on the device flips through without problems and freezes. </p><p>  This applies to both the simple FB2 format and more complex analogues (PDF, DJVU, DOC).  Access to such files opens up great opportunities for the reader with PocketBook 623. The user manual will help to resolve the most common difficulties during operation.  But do not give in to the impression that the functionality of the device is difficult to learn.  In fact, the device is intuitive.  Its menus and settings are arranged in a convenient scheme that is easy to remember.  Many buyers note this. </p><p>  The degree of interaction with the text also depends on the file itself.  If the PDF has a layer of recognized text, then you can copy or select it for annotations.  These are very useful features - this way you can create notes and mark the necessary parts of the text.  Bookmarks work in all files.  They will help to return to the necessary page by clicking the mark in the table of contents.  This useful point is also liked by users. </p><p>  DJVU format is not as functional as PDF, but it is less weight and compact.  In addition, such files are often facsimiles of real books.  If we are talking about the old edition, then the reader can see the old typographic techniques, as well as the layout of the pages. </p>

    <h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  They tried to diversify the first models of ‚Äúreaders‚Äù by complementing them with a variety of proposals, making the device a mini-similarity of a PDA.  However, now all manufacturers (like PocketBook) are trying first of all to give customers the opportunity to comfortably access the Internet from a new device.  For this, readers are equipped with Wi-Fi. </p><p>  PocketBook 623, reviews of which as a positive Internet tool, is no exception.  By default, there is always a button on the main menu of the screen that redirects the user to the online store.  It is branded.  The account here can be synchronized with the device, which is extremely convenient when interacting.  A wide selection of books will help both those who are looking for a specific volume in their library, and those who do not know what to read. </p><p>  However, for the latter there is another functional service.  This is a social network for book lovers ReadRate.  You can enter it in various ways - create your own account or synchronize with your Facebook.  The reader, who is languishing at the choice and does not know which book to spend his evening with, can open ratings and collections or read comments left by the same users.  A user-friendly interface and a wide selection - this is what ReadRate gives to any user. </p><h2>  Browser </h2><p>  But for Internet surfing, this device is not very suitable.  The menu has a built-in browser, with which you can hypothetically open any page of the World Wide Web.  However, the application is fraught with certain problems.  Some especially large pages will open for a long time, and the device will begin to slow down.  All this is an inevitable cost of PocketBook 623 format. Instructions for using each application are presented in the user manual, which is in the box with the device. </p>

In addition, there are uncomplicated standard games, a calendar, a calculator, a note function - in general, everything that any organizer needs. </p><p>  The device supports viewing photos in popular formats.  There is also an mp3 player, which will be a great addition to entertaining reading.  It, like the library, has its own music library.

    <h2>  Faults and repairs </h2><p>  If the PocketBook 623 does not turn on, then most likely the device wasted its charge.  A convenient interface will not let you forget about the lack of energy (the icon with the battery and its status is visible in any mode).  On the other hand, a charger or other part of the reader may break down.  Then it is best to contact a specialized center where staff can conduct high-quality diagnostics using special equipment. </p><p>  As with any other device, trouble can happen with PocketBook 623. Screen repair (for example) is most often associated with matrix damage when the display does not show part of the picture or completely stops responding to button presses.  There may be various reasons for this.  Most often they are associated with sloppy operation, as the users themselves are talking about.  Repair PocketBook 623 Touch 2 (replacement screen and accessories) can be done under warranty, if it has not yet expired.  Therefore, before going to a specialist, it is worth checking all the papers and documents received upon purchase. </p><p>  Repair PocketBook 623 Touch 2 is often needed in case of mechanical damage.  The manufacturer did everything so that the case and the screen could not break with proper care.  All that is required of the user is to be careful in handling the equipment. </p>
