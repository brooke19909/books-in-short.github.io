    <p>  A rhinoceros beetle is an insect belonging to the family of lamellar and <span>arthropod type.</span>  Its habitats are localized everywhere, excluding taiga and tundra.  Preference is given to forests with broad-leaved trees.  You can meet him in the gardens, as well as in areas with artificial plantings.  The name of this insect is very well suited to its appearance.  Beetles are really very much like a real rhino.  Like this animal, they have a protrusion located on the front of the head - the horn.  In addition, the body of the beetle is covered with a thick layer of chitinous ‚Äúarmor‚Äù.  Slow gait and all the guise of this insect makes it a miniature likeness of a large animal. </p><p>  Rhinoceros beetle has a massive body, which in length can range from twenty-five to forty centimeters.  His legs are strong and thick.  The front ones are designed to perform digging functions, and the rear ones, with small spikes and teeth, are used for support.  On the pronotum, the male beetles possess a three-toothed transverse eminence.  The horn bent back is located on the head.  In females, only a small tubercle rises on the nose.  The back of the beetle may have a different color, depending on the environment.  It ranges from reddish brown to dark brown.  The limbs and abdomen are much lighter.  Their outer cover is yellowish-brown hairs.  The chitinous shell of the insect has a shiny surface. </p><p>  The rhinoceros beetle, belonging to the <span>class of insects,</span> has a structure similar to other representatives of this class.  Extremities, and indeed the body itself consists of several segments - segments.  Three pairs of legs for walking are located on the chest of the beetle.  They consist of five segments.  The limbs are located at a fairly large distance from each other.  This creates the impression that the beetle has spread its legs wide.  The insect is active at dusk.  The bug flies well.  Without stopping, he is able to cover a distance of fifty kilometers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An amazing property of an insect is its performance as semiconductors with its wings.  They appear when exposed to ultraviolet rays.  A rhinoceros beetle, whose nutrition is still uncertain until the end, according to some sources, uses plant juice or liquefied food.  Other specialists are of the opinion of the presence of aphagia.  That is, some scientists believe that the insect does not feed at all.  During its existence, it uses those nutrients that have accumulated the larva of a rhinoceros beetle.  The first version is confirmed by the structure of the oral cavity of the insect.  Its chewing surfaces are poorly developed and do not have teeth for grinding solid food.  At the same time, the lower jaw is covered with brushes of thick long hairs, which are supposed to contribute to the collection of plant sap.  Confirmation of the second opinion is the state of the digestive organs.  They are almost completely atrophied. </p><p>  The rhinoceros beetle breathes atmospheric air that enters its <span>respiratory organs</span> through the spiracles located on the abdomen and chest.  <span>The circulatory system of the</span> insect is not closed.  The heart of the beetle is from the back.  It is a tube divided into chambers having valve openings.  Bug <span>excretion organs are</span> represented by the adipose body and malpighian vessels.  The <span>central nervous system is</span> involved in controlling the basic processes of functioning of the entire body of the insect <span>.</span>  Well-developed sensory organs, together with the horn, contribute to the successful orientation of the beetle in space.  The insect is very strong.  It is capable of moving a load whose mass exceeds its own weight a thousand times. </p>
