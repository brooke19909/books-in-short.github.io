    <h2>  Comments of tourists about the hotel itself, its territory, housing stock and location </h2><p>  As for the territory of this hotel, it is small, but green and very well maintained and clean.  Almost all of its area is occupied by a residential building and a swimming pool with a sun terrace.  A big plus, as tourists say, is the ability to use almost all of the infrastructure (except for accommodation and meals) in a neighboring hotel belonging to the same Larissa hotel chain. </p><p>  As for the rooms in Larissa Blue Resort 3 *, our compatriots find them quite spacious, comfortable, pleasantly decorated and equipped with everything necessary.

Guests also note the presence of very spacious cabinets, where you can easily put all the items brought with you.  But the Internet is not in the rooms, which upsets vacationers.  But Wi-Fi is available in the lobby and near the pool.  Travelers who have already been here advise, if possible, to ask you to check in with a room with windows overlooking the pool and mountains.  In this case, you can enjoy the beautiful view. </p><p>  Apartments are cleaned daily.  Towels are changed every other day even if you do not stack them on the floor.  Maids change bed linen twice a week.  As for shampoos, shower gels and soaps, they are provided only upon check-in.  Subsequently, you will need to buy them yourself. </p><p>  Now about the location.  Larissa Blue Resort 3 * is located in a fairly quiet part of the resort village of Kirish in the vicinity of Kemer.  Within walking distance for guests of the hotel there are travel agencies, rental cars, scooters and bicycles, shops, supermarkets, souvenir shops and other infrastructure facilities.
