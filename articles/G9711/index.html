    <p>  According to historians, 120 thousand Russian soldiers and 135 thousand French participated in the battle of Borodino.  The Russians had 624 guns, and their opponents - 587. The battle began with the capture of the Borodino village by the French, where before them there were Russian troops.  The main events of the battle began at 5 a.m., on the left flank of the Russian army.  In this place, near the Semenovsky ravine, were <span>Bagration's flushes.</span>  Many hours of fierce fighting took place here.  Flushes many times passed from the hands of the opponents.  The land was completely covered with the corpses of soldiers and horses.  In this battle, the commander-in-chief of the 2nd Western Army P.I. Bagration was mortally wounded.  After that, the French were able to capture the flushes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Equally brutal was the battle for <span>the Raevsky battery,</span> which was at the center of the Russian position.  During the bloody battle, in which thousands of soldiers died on both sides, the Russian soldiers showed their indestructible will to win.  Despite the fact that the French were able to capture the fortifications of the Russians in the center and on the left flank, Napoleon flinched at such an enemy‚Äôs determination to stand to death and retreated to their original positions. </p><p>  The battle of Borodino is considered the bloodiest in the history of one-day battles.  It killed 45 thousand Russians and about 40 thousand French.  Moreover, on both sides there were losses not only soldiers, but also officers.  In this battle, 23 Russian and 49 French generals died, which greatly weakened Napoleon‚Äôs invincible army. </p><h2>  The significance of the Battle of Borodino </h2><p>  The battle of Borodino is one of the most bloody in the history of the Russian army.  It was described with great accuracy in the novel by L. Tolstoy, "War and Peace."  The consequence of this battle was the flight of Napoleon.  He not only left captured Moscow, but also lost his army of many thousands and France. </p><h2>  Museum foundation </h2>
