Stretched out on a deck chair under the gentle rays of the sun, you can spend hours enjoying the surrounding serenity.  For a successful vacation, you should go to Greece.  Her island of Halki will become that reliable harbor, which will kindly receive its guests. </p><p>  It combines the beauty of nature, ancient and modern architecture.  What to see on the island, how to get to it, we will tell in the article.  The reviews of tourists who visited these parts will help to convey the atmosphere of a pleasant sea holiday. </p><h2>  What is this island </h2><p>  Halki Island (Greece) is located in the <span>Aegean Sea.</span>  It is part of an archipelago called Dodecanese.  This picturesque islet is 65 km from the port <span>of Rhodes.</span>  The only settlement on this earth is Nimbboro.  Here, several bright houses descend to the sea with an amphitheater.  There are several small taverns.  Vessels arrive here both from the surrounding islands of the archipelago and from Rhodes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Halki Island" class="if" height="221" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1386435.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Getting to the island is not difficult.  You will have to move around Halki exclusively on foot.  There is no transport here at all.  This, of course, will please lovers of silence, walking along the winding paths of the surroundings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Halki (Dodecanese) has a coastline of 40 km.  On the island itself is the now abandoned village (the former capital) of Horo.  About 200 people live in the only existing settlement.  Tourists are attracted here by the amazing beach with its soft sand. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The island of Halki, according to the myths of ancient Greece, was the habitat of the titans.  The name of this earth comes from the word "copper".  It in Greek sounds like "Halkos."  There are copper mines.  But some do not agree with the origin of the name of the island.  There is a version that Halki got his name because of the catch of a special kind of purple mollusk.  In Greek, halke means violet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Greek islands" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1386434.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  However, from those distant times, the inhabitants have changed here more than once.  Halki has always been associated with Rhodes.  Therefore, the period of its capture by the Turks led to the decline of these beautiful lands.  All of Greece then suffered from the oppression of the Ottoman Empire. </p><p>  At the beginning of the last century, the island was transferred to the jurisdiction of Italy.  It is with this period of time that a significant outflow of the population from Halki is associated.  Nowadays, they get sponges, fish, raise sheep and goats.  They produce cheese, copper, and the tourism industry is actively developing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  <span>The Greek islands</span> of the Dodecanese archipelago are very hospitable.  On Halki, local residents erected bright houses.  Some are located right next to the water.  Local boys can dive into the sea right from the windows of their homes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Halki Island Greece" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1386437.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To rent private housing or a separate room, you will need about 50-90 euros per night.  Previously, there was practically no drinking water on the island.  But today there is a desalination station.  If you need to wash yourself in your room or on the beach, you will have to use rainwater. </p><p>  Water on the island for local residents is worth its weight in gold.  They take care of her here.  But, having entered any tavern, you can buy bottled water.  Plumbing with industrial water is everywhere.  This allows you to maintain cleanliness and sanitation. </p><h2>  Halki Holidays </h2><p>  The Greek islands attract a huge number of tourists every year.  Locals are very welcome visitors.  Some of them even speak Russian.  Here, guests will be offered a glass of local moonshine, which can be eaten with fresh vegetables. </p><p>  Halki is interesting for its beaches.  The most important of them - Pondamos is located next to the pier.  Here is a small soft sand.  Holidays with children in this place will be ideal.  Not far from the monastery of St. John the Wise, there are also two good pebble beaches.  They are called Yali and Kania. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Halki Dodecanese" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1386433.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you want more active leisure, you can go fishing.  Locals give fishing rods for free.  If the guest managed to fish out large fish, the owners will also absolutely free fire it.  But with the little things caught in the local waters, you have to bother yourself.  Although large fish so simply do not fall into the hands of visitors.  But you can still experience happiness. </p><h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  Halki Island, reviews of which were left by tourists who rested here, is famous for its cuisine.  Cuisine is considered one of the "lures" of both this island and Greece in general.  Many tourists liked the fact that in the local taverns you can try many island delicacies, but the figure will not deteriorate.  Seafood, fruits and vegetables keep your waist slim. </p><p>  The local cuisine is low-fat.  Their basis is protein.  Protein is consumed by locals in the form of vegetables.  During lunch, you can enjoy a glass of local aromatic wine. </p><p>  Specialties of Halki are considered to be musakas (baked eggplant with minced meat and potatoes), zaziqi (salted yogurt with garlic).  An abundance of fruits, seafood, vegetables and many other wonderful components of local cuisine will please any vacationer. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Any excursion will be able to entertain tourists.  Halki Island is famous for its huge number of churches.  There are more of them than the locals.  It is worth visiting the temple of Agios Nicholas.  Its high bell tower and traditional architecture will delight the eye with its solemnity.  The courtyard of the temple is covered with mosaics.  She depicts the tree of Life. </p><p>  On foot you can reach the ancient village of Horo.  Here is a real church from the time of the Crusade.  It is as if growing out of a rock.  If the weather is calm, you can see the island of Crete from it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Excursion Halki Island" class="if" height="487" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1386436.jpg" width="365"></div>

    <p>  Many temples of different cultures and beliefs will open to guests of the archipelago.  It is worth visiting the Byzantine church of Panaya, Stavros.  There are also monasteries on the island.  Hospitable monks can let travelers spend the night under their roof. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Halki Island is visited annually by many vacationers.  A rather significant source of income for the local budget is precisely the tourism sector.  The reviews of our compatriots make it clear that here the vacation turns out to be as successful as possible for those who seek solitude, peace and unhurried contemplation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Halki island reviews" class="if" height="228" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1386432.jpg" width="600"></div>
