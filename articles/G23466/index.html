It is the most demanded among all advanced sonar devices. </p><p>  Deeper depth sounder scans the entire thickness of the water from the surface to the bottom, measures the temperature and depth and finds fish.  In addition, it collects information on the structure and topography of the bottom, as well as other important and useful information to obtain the best fishing results.  All data collected by the sensor is instantly broadcast and displayed on your smartphone or tablet. </p><h2>  DEEPER Product Features </h2><p>  After the release of the first Dipper wireless echo sounder models, many anglers finally got the opportunity to use modern echolocation achievements when fishing from the shore without using boats.  The main advantage of the novelty is the ability to study the reservoir by casting the device with a spinning rod directly from the shore.  At the same time, the data from the fishfinder is transmitted to the connected mobile device via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.  To do this, you must install the Deper mobile application under Andriod or IOS. </p><div class="photo" data-original="scout.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="For fishing from the shore" class="if uuid-2871796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2871796.jpg"></div><ul><li>  all ‚ÄúDipper‚Äù fishfinder are designed for long-distance casting using spinning from a shore or boat at a distance of 50-100 meters; </li><li>  in addition, with the help of a special fastening flexible device, they can be installed on boats, boats, kayaks or kayaks; </li><li>  All information about the desired fishing sector is sent to the screen of your smartphone or tablet. </li></ul><h2>  Difficulty of choosing </h2><p>  Bluetooth data models are significantly cheaper, but this protocol limits the data transmission range to about forty meters.  It is preferable to purchase it in cases where the sensor or phone will be at a distance of no more than 40 meters, for example, during winter fishing or using the device on a boat.  The transmission of information from the echo sounder via Wi-Fi allows it to be used in any situation, since the range of the most powerful casting spinning is overlapped by the radius of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.animalgear.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baltic quality" class="if uuid-2871805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2871805.jpg"></div><p>  The next criterion for choosing is the price of the Dipper echo sounder.  When buying the cheapest model, the cost of which is slightly less than 10 000 r., You must remember that the budget option has limited functionality and a small screen in low resolution. </p><p>  The optimal choice for today is a fish-searching model with a five-inch screen.  They have sufficient resolution, and can also easily recognize: </p><ul><li>  thermocline; </li><li>  bottom structure (rocky, silty); </li><li>  improved fish recognition; </li><li>  border of grass. </li></ul><p>  Next, we offer an overview of Deeper sounders models with their characteristics and reviews. </p><h2>  Unique DEEPER PRO + </h2><p>  The Dipper PRO PLUS sounder is a great purchase for any fisherman.

The device also boasts a built-in high-frequency GPS receiver, which creates bathymetric maps of the entire water column. </p><p>  Thanks to this, this model is the only and unique of its kind.  It has the highest accuracy of echolocation and all the functionality that was previously available only to stationary sonar on boats. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Best fish finder" class="if uuid-2871777" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2871777.jpg"></div><p>  In their reviews of the Dipper PRO sonic depth finder, users note the ease of use and settings, ultra-compact dimensions, low weight that standard fishing lines can withstand.
