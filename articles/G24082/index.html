Without exaggeration, everyone is in love with them: both children and adults.  Sometimes dolphins can be found at sea, very often they swim very close to people.  But you can visit the well-equipped dolphinariums, where dolphins are kept in good conditions.  "Artists" will show a great performance, demonstrate all their skills and will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><h2>  Dolphinarium "Nemo" </h2><p>  Dolphinarium in Phuket opened relatively recently, in 2015.  The name of the dolphinarium is Nemo Dolphins bay.  Performances are held almost daily, with the exception of Monday.  The hourly performance with the participation of not only dolphins, but also fur seals is truly impressive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dolphinarium phuket" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2190535.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Dolphins under the guidance of their trainers jump, play, show various tricks, which cause delight and thunderous applause from the audience.  And the fur seals do not forget to send air kisses every now and then. </p><p>  The dolphinarium hall in Phuket can accommodate enough flax, and about a thousand people can enjoy the show at the same time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dolphinarium phuket" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2190540.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  "Artists" came to Phuket from Ukraine, all seven of them - five dolphins and two fur seals. </p><h2>  Where is the dolphinarium </h2><p>  The dolphinarium is located in an area called Chalong, in close proximity to the Phuket Zoo.  Of course, the question arises of how to get to the dolphinarium in Phuket. </p><p>  Since public transport on the island is poorly developed, there are few options to get to the dolphinarium on your own.  Firstly, you can take a taxi.  Taxis can be ordered to any part of the island or to "catch" any passing car with special signs.  But a taxi in Phuket is not cheap, so get ready to pay a decent amount, even if you go very close. </p><p>  The second way is to rent a car.  The cost of renting per day is often not much higher than the cost of a single trip in a taxi, but during the rental you can visit not only the dolphinarium, but also many other attractions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dolphinarium phuket" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2190570.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The third way is to buy a ready-made tour.  There are quite a lot of tour agencies in Phuket, the prices are quite loyal. </p><p>  The fourth option is to order tickets by phone given on the dolphinarium's official website, and order tickets with the tickets, which will be picked up from the right place and delivered back after the presentation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Finding a dolphinarium is easy.  A large building without walls resembles a tent, in the center of which is a swimming pool, and at the edges of the place for spectators.  The absence of walls does not mean that it will be hot inside, as fans are located everywhere, which create additional coolness and comfortable conditions for viewing the performance. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  There are few reviews of the dolphinarium in Phuket, probably due to the fact that the dolphinarium has been working for only about two years.  However, all the feedback that can be found on the Internet is positive.  Especially enthusiastic about the performance are the little travelers, the good organization, the excellent performance of the performance, as well as the dolphins, are also noted ... Their artistry, arrogance and smiles cause a complete delight of the audience. </p><p>  Those who take tickets to the front rows are given raincoats, as dolphins are big mischievous and can spray. </p><p>  A special delight in the reviews of those who managed to swim with dolphins, take pictures with them or just stroke them. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The price of a performance depends on how far the seats are from the scene.  The most expensive seats on the first and second row: an adult ticket costs 1000 Thai baht, and a children's ticket is 600. Tickets from the third to fifth rows are already a little cheaper, for an adult ticket at the box office they will take 800 baht, and a children's ticket will cost 500 baht.  Next are places with a cost of 600 baht for an adult ticket and 400 will cost a ticket for a child. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolphinarium in thailand phuket" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61221/2190584.jpg"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>

      <p></p>
    <p>  But from any row and from any place, the performance is clearly visible, so here it is most likely a matter of personal preference. </p><p>  After the presentation, viewers can take advantage of additional services that are paid separately.  For 5,000 baht, you can swim with dolphins or go royal diving, but an unforgettable photo on your camera with an artist right on the stage will cost 400 baht. </p><p>  In order to understand what the cost of representation in rubles is, we use simple arithmetic.  1 baht on average is 1 ruble 80 kopecks. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Dolphinarium in Thailand in Phuket is a must visit, especially for those who come to the island with children.  Little travelers will no doubt be delighted with the show.  However, adults will also not remain indifferent to beautiful dolphins and fur seals. </p><p>  It is also worth adding that the performance can be reached on any day of the week, except Monday.  Three sessions take place during the day - at 11:00, 14:00 and 17:00.  Cash desks start working from 10 a.m.  Since the dolphinarium is roomy, it is worth arriving a little earlier than the show so as not to miss all the fun while standing in line.  On the official website you can find information about special offers and promotions, thanks to which you can save a little when buying tickets. </p>
