He went from being an artilleryman to an experienced staff officer.  At the age of 65, retired, was arrested and sentenced to death for twenty-five years of cooperation with the US government. </p><h2>  Carier start </h2><p>  Little is known about this man‚Äôs childhood.  He is a native of Ukraine.  His father was an accountant.  After leaving school, Polyakov Dmitry entered the First Artillery School.  In 1941 he went to the front.  He served as platoon commander on the Western and <span>Karelian fronts,</span> during the two years of the war he became battery commander.  In 1943 he received the rank of <span>artillery intelligence officer.</span>  For successful military operations and excellent service he was awarded a large number of medals and orders.  In 1945, he decided to enter the intelligence department of the Frunze Academy.  Then he graduated from the General Staff Courses and was enrolled in the GRU staff. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Polyakov Dmitry Fedorovich" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20759/878193.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Work in the USA </h2><p>  Almost immediately after completing the training and drawing up the necessary legend, Dmitry Polyakov was sent to New York as an employee of the Soviet UN mission.  His true occupation was the covering and deployment of illegal GRU (agents) in the United States.  The first resident mission was successful, and already in 1959 he again sent to the United States as an employee of the UN military headquarters.  In the second mission, military intelligence assigned Polyakov the duties of deputy resident.  The Soviet agent performed his work perfectly, clearly followed the instructions, obtained the required data, coordinated his scout. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In November 1961, Dmitry Polyakov continued to work at the GRU agency in New York.  At this time, flu was rampant in the States.  His youngest son caught the virus, the disease gave a heart complication.  An expensive operation was required to save the child.  An experienced staffer asked the management for financial assistance, he was denied money, and the child died. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="General Poles Dmitry Fedorovich" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/878752.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <h2>  Collaboration with the FBI and the CIA </h2><p>  After interrogating witnesses, American spy colleagues and his inner circle, it became clear that Polyakov had come to betrayal deliberately.  After debunking the cult of Stalin and the beginning of the "Khrushchev" thaw, the scout became disillusioned with the new leadership, believed that the Stalinist ideals, those for which he had fought on the fronts of the Great Patriotic War, had been completely lost.  Moscow elite is mired in corruption and political games.  Polyakov Dmitry felt that he had lost faith in the political landmarks of his country and its leaders.  The death of his son became the catalyst that accelerated events.  An embittered and broken Soviet agent contacted a senior American officer and offered his services. </p><p>  The FBI leadership took the betrayal of such an experienced intelligence agent from the USSR as a gift of fate, and did not fail.  Dmitry Polyakov has established contact with the FBI recruiter, establishing contacts with traitors from the GRU and the KGB.  The Soviet agent received the pseudonym Tophet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1962, the CIA chief asked President Kennedy to transfer his most valuable mole to his agency.  Polyakov began working for the CIA and received the callsign Bourbon.  The central government considered him his "diamond." </p>

    <p>  In almost 25 years of cooperation with foreign special services, the Soviet traitor managed to send 25 boxes of documents and photo reports to the United States.  This amount was counted by the American "colleagues" of the spy after his exposure.  Dmitry Polyakov caused damage to his country, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.  He transmitted information regarding the development of secret weapons in the Union, thanks to him Reagan began to more closely control the sale of his military technologies, which the USSR bought and improved.  According to his tip, 19 Soviet residents, 7 counteragents and more than 1,500 ordinary GRU staff officers working abroad were destroyed. </p><p>  Over the years of service, Polyakov managed to work in the USA, Burma, India and Moscow.  Since 1961, he constantly collaborated with the CIA and the FBI.  Upon retirement, the traitor did not stop his activity: he worked as the secretary of the party committee, had access to the personal files of illegal immigrants in the USA, and willingly "shared" this information. </p><h2>  Exposure </h2><p>  In 1974, a Soviet intelligence officer was promoted.  Since that time, General Polyakov Dmitry Fedorovich had full access to classified materials, diplomatic relations, developments and plans of his government. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the first suspicions of Polyakov fell back in 1978, but his crystal clear reputation, an excellent track record and patron in the person of General Izotov played a role - they did not conduct investigations.  Experienced Bourbon lay at the bottom for a long time, but, finally settling in Moscow, reiterated to his Western colleagues his readiness to cooperate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Poles Dmitry" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/878330.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  In 1985, Dmitry Polyakov was discovered by the American "mole" Olridge Ames.  All military intelligence of the Union was in a state of shock: such a high-ranking spy has not yet been exposed.  In 1986, a talented resident was arrested and sentenced to <span>confiscation of property,</span> deprivation of ranks and execution.  In 1988, the sentence was carried out. </p>
