Walt Disney Park</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Once the creator of the cartoon about Mickey Mouse Walt Disney took his daughters to a recreation park.  As a result of this walk, an idea was born that later brought its author many billions of dollars in profit.  Disneyland is now playing the first fiddle in the US entertainment industry.  These family parks have stepped over both oceans.  Now Paris and Tokyo have their own Disneyland.  Walt's empire was not limited to just filming cartoons and <span>amusement parks.</span>  Now you can go on a trip with the Disney Cruise Company.  But the main contribution of the creator of the fun little mouse was to the US leisure industry.  Now every amusement park in this country copies a Disneyland model.  All of them have a theme that gives the amusement town uniqueness and identity.  The emphasis is on comfort and safety, design is carried out taking into account the expansion of construction. </p>

    <p>  In this article, we will take a look at Disneyland's second-largest appearance.  Orlando (Florida, USA) - its location.  What do tourists say about him? </p><h2>  History of the park </h2><p>  It is hard to believe, but back in the 50s of the last century there were <span>karst lakes</span> and swamps.  Now the whole city is making a noise here.  One day in November 1963, Walt Disney flew over Orlando by plane in order to explore the neighborhood of the town in search of a suitable site for the construction of a new park.  The car was chartered in a fictitious name.  The reason for this secrecy was that California Disneyland was already very popular.  Orlando at that time was an unremarkable town, the administrative district center of Orange.  The land there was cheap.  But to prevent speculation, Walt acquired plots through shell companies and individuals.  But in December 1966, he died, without having seen the embodiment of his dreams.  His brother Roy Oliver completed the work.  The amusement park was officially named "The Walt Disney World Resort".  It opened in early October 1971.  Now it is no less popular than Disneyland California.  Orlando, from an agricultural town for growing citrus fruits, has turned into an international tourist center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Orlando usa" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/972639.jpg" width="370"></div>

Contrary to popular belief, Disneyland's Orlando address is not urban.  It is located within the Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista - villages that grew, as they say, from scratch.  The Walt Disney World business empire even crawled out of Orange County and entered the neighboring Oceola area.  Now the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complex is over one hundred square kilometers.  It is more than the Manhattan Peninsula in New York.  Reviews say that you need to start your journey into the world of entertainment with the fact that you come to the city of Orlando.  Disneyland is located thirty-four kilometers southwest of this village.  Getting to the park is no problem.  In Orlando, this is almost the only attraction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Walt Disney" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/972640.jpg" width="338"></div>

    <h2>  Walt Disney World </h2><p>  On a vast territory, warn reviews of tourists, it‚Äôs just right to get lost.  It is good that buses and monorail trains run across all the cities of the entertainment empire.  What does a park in Orlando consist of?  Disneyland includes four thematic towns.  If you are traveling with young children (under five years old), reviews are advised to limit themselves to the "Magic Kingdom".  Everything else will either tire the baby, or he simply will not be allowed on the rides.  And in the "Magic Kingdom" - and Cinderella‚Äôs castle, and the characters of Disney cartoons, with which you can take a photo.  The other three theme parks are called Hollywood Studios, Epcot, and Animal Kingdom.  In addition to them, Disneyland includes a lot of commercial stalls and shops.  There is where to eat and eat tight.  There are twenty four hotels and two water parks on the territory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Disneyland Orlando tickets are expensive.  For one day of pleasure for children under nine years old, they will have to fork out $ 83.  But an adult ticket costs a little more - $ 89.  If you decide to stay in Orlando for a long time, reviews are advised to buy a subscription for three days or a week.  They will reduce the cost of rest (per day): 80 and 41 dollars, respectively.  Experienced tourists are advised to drop in various cafes in Orlando or find out at the reception of their hotel.  Walt Disney World distributes its discount coupons through these establishments.  Thus, you can get to the action "2 days for the price of one", "-30%", etc. As for the remaining expenses in the amusement park, usually a person drops here about two hundred dollars a day.  But the bus movement around the complex is free for visitors.  Water parks are paid separately.  A one-day ticket costs $ 47 for children under nine years old and 56 for everyone else. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Disneyland Orlando City" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/972636.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The Magic Kingdom </h2><p>  Disneyland Orlando began with this park.  This place is the first most visited in the world.  Seventeen million people come here every year.  The most iconic building here is Cinderella's Castle.  From it diverge in different directions of the track into seven thematic zones.  This is the "Land of the Future", "Edge of Fantasy", "Colonial Era", "World of Adventure", "Main Street", "Freedom Square" and Mickey's Toontown Fair.  Walt Disney conceived for his "Magic Kingdom" 23 attractions.  Now there are forty-seven of them, and new ones are added every year.  The Magic Kingdom is the most family park.  It is here that both children and parents will be equally fun.  Cartoon characters - Mickey Mouse and his girlfriend Minnie, the scary Captain Hook, Goofy and others - take you to the magical world.  Reviews are advised to visit the attractions "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Space Slides." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours in Orlando to Disneyland" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/972635.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other theme parks </h2><p>  After the "Magic Kingdom" in Walt Disney World (Orlando, USA) Epcot (1982), "Hollywood Studios" (1989) and "Animal Kingdom" (1998) were opened.  The first park resembles VDNH.  Especially the part called the "Showcase of the World."  There, in 11 pavilions, cultures of various countries are represented.  The other part, according to reviews, is more interesting.  It is called the "Community of the Future."  The most spectacular attraction, which is lined up in the morning, is the Spaceship.  Equally popular is Flight over California.  In the evening, around the lagoon, grandiose laser fireworks are organized.  Visitors claim that in the "Hollywood Studios" there are not many attractions.  The most exciting is the "Tower" with free fall.  However, children will like this theme park, because the heroes of Star Wars, the series about Indiana Jones, etc., "The Animal Kingdom" was opened here in 1998.  This is not just a zoo.  Animals here do not feel in captivity.  Reviews say this theme park closes earlier than others, so it's best to explore it in the morning.  Here in seven thematic zones you can see not only the existing animal species, but also extinct and even fictional. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Disneyland orlando reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/972564.jpg" width="592"></div>

    <h2>  Water parks and hotels </h2><p>  There are two of them in Walt Disney World in Orlando (USA).  The first looks typical - in the style of a tropical lagoon.  However, it is possible to snorkel among real sharks!  The second water park - Blizzard Beach - from a distance resembles a snowy peak.  It also has its own rides.  In particular, one of the highest roller coasters is located here.  If you don‚Äôt like the feeling of free fall, you can choose other activities.  There are more than enough of them in water parks, including for the youngest visitors.  Disneyland hotels are expensive.  Price per room starts at one hundred dollars.  But this high cost, according to reviews, pays off.  All transport in the complex (monorail, boats and even a shuttle to Orlando Airport) is free for hotel guests.  In addition, the Extra Magic Hours system is practiced.  Tourists living in the complex can use the rides one hour before the opening and three hours after the completion of the parks. </p><h2>  Tours in Orlando at Disneyland </h2><p>  In order not to get lost for Russian people from their habit in the vast space of the complex, group trips are organized from Moscow.  They can be for five, seven and nine days.  The cost of such tours is low - from 325 dollars.  But it is worth considering that entrance tickets to Disneyland parks are paid separately.  The price of the tour includes accommodation in a hotel with breakfast, transfer from the hotel to the parks and the services of a Russian-speaking guide instructor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Disneyland Orlando Park" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/972637.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  The most successful time to visit a place like Disneyland in Orlando, reviews are called late autumn and winter.  Indeed, in Florida this season reigns wonderful weather.  School holidays as well as Fridays, Saturdays and Mondays should be avoided.  In advance, select the attractions you want to visit on the map.  Come before the opening of the complex, and only the gates will open - immediately there.  If you have not yet made a choice, quickly go to the end of the park and move towards the crowd.  Get a raincoat for water rides: in the complex it costs eight times more than outside.  The food here also cannot be called cheap, but the portions are simply huge.  Use the Fastpass system to avoid tedious queuing. </p>
