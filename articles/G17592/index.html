    <h2>  Modeling career </h2><p>  The popular Nigel Barker was born in 1972 in a large family.  The boy studied well and planned to enter the medical faculty after school.  However, his mother, a former winner of the beauty contest, having estimated the attractiveness of her son, brought him to a television show, a confident victory on which brought him a signed contract with a modeling agency. </p><h2>  Own business </h2><p>  A handsome young man traveled around the world for more than 10 years, participating in shows of famous brands.  Having learned the model business from the inside and realizing that young fashion models are stepping on his heels, Nigel opened his own photo studio in Manhattan, which has been collaborating with various publications since 1996.  Of course, connections in the fashion world helped him a lot, but every day his growing talent was noticed by everyone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reality Judge </h2><p>  Photographer Nigel Barker considers his many years of participation in the Tyra Banks show a real success, because it was after this project that his career made another round up.  And many are sure that only the participation of a charming photographer made the model reality project so successful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nigel barker personal life" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1249600.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  He also participated in the Russian seasons of ‚ÄúTop Models‚Äù, noting that it was a great time.  The project judge recognized the beauty and professionalism of our girls, marveling at how people who speak different languages ‚Äã‚Äãunderstood each other perfectly.  And the professional work of the photographer Nigel Barker on the show has repeatedly become the subject of admiration and real works of art. </p><h2>  Healthy forms are in fashion </h2><p>  He said that the time of gaunt models was long gone, and now classic beauty is popular.  The healthy appearance of girls with forms is a big step forward, because the catwalk divas are role models for many spectators. </p><h2>  Happy husband and father </h2><p>  The courageous Nigel Barker, whose personal life has always interested his fans, has been happily married since 1999.  The model Kristen Chin became the woman of his dreams, and now two charming kids are growing up in a married couple.  Barker often gives interviews without hiding that he is as much in love with his wife as on the first day he met in Milan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Different hypostases </h2><p>  The photographer is not limited only to studio work, he produces films, writes books, participates in advertising campaigns and arranges exhibitions, but emphasizes that his family will always be in first place. </p>

    <p>  Barker's dream is to organize the release together with his wife, who is now working as a makeup artist, of two cosmetic lines for women: luxury and budget. </p><p>  In 2011, he presented to the audience a documentary about the inhabitants of the island of Haiti, having received many positive reviews from critics.  As a regular participant in charitable activities, Nigel defends the rights of animals and opposes their killing for the sake of fur. </p><h2>  Name Perfume </h2><p>  Three years ago, he released unisex signature fragrances, and the inspiration for them was New York, in which Nigel Barker lives with his family.  Laconic form bottles he adorned with his work. </p><p>  Now, any buyer can find out how the metropolis actually smells.  The aromas of Times Square, Wall Street and Night New York are on display, and the Demeter brand, known for its non-trivial approach to perfume creation, helped the photographer create perfumes. </p><h2>  Barker Books </h2><p>  In 2010, Nigel Barker released a book that became a real bestseller, in which he shared with all readers the secrets of beauty.  And five years later, the new edition saw the light, illustrated with stunning pictures. </p><p>  Nigel wrote about 50 influential women in the beauty industry who are commonly called style icons.  Successful models of various appearances that have turned the standards of beauty appear on two hundred colorful photographs, which were carefully selected by the author. </p>

    <p>  Each shot is equipped with interesting stories and fun captions, and, as Nigel Barker assures, this is not just a work introducing the catwalk divas.  He created a very significant work for readers, telling about the history of fashion, starting from the 40s of the last century. </p><p>  Traveling around the world, the photographer often holds master classes, inspiring other people with his work.  He recognizes himself as a happy person in work and family life, saying that he has found a long-awaited balance. </p>
