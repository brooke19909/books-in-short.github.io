Silver Boulevard, like many other local highways, in their names preserved the memory of the previous object, which had a glorious history. </p><h2>  Territory History </h2><p>  The Black River, originating in a swamp adjacent to Lake Dolgoy and flowing into the Bolshaya Nevka, has a rather unfortunate reputation in connection with the duel of A.S. Pushkin, which took place here in 1837.  But due to the picturesque nature of the river, its surroundings were built up by government summer residences from the 17th century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="silver boulevard" class="if" height="232" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/419289.jpg" width="350"></div>  On its left bank was the dacha of the commandant of the Peter and Paul Fortress.  Therefore, the vast territories belonging to her, and received the name of the Commandant Field.  The terrain was not empty.  At the beginning there was the Specific Hippodrome, which was later chosen by aviators.

    <h2>  Why is the boulevard so named </h2><p>  The modern Silver Boulevard, named after the color of aircraft, crosses the then Commandant airfield, erected at the expense of the Wings Partnership, where the first ballooning holiday was held in 1910.  Much is connected with this air harbor in the history of Russian aviation, known as the “first” - a flight to Kronstadt (1910, a little later - to Gatchina), a group flight to Moscow in 1911.  Here the idea of ​​creating a parachute arose.  The memory of this airdrome and its history, designers and pilots, whose activities were associated with it, was preserved not only in the street names of the modern microdistrict (Aerodromnaya, Parashyutnaya, Polikarpova, etc.).  At school No. 66, the Ikar Folk Museum was created. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tribute to the memory </h2><p>  Silver Boulevard was originally conceived as a tribute to the former airfield.  It had to be planted with silver willows, so that everything here was associated and resembled the wings of airplanes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg silver boulevard" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/419288.jpg" width="600"></div>  Great unrealized idea.  Planned as a boulevard, it essentially remained a rather narrow street.  But the name remains, and it is closely connected with the history of the city.  Therefore, the address: St. Petersburg, Silver Boulevard, despite the novelty of the latter, in its name, like almost all the objects of the northern capital, contains part of the information about the historical events of the Russian State.

    <h2>  Heroes of Russia </h2><p>  The military history of Russia knows several generals Khrulev, who brought her fame over the past two centuries.  But the street in the Primorsky district of St. Petersburg is dedicated to Andrei Vasilyevich Khrulev (1892-1962), who became famous as the chief of rear services of the Red Army, especially in the early years of World War II.  From the street named after the hero-general, and originates the Silver Boulevard, ending on Parachute Street.  It was built mainly by houses that correspond to the plans of the new microdistricts of 1970. </p><h2>  Comfortable area </h2><p>  This area is quite comfortable and has all the necessary infrastructure.  There are many cafes (there are also quite exotic names, for example, “Hut Magnata”) and restaurants (“Caucasus Asia”), several salons, factories, beauty studios and simply hairdressing salons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russia St. Petersburg Silver Boulevard" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/419309.jpg" width="300"></div>  On Serebryany Boulevard there are hospitals, children and adults, and various veterinary services.  Not counting a variety of shops, there are video rooms and fitness clubs.  There are many offices of various companies and comfortable hotels.  So, for example, at the address: Serebryany Boulevard, Russia, St. Petersburg, house 21 there are about 30 objects, which include almost all of the above life support centers of the district.  And in house 24-1 is the Archive of the Navy, in house 27 (building 2) is located the business center "Silver".  And the center of hygiene and epidemiology occupies building 3 of building number 18. The Silver Boulevard itself runs parallel to Sedov Avenue and the Kolomyazhskaya Highway, at the intersection of which with the Testov Avenue there is the closest metro station “Pionerskaya” to the described facility.  Serebryany Boulevard itself crosses or approaches close to such highways as Bogatyrsky Avenue, Testers, Koroleva Avenue, Polikarpov, Kotelnikov Alleys, Aerodromnaya and Parashyutnaya Streets.  The plans of the city provide for the restoration of Silver Avenue.
