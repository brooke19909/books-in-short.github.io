    <h2>  All clear </h2><p>  It is no accident that the playwright created his work when he was in his favorite estate - in Shchelykovo.  After all, it is located only 30 kilometers from Kostroma.  And this city is named after the ancient goddess who was worshiped by peasants.  Kostroma must perish in order to enable the future crop to appear.  Ancient rites fed the writer‚Äôs imagination.  Spending more than one year on his estate, he, of course, could not have been unaware of the tradition of burning or drowning the straw effigy of Kostroma, which symbolized the onset of spring. </p><h2>  Interrelation of stories </h2><p>  Also, the heroine of the famous play could survive only one winter, and then melted over the fire.  By the way, the word "Kostroma" has one root with the word "bonfire".  Ancient tales formed the basis of the <span>work of Ostrovsky.</span>  In addition, the nature of the Kostroma region served as a decoration for the film, which was shot based on the play by Alexander Nikolaevich.  The audience was fascinated by the wooden city, which was built specifically for the shooting.  The film was directed by Pavel Kadochnikov. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  And so they lived </h2><p>  Therefore, the question of where the home of Snegurochka is located was quickly resolved.  This, of course, is Kostroma.  Near this city is the museum-reserve of A. N. Ostrovsky "Schelykovo".  It was created on the site of the former estate of the playwright.  Manor Shchelykovo is located in the village.  It consists of several ancient buildings.  On its land is a barn, peasant huts, a farmyard, a cellar, a greenhouse.  In a stone five-window building with a mezzanine there were kitchens for the owners and servants.  The servants and the clerk lived in the rooms, but sometimes the guests were accommodated.  The master's house is also preserved.  It is made of wood and painted with gray paint.  Its rear facade faces the garden.  The house also has two porches and four columns.  The estate, however, did not always belong to the Ostrovsky family. </p><h2>  Past wealth </h2><p>  Previously, it was owned <span>by the leader of the nobility,</span> Major General F. M. Kutuzov.  The estate was very rich.  Only landowners with a very high income could afford to build stone buildings.  Therefore, the wooden manor house looks unusual against the background of a stone house for the servant.  The remains of brickwork and scattered columns in the upper park indicate that there was a large stone manor house on the estate, but for some reason it was destroyed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Tribute </h2><p>  In 1973, a literary museum was built on the estate, dedicated to the work of Alexander Nikolaevich.  It is a small two-story house.  Inside it is an exposition consisting of the writer's personal belongings, sets for performances, costumes, photographs.  You can also visit the house in which the author of the work ‚ÄúThe Snow Maiden‚Äù (Ostrovsky) lived and died.  He loved <span>this estate</span> very much <span>.</span>  Although his hopes of earning income from economic activity were not realized, he rested there, fished, hunted.  And also he worked - he wrote his works, the income from which fed his large family. </p><h2>  Like before </h2><p>  Of course, the situation at home was somewhat lost, but over time it was possible to recreate.  The building is maintained residential comfort.  It seems that the owner is also in one of the rooms.  What rooms are there in it?  The large dining room, where the whole family loved to gather at the table, the living room, the rooms of the owners, Ostrovsky‚Äôs office, library.  The playwright loved carving from wood.  He presented his crafts to friends and acquaintances.  His wife was in charge of the household.  The writer died in his office.  Although he already felt very ill, he continued to work, making creative plans, hoping that the air Shchelykovo heal.  But the miracle did not happen.  The writer died on June 2, 1886. </p>
