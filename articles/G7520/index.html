Display characteristics, camera capabilities, operating system, communication functions - these are the aspects that primarily interest users.  However, the convenience of handling the phone in terms of charging also becomes a serious factor in the success of the models.  And while the manufacturers of the same smartphones seek to optimize the energy consumption of products and increase battery capacity, third-party manufacturers offer an alternative solution to the problems of fast consumption of the power source.  Therefore, more and more often you can meet the question of how to choose Power Bank?  This is a special device, which, in fact, serves as an independent <span>energy storage device.</span>  Connecting to such a unit allows you to charge your mobile device even without access to an outlet. </p>

    <h2>  Power Bank Drive Overview </h2><p>  Externally, such devices resemble small disks with one or more connectors.  This is a traditional form factor, but there are a variety of cases.  For example, models in the form of tubes, cubes, various shapes, and even stylized versions similar to popular characters are also common.  At the same time, the question of how to choose a good Power Bank from the point of view of the characteristics of the case should rather be based on the type of material used.  Today you can find models made of metal, polycarbonate and plastic.  Obviously, metal, in particular high-strength aluminum, is the most reliable, and polycarbonate is lightweight and practical.  Plastic versions are good at a low price, but they should be protected from mechanical stress, since they are short-lived under harsh operating conditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The internal filling is a lithium-ion battery with a large supply of energy.  Actually, the question regarding which Power Bank to choose should be decided on the basis of the volume, organization of content and methods of transferring this resource. </p><h2>  Volume Choice </h2>

    <p>  The main parameter that determines the benefit of this device is the capacity.  It depends on how many times one charge of this battery can replenish the smartphone battery.  Measured volume in milliamps / hours (mAh).  It should be matched with the needs of the target device.  For example, if the question of how to choose a Power Bank for Iphone is being decided, then a capacity of 5,000 mAh will be enough.  <span>The standard model of the</span> gadget has a battery of 2,000-3,000 mAh.  That is, the energy storage is enough for 2 cycles with a small one.  But another aspect is important here.  The fact is that not always the user can be limited to 2-3 cycles.  Sometimes a larger unit is also required, even if they plan to service an undemanding phone.  For example, on a long trip for several days, the number of cycles can be increased to 5-6.  Therefore, the potential of the drive must comply with these requests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to choose Power Bank by current? </h2><p>  Each user of traditional <span>chargers</span> gets used to the speed of energy replenishment over time.  In most cases, it does not matter, since the session is carried out at home without haste.  Much more important is the ability of the device to stably hold at least the declared charge.  However, it is the speed of energy replenishment that can be important when working with storage devices.  This indicator is affected by current strength.  The number of amperes determines how long the gadget's battery will charge.  For entry-level devices, models are recommended whose power reserve is at the level of 1 A. This, in particular, is enough for servicing smartphones.  If you plan to work with tablets, then you should focus on 3-4 A. Such a distribution of current strength by the type of target devices will provide an optimal charge time of about 30-40 minutes. </p><h2>  Compatibility nuances </h2><p>  If the current strength mainly affects ergonomics when handling the power supply, then voltage and connectivity will be of fundamental importance from the point of view of compatibility.  In terms of voltage, it is important that the gadget is serviced by a drive whose voltage potential is within the acceptable range for a particular model.  For average phones and smartphones, this figure is 5 V. Now we can move on to the question of how to choose Power Bank, taking into account the interface.  In this regard, you should rather pay attention to the equipment of the mobile device itself with USB and micro-USB connectors.  The vast majority of <span>external batteries</span> interact with devices through these interfaces.  Another question is that their number may be different.  That is, 2-3 ports will already allow you to simultaneously energize both the phone and the tablet, and maybe the action camera, which is suitable for other characteristics for such a charge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Additional functionality </h2><p>  I must say that banks are mainly focused on the fulfillment of a single task - recharging the charge on mobile devices.  Nevertheless, to attract interest in their products, many manufacturers are experimenting with the inclusion of additional features.  So, for the convenience of tracking charge in modern models, a digital indicator is provided.  In addition, there are models equipped with LED flashlights.  Before choosing a Power Bank with additional functionality, it should be borne in mind that it will take energy to provide the same indication and flashlight. </p><h2>  Hiper Model Reviews </h2>

    <p>  The brand is not as popular as many of the representatives of the segment, but this is just the case when a little-known brand is left undeservedly aside.  According to users, drives of this company are durable, impressive capacity and at the same time small in size.  How to choose Power Bank from the Hiper line?  Unfortunately, the model range is not rich, but the MP10000 device clearly stands out from the general segment by its versatility.  The device is able to provide energy to almost any mobile device.  And the matter is not only in capacity.  The owners also emphasize that the model is equipped with a wide range of adapters that allow the drive to perform its tasks with virtually no limits. </p><h2>  Inter-Step Model Reviews </h2><p>  The developers of this company can be said to move the segment towards technological improvement.  They not only increase capacity, maintaining the compact size of the models, but also improve the quality performance of the drive.  So, according to users of the PB240004U model, the device for each gadget selects the optimal current strength in the range of 1-3.5 A. This feature saves time on charge and at the same time eliminates the risks of working with non-standard phones and smartphones.  That is, it does not matter how the connectors correspond to the connected devices - a wide range of charging currents eliminates possible inconsistencies.  Therefore, if there is a question about how to choose Power Bank for a smartphone of a little-known Chinese manufacturer with dubious battery quality, then it is quite possible to entrust this task to Inter-Step products. </p>

    <p>  The main segment of power banks is represented by telephony-oriented drives, but there are also proposals for more demanding electronics.  In particular, the company Rombica produces good devices for laptops and tablets.  Users praise the NEO PRO180 model for the presence of several voltages, high charging speed from the network, reliable operation and at the same time an elegant case made of aluminum.  If there is a question about which is better to choose Power Bank in terms of versatility and performance, then it is advisable to contact these products.  It is not only a matter of high amperage, voltage and capacitance - there are quite a lot of such products on the market.  The main advantage of the development from Rombica is that the company provides its devices with a multi-level security system and a large number of various adapters. </p><h2>  Price issue </h2><p>  Power banks working with phones and smartphones can be purchased for 1.5-2 thousand. These will be the simplest models without any special functional frills, but from reputable manufacturers with a guarantee.  The middle segment offers versions with a price tag of about 3 thousand. But in addition to possible optional additions, in this case, you can count on high performance indicators - for example, in the parameters of current and voltage.  It is also worth noting that the choice of the right brand is very important.  So, when deciding which Power Bank to choose on Aliexpress, you may encounter a situation where for 500-1000 rubles.  A productive unit from companies such as Pisen and Aukey will be offered.  Perhaps the claimed characteristics will indeed correspond to the actual ones, but there is a high probability that such a drive will last no more than 1-2 years. </p>

    <h2>  What else to consider in choosing? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, even the acquisition of a power bank with optimally suitable characteristics does not guarantee the fulfillment of the charger function in full accordance with expectations.  The question of which company to choose Power Bank has already been considered - in terms of reliability, preference should be given to Rombica, Inter-Step, etc. But even in choosing among these products, you should prepare for two unpleasant nuances.  Firstly, the capacity of the purchased copy may be 10-15% lower than that stated in official documents.  This is not due to dishonesty of manufacturers, but may be due to improper storage and transportation of the device.  The second aspect is that as you operate, the power bank will lose its potential.  Even the best models lose an average of 15% capacity.  You should also be prepared for this.  A decrease in capacitive potential is typical for all models and it is almost impossible to prevent this process.  However, it is possible to minimize its intensity, if preliminary, if possible, to perform frequent recharging sessions.  By the way, the loss of energy in the idle mode is also typical for power banks, so you should not count on the effectiveness of the device if it has been idle for a long time. </p>
