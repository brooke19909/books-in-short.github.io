    <h2>  Mini-hotel "Lazurnaya" </h2><p>  Azure is a great option for people who are not ready to spend too much money on their vacation.  However, tourists who choose this hotel will have to sacrifice their proximity to the sea, since you need to walk about 20 minutes to the beach.  Although, on the other hand, leisurely walks during the rest have not hurt anyone.  Moreover, it is very nice to walk a bit on the picturesque streets of the village of Agoy.  Hotels that are located as close to the sea as possible will cost much more, but is it worth overpaying for this advantage?  Moreover, on the territory of "Lazurnaya" there is a private pool where you can swim at any time. </p><p>  The hotel consists of 10 one-room rooms, designed for two people.  Each of them has a fan, refrigerator, TV, bed (double or twin beds), as well as a shower with constant hot water and a toilet.  The hotel has an equipped kitchen for preparing food for vacationers. </p><h2>  The Little Mermaid Hotel </h2><p>  The location of the Little Mermaid Hotel is the mouth of the two rivers that Aga is famous for.  Hotels located in this village often have one drawback - in order to get to the sea, vacationers must cross the federal highway.  Fortunately, the Little Mermaid hotel is not concerned.  His guests can go down to the sea along a quiet street surrounded on all sides by trees, the shadow of which ‚Äúbrightens up‚Äù even a very hot day. </p>

The hotel has a children's pool and playground, as well as a place for cooking and eating barbecue.  Guests of the hotel can be provided with meals at their request, or they themselves can prepare their favorite dishes in the shared kitchen-dining room. </p><h2>  Opinions of tourists about the rest in the village </h2><p>  Tourists who once rested in Agoy leave extremely positive reviews about this village.  They are pleased with the spacious and sparsely populated beaches, the clear sea, the abundance of greenery, the absence of a railway, the presence of two rivers with blue clay, many shops and cafes.  If negative reviews about Agoy appear, they are usually associated with hotel stays.  Therefore, if you want to avoid such a problem, carefully approach the choice of place of residence. </p>
