    <p>  The future actress always dreamed of making a career in the field of acting, but was afraid to even start, as she was not confident in her abilities.  But when she found out that her friends were submitting documents to the B.V. Shchukin Theater School, she could not resist and decided to take a chance.  And she did quite unexpectedly for herself. </p><p>  With her talent for acting, the ability to get used to the role and convey all the feelings of the heroines, she struck all the teachers, especially the course leader P. Lyubimtsev.  So she entered the university, and her completely new life began. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="photo by Maria Ilyina" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62789/2047857.jpg"></div>

But after completing her studies in 2013, she began to accept invitations to participate in films and shows where she needed a bright appearance and good acting talent.  Fortunately, Ilyina <span>Maria Alexandrovna had</span> all of this in abundance. </p><p>  But, as happens with many aspiring actors, Maria has not yet received the main role.  All the heroines she played had a bright charisma and some kind of inner strength, but obviously this was not enough to get the main role.  Her heroines were somewhat similar to Maria Ilyina herself.  They all could truly love and believe in people.  Mary herself was waiting for her only one with whom she would share fate. </p><p>  At the theater school she participated in such productions as “Chorus Girl” - Kolpakov’s wife, “Les” - Aksyusha, “Crime and Punishment” - Dunya, “The Marriage of Figaro” -Suzanne, “Over the Catcher in the Rye” - Sunny, “Run” - Lyuska, “Cymbolin” - Imogen, “Marriage of Balzaminov” - Raisa, “Farewell to June” - Tatyana Repnikova. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ilyina Maria Alexandrovna" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62789/2047867.jpg"></div>
