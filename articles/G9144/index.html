Often interest is caused by those who tragically died or were killed, especially if this happens at a young age.  Thus, the personality of Emperor Peter III, whose fate has been cruel to him since childhood, excites many readers. </p><h2>  Tsar Peter 3 </h2><p>  Peter 3 was born on February 21, 1728 in the city of Kiel of the Duchy of Holstein.  Today it is the territory of Germany.  His father was the nephew of the <span>king of Sweden,</span> and his mother was the daughter of Peter I. Being a relative of two sovereigns, this man could become a contender for two thrones at once.  But life decreed otherwise: the parents of Peter 3 left him early, which affected his fate. </p><p>  Almost immediately, two months after the birth of the baby, the mother of Peter 3 fell ill and died.  At the age of eleven, he lost his father: the boy remained in the care of his uncle.  In 1742 he was transferred to Russia, where he became the heir to the Romanov dynasty.  After the death of Elizabeth, <span>Peter 3</span> was on the Russian throne for only six months: he survived the betrayal of his wife and died in prison.  Who are the parents of Peter 3 and what is their fate?  This question is of interest to many readers. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Father of Peter</span> III Fedorovich </h2><p>  The father of Peter 3 was Karl-Friedrich, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp.  He was born on April 30, 1700 in the city of Stockholm and was the nephew of Charles XII - King of Sweden.  He failed to ascend the throne, and in 1721 Karl-Friedrich went to Riga.  All the years after the death of his uncle Charles XII and before arriving in Russia, the father of Peter 3 tried to return Schleswig to his possessions.  He really hoped for the support of Peter I. That same year, Karl-Friedrich traveled from Riga to Russia, where he received a salary from the Russian government and expected support for his rights on the throne of Sweden. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In 1724, he was engaged to Anna Petrovna, the Russian princess.  <span>Peter I</span> soon died, and the marriage took place already under <span>Catherine I,</span> in 1725.  These were the parents of Peter 3, who caused Menshikov's discontent and made other enemies in the capital of Russia.  Unable to withstand the oppression, in 1727 they left St. Petersburg and returned to Kiel.  Here, the next year, a young couple was born to the young couple, the future Emperor Peter 3. Karl-Friedrich, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, died in 1739 in Holstein, leaving his eleven-year-old son an orphan. </p><h2>  Anna - mother of Peter 3 </h2><p>  Russian princess Anna, mother of Peter 3, was born <span>on February 7,</span> 1708 in Moscow.  She and her younger sister Elizabeth were illegitimate until her father, Peter I, married their mother, <span>Ekaterina Alekseevna</span> (Marta Skavronskaya).  In February 1712, Anna became a real "Princess Anna" - she just signed in letters to her mother and father.  The girl was very developed and capable: at the age of six she learned to write, then she mastered four foreign languages. </p>

    <p>  At fifteen, she was considered the first beauty in Europe, and many diplomats dreamed of seeing Princess Anna Petrovna Romanova.  She was described as a beautiful brunette of angelic appearance with a beautiful skin color and a slender camp.  Father, Peter I, dreamed of having a relationship with Karl-Friedrich Holstein-Gottorp, and therefore agreed to engage with his eldest daughter Anna. </p><h2>  The tragic fate of the Russian princess </h2><p>  Anna Petrovna did not want to leave Russia and part with her close relatives.  But there was nothing left for her: her father died, Catherine I ascended the throne, who two years later unexpectedly dies.  Parents of Peter 3 were harassed and forced to return to Kiel.  Through the efforts of Menshikov, the young couple remained almost impoverished, and in this state they arrived in Holstein. </p>

    <p>  Anna wrote to Sister Elizabeth many letters in which she asked to be rescued from there.  But she received no answers.  And her life was unhappy: her husband, Karl-Friedrich, changed a lot, drank a lot, went down.  Spent a lot of time in dubious institutions.  In the cold palace, Anna was alone: ‚Äã‚Äãhere in 1728 she gave birth to her son.  After the fever there was a fever: Anna fell ill for two months.  May 4, 1728 she died.  She was only 20 years old, and her son was two months old.  So, Peter 3 first lost his mother, and after 11 years, his father. </p><p>  The parents of Peter 3 had an unfortunate fate, which was involuntarily passed on to their son.  He also lived a short life and died tragically, having managed to stay the emperor for only six months. <strong></strong></p>
