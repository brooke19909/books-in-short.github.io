    <h2>  The niche of this smartphone </h2><p>  Initially, the Samsung 5250 was aimed at the niche of the most affordable, budget gadgets in 2010.  The characteristics of the technical plan indicate this.  His cost was also appropriate.  The key advantage of this model was the <span>system software,</span> which was its own development of the South Korean smartphone manufacturer - Bada.  This OS combined the best features of the two leading operating systems of that time - Android and iOS.  The disadvantage of this platform was that the set of application software was very modest.  As a result, it was this shortcoming that led to the fact that even the manufacturer itself ceased to support this software platform.  Otherwise, this device was one of the most affordable gadgets of the time.  At the same time, he had very good technical specifications.  And its drawback was in system software and a small amount of additional <span>application software.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  The standard equipment of this smartphone model had the following components: </p><ul><li><p>  a mobile gadget with a removable battery installed inside; </p></li><li><p>  charging adapter; </p></li><li><p>  standard interface cord that can be used with any other similar device; </p></li><li><p>  user's manual;  at the end there is also another important document from the documentation - this is a warranty card; </p></li><li><p>  wired stereo headset. </p></li></ul><p>  Now that the new owner of such a gadget is forced to additionally purchase at the same time as its purchase.  First of all, it is a cover.  The case of the device is plastic, and it will be very difficult to avoid possible damage without such an important accessory.  The second component that is missing from the list is a transparent protective film for the front panel.  With it, you can reliably protect the front panel of the smartphone.  The last component is a memory card.  It will significantly increase the amount of stored information on a mobile device. </p>

    <h2>  Design decisions and device practicality </h2><p>  On the front panel of the gadget is a capacitive touch screen, the diagonal of which is 3.2 inches.  Its resolution is very modest by today's standards, 240 x 400. Its matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãbased on the TFT technology.  Three mechanical control buttons are displayed below the screen (‚ÄúStart Call‚Äù, ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù and ‚ÄúEnd Call‚Äù).  On the upper end of the device there are wired ports - MicroUSB (locked with a special plug) and an audio port.  On the left side of the device are buttons for adjusting its volume level, and on the right - turning on and controlling the main camera.  A peephole of the main camera is displayed on the back cover.  The whole body is made of plastic with a glossy finish. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  <strong>Gadget Hardware Features</strong> </h2><p>  Samsung 5250 is based on a single-core semiconductor chip from Kualkom with a frequency of 667 MHz.  One can only guess about the amount of RAM.  The capacity of the integrated data and program storage is 100 MB.  If necessary, it can be increased by installing a memory card.  Its maximum size can reach 16 GB. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Very weak main camera on the Samsung 5250.  Photo (specifications <strong> </strong>  technical plan indicate this) in this case, very mediocre quality.  The sensor element is 3.2 megapixels.  Also, there are no backlight systems and auto focus.  Even with excellent lighting, it is difficult to get a high-quality picture with it.  The situation with the video is even worse.  The clips are recorded only in the resolution of 320 x 240, and their refresh rate is 15 frames per second.  And their quality will be completely disgusting.  But expect the best from a budget smartphone in 2010 is not necessary.  The front camera, as you might guess from the technical specifications, is not at all. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù smart phone ‚ÄúSamsung 5250‚Äù was equipped with a removable 1200 mAh battery.  For devices based on the competing Android software platform, this was clearly not enough.  But in our case we are talking about a more energy-efficient Bada.  As a result of one charge of the battery in this case, it would guarantee enough for 1 day of heavy load.  On the other hand, the software package for this platform is very limited and there are simply no demanding programs for it at the moment.  Therefore, the owners of such a gadget can confidently count on 2-3 days of work on a single battery charge.  If this is not enough for any reason, you can increase autonomy by purchasing an additional external battery.  The necessary port for connecting it is in this device. </p>

    <h2>  OS and application software </h2><p>  The main disadvantage in this case is the software of the Samsung 5250.  Firmware <strong> </strong>  It is based on the Bada operating system.  At one time, it acted as a worthy alternative to the most advanced solutions in this regard - ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù and, of course, iOS.  Moreover, Korean programmers tried to combine the best aspects of these two software products.  But one company represented by Samsung was not enough for the successful development of this OS for mobile devices.  As a result, the South Korean semiconductor giant was forced to abandon the development of its own platform and concentrate on developing devices for Android.  The second important nuance in this case is the small amount of available application software.  Third-party developers focused on the more common software products (two previously listed OSs, Windows Mobile and Symbian).  And only after that, as far as possible, developed applications for the OS "Bada". </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The first minus is the main camera of the Samsung 5250 device.  Photos taken with it are of really modest quality.  But you can‚Äôt expect anything else from the 2010 budget gadget.  A much more serious problem lies in the software.  Even the developer company Samsung refused to actively promote the Bada OS.  For this reason, device owners do not have to expect new application software products.  For the rest, this is a decent entry-level smartphone, the capabilities of which allow even now to solve most daily tasks. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Initially, in 2010, the South Korean giant Samsung 5250 Wave was priced at $ 150.  The characteristics were consistent, as a result, the price was above the initial level.  Then, as the entry-level devices of competing software platforms are updated, the cost of this gadget began to decline.  At the finish of stock sales, this smart phone could already be purchased for $ 110.  Now it‚Äôs easy to buy such a device on any online platform.  At the same time, the price for it starts at $ 60. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Samsung 5250 <strong> </strong>  would continue to be a relevant phone to this day, if not for one ‚Äúbut‚Äù.  The software component of this gadget is outdated and is no longer supported even by the manufacturer.  That is, you do not have to expect updates to system software and the emergence of new applications.  It is this minus that is the main disadvantage of this device, which cannot be eliminated in any way.  The rest is a decent budget smartphone in 2010. </p>
