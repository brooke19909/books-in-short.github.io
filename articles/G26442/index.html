This unique reservoir is located in the 6th microdistrict of Moscow - Zelenograd.  The coastline of the lake is surrounded by forest stands.  This gives the local area special comfort.  Vacationers feel comfortable in the bosom of pristine nature. </p><p>  Although Zelenograd belongs to the administrative unit of Moscow, you can only get to it by driving through the entire Moscow region, outside the ring road.  To get to <span>Black Lake,</span> you need to retire from Moscow 37 km to the north-west. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Black Lake Zelenograd" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1142759.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Black Lake (Zelenograd): a brief description </h2><p>  Black Lake is often called a ‚Äúnatural oasis‚Äù in a dusty urbanized city.  Approaching closer to this territory, and really do not believe that Moscow is not far from here.  Zelenograd is the most landscaped district.  This is evidenced by its name and, of course, the local nature.  Green forest stands, streams, rivers and other bodies of water are found everywhere. </p><p>  Black Lake has an artificial origin.  Earlier, in the first half of the twentieth century, there was a peat quarry in these places.  And the surrounding areas were swampy.  Now here is the beautiful Black Lake (Zelenograd).  Photos of this reservoir reveal all the charm of picturesque landscapes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The reservoir has a peat bottom, because the water is saturated with peat decomposition.  It is because of this that it has a dark color.  Among the people, the name was attached to the lake - Black, which is now considered its official.  The reservoir is large enough, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe water "mirror" is 3 hectares. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Many are afraid that Black Lake (Zelenograd) has peat deposits at the bottom.  However, despite this, it is recognized as favorable for swimming.  This is evidenced by the numerous studies of waters that have been carried out in recent years.  The water in the <span>lake is clean,</span> there are also a lot of fish here. </p><p>  The beach is sandy, but its territory is small.  Sand was specially introduced to places intended for swimming.  The main reason for this decision was that initially the entire coastline consisted of viscous silt.  Even nowadays, you can find places that are more like a swamp.  Dresin is not there, but it is not recommended to independently move away from the lake.  In the forest, special routes are indicated - pedestrian paths. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="black lake Zelenograd how to get" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1142763.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What awaits vacationers on the lake? </h2><p>  The beach on the Black Lake is equipped according to all the rules.  There are playgrounds for children and sports grounds, changing rooms, picnic areas.  It is also very pleasant that the pond is surrounded by a beautiful picturesque forest.  The local area is a great place for a family day out. </p><p>  When planning your vacation, you need to remember that in these places the infrastructure is poorly developed.  There is no cafe, no entertainment, no other benefits of civilization, but this is what Muscovites attract here.  Black Lake (Zelenograd) will allow vacationers to forget about the bustle of the city for a long time and fully enjoy the virgin nature. </p><p>  It is crowded at any time of the year.  In summer, people go here to swim and hide from the heat.  In autumn and spring there are many vacationers having picnics.  But in winter they come here in order to plunge into the ice hole. </p><p>  Rescuers are constantly on duty at the lake.  Entrance to the territory of the Black Lake is free.  Because of this, there are always many visitors, especially on weekends and holidays. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Black Lake Zelenograd photo" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1142765.jpg" width="600"></div>
