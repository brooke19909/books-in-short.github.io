And although the cost of the rest here cannot be called budgetary, many guests from the CIS come here every year.  There are many small and inexpensive hotels on the island, but many prefer to stay in comfortable resort hotels.  One of such complexes will be discussed in this article.  We will tell you more about the Dessole Dolphin Bay Resort 4 * hotel in Crete, its rooms, infrastructure, as well as the reviews of tourists who have already spent their holidays here. </p><h2>  More about the location of this complex </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, the Dessole Dolphin Bay Resort (Crete) has a very favorable location.  It is built directly on the first line, and its territory is almost adjacent to the coast.  Therefore, you can reach it in a matter of minutes.  Also, guests positively assess the proximity of the hotel to infrastructure facilities.  For example, a bus stop is just 50 meters from the main building of the complex.  The hotel itself is located on the outskirts of the small resort village of Amoudara.  Its central part is only 300 meters away from the hotel.  Therefore, tourists can easily walk not only to restaurants and cafes, but also to large shopping centers.  At the same time, the noise of roads and nightclubs does not reach the hotel, so the rooms are always quiet. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="35.33815" data-lng="25.064705000000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/9/8/7/2987.png"></div><p>  A significant advantage of this hotel is its proximity to the capital of Crete - the large city of Heraklion.  It is 8 km from here, and can be reached by bus or taxi.  In addition, not far from the capital is the international airport.  It is 12 km away from the hotel.  Therefore, tourists can reach their vacation spot in less than 1 hour. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Basic hotel information </h2><p>  The resort complex Dessole Dolphin Bay Resort (Greece) was built in 1981, however, in the reviews, guests note that the hotel does not look dilapidated or old.  And all because cosmetic repairs are carried out almost annually here.  The last major renovation ended at the hotel in 2014.  The complex itself occupies a rather large area of ‚Äã‚Äãapproximately 54,000 square meters.  m. For its most part there is a well-kept Mediterranean garden with small walking paths for walks in the shade of trees.  The main building is a small three-story building.  Part of the rooms, reception and other administrative facilities are located here.  But there are also small two-story bungalows on the territory for lovers of secluded relaxation.  In total, the hotel offers guests 259 rooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View to a pool" class="if uuid-2451661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2451661.jpg"></div><p>  This hotel does not have any special requirements for guests, as it tries to adhere to European standards of service.  For example, the arrival and departure of tourists is made only at certain times.  So, registration of tourists is carried out from 14:00 until midnight, but they must leave their rooms before noon.  You cannot come here with animals of any size, such guests will simply be denied service.  In addition, it is worth noting that the hotel has Russian-speaking staff who are always ready to help guests from Russia who do not know English. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What rooms does the hotel Dessole Dolphin Bay Resort 4 * offer its guests? </h2><p>  The rooms of this hotel do not differ in large area, have a simple design and high-quality equipment.  It is immediately worth noting that there are no adjacent apartments in the hotel, so large families will have to rent several living rooms at once.  Most of the hotel are standard rooms.  They are equipped with a double bed or two single beds.  In addition to the living room, there is an open balcony or terrace, as well as a combined bathroom.  In total, up to three adult guests can live here, while one of them will not be placed on the bed, but on a small sofa.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch apartments is 20 square meters.  m. They are all decorated in light color, which visually makes them more spacious. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vacanzegreche.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Standart room" class="if uuid-2451674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2451674.jpg"></div><p>  Hotel Dessole Dolphin Bay Resort 4 * in Amoudar has triple rooms.  In their equipment they do not differ from the apartments described above.  True, in addition they have another single bed.  Their area is slightly larger - 24 square meters.  m. Since the hotel is built to the sea sideways, most of the windows overlook the garden and nearby buildings, and not on the coast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What equipment can be found in the room? </h2><p>  Tourists living in the rooms of the Dessole Dolphin Bay Resort 4 * hotel (Amoudara) are provided with a standard complex of amenities, which includes all the necessary equipment for a relaxing break.

As expected, guests can eat daily at the buffet in the main restaurant of the complex, as well as order local drinks in bars.  The concept itself works exclusively until midnight, then you can eat or drink only for a fee.  Alcohol is not served to guests under the age of 18.

The entrance to the water here is gentle, but the beach itself is not sandy - there is pebble in it, so you need to use shoes so as not to injure your legs.  But for free guests can use sun loungers and umbrellas, play beach volleyball.  For a fee, water activities are available in the special center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sun loungers on the beach" class="if uuid-2451680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2451680.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel has two outdoor pools.  The main one is located at the main building, and the second - at the bungalow.  Both of them are filled with fresh water and do not heat up.  Also, the second pool has three water slides for adults and children over ten years old.  Both ponds have a terrace for relaxation with free sunbeds. </p><h2>  What other entertainment is there in the hotel? </h2><p>  Dessole Dolphin Bay Resort offers a standard entertainment package for holiday resorts.  However, some of them are provided only for a fee.  For example, all the services of a local spa are not included in the price.  Guests can visit the hammam, jacuzzi, sauna and massage room. </p><p>  There are also open areas for playing basketball, tennis, volleyball and futsal.  In the morning and afternoon, the hotel‚Äôs animators conduct wellness and sports classes in water aerobics, dance classes.  In the evenings, they also organize themed shows and discos for adults. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dessolehotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Sauna" class="if uuid-2451669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2451669.jpg"></div><h2>  Conditions for placing with small children </h2><p>  Since the Dessole Dolphin Bay Resort hotel is significantly removed from the bustling center of the resort, tourists with young children often choose it for relaxation.  They are also attracted by their proximity to the sea, because with a child it is very difficult to travel long distances every day.  At the same time, the hotel is considered a family hotel, so guests can find a standard list of amenities for young children.  Upon request, children under 2 years old are provided with a cot and a baby potty, and they are given out completely free of charge.  In restaurants and bars, you can use high chairs for feeding without restrictions.  But for a fee, guests can even rent a stroller, as well as call in the room a nanny who takes an hourly fee. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dessolehotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Playroom" class="if uuid-2451667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2451667.jpg"></div><p>  There is not much entertainment here, but the children will certainly not be bored.  They can swim in a shallow pool, which is additionally equipped with water slides.  For outdoor games, two playgrounds are equipped at once.  There are swings, slides, and a sandbox.  Children can also be left in the mini club, where children from 4 to 12 years old are accepted.  It works every day, and an experienced team of animators is engaged in children, among which there are employees who speak Russian. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about Dessole Dolphin Bay Resort 4 * </h2><p>  The hotel is very popular among tourists in Amoudar, because they consider it one of the best in this village.  In the reviews, they indicate that the complex values ‚Äã‚Äãits reputation, therefore it always provides only the highest quality service.  At the same time, guests noted that if they again have to relax in Crete, they will definitely choose the Dessole Dolphin Bay Resort hotel.  In their opinion, this complex has the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  spacious and comfortable newly renovated rooms, which overlook the beautiful garden; </li><li>  very fast check-in, and if there are vacant rooms, tourists check in before 14:00; </li><li>  many different types of trees, shrubs and flowers grow on the territory, which are constantly looked after by gardeners; </li><li>  qualified staff performs their work efficiently, employees always smile and talk very politely; </li><li>  the choice of dishes in the main restaurant is small, but all the food is very tasty, so it doesn‚Äôt bother during the rest. </li></ul><h2>  Negative hotel reviews </h2><p>  Of course, there are no ideal hotels, because there are always some flaws, albeit minor ones.  Complex Dessole Dolphin Bay Resort 4 * (Greece, Amoudara), of course, was no exception.  In the reviews, tourists describe many small flaws, but they immediately specify that they did not ruin their vacation.  They indicate that the hotel should pay attention to the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  the main restaurant has a strict dress code, so tourists are forced to walk and change clothes after the beach to eat; </li><li>  It is impossible to use the Internet in the rooms, as the connection speed is very low; </li><li>  not the most thorough cleaning of living rooms, for example, employees do not wipe mirrors, do not clean garbage on time; </li><li>  there are a lot of plastic glasses and other garbage lying on the beach that no one is cleaning; </li><li>  very loud music is played by the pool daily from morning to evening, so you won‚Äôt be able to relax and sleep at this time. </li></ul><h2>  Draw conclusions </h2><p>  Dessole Dolphin Bay Resort (ex. Dolphin Bay), located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, is a great option for a comfortable vacation in Greece.  It is suitable for lovers of a calm and measured rest, as well as for those tourists who prefer to spend free time on the beach.  Most often, adult couples and families with small children relax here, so the hotel does not have noisy and drunk youth companies. </p>
