This is a mandatory visit to Red Square and several of the most famous museums, and after all, it‚Äôs only a couple of steps to get off the paved paths - and you will see Moscow not at all like in guidebooks.  Of greatest interest is the historic city center.  It's hard to believe, but here, next to the elite new buildings, old mansions are still preserved.  A striking example is Malaya Ordynka Street.  How is it interesting, and what sights can be seen here today? </p>

    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Once all the main roads of Zamoskvorechye stretched from the city center in a southeast direction.  The modern Malaya Ordynka street, which got its name in honor of the parallel Great Ordynka, is no exception.  There are many variations on the origin of this unusual name.  The most popular version is that they got their street names, since the Tatar quarter was once located here.  Some historians believe that these roads carried tribute to the Golden Horde.  The street has its history since the XIV century.  It was fully formed by the 16th century.  The historical buildings have been partially preserved to this day.  There are enough old mansions on this street today, and modern houses are located next to them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  N. A. Ostrovsky on Malaya Ordynka </h2><p>  In 1948, the street was renamed and received the name in honor of A.N. Ostrovsky.  The historical name was returned only in 1992 and is preserved to this day.  The famous Russian playwright was really born, lived and worked here, for a reason Malaya Ordynka bore his name for a while.  The old mansion in which the Ostrovsky family lived has survived.  His exact address today: Moscow, st.  Malaya Ordynka, 9/12, building 6. The date of construction of this building is considered to be 1810.  Today, in the old mansion for tourists, the A.N. Ostrovsky house-museum is open, a significant part of the exhibition is devoted to theatrical art.  On the facade of the building there is a memorial tablet telling about the life and work of the playwright.  Also on Malaya Ordynka there is a monument to Ostrovsky, which is a bust on a high pedestal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Ancient sights and monuments of architecture </h2><p>  Once, Malaya Ordynka Street was a popular place among representatives of the upper strata of society.  Residential estates and apartment buildings were built here.  Not much has changed these days: there are many offices and business centers on this street, but finding an apartment here is not so simple.  Of the old buildings, of great interest is the building of the Sysalin-Golofteyev estate, which has number 12/31.  This is a three-story mansion built at the end of the 18th century.  If you go further, you can appreciate all the splendor of the apartment buildings of L.I. Kashtanov, M.I. Sotnikov and A.A. Durilin.  Today they have modern offices and commercial organizations.  Malaya Ordynka boasts two ancient churches.  This is the <span>church of St. Nicholas in Pyzhi</span> and the Iveron Icon of the Mother of God in the Volga. </p><h2>  What else to see while walking? </h2><p>  It is no accident that A.N. Ostrovsky lived and worked on Malaya Ordynka Street.  Today this street is one of the most "theatrical" in all of Moscow.  Here are two theaters.  One of them is the famous Moscow Theater of the Moon, located at 31 Malaya Ordynka Moscow, in a building built in 1912.  And very close is the Russian Spiritual Theater "Glas".  These cultural organizations are not only related by location.  Both theaters have relatively small auditoriums, and it is especially interesting and comfortable to watch performances here.  Near the house-museum of N. A. Ostrovsky there is a Theater Gallery.  Its exact address: Moscow, Malaya Ordynka, 9/12, building 1. The exhibition hall is located in an old mansion built in the 50s of the nineteenth century. </p>
