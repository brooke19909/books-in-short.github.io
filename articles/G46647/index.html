State revenues grew day by day, making it possible to build fashionable hotels and other buildings with an amazing design.  One such country is Malaysia.  Petronas Towers, named after the local oil giant, are a real decoration of the capital of this distant state. </p><h2>  A bit about Malaysia </h2>

    <p>  The territory of the state spreads on the Malacca Peninsula, located south of Thailand, as well as part of the famous Borneo, which the Malays call Kalimantan.  In addition, the country includes a number of small and not very archipelagos, the most famous of which is Langkawi.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe state is about 329,000 km <sup>2</sup> , which is slightly less than that of neighboring Thailand. </p><p>  Now Malaysia is one of the fastest growing countries in the world.  In addition, state authorities are actively trying to lure tourists to visit.  For example, more and more interesting objects are being created, such as Legoland on the Singapore border or the already mentioned Petronas twin towers.  Malaysia, in addition to high-tech entertainment, can offer its visitors the beautiful beaches of Borneo and Tioman.  In addition, throughout the state there is a jungle that you can visit with a guide if you want a thrill. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Malaysia is considered by many Russians to be something very exotic, located over distant lands.  However, this is not so, because Thailand itself, so beloved by domestic vacationers, borders on this country, and if we talk about the safety and goodwill of the population, the northern "neighbor" of the Malays is much less favorable. </p><p>  It is easy to fly to Kuala Lumpur from Moscow.  True, most likely, you will have to get with one change - in Bangkok or Istanbul.  In addition, it can be easier to fly to Singapore and take a bus there to Johor Bahru.  From there it is easy to get to anywhere in continental Malaysia, and most importantly - cheaply.  Transport here is generally inexpensive, especially when compared with Russian prices. </p><h2>  Malaysia: Petronas Towers and Their History </h2><p>  The project originated in the nineties of the twentieth century, when the authorities decided to move the hippodrome from the center of Kuala Lumpur, thereby freeing 40 hectares of land.  It was decided to erect something reflecting the progress of the Malay people. </p>

He eagerly took up the project, proposing to add two small round extensions to the towers, which increased the reliability of the structure.

He wanted the height of the Petronas Twin Towers in Malaysia to surprise the whole world.  In addition, the design was also to be unusual and catchy.

    <p>  The skyscraper was erected in a Muslim style: the building was made in the shape of an octagon, and at the highest point, the structure is slightly reminiscent of minarets.  In addition, it was possible to complete the task of getting into the Guinness Book of Records, although initially no one thought about it.  The height of the Petronas towers was almost 452 meters, making the <span>building the tallest in the world</span> for 6 years: from 1998 to 2004. </p><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complex, including parks and buildings, is almost 40 hectares.  In addition, the construction of the building took 13,000 cubic meters of concrete: the building has the most powerful foundation in the world! </p><p>  For comfortable movement around the tower, a whole system of elevators is used: 29 in each of them.  They move at a speed of up to 7 m / s. </p><h2>  Sky bridge </h2><p>  Even at <span>the design stage of the</span> towers, Petronas Pelli was thinking about how to establish communication between buildings.  As a result, he came up with a brilliant idea: to build a bridge at an altitude of 170 meters, which connected the ‚Äútwins‚Äù. </p>

It was decided to place it at the 41 and 42 floors of buildings.

    <p>  The length of the engineering miracle was 58 meters, and the total weight is 750 tons.  Despite the powerful technical parameters, the bridge was mounted within three days, since all the blanks for it were previously created in South Korea. </p><p>  Now, not only the height of the Petronas twin towers in Malaysia attracts tourists with their views, but also a unique bridge, as if suspended in the air.  By the way, the first of a number of viewing platforms of the complex is located there. </p><h2>  What to visit in Petronas Towers </h2>

The height of the Petronas Twin Towers in Malaysia is so great that you can see any part of the capital.  On the other hand, getting to the very peak is not so easy: the number of tickets is limited, but there are many who want to.  Thus, it is worth buying the right to visit in the early morning, at 8-30, when the ticket office is just opening.  It‚Äôs better not to use the services of third-party companies, as often their tickets are invalid and no one will return the money.  In addition, the cost also bites - you will have to pay about one and a half thousand rubles for entry.

    <p>  It will be interesting to visit the Petronas Science Museum located inside the building.  There are many interactive activities for adults and children.  Unfortunately, you have to stand a long line at the entrance, especially on weekends. </p><p>  In the evening, you can watch a show of fountains located in front of the entrance to the buildings.  It is absolutely free and very effective. </p><p>  In addition, all the lower floors of the towers are filled with various supermarkets and boutiques, so there is always something to occupy yourself with. </p><p>  Malaysia is an amazing country that can show its guests two faces: a technologically advanced power and at the same time a typically eastern mentality with a leisurely life and Buddhist calm.  The height of the Petronas towers is not the only thing that is impressive here.  Beaches, sun, nature, people, technology - the country really has every opportunity to become something more than an exotic exotic! </p>
