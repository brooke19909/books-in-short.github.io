This appeal existed in Russia for almost two centuries and was canceled only after the revolution in 1917.  In the modern world, “Your Excellency” is used to appeal to various representatives of state power, if this is appropriate in the form of an official letter and is applicable directly to the addressee and his title. </p>

    <h2>  Appeal to ranks according to classes </h2><p>  January 24, 1722 by <span>decree of Peter the Great</span> established a table of ranks, which gave a clear distribution of ranks for fourteen classes.  Each of the fourteen classes corresponded to one of the five statutory appeals with the addition of your pronouns, their, his, hers: </p><ol><li>  "Excellency" - appeal to the ranks of the first and second classes.  In the "Table of Ranks" - these are the highest ranks. </li><li>  "Excellency" - appeal to the third and fourth grades. </li><li>  "High-born" - corresponded to the fifth grade. </li><li>  "High nobility" - sixth and eighth grades. </li><li>  "Nobleness" - from the ninth to fourteenth grades. </li></ol><p>  There were 262 posts in the Table.  These were the military (in the army and navy), civil (state) and court ranks.  All of them were subdivided into classes, which determined their place in the hierarchy of public service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Messages not marked in the “Table of Ranks” </h2><p>  In addition to the titles provided for in the timesheet, there were separate appeals to representatives of the imperial family and the nobility, such as: </p><ol><li>  Imperial Majesty. </li><li>  Imperial Highness. </li><li>  Highness. </li><li>  Grace. </li><li>  Grace. </li><li>  The nobility. </li></ol><p>  Also, special appeals were provided for clergy.  According to their increasing status, clergymen were called "Your Reverend", "Your High Reverend", "Your Grace" and "Your Eminence" respectively. </p><h2>  History of the creation of the decree </h2><p>  The "Table of Ranks" was created as a single system of rank production in Tsarist Russia.  According to the “Table”, the structure of the distribution of posts by seniority was also formed.  Prior to the publication of this decree, discharge books were kept in which records of appointments to posts were recorded.  Similar books have been kept since the reign of Ivan the Terrible and were abolished by Peter the Great. </p>

    <p>  According to historians, the idea of ​​creating a “Table of Ranks” belonged to Leibniz.  The decree was based on similar laws of some European states.  Tsar Peter personally edited the Timesheet.  The decree was signed after consideration by the Senate, as well as in the military and admiralty colleges. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description of the decree </h2><p>  <span>As described above, the “Report Card” was a law according to which 262 civil, military and court posts were divided into 14 classes.</span>  <span>After the lapse of time, some posts were removed from the “Table” and were completely excluded by the end of the eighteenth century.</span>  <span>The decree consisted directly of the schedule of ranks for classes and nineteen explanatory points.</span> </p>

    <p>  The result of the “Table” was the informal abolition of ancient Russian ranks.  In addition, the possibility of obtaining a higher status became only due to personal service, the so-called "fatherly honor" no longer mattered.  The issuance of the decree entailed the division of the nobility into hereditary, inherited by gender, and personal, served or granted.  Thus, the “Table” made it possible to increase the rank of people who did not inherit a high title, but showed themselves in the service.  Hereditary nobles at the same time were deprived of many privileges.  Undoubtedly, this had a positive impact on the development of the Russian Empire. </p><p>  It is important to note that obtaining a higher title was possible only on condition that a person professed the Christian faith.  The titles of many Tatar princes, descendants of the Golden Horde murz who remained in Islam, were not recognized until they converted to the Orthodox faith. </p><h2>  "Your Excellency" - an appeal to whom? </h2><p>  <span>In <span>Tsarist Russia, an</span> appeal to a person corresponded to his position.</span>  <span>Violation of this regulation was punishable by a fine, as mentioned in one of the paragraphs of the “Table”.</span>  <span>The appeal “Your Excellency” in Tsarist Russia was addressed to the posts of the third and fourth grades.</span> </p>

    <p>  According to the Petrovsky “Table”, six <span>court ranks,</span> one state, four army and two navy ranks corresponded to the third class.  The fourth class included two civilian, one court, four army and two naval posts.  In military ranks, these were general positions, in state ranks, they were secret advisers. </p><p>  All these posts should be addressed only as "Your Excellency."  This rule of speech etiquette persisted in Russia until 1917.  After the revolution and the change of power, such appeals were abolished, they were replaced by the appeal "Lord." </p><h2>  Speech Etiquette Today </h2>

    <p>  Today, the appeal “Your Excellency” also has application.  It is often used in various kinds of diplomatic correspondence.  <span>Diplomatic documents</span> include personal and verbal notes and more.  Due to the significance of such documents, it is customary to use protocol politeness formulas (compliments) in them.  As a rule, compliments are used at the beginning and at the end of the letter.  One of these formulas is conversion.  The title "Your Excellency" may be applied to the following persons: </p><ul><li>  heads of foreign states; </li><li>  ministers of foreign states; </li><li>  ambassadors of foreign states; </li><li>  bishops and archbishops. </li></ul><p>  An example of the use of the appeal: "Your Excellency Mr. Ambassador."  It is important to understand that the type of treatment is also affected by local practice and the use of titles in a particular state.  The wording of the appeal also depends on the tone of the diplomatic document, on the author’s desire to give the letter a friendly or restrained character.  The most frequently used address is “Dear Mr. Ambassador,” “Dear Mr. Minister.”  To add warmer friendly notes, it’s appropriate to apply the final compliment “With deep respect,” “With sincere respect.” </p>
