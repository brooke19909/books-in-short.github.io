However, now the fashion has carefully ‚Äúconsidered‚Äù this item of clothing.  That is why ordinary scarves went into the background, and they were replaced by stylish stoles, snud, shawl, poncho and many other varieties of scarf.  Now they are used by people not only for warming, but also to create an interesting image. </p><p>  However, sometimes it is not possible to find the desired part of the wardrobe in the assortment of the store.  And then some wives decide to do it with their own hands.  That is why in this article we offer the reader detailed instructions on how to knit a scarf collar. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to tie a scarf" class="if uuid-2491323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2491323.jpg"></div><h2>  Key Product Features </h2><p>  Surely many people know that it‚Äôs simply impossible to start performing any thing without exploring its features.  After all, having difficulty imagining what a scarf collar is, it is difficult to knit it on your own.  Especially if a beginner knitter takes up the matter. </p><p>  So, a scarf-collar or snood, or a scarf-pipe is a long piece of matter that has no beginning and end.  And all because this is not an ordinary scarf, but a ring-shaped one.  That is, its ends are stitched.  Therefore, the product is twisted one or several times (depending on the length) and put on over the head.  They wear such a thing mainly in the cold season.  After all, if desired, it is easy for them to cover their head, having formed a kind of hood.  It is for this reason that a scarf collar is made of warming yarn.  Most often from wool. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Fashionistas who are interested in how to knit a scarf collar know that such a product is suitable not only for women, but also for men.  And this shows the versatility of this wardrobe item.  Snood goes well with different styles of clothing.  For example, with a leather jacket and dress, with jeans and a down jacket.  With the right choice, you will be able to give your image a special charm and elegance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="scarf collar how to make" class="if uuid-2491319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2491319.jpg"></div><h2>  The easiest scarf collar </h2><p>  The product being studied, like the other types of scarf, is noteworthy in that for its implementation does not require excessive knowledge.  Just the basic basics of knitting are enough.  If a beginner knows how to type, knit the front and wrong, and then properly close the loops, you can safely proceed with the do-it-yourself snood. </p><p>  Necessary tools and materials: </p><ul><li>  two knitting needles with one working end (you can take circular ones); </li><li>  yarn of the desired color, composition, quality. </li></ul><p>  How to knit a scarf collar with knitting needles? </p><ol><li>  Each needlewoman can determine the width and length of any product independently.  The only thing if you want to make a scarf pipe is to knit the product in a circle using hosiery knitting needles.  We will first consider a simple snud. </li><li>  So, we put on the knitting needles of the number of loops.  And thereby determine the width of the future accessory. </li><li>  We remove the first knitting needle, we knit all the others, except the last, as well as the front ones.  The latter is the wrong side. </li><li>  Now go to the next row.  We also remove the first one, we knit the rest as if they were purl. </li><li>  Repeat the third and fourth steps until we reach the desired scarf length. </li><li>  Then close the hinges without tightening them much. </li><li>  Sew the ends of the snood from the wrong side.  We can say that we close the question of how to knit a scarf collar. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself snood" class="if uuid-2491773" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43230/2491773.jpg"></div><h2>  Scarf collar with elastic pattern </h2><p>  An accessory made according to the following scheme looks very interesting and original: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  We pick up the right number of loops on the knitting needles.  The only caveat - their number must be a multiple of three + two edge loops. </li><li>  After knitting the first row.  We remove the first loop, knit the next three as face, then three purl.  Repeat until one loop remains on the left knitting needle.  We knit it, as well as the wrong one. </li><li>  We pass to the second row.  We remove the first, and then we knit according to the drawing.  The latter is edge, it is knitted, like a purl.  We continue in this way until the desired length of the snud is reached. </li><li>  And this is the second version of a scarf-clamp for beginners. </li></ol><p>  Run a long canvas is not difficult even for beginners.  Well, and to sew the ends of the finished scarf from the wrong side is not at all difficult. </p><h2>  Scarf tube - step by step instructions </h2><p>  This product can also be tied with an elastic band.  But the pattern will not stretch horizontally, but vertically.  Therefore, for the execution of the technology we need five hosiery knitting needles - four main and one additional.  Each needlewoman can choose yarn at her own discretion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting scarf collar" class="if uuid-2491332" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2491332.jpg"></div><p>  So, how to knit a scarf collar with knitting needles? </p><ol><li>  First you need to decide which gum we will use to create the picture.  The best option is 2 x 2, 3 x 3 and 4 x 4. You can use 5 x 5 or more, but then it is more reasonable to supplement the pattern with braids or a braid.  We will talk about their performance a little later. </li><li>  Having figured out the elastic, you should connect a fragment of the pattern with a width and height of ten centimeters. </li><li>  Then count the loops and calculate the desired number.  To do this, determine the width of the snud and divide the resulting value by ten centimeters.  This number is multiplied by the number of loops in the fragment.  The total number indicates the total number of loops in the snood.  It should be a multiple of ¬Ω loops in the pattern repeat. </li><li>  We collect them and distribute them into four main knitting needles.  We knit with the selected pattern, moving in a circle, but without tying the hem. </li><li>  When the desired height of the scarf pipe is reached, close the hinges. </li></ol><h2>  Snood with harnesses </h2><p>  If you want to make a really beautiful product that will look expensive, you should study the following technology.  It details how to knit a scarf collar.  It can be performed by moving both in length and in height.  The appearance of the accessory will not deteriorate from this, but will even be transformed.  The only moment: in order to connect using the technology described above, you should also prepare a fragment of the pattern and calculate the desired number of loops from it.  Otherwise, you just need to follow the scheme below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting scarf" class="if uuid-2491301" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2491301.jpg"></div><p>  The gray pattern marks the purl loops, the white ones the front ones.  In the third row, the first ‚Äúbinding‚Äù follows from the beginning.  Having knitted the pattern repeat in height, it must be repeated until the length or height of the scarf-collar is reached. </p><p>  That's the whole description of a scarf-collar, consisting of harnesses. </p><h2>  Openwork snood </h2><p>  The next scarf looks incredibly beautiful, but it will take a long time to tinker with its execution.  However, thanks to the detailed design, the process will go smoothly over time.  The only clarification: for such a product it is better to use thinner yarn.  For example, acrylic or Angora.  Knitting needles should be chosen, guided by the type of snud. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="scarf clamp circuit" class="if uuid-2491241" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2491241.jpg"></div><p>  When the necessary tools and materials are ready, you can proceed to the study of the scarf-clamp scheme. </p><h2>  Hand-tied snood </h2><p>  Recently, voluminous scarves with giant loops have become very popular, which is simply impossible to make with knitting needles.  That is why we invite the reader to consider a detailed video where the needlewoman shares her experience on how to tie the studied product in her hands. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="rZro6fii1TM" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZro6fii1TM" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/3/5/3/5/3535.jpg"></div><h2>  One turn scarf </h2><p>  Another interesting idea is shown in the video. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="wOOEfi--4mw" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOOEfi--4mw" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/3/5/3/6/3536.jpg"></div><p>  Its execution is quite simple.  After all, another craftswoman talks in detail about each step.  In addition, learning the technique of knitting in the video is much more convenient than learning the basics on your own. </p><p>  So, here we have sorted out simple and more complicated master classes that will allow you to knit a scarf collar on circular knitting needles, hosiery and others. </p>
