It took two years.  And in the middle of spring 2000, the first hockey match was held here. </p><p>  Today the Ice Palace in St. Petersburg is one of the largest sports and concert complexes in the city, capable of simultaneously accommodating more than 12 thousand spectators.  It includes the Great Hall, capable of transforming into the Middle or Small Hall, as well as the ice rink, which is available to all comers to visit in their free time from sports. </p><p>  The stadium is the home arena of the local SKA hockey club.  In addition to sports matches, concerts by popular domestic and foreign performers are held at the Ice Palace. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ice palace spb address" class="if uuid-3113176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60659/3113176.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get to the Ice Palace in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  The stadium is located in the Nevsky district of the city.  The address of the Ice Palace in St. Petersburg: Pyatiletok Avenue, 1A. </p><p>  Two stops of ground public transport are located nearby: Ice Palace (routes 12, 161 and k-161) and Pyatiletok Avenue (routes 28 and 43). </p><p>  The nearest metro station is Bolshevik Avenue. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.9216347" data-lng="30.468137100000035" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/5/0/5/1/15051.png"></div><p>  For spectators arriving at the Ice Palace in St. Petersburg on their own car, free ground parking is equipped at the stadium.  However, it is designed for only a few hundred cars, which can create inconvenience during the days of public events.  If all parking spaces are occupied, then the car can be left in one of the surrounding courtyards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Great Hall of the Ice Palace </h2><p>  In the Great Hall of the stadium, sports are held in hockey, figure skating, boxing, basketball, volleyball, wrestling and other sports;  concerts of opera singers and a symphony orchestra, performances by popular music groups. </p><p>  The hall includes 11 762 standard seats, and 74 seats in VIP-boxes of increased comfort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="ice palace spb" class="if uuid-3113177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60659/3113177.jpg"></div><p>  VIP lodges are rooms isolated from other places, equipped with amenities such as a separate wardrobe, a toilet, a balcony and a table.  In addition, spectators in the VIP box are provided with a separate entrance to the hall, which will help to avoid the huge lines that are usual in the days of public events. </p><p>  In the center of the Great Hall there are four screens and the same number of information boards: one screen and a panel on the left, right, front and rear.  On them, in real time, in close-up, all events occurring during the match and concert are broadcast, as well as intermediate results of sports competitions are displayed. </p><p>  An interactive diagram of the Ice Palace hall in St. Petersburg and its 3D model can be seen on the official website of the stadium. </p><h2>  Special configuration </h2><p>  Due to the special design, if the event requires it, the hall can be transformed, increasing and decreasing the number of seats.  Thus, the Great Hall can turn into a Medium, Small or "Hall in a circle." </p><p>  Black curtains, invisible in the usual arrangement of seats, completely cover the seven sectors of the hall, making it look more compact.  The scene moves forward, the wings are located to the right and to the left of it. </p><p>  Such a transformation helps to avoid a half-empty hall when performing performers whose audience at the concert does not exceed 6 thousand spectators. </p><h2>  Rink </h2><p>  The indoor ice rink in the Ice Palace of St. Petersburg is open to visitors not only in winter, but also at any other time of the year on days free from figure skating or hockey competitions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newsdale.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ice palace spb" class="if uuid-3113189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60659/3113189.jpg"></div><p>  For guests' convenience, the ice rink of the Ice Palace in St. Petersburg is equipped with comfortable spacious changing rooms and showers.  There is a left-luggage office where you can leave valuables unnecessary while riding.  In the cold season there is a wardrobe for outerwear. </p><p>  The cost of visiting the rink is calculated by the hour and is 400 rubles for adults and 300 rubles for children under 7 years.  Skate rental will cost 200 rubles and 150 rubles for adults and children, respectively. </p>
