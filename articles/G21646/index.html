Along with this, original approaches also take place in the scientific community, where the latest developments are actively used.  However, the introduction of new concepts and programs conducive to development is far from always welcomed by decision makers.  But not only this explains the problems of modern education and science, which make further development impossible.  Stagnation of pedagogical activity, for example, is facilitated by several factors, the culprits of which are teachers, students themselves, and the inefficient <span>state apparatus.</span>  For a more complete picture of the current situation in the sectors of education and science, we should consider in more detail their problems and ways out of this difficult situation. </p>

    <h2>  Financing problems </h2><p>  The domestic <span>education system</span> has long been considered one of the best in the world.  The reason for this was the enthusiasm of the teaching staff, who qualitatively and with love for the wards fulfilled their duties.  However, in our time, quality education is impossible without funding.  And this is not only about the proper level of teachers' remuneration, among which there are still a lot of people who are truly devoted to their work.  The fact is that the distribution of money is planned based on the number of students.  But such an approach today is ineffective and gives rise to other, no less <span>urgent problems of</span> education, including the difficulty of controlling students' school attendance.  To this end, some institutions practice the introduction of special commissions, which subsequently draw up reports on the actual number of students.  This is due to the fact that the allocated money does not always correspond to the intended tasks precisely because of discrepancies in the numbers related to the number of students.  However, there is an alternative to such a financing system, which involves the receipt of funds directly from parents.  At least, the most acute problems of the technical condition of schools are solved in this way. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Lack of young professionals </h2><p>  The aging of the faculty is one of the main problems of modern universities.  It would seem that this is a normal and natural process, since the older generation is always replaced by young educators and teachers.  But every year, it becomes more and more evident that the rate of ‚Äúreproduction‚Äù of young cadres has slowed.  The situation is aggravated by the fact that because of hopelessness, the heads of institutions are forced to hire people with dubious qualifications.  As a result, the <span>quality of education</span> suffers <span>.</span>  By the way, in science there are problems of the same nature, but with their own specifics.  It must be said that many young specialists begin their journey into science precisely with teaching.  This is followed by research, writing articles, etc. But to stimulate such processes, government involvement is not enough.  Again, much rests in the absence of sufficient material support for teaching staff. </p><h2>  Lack of career guidance </h2><p>  According to surveys of high school students, most of them, even at the last stages of basic education, do not have a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe choice of a future profession.  Of course, there are several specialties and niches that are in demand nowadays, but in a rapidly changing market and technological development it is difficult to say which professions may come in handy after 5 years. Accordingly, the problems of education in Russia are also expressed to a certain extent by the schoolchildren‚Äôs uncertainty in order to obtain specific knowledge. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to experts, students should have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe possible direction of their further development in terms of education.  Of course, this does not at all preclude the need for a wide range of knowledge.  The solution to such problems in the West is to attract successful people who have made a career in a particular area.  As a rule, these are recognized specialists who share their experience with schoolchildren and students. </p>

    <h2>  Lack of practical orientation of education </h2><p>  Another unsolved problem, the practical orientation of education, follows from the problem identified above.  Even if the student determines for himself the direction of further development in the early stages, he will not have the opportunity to master the practical skills in the learning process.  The Russian education system is more likely to focus on graduating young scientists with a theoretical background.  Such problems of education in Russia appear in the future, when graduates cannot organically fit into the conditions of real activity.  And we are not even talking about getting practice in its traditional sense.  It is much more important at the training stage to be able to navigate the market of professions and services, understanding where and how specific skills can be claimed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Disability of gifted children </h2><p>  The notorious ‚Äúegalitarianism‚Äù is still on the list of the main problems of national education.  Unfortunately, even the modern system does not allow children to rise higher than the bulk of classmates.  The five-point system, in particular, does not allow encouraging students who seek to go beyond the boundaries of standard programs.  We can say that work on standard programs and methods are common problems of modern education and science, which impede development in both areas.  The originality of thinking, of course, finds its own ways of expression, but school and university should in every way encourage and support such aspirations.  And this is not to mention the lack of teaching practice in the framework of individual programs, which are much more effective than standard methods that smooth out the personal characteristics of students. </p><h2>  Higher Education Issues </h2><p>  The last 20 years there has been a whole series of changes that have significantly transformed <span>higher education in the Russian Federation.</span>  The main result of the reforms was the commercialization of universities and the provision of complete freedom from the state.  Most modern universities are almost commercial organizations that take money for their services from students.  Of course, this situation leads to other problems of modern education and science, which, among other things, are expressed in the low level of knowledge gained.  Similar problems begin with the accessibility of higher education.  Theoretically, any graduate of the school can get it.  The following are the nuances of the personnel formation of universities.  The increase in their number against the backdrop of a shortage of professional educators also does not allow for the provision of specialist training at the proper level. </p>

    <h2>  Causes of Education Problems </h2><p>  As already noted, one reason cannot explain contemporary problems in education.  On the one hand, we can name the weak position of the state, which does not participate in supporting universities, does not adequately finance schools and practically does not stimulate schoolchildren and students to acquire new knowledge.  But problems in the education system are explained not only by state policy.  The reluctance of teaching staff to introduce new technologies into the learning process causes the backwardness of Russian schools and universities against the background of European educational institutions.  For example, one of the most high-profile novelties of recent years has become interactive tools, which are actively being introduced in many Western schools.  But in Russia, even large educational institutions are reluctant to accept such innovations.  Of course, one cannot ignore the reluctance of schoolchildren and students themselves to be among the reasons that determine the problems of domestic education.  But even these factors are closely intertwined with the lack of incentives and, in general, an understanding of the benefits of knowledge. </p>

    <h2>  The main problems of science </h2><p>  Many of the problems of education are also characteristic of science.  First of all, this is a lack of funding.  Activities in this area require considerable investments - only in this case can we count on high research results and new developments.  But the problems of domestic science are associated not only with the technical arrangement of laboratories.  According to many experts, domestic science lacks a clear definition of goals and objectives.  As a result, there is inconsistency of activity and, as a result, an inability to realize innovative priorities. </p><h2>  Ways to solve problems </h2><p>  Most of the concepts that offer the creation of conditions for a natural solution to the problems of education presuppose an initial orientation to students, and not to the development and continuous improvement of new rules and standards.  In other words, the school should not force and control, but stimulate interested development.  From this point of view, the solution of problems of education occurs through an incentive to independently search for answers to questions.  For their part, teachers and educators should evaluate the proposed solutions taking into account the originality of the approaches used.  Of no small importance in this process is the motivational component, which arouses the interest of the schoolchild or student in further research. </p><h2>  Promising areas of development </h2><p>  Both in the educational system and in science, there is a huge gap between theory and practice.  The school has almost no connection with the labor market, the mechanisms of which are knowledge with the skills of a specialist, and <span>scientific activity</span> does not take into account the interests of financial groups.  Therefore, the most promising direction, the movement in which can solve the problems of the development of education and the scientific industry, is the fusion of theoretical thought and viable market segments.  Moreover, the effectiveness of this merger is possible only with the support of the state.  Still, without proper funding it is impossible to talk about the implementation of promising knowledge and projects developed on their basis. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In recent years, Russia has been in some search for an optimal education system.  This is evidenced by the reform of this segment.  Nevertheless, attempts to make changes so far do not <span>solve the problems of</span> modern education and science, but only change their nature.  If we talk about the most pressing tasks facing the state in this direction today, there is a lack of funding and a lack of orientation in scientific and educational activities.  That is, with a high development potential, domestic schools and universities provide rather modest returns. </p>
