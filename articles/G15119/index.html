    <p>  At the <span>Potsdam conference</span> , I. Stalin met with his son Vasily, who was a military pilot.  He told the leader that American planes are much better than domestic.  Stalin ordered an investigation.  The head of the MGB Abakumov decided to ‚Äúbend over‚Äù and started a company against aviators.  In March 1946, Marshal Novikov was arrested along with the People‚Äôs Commissar of the Aviation Industry Shakhurin and several other officials. </p>

    <p>  Investigators demanded that Aleksandr Aleksandrovich confess to criminal acts, otherwise they promised to shoot the whole family.  After a whole week of nightly interrogations, Marshal Novikov signed a typewritten document in the name of Stalin, with compromising evidence on Zhukov and Malenkov.  However, here the investigators made a mistake.  In the ‚Äúsincere confession‚Äù signed by Marshal Novikov, there was a list of persons known to him unknown.  Abakumov, as if nothing had happened, the investigator Likhachev made a remark: "It seems that they overdid it here ...".  According to Novikov's memoirs, he was given some kind of cigarette, after which the marshal finally lost his sense of reality of what was happening.  Under her action, he page-by-page signed a revised document. </p><p>  It is believed that the MGB needed knocked out "confessions" of the marshal and the rest of the arrested aviators in order to use them against G.K.  Zhukov.  Alexander Alexandrovich was sentenced to a significant term, which he was serving in one of the institutions of the Gulag.  He was rehabilitated after the <span>death of Stalin</span> in 1953 and was appointed to the post of commander of the ADD <span>(long</span> - <span>range</span> aviation).  In 1956, Marshal Novikov resigned.  He lived in Moscow and published his memoirs.  Alexander Alexandrovich died in 1976. </p>
