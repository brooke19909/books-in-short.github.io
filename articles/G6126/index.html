    <p>  Evaluation is carried out by specialized organizations, usually for a fee.  Without this procedure, to conclude a contract of sale of a summer residence is very problematic.  After all, buyers will certainly want to know the real value of the property. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When the appropriate conclusion on the assessment will be on hand, you can put the cottage for sale.  But before this (and even better - shortly before the visit of the appraiser) will have to prepare the property.  What are you talking about? </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The fact that the cottage should look normal is neat.  That is beautiful and civilized.  Before you engage in the sale of any property, it must be put in order. </p><p>  The man wondered how to sell a cottage quickly?  Then first you have to clean the area, if any.  And in the building itself too.  After all, many buyers evaluate real estate by external indicators.  The price of the goods will depend on them.  For example, a beautiful summer cottage with a pool is a priori more expensive than a forgotten summer cottage area overgrown with grass.  And this will have to be taken into account. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sale of cottages" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1447902.jpg"></div>

    <p>  By the way, if everything in the country is overgrown with grass, you need to try hard so that the "appearance" of the property attracts attention.  Then there is a chance of a quick sale. </p><h2>  Photo </h2><p>  The following tip helps a lot.  It's about photos.  As soon as the plot and the cottage itself are put in order, it is recommended to make several images of the objects sold.  And from different angles.  Some even invite photographers for this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In fact, to cope on your own is also not difficult.  It is important to capture every detail of the plot and the house.  So that the person, upon seeing the ad, understands what exactly he is going to acquire.  Successful and beautiful photographs are the key to success in concluding a deal.  As practice shows, the availability of photos, and of high quality, contributes to the quick sale of real estate.  Moreover, any, not necessarily cottages or land. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sale and purchase agreement" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1447900.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Internet help </h2><p>  How to sell a country house quickly?  To speed up the process, you can and even need to turn to the help of the Internet.  Today, there are a huge number of free sites for submitting ads on the Web.  They can be used. </p><p>  In Russia, Avito is in great demand.  It is recommended that you leave an ad for the sale of real estate.  In this case, it is worth describing the cottage in detail, as well as uploading photos of the sale.  If you place posts on several boards, then things will go faster.  The main thing is that the ads attract the audience.  And, as already mentioned, the property looked neat, attracted the eyes. </p><h2>  Do not forget about the season </h2><p>  What else do you need to pay attention to when selling?  There is such a thing as seasonality.  The sale of cottages at one time of the year is moving faster than at another.  This factor should be considered by each seller. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When is the best deal?  It is recommended to give preference to the spring-summer period.  It is during these seasons that the demand for summer cottages is increasing.  But in the fall and winter, the deal is unlikely to be quickly realized.  This must be taken into account without fail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="urgent sale" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1447904.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  However, it is recommended year-round to advertise the sale of a summer cottage.  It is likely that even in winter it will be possible to conclude a deal.  But if you need an urgent sale, it is best to exhibit a property in the summer.  Progress will be made faster than in the cold season. </p><h2>  Real estate agency </h2><p>  The following advice is often used by potential sellers.  Moreover, it is often regarded as a mandatory item.  How to sell a country house quickly?  It is recommended that you seek help from a real estate agency. </p><p>  They will take care of finding buyers.  Also, such organizations accompany the conclusion of the contract of sale.  But they have one drawback - the margin that turns out to be real estate.  This percentage is taken for a transaction by one or another real estate agency.  Therefore, when selling a summer residence in this way, it is worth setting a price slightly lower than desired.  So that in the end, with a mark-up, the value of the property does not deter customers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="documents for a summer cottage" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1447905.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Bargaining </h2><p>  You can attract buyers with the possibility of bargaining.  Selling summer cottages is not so difficult.  But it is associated with large sums of money.  People love bargaining.  And they try to give preference to proposals that, for one reason or another, reduce the value of real estate. </p><p>  In general, whether to arrange a bargain or not is the decision of each seller individually.  Often, citizens deliberately exhibit dachas and apartments for a higher price.  And they throw it off during the auction to the one that they originally wanted.  A common technique that allows you to attract buyers.  Especially those who have money to purchase a plot, even without bargaining. </p><h2>  Documents </h2><p>  The next step that must be taken is to prepare documents for the summer cottage.  Not many are required.  But every citizen should worry about their availability.  As practice shows, when inspecting real estate, potential buyers check the owner's documents for the property.  Having all the necessary papers is the key to success.  This technique confirms the integrity of the seller.  This means it increases the chances of a successful deal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="purchase sale cottages registration" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1447903.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <p></p>
    <p>  What might come in handy?  At the moment, most often for the sale of a summer residence the following list of securities is required: </p><ul><li>  certificate of ownership of the cottage and the plot; </li><li>  certificate of property valuation (optional); </li><li>  statements on the absence of arrears on certain payments; </li><li>  documents from Rosreestr about the absence of encumbrances at the dacha; </li><li>  cadastral passport of real estate (land and house). </li></ul><p>  But this is not all documents.  In addition to them, if the cottage has several owners, the consent of everyone is required.  Plus, you need to attach copies of the identity cards of the remaining owners.  And, of course, the passport of the main seller. </p><p>  With this list of documents the contract of sale of a summer residence is concluded without any problems.  It is enough to attach to the package of papers the corresponding agreement with a detailed description of the property and the terms of the transaction. </p><h2>  Politeness and attentiveness </h2><p>  It is also recommended to be a polite seller, attentive to customers.  Most likely, a potential client will begin to ask many questions regarding real estate.  A good and diligent seller will give honest answers, even if they were written in the ad. </p><p>  So attentiveness and courtesy are the features that contribute to a successful transaction.  Not a panacea, but if it is pleasant to communicate with the landlord, then buyers have a subconscious tendency to conclude an agreement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cottage with pool" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1447907.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Make a deal </h2><p>  Suppose buyers are found.  What does the purchase and sale of a summer residence now require?  A contract can be drawn up in several ways.  Either without intermediaries, or with them.  In the second case, it is enough to provide the seller‚Äôs identity card.  Next, it will be up to the real estate agency.  At the end of the transaction, the seller receives money for the cottage. </p><p>  But self-sale is an additional step.  It is required to come to a notary with the documents listed above and conclude a sales contract in his presence.  Also at this moment, the buyer transfers the funds to the seller.  And the second is a receipt for receiving money.  The notary certifies the deal - the deal is done.  In fact, if a person is thinking about how to sell a cottage quickly, then the suggested tips will certainly help in this. </p>
