This is a unique nature reserve in Kazakhstan, striking with a combination of various natural landscapes and their primeval preservation.  The land of mountains and lakes conquers at first sight, and yet, in addition to this, there are its <span>impenetrable forests,</span> mountain rivers and water cascades. </p><h2>  Resort Overview </h2><p>  Borovoye village got its name in honor of the lake, in the immediate vicinity of which it is located.  This settlement received the status of a climatic resort in 1910.  This is an incredibly picturesque place with a special atmosphere, where you can not only enjoy the beauty of the surrounding nature, but also improve your health.  The value of this place consists primarily in a special microclimate, and the combination of mountains, lakes and coniferous forests makes the air here special and truly healing.  In addition, Borovoe is a resort where treatment with mineral waters and muds, as well as koumiss is used.  Often this region is called the "pearl of Kazakhstan" or "Kazakhstan's Switzerland." </p>

    <h2>  Holiday Prices </h2><p>  Do not think that you can relax in Kazakhstan for a symbolic price.  Many tourists joke that in ‚ÄúKazakhstani Switzerland‚Äù there are prices for all Swiss.  However, this is an exaggeration.  A double room in a sanatorium (with meals and wellness services) costs from 3,500 rubles per day.  It is much cheaper to rent housing from private owners - from 500 rubles per person.  Borovoye resort (Kazakhstan) has a developed domestic infrastructure.  In the village you can easily find shops, catering establishments, hairdressers, travel agencies and private guides.  Many wellness facilities can be used at local motels without accommodation.  But there are no night clubs and modern entertainment centers here.  However, many holiday homes hold their own discos, concerts and film screenings for guests.  The cost of excursions, meals and household goods is acceptable.  Attention: the local currency is tenge, consider this when booking permits and tickets and comparing prices of different hotels and resorts. </p>

    <h2>  Holiday Tips </h2><p>  The most popular question among tourists who are going to rest in these parts for the first time is how to get to the village.  The most convenient option is by train from a city like Astana.  Borovoye resort is a three-hour train ride from this village.  We recommend that you use the services of local guides during your vacation.  Without a guide in the vicinity of Borovoy, it is not at all difficult to get lost.  If you are used to a comfortable rest or plan to combine rest with treatment and rehabilitation, book vouchers for sanatoriums or hotel rooms in advance.  The resort is becoming more and more popular every year, at the height of the season it is not always easy to find an accommodation option or a place in a particular sanatorium. </p>
