  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make do-it-yourself tacks?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The kitchen is not just a place of the hostess's regular stay, but also her “face”, the gathering place of the whole family for breakfast, lunch, dinner.  If you are engaged in the repair or rearrangement of furniture, redevelopment - it is quite difficult and financially expensive, then decorating everyday life with spectacular and stylish accessories is available to all needlewomen. </p><p>  One way to diversify the style of the kitchen is to create original cup holders, tea bags, and pot holders. </p><p>  To make do-it-yourself tacks, just draw a pattern on paper or cardboard in the form of a large mittens.  This can be done according to the example of an existing tack or circle your hand and add around 2-3 centimeters, which will be needed to stitch the edges, compensate for the place after filling with insulating material or just in reserve - maybe the husband will also have to put it on. </p><p>  You can also create do-it-yourself potholders in the form of a square.  If it’s not always convenient for you to put them on your hand, this is a great alternative.  After creating the pattern, you need to cut four parts on it: two for the outer surface and two for the inside.  They should be folded inward and sewn separately, after which the outer part must be turned out and put on the inside.  It will look like your <span>kitchen</span> stitch <span>,</span> sewn <span>with your own hands</span> .  If the fabric is dense and gives sufficient strength and thickness to the entire work, then you can sew the edges and decorate the oven mitts as you wish.  But if the fabric is thin, you need to insert a synthetic winterizer, foam rubber or similar filler between the inner and outer layers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can not only sew, but also knit the tack with knitting needles, crochet.  This method of manufacturing gives even greater scope for creativity.  It is very convenient to experiment with shapes and ornaments.  For example, you can connect oven mitts in the form of a house, scrambled eggs, ladybug, flower.  They do not have to be flat - voluminous tacks look spectacular and better insulate your hands. </p><p>  A tack can be a great addition to an apron, <span>cup holders</span> or <span>teapot</span> cover <span>.</span>  It can be fun to design and give to mom, girlfriend, teacher.  Kids will love the kitchen gloves made in the form of a <span>cat's paw,</span> nesting dolls, butterflies, snowflakes. </p><p>  Old jeans are a great material for creativity.  Even different shades of <span>denim</span> combine well, as they are perceived in the same style.  In the kitchen, oven mitts, an apron, a garter for a curtain, <span>chair covers</span> in the same style or with the same ornament will look stylish. </p><p>  Using a pattern and cutting it into pieces, you can create a real patchwork masterpiece.  A mixture of techniques is welcome: in the center of the potholder, hand-sewn from rags, you can place a knitted ornament or decorative element.  On the outside of the potholder, embroidery with ribbon can be done. </p><p>  You can buy paint for painting fabrics and create with children.  Sew the simplest do-it-yourself tacks from a plain fabric and let the kids decorate them.  The best gift for grandmother not to come up with!  If you circle the child’s pen on the fabric, cut and color, draw eyes, paws and attach it as an application to the base, you will get an original decoration for the kitchen.  Several carved palm-shaped silhouettes superimposed fan-shaped on the base will become a beautiful peacock tail or grass. </p><p>  To fix the filler tack can be quilted.  So when washing, it will not stray into lumps and will be firmly fixed. </p><p>  Do not forget to sew a loop in the product, for which it will be hung on a hook and dried after washing.  If the work turned out to be very beautiful and it is a pity to use it for its intended purpose, then you can always leave it to decorate the interior. </p>
