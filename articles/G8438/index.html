And if not for numerous <span>parks, squares,</span> rivers and lakes, then it would be completely bad.  Thanks to the large planting areas, Muscovites and guests of the capital have the opportunity to relax and breathe clean air.  One of such places is the Dubki park.  And although such a name appeared about half a century ago, this area has its own history, which begins in the 19th century.  In those days there was a gorgeous <span>oak grove.</span> </p><h2>  Oak Park in the 19th century </h2>

    <p>  In the middle of the grove was a three-part lake.  This body of water was not independent, but was part of the water exchange system in the north of Moscow.  And now, according to some information, it connects with the waters of the Kopytovka river, through it - with the Ostankino and Farmer ponds.  And all this with the help of an underground collector system.  Previously, there was a connection with the Astradam and Deer ponds through the Zhabenka river.  Significant changes began after 1861, when the Petrovsko-Razumovskaya estate passed into the ownership of the Forestry Academy.  They began to cut down parts of the grove and conduct summer house construction there, to lay new driveways and roads.  It turns out that the Moscow zoo was originally planned to be built not on Krasnaya Presnya, but here.  A beautiful lake, a chic forest - ideal conditions, but it was necessary to perform a small amount of work.  The distance to the center of the capital was great, and for this only reason, the mayors of Moscow decided that the public would not go that far. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The next stage in history: after 1945 </h2>

    <p>  After the end of World War II, the grove was almost completely cut down.  One person stood up for defense, Mironov, a former engineer for landscaping and landscaping.  He began to defend an ancient oak grove in front of officials.  Connected to the struggle of students, pensioners, schoolchildren, in general, the entire local population.  Felling was stopped and even planted new plantings: young oak trees, lilacs, decorative varieties of shrubs and trees.  Ponds began to be put in order.  The name of the revived park was given precisely by the oaks.  In the 80s they wanted to build up this area with residential buildings, but again, caring people defended it.  In those same years, a large amount of improvement work was carried out here.  After <span>cleaning the ponds,</span> many keys were scored.  Built a children's town.  It was soon destroyed, but then restored again.  Recently, these places have been thoroughly cleaned up, and now Dubki Park is a favorite place for recreation and walks of all residents. </p><h2>  Modern leisure park </h2>
