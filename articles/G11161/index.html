It is worth noting that this resort complex received its current name only in 2012, and before that the hotel changed several more brands. </p><p>  Hotel Le Mirage New Tower Hotel Resort 4 * has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã30,000 square meters.  m, on which there are several buildings, cozy bungalows, as well as numerous objects of tourist and resort infrastructure.  The hotel is relatively small and has only 175 rooms, which can be called a fairly modest indicator.  The rich history of the hotel, which dates back to 1998, is in no way associated with disrepair, because more recently (in 2014) all buildings and facilities underwent major repairs. </p>

    <h2>  Comments and complaints about the hotel </h2><p>  For a long time, the Le Mirage New Tower 4 * hotel (Sharm el Sheikh) has established itself in the tourism sector.  Reviews of tourists contain not only positive comments and gratitude, but also some comments and complaints about this hotel complex: </p><ul><li>  during the cold season, rooms are practically not heated, which is especially felt at night; </li><li>  the number of towels provided per person does not match the stardom of the hotel; </li><li>  for breakfast, the same assortment of products will be added every day; </li><li>  the service does not match the price of the tour; </li><li>  problems with hot water in the rooms; </li><li>  guests are offered little entertainment, and the <span>work of the animators is</span> also not satisfactory; </li><li>  in the dining room are large lines; </li><li>  poor quality of cleaning in the rooms, as well as hotel employees are in no hurry to change the guests bed and update towels; </li><li>  in the main restaurant, dishes are poorly washed, and cases of dilution of drinks with running tap water have been noticed; </li><li>  for unknown reasons, guests are not provided with cosmetic sets for the shower. </li></ul><p>  We can say that at this life stage of the hotel there is something like a crisis period.  The management should seriously work both on the general condition of the number of rooms and on the quality of staff work.  Nevertheless, if you do not belong to the category of whimsical tourists and do not pay attention to trifles, then this option is quite suitable for you, especially since the hotel‚Äôs own beach can be considered one of the best on the coast. </p>
