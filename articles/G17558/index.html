The legendary military unit in the Russian Imperial Army, formed in early 1691 in the village of Semenovsky near Moscow.  At first she was called comic.  The Semenovsky regiment owes its name to Emperor Peter the Great, who created it for game battles.  History has almost no knowledge of the initial structure of this unit.  It is only known that the number of "comic" did not exceed fifty, and due to the lack of premises in Preobrazhensky this part was transferred to the village of the same name, where it was renamed.  And already in 1700, this unit was called the Life Guards Semenovsky Regiment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Semenovsky regiment in h 75384" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/438703.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  First battle </h2><p>  In November 1700, the Russian guard, which included the Preobrazhensky and Semenovsky regiment, near Narva, in the battle that had failed for the Russians, with the Swedes, steadfastly defended themselves and were able to miraculously avoid defeat.  Assessing their prowess, the Swedish king agreed to keep the soldiers of both regiments their weapons.  The Russians crossed the ferry with drumming and with unfurled banners. </p><p>  For courage and in memory of the fact that in the <span>battle of Narva</span> they stood knee-deep in blood, the Semenovsky regiment began to wear red stockings.  Seventeen officers were killed in this battle, including the commander, Lt. Col. Cuningham, as well as four and a half hundred lower ranks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  <span>Battle of Poltava</span> and World War II </h2><p>  In 1702, the Semenovsky regiment sent a small detachment to storm the Noteburg.  After thirteen hours of fighting, an <span>impregnable fortress</span> was taken.  All participants were awarded <span>silver medals,</span> and the unit commander, Lt. Col. Golitsin, was the rank of colonel of the guard.  Six years later, in September 1708, as part of the corollant, the Semenovsky regiment successfully fought in the <span>battles of Lesnaya,</span> and in June of the following year, in the Battle of Poltava. </p><p>  During the war of 1812, the regiment was in reserve, but immediately after the capture of the French, Raevsky‚Äôs batteries were transferred to the center of Russian positions to repel the attacks of the enemy‚Äôs heavy cavalry. </p><h2>  Twentieth Century </h2>

    <p>  The structure of such a newly created unit as the Semenovsky regiment (Moscow, military unit 75384) included infantry battalions of the 27th Motorized Rifle Brigade.  Possessing excellent combat training, Semenovtsy traditionally opened military parades on Red Square. </p><h2>  Semenovsky Regiment Banner </h2><p>  On May 3 of this year, a major event took place: the presentation of the Battle Banner 75384 military unit.  On this day, the Semenovsky regiment began the countdown of its modern history.  Veterans and representatives of the clergy warmly congratulated the personnel.  And from that time on, the Semenovsky regiment (Moscow) acquired its official symbol and its military relic.  Semenovites and their "brothers in arms" were visited by representatives of the 154th Preobrazhensky regiment, formed at the same time as Semenovsky in the Petrine era.  A surprise for many was the appearance of warriors in the form of grenadiers of the Patriotic War of the twelfth year. </p>

    <h2>  Taking the oath </h2><p>  On June 28 this year, military oath of young replenishment took place in military unit 75384, which arrived at the Semenovsky regiment.  The soldiers showed excellent dressing at the gala event.  Today's new recruits throughout the coming year will be called upon to fulfill the specific tasks facing the Semenovsky regiment. </p><h2>  <strong>New address</strong> </h2><p>  A little more than a year has passed since the moment when this legendary military unit was recreated.  And more recently, it finally found its permanent and, most importantly, its own premises.  The barracks are now located in Moscow, in a military town.  Semenovsky regiment, whose address is Bolshaya Serpukhovskaya street, 35, building one, today moved to the so-called "Chernyshevsky barracks."  They were thoroughly repaired and prepared for commissioning by specialists of the State Special Spetsstroy of Russia in the Central Federal District. </p><p>  Construction work here began in January 2013.  Overhaul was carried out not only for sleeping quarters, but also for households, as well as cabinets and all rooms that were intended for storing weapons or ammunition.  All barracks facilities underwent a complete reconstruction of the facades, interior finishing work, engineering systems were replaced, and fire and security alarms were installed. </p><p>  And today, the location of the Semenovsky regiment is radically different from the conditions in which the first soldiers and command lived, when the guards units of the elite tsarist troops transferred from Moscow to the Northern capital were moved beyond the city limits - beyond the Fontanka River.  Hence the fairly characteristic name of Zagorodny Prospect went, not far from which the military stationed.  Gradually, the Semenovites began to populate the main part between the current Moscow and Zvenigorod streets from the west and east, the Fontanka and the Obvodny canal - from the south and north.  There was also the parade ground of the regiment, which in history became known as the place where Petrashevists were executed in 1849. </p><h2>  Daily routine </h2>

    <p>  Every day, one of several battalions of military unit 75384, which includes more than four hundred soldiers, goes on duty.  With arms in hand, they carry out their combat mission in thirty guards.  According to statistics, almost every member of the Semenovsky regiment enters the service on average up to a hundred or more times. </p><p>  Every day a special vehicle delivers guards and outfits to the objects intended for protection.  It is estimated that cars drive more than one thousand six hundred kilometers per day through Moscow streets. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Semenovsky regiment in Moscow" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/438702.jpg" width="550"></div></h2><h2>  Daily ritual </h2><p>  Literally every day at exactly nine o'clock in the morning the guard is being divorced, regardless of the weather, nor on holidays or weekends.  For people who were present for the first time in a divorce, this magnificent and beautiful ritual impresses with its scale.  Five companies of a rifle battalion, led by their commanders, are simultaneously lining up on a large parade ground.  In addition to soldiers, nineteen buses are parked on a flat line, which are designed to be transported to guard duty stations. </p><p>  After the obligatory report to the commander, the readiness test begins, including the weapons and appearance of each soldier, as well as their knowledge of their duties, etc. After passwords are handed to the guards of the intervening guards, all the personnel, accompanied by the military orchestra, go through a solemn march and Organized in their buses.  Then the convoy transport and with a clearly observed distance passes along the parade ground to the accompaniment, and then goes on its routes. </p><p>  The clarity of the teams and the absolute coherence of the actions of the personnel are simply amazing.  The simultaneous combat dressing and the chased step of several hundred people is so synchronized that it seems as if the soldiers served their whole lives together. </p><p>  They say that for many units it takes a lot of time and effort to prepare for such a ‚Äúparade,‚Äù but for Semenovtsy it is a familiar daily ritual that residents of neighboring buildings and local children, who constantly gather on the other side, are happy to watch from their windows. the fence. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  At first glance, it may seem to an uninitiated person that the service in the Semenovsky regiment of the capital is quite easy and pleasant.  But for those who have already passed or today are going through their military path, such a statement is unlikely to seem true.  Almost a third of their service is carried out by personnel in various guardrooms, not to mention the enormous responsibility that lies with the command.  At the head of more than half of the guard of the <span>military unit</span> are sergeants-conscripts. </p><p>  Of great importance to the regiment is the training and education of personnel, and the creation of the most comfortable conditions for him.  All elements of the daily routine, starting from the ascent to the end of the day, as well as training sessions and trainings, are carried out strictly in accordance with the schedules, so that even a small failure does not complicate the functioning of such a large and complex military unit as military unit 75384, or the Semenovsky regiment in Moscow is the successor to traditions. </p>
