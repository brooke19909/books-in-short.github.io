Some manage to do this, others not. </p><p>  The methods by which smartphones are promoted are also different.  Some developers are inclined to carry out broad media campaigns using the media, outdoor advertising, and online platforms;  others are engaged in the correct positioning of their devices, creating for them the ‚Äúdesired‚Äù image and reputation. </p><p>  An interesting way to promote the device used the company Oneplus.  This is a Chinese manufacturer that produces ‚Äúspecial‚Äù phones.  What is wrong with them - read further in our article. </p>

    <h2>  The concept of the developer and models </h2><p>  All phones that are manufactured under the logo of this company are designated as ‚Äúflagship killers‚Äù.  This means that the specified smartphone has such powerful characteristics that it can withstand the best (‚Äúflagship‚Äù) models of other manufacturers.  On the side of this device, its low cost, due to which the developers hope to ‚Äúdefeat‚Äù their competitors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, by all the laws of the market, a device that has high-quality technical content and affordable price should be very successful with its audience.  But in practice, we see a slightly different situation - for phones like the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> S6, the Oneplus 2 model, which we are going to review, is clearly not a competitor.  However, in this article we will take a closer look at the features of the device and establish its most basic advantages and disadvantages.  To do this, we will make a detailed analysis and, as expected, we will start with a description of the configuration. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Having bought the Oneplus 2 device (a review about which we are conducting), you will first of all see a red box, unusual in its design, with a minimal number of symbols on it - the name of the model and the developer company.  Inside it you will not find such a rich set, as you may be accustomed to seeing from other Chinese suppliers.  The kit includes: a device, a cord for charging (flat shape) and an adapter for connecting the device to the network.  Since it‚Äôs usual for many suppliers from the Middle Kingdom to equip boxes with their gadgets with covers, films on the screen or additional batteries, the Oneplus 2 experience (reviews confirm this) looks rather unusual. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The appearance of the smartphone, according to some reviews, strongly resembles the Oppo Find 7 model. The reason for this is the connection between enterprises;  it is obvious that some design elements (if not the entire design) were transferred from one company to another. </p><p>  Actually, the shape of the device is a flat ‚Äúbrick‚Äù with rounded corners and a sloping back cover.  The line around the perimeter of the smartphone is made of metal, due to which the whole device looks somewhat massive.  At the same time, what is most interesting, the Oneplus 2 back cover is made of rough, rough plastic.  Holding it in your hand is convenient and, however, safe for the device itself, since the risk that you drop your smartphone is significantly reduced. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Navigation items </h2><p>  The location of the buttons on the smartphone can be called classic - directly below the screen is the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button, made in an oblong, oval shape.  The display lock button is placed on the right side, directly under the ‚Äúswing‚Äù, with which you can change the sound level of the phone.  On the opposite side, the Oneplus 2 smartphone has a key made in the form of a slider.  By switching it, you can change the sound mode in the phone - the function is clearly copied from Apple devices.  This mechanism allows you to translate sounds in the device into one of three modes - a full range of audio, only important signals or complete silence. </p><h2>  Function connectors </h2><p>  A headphone hole is located at the top of the device, while the Oneplus 2 charging port (photos in this article are confirmation) is located at the bottom.  However, nothing special. </p><p>  Here, on the lower edge, the developers installed an external speaker.  It has wide functional openings, the sound through which, according to reviews, is transmitted at a high level.  True, there can be no talk of isolating the model from moisture or dust - it will be necessary to monitor the device very carefully. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Features related to Oneplus 2 indicate that the device has a 5.5-inch screen size.  In principle, this is a classic size for devices of this class, because 4-inch screens seem too small, taking into account the capabilities of modern phones;  while an increase in the display will lead to the transition of the smartphone to the category of ‚Äúphablets‚Äù.  It can be said that Oneplus 2 has an optimal screen size (reviews confirm this). </p><p>  The display operates on the basis of IPS technology.  With such a high resolution (about 1920 x 1080 pixels) on the device, we can talk about a high image density.  It is 401 pixels per inch. </p><p>  The screen functionality here is similar to many devices of the same class - there is support for up to 10 simultaneous touches, <span>a proximity sensor of the</span> device, the ability to lock the screen during a call.  In order to disable it in the future, you will need to make two brief knocks on the display. </p>

    <p>  The Oneplus 2 user, whose characteristics do not display this information, will be pleased with the presence of two features of the phone‚Äôs display, which has been established in practice.  Firstly, its surface is covered with oleophobic and anti-reflective layers, which makes the apparatus convenient in light weather.  Secondly, the model is reliably protected by glass, able to withstand impacts and scratches.  For this reason, your smartphone will last longer and the screen will remain untouched. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  It is not for nothing that the smartphone to which we pay attention in this article is called the ‚Äúflagship killer‚Äù!  Oneplus 2 is equipped with a powerful eight-core processor, which has four identical cores.  Their clock frequency is 2 and 1.5 GHz, respectively.  Given this feature, we can talk about a fairly high performance model. </p><p>  The developers installed Qualcomm's 64-bit processor on Oneplus 2 - a modification of the Snapdragon 810. This is an advanced solution in the electronics world that really makes the phone much faster and more dynamic in operation.  You can notice this even if the device‚Äôs response speed in practice - the system behaves very smartly even when additional loads occur during the launch of some ‚Äúbulky‚Äù, demanding games. </p>

    <p>  It is important to note that the model comes on the market in two variations - with 3 and 4 GB of RAM.  Therefore, the speed of their work, respectively, will vary somewhat. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  There are two cameras on the device - the main one and, you can say, the additional one, designed to create user pictures and view the image on the screen.  It is located on the front panel of the device. </p><p>  The cameras have a resolution of 13 and 5 megapixels, respectively.  If you find a discussion that characterizes Oneplus 2, you can find that the shooting quality of the device is quite satisfactory for most users - the photos are excellent due to the option of laser autofocus.  There is also an HDR function - the creation of several photos and combining them together. </p><p>  Of course, in addition to simple pictures, you can make videos.  The phone supports the option islo-mo, which, judging by the name, indicates a slow mode of operation of the camera. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The phone is offered in versions with 16 and 32 GB of internal (‚Äúnative‚Äù) memory.  Accordingly, the user is given the opportunity to choose how much the phone will have.  In addition, there is support for a memory card that can accommodate data up to 64 GB. </p><p>  In general, this will be more than enough even for the most active and advanced smartphone users.  Imagine how many videos, music and movies you can upload to your device!  Thus, from a portable device you can make a real portable multimedia center, which will always be at hand.  And on a small but clear screen, you can watch movies in better resolution, while away from stationary devices. </p>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Since we are already talking about working with entertainment content, there is also the urgency of the problem of autonomy - how long the phone can work without additional charge. </p><p>  As the Oneplus 2 review has already noted, the model has a non-removable battery.  Its capacity, according to technical parameters, is about 3300 mAh.  This is close to the average, when a phone that consumes a lot of energy due to its functionality has a sufficiently large charge. </p><p>  Speaking in a more specific language, then a single battery is enough for you to ‚Äústretch‚Äù to the end of the day in active use.  It should be noted that in the use of 3D games (that is, with the most active performance), the model is able to show work for 4.5 hours. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The possibilities of connecting the device to mobile networks are quite wide.  So, the device supports all modern 2G / 3G / 4G formats.  Here, in particular, as the review on Oneplus 2 shows, in our country, when installing SIM cards ‚ÄúMegafon‚Äù or MTS, the device determines the connection using LTE. </p><p>  There are, of course, other possibilities to connect to the phone.  For example, this is a Wi-Fi signal for high-speed Internet data transfer.  In addition to receiving a signal in this format, the smartphone can also act as an independent access point, distributing mobile Internet to other devices. </p><p>  There is also a module for transmitting data over short distances - Bluetooth.  As reviews of the device describe the possibilities of communication, all systems here work properly. </p><p>  The phone uses the GPS format to navigate the terrain.  In addition to it, the smartphone can work with GLONASS systems. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Regarding a smartphone on the Internet, there are a lot of recommendations and characteristics left on behalf of those people who directly worked with it.  As they show, this model of the device is not perfect, and some unforeseen errors and malfunctions happen to it. </p><p>  In particular, these may include: problems with one of the systems (Wi-Fi, GSM-module);  device errors during a conversation (when the phone independently turns on the loud speaker);  errors when working with the touchscreen (the device ‚Äúgoes crazy‚Äù, starts randomly switching certain applications).  Some users note the inability to update the phone‚Äôs OS via Wi-Fi without the need to download additional software (although this can fix the firmware available on the Internet on Oneplus 2 from Android to Cyanogen). </p><p>  About the advantages of the model in the reviews also described a lot.  For example, all the features, a colorful screen, a powerful processor, and a stylish design are listed as strengths.  Users note that for such a low cost (about 17 thousand rubles) they could not wait for a good device from an anonymous Chinese manufacturer.  And, of course, if we take the recommendations as a whole, then most of them are positive. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  So, we conducted our review for a device called the ‚Äúflagship killer‚Äù, the Chinese Oneplus 2. First of all, I would like to say that the products from the Celestial Empire have really become a level better than their predecessors.  Given that previously it was possible to talk maximum about low-quality copies of Samsung and iPhone, today these are independent products, endowed with powerful features and lots of features.  The same applies to our described device. </p><p>  How does the phone fit the descriptions given here?  In general, it really is what is described: these high rates of performance, autonomy and the like - they are all true.  The smartphone can really be attributed to the ‚Äútop‚Äù models, if you do not take into account some minor errors.  And they, of course, are in all phones.  You learned about them from the ‚Äúreviews‚Äù section.  In general, such failures are not critical, and they will not affect the overall impression of the model. </p><p>  Therefore, based on all of the above, I would like to make a positive conclusion regarding Oneplus 2 and call this device a strong, high-quality assembled and promising smartphone, the next generation of which can really make giants such as Samsung and LG nervous. </p>
