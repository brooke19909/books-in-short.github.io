  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Indicators of air humidity. Absolute humidity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If for an ordinary person the absolute humidity in the home has a comparative value and only affects the comfort of the microclimate in the room or the relative perception of the weather on the street, then at the professional level, many types of human activity require regular monitoring and even regulation of this indicator. </p><p>  The air around us is a natural cocktail, which contains the full range of components necessary for the life of all living things on planet Earth.  <span>Water vapor</span> has the status of a necessary component in a life-sustaining recipe written by Nature itself.  Fluctuations in the concentration of moisture in the environment occur within acceptable limits for the life of living organisms. </p><p>  But at certain points, it is the amount of water (steam) in the air that can trigger the appearance of various physical, biological and chemical processes.  In such cases, absolute humidity is of great importance, requiring constant monitoring and finding ways to regulate it.  Taking on a purposeful study of the concentration of water vapor in the air, we will determine the most important measuring quantity that determines the amount of moisture dissolved in a gas. </p><p>  Most scientific sources give an explanation that the absolute humidity is the amount of water (steam) dissolved in a certain amount of air.  The SI system measures this value in grams per cubic meter.  In the GHS standard, absolute humidity is measured in grams per cubic centimeter.  Under terrestrial atmosphere, this range varies from 0.1–1.0 g / m3, recorded over the continents in winter, at polar latitudes, and up to 30 g / m3 (and even higher) for the equatorial zone. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A study of the behavior of water (steam) dissolved in a gas revealed a number of interesting patterns.  Creating a certain pressure, water vapor makes its own adjustments to the barometric air pressure.  But the pressure of water vapor, and this directly affects the absolute humidity indicator, rises to a certain limit, which depends only on temperature.  This value is also called saturation pressure. </p><p>  Having reached the saturation limit, the absolute humidity of the air no longer changes.  The dependency table accurately records how, at a certain point, the amount of moisture in the air cannot increase, and its excess falls out in the form of condensate during physical experiments or dew, fog, rain in natural conditions. </p><p>  We clearly see that neither the pressure of the environment, nor the presence of other gases in the air have an effect on changes in water vapor pressure.  Condensation can be caused by the cooling of saturated warm air.  Physicists, the temperature that accompanies a similar phenomenon, called the temperature of the saturation point.  It is usually indicated in degrees Celsius. </p><p>  Using the saturation point, find the vapor pressure for moist air.  In other words, the saturation point determines the moment when the absolute humidity reaches its maximum size.  The use of various dimensions does not lead to a change in the readings of their relationships with each other. </p><p>  Despite the most complete estimate of the amount of moisture in the air, in most cases, it is not absolute but relative humidity that is used.  To determine this value, take the ratio of absolute humidity to the maximum possible amount of moisture that can be contained in atmospheric air for a specific temperature.  Relative humidity is measured as a percentage. </p><p>  The intensity of evaporation of moisture from parquet, wooden furniture or human skin depends on the <span>value of relative</span> humidity.  Increased moisture content may affect the storage of certain substances in storage facilities.  <span>Relative humidity</span> appears in the reports of the Hydrometeorological Center <span>.</span> </p>
