The scheme and description of the operation of this product have several difficulty levels.  Therefore, any craftswoman will be able to choose for herself the most optimal option, which will warm the body and soul, since it will be tied with their own hands. </p><h2>  Varieties of Shawls </h2><p>  Today, a crocheted lace shawl is no longer a wonder.  And even before the 17th century, Europe did not know about such an accessory.  It was used mainly in the East. </p><p>  It is generally accepted that a shawl is a huge half-board.  It looks like an ordinary scarf, only has impressive dimensions. </p><p>  Such accessories come in many forms: woven and crocheted or knitting.  There are even options from macrame or specific lace.  The long side of the shawl often exceeds 1.5 meters.  This allows a woman to wrap herself in her completely. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork shawl crochet diagram and description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/963370.jpg" width="336"></div>

    <p>  Some people call the shawl a wide scarf, which has another name - the stole.  In order not to make a welter in this matter, we will focus on the fact that openwork <span>shawls</span> with <span>crochets</span> with patterns are also rectangular.  In addition, an equilateral rectangle is a square, and therefore a large scarf. </p><h2>  Imitation filet knitting </h2><p>  Many craftswomen have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat <span>crocheting is.</span>  <span>Openwork</span> shawl in this technique is simple and not very long.  The only difficulty may be keeping the triangular shape.  But you just have to figure out the algorithm of work, everything immediately falls into place. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This model fits from corner to base.  There is no difficulty in this work.  It all starts with a loop of air loops.  In the first row we knit 5 <span>stitches,</span> 3 <span>double crochets,</span> 3 stitches and double crochets.  Each row ends with just such a double crochet, which is considered as 2 v / p.  The second row, like all subsequent ones, starts with 5 air loops.  Then we knit 3 double crochet, 3 high, 3 stitches, 3 stitches and a stitch. </p><p>  In this way, you can expand the canvas to infinity, until you get an openwork shawl crocheted.  The scheme and description of the work on it is intuitively clear to every craftswoman who knows how to hold the hook in her hands. </p><h2>  Simple and beautiful lace pattern </h2><p>  Every woman wants an openwork shawl in her closet.  Crochet (the scheme of work mastered by many craftsmen), such a product can be built in a couple of days.  To do this, you can use the simplest pattern. </p><p>  We collect the number of air loops equal to the length of the side of the future square, and we knit the first row according to the scheme: 2 air loops, 2 double crochets through 2 loops, 2 w / n, 2 double crochets in a row, 2 air loops. </p>

    <p>  In the second row we knit 7 stitches and 4 double crochets over a group of 4 stitches. </p><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__fzl"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__fzl"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__fzl"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__fzl"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__fzl"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The third row is the most interesting.  It is knitted from <span>double crochet posts.</span>  A group of columns with a common point knits 2 rows at once.  This is the vertical pattern report.  We knit it until the fabric becomes square or the length that we need to make a crocheted openwork shawl.  This scheme is ideal for beginners. </p><h2>  Beautiful fan pattern </h2><p>  This pattern is also not designed for a triangle.  But it is so beautiful and simple that it will definitely turn out to be an unsurpassed openwork shawl crocheted.  The scheme and description of working with this pattern are clear at a glance. </p>

    <p>  It was built on the basis of lush fans formed from double crochets.  So that they ‚Äúunfold‚Äù, there are half columns on both sides of them.  An intermediate pattern is created from the same columns with a crochet and chains of air loops.  To make the work more interesting, it can be performed in two stages.  First, we knit half the length in one direction, and the second half we start from the bottom of the base of the finished fabric.  But this is more acceptable for a long scarf or stole. </p><p>  When the product is ready, it is necessary to tie it with a hem pattern and attach a lush fringe, which adds festivity to any shawl. </p><h2>  Shawl with rhombuses </h2><p>  This is another variation on the theme of fillet knitting.  A crocheted openwork shawl, the scheme of which is presented below, is performed from the lower corner to the base.  Adding loops occurs at the edges, due to which it looks organic.  The central part of the shawl consists of a simple alternation of double crochet and air loops, which is the basis of the filet pattern.  The edges are made with rhombuses with a filled center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet openwork shawl" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/963373.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In this model, a beautiful fringe is required.  It is attached after the entire product is finished and tied with an edging.  Measured to the desired length, several pieces of the main yarn, they are folded in half and partially stretched through the hole with the edge.  Free ends are threaded into the resulting loop and tightened.  So the openwork shawl crocheted takes on a finished look. </p><h2>  Fan shawl from the base </h2><p>  Before that, we looked at <span>crocheting</span> an openwork <span>shawl, the patterns of</span> which were built either from the corner or square.  Now let's pay attention to a more traditional way of making this accessory. </p><p>  The diagram clearly shows that knitting begins with a set of air loops.  In the first row, arches from the same military style with crochet columns are knitted.  But starting from the second row, the main pattern is built using double crochet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted openwork shawl" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/963374.jpg" width="500"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  In each row, the number of loops decreases.  Due to this, the canvas gradually narrows and eventually comes to a triangular shape. </p><p>  This pattern also requires fringe.  You can make it not only with the help of brushes, as in the previous version, but also by knitting large arches from air loops at the edges with small gaps between them.  This will give an interesting fringe that will beautifully hang from the shoulders of a woman wearing this shawl. </p><h2>  Semicircular model </h2><p>  For some reason, it is generally accepted that a crocheted openwork shawl, the scheme and description of which is the subject of this article, should be only triangular.  But some craftswomen have long developed patterns of semicircular products.  And they look no worse than those that have a corner. </p><p>  To tie this shawl, you must have an average level of skill, since there are many transitions from one patterned pattern to another.  At the same time, there are no complex loops and columns in the scheme, which guarantees the success of almost every craftswoman who has a sufficient level of attention. </p>

    <p>  The presence of sharp angles in the pattern does not foresee fringe shawl decoration.  This adds to it a certain charm that real fashionistas will appreciate. </p><p>  As we have already seen, making a shawl from yarn with a hook is not difficult.  The main thing is to stock up on threads, patience, attentiveness and inspiration.  And everything will turn out, even if the needlewoman is at the initial level of skill. </p>
