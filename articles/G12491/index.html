    <h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  All children just love soft-stuffed toys.  We offer all creative mothers and grandmothers to make a pillow for their beloved child, which will serve not only as intended for sleep, but also as an attribute for entertainment.  We will do it in the form of a cat figure.  We offer master classes that describe the technology for making such a product from fabric and yarn.  How is a cat pillow made with your own hands?  We learn this from the following sections of the article. </p><h2>  We will knit a soft toy for the child - a striped pillow.  Preparation stage </h2><p>  We will perform this version of the product with knitting needles No. 4. In addition to them, we will need yarn ‚Äúgrass‚Äù and children's acrylic.  Choose the color of the thread as you wish.  So that the <span>knitted pillow</span> "cat" is not monophonic and boring, you can take fluffy yarn of several colors and draw a striped figure with it.  To fill the product, prepare a synthetic winterizer or holofiber.  Still in the work you will need a needle, thread for sewing and floss, accessories "eyes" or two buttons.  Well, so that the cat <span>(pillow, knitting with knitting needles)</span> is beautiful, you will need more inspiration, desire and diligence.  We stock up on them and get to work! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted pillow cat" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/357473.jpg?1395411407273" width="395"></div>

We collect 80 loops on the knitting needles.  We perform the front smooth surface of the canvas in straight and reverse rows until its height reaches 10 centimeters.  Then we attach the thread "grass" (in two additions) and continue to work with it.  Knit another 20 centimeters straight.  If you have this type of yarn in several colors, then do the stripes, alternating threads of different shades every four rows.  Next, we again turn to the acrylic thread and knit with it 10 centimeters, close the loops.  The result was a canvas in the form of a rectangle.  The side from where the knitting started will be the bottom of the product.  On the seamy side we perform seams: one vertical and two horizontal.  During this procedure, leave a hole. </p><p>  Our knitted cat pillow will have legs and a tail.  In order to fulfill the forelimbs, we draw 14 stitches on the knitting needles and draw them with a <span>front smooth surface with a</span> straight cloth to a height of 16 centimeters, alternating the colors of the threads.  Next, close the loop.  Thus, we knit two parts.  The hind legs are made with front stitch of 20 loops to a web height of 18 centimeters.  We sew the details from below and from the side.  Turn out through the hole on top of the foot. </p><p>  To make the tail, we collect 10 loops.  We knit them over 22 centimeters.  Close the eyelets. </p><p>  Next, the pillow "cat", with his own hands tied, is stuffed with a filler.  We distribute this material evenly inside the product.  The hole is sewn with a <span>hidden seam.</span>  The upper two corners of the pillow are made in the form of ears.  For this, the thread "grass" we sew them obliquely, forming triangles.  After performing this action, the ears begin to protrude, and the product immediately takes on the shape of a figure.  We embroider the bangs and villi inside the ears with the same thread. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>Embroider a</span> pink mouline thread with a nose, mustache and mouth.  Sew on the eyes.  Attach the paws, having previously filled them with a synthetic winterizer (holofiber).  Place the tail in the right place.  At its tip from the "grass", perform a brush.  DIY pillow-cat tied and framed.  Your baby will be happy to play with her and sleep. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cat pillow knitting" class="if" height="461" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/357474.jpg?1395411445897" width="401"></div>

    <h2>  Textile pillow "cat" </h2><p>  With our own hands we will make a similar product from fabric.  For these purposes, fleece, thin felt, cotton, flannel are suitable.  We also prepare paper, pencil, scissors, filler, needle, thread for sewing and embroidery for work. </p><p>  We make a template in the form of a cat figurine from paper.  Since in our country this product is both a toy and a pillow, it means that the body pattern should be voluminous, that is, in the form of a square, a wide rectangle or a circle.  Transfer the pattern to a double folded fabric and circle it.  Further, without cutting anything, we flash along the contours on a sewing machine or manually.  In this case, leave free space about 10 centimeters along the side line of the figure. </p><p>  Now we cut the workpiece, retreating from the seams by 1 centimeter.  We twist the product, stuff it with filler and sew a hole.  In the same way we make out the details of the legs and ears.  Sew them in the right places.  We embroider a muzzle with thread floss: eyes, nose, mouth, mustache.  On the tummy and back, you can embroider or applique from fabric in the form of stripes.  Pillow toy "Cat" with your own hands is made and ready to serve as intended. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sew a cat pillow with your own hands" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/357471.jpg?1395411497585" width="570"></div>

    <h2>  With a flick of the wrist, an old sweater turns into an original product </h2><p>  You can sew a cat pillow with your own hands from old clothes.  How?  We are studying a master class.  On the table, lay out the sweater, turned to the wrong side.  Draw the outline of the cat‚Äôs head with ears on the front part with chalk.  This will be the main part of the pillow.  Cut two such blanks, capturing the back part.  From one sleeve we will make a tail, cutting out its pattern in the form of a long strip. </p><p>  On a typewriter we flash all the blanks and twist.  If you are making a cat out of a knitwear, iron the parts before sewing.  They will then be easier to connect with each other.  Fill them with holofiber and close the holes.  Sew the detail of the tail to the torso.  From felt in black and white, we cut the blanks for the eyes and nose.  Sew them on a small pillow.  Embroider mouth and mustache.  That's all, the old sweater has become a new beautiful toy. </p>
