What documents are needed to buy a phone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Transactions in Russia have a huge number of features.  For certain operations, certain documents must be provided.  For example, an identity card.  Without it, it‚Äôs hard to imagine a sales transaction.  But there are exceptions.  This article will tell you if you need a passport when buying a phone in a particular case.  What kind of documents can come in handy?  What features of the transaction are recommended to pay attention to?  Understanding the question posed is not so difficult.  Especially if you carefully study the legislation of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Age to close a deal </h2><p>  The first issue to consider is the age of the buyer.  The thing is that often transactions related to the sale of goods are not accessible to part of the population.  It's about children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Do I need a passport when buying a phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1650679.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Under the laws of the Russian Federation, minors are entitled to enter into transactions of a certain nature with the permission of their parents after 6 years.  From 14 (or after receiving a passport) the list of these increases.  By adulthood, any transactions are permitted. </p><p>  How to buy a mobile phone?  At what age can a deal be made?  In practice, even a teenager can purchase a mobile device.  Since 14 years old for sure.  But in some stores they have the right to refuse the transaction.  It should be noted that 100% will be able to buy a mobile or any other gadget in Russia after adulthood. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Checkout </h2><p>  The most commonly studied problem arises when placing a telephone.  As already mentioned, when buying a gadget there is a sale.  Usually, after the transaction is completed, a citizen is issued a check.  And nothing more.  We are talking about contacting a regular hardware store. </p><p>  In practice, there are no problems with buying a mobile device in such places.  To think about whether you need a passport when buying a phone, it is necessary if you plan to purchase a used device.  Typically, such transactions require separate attention, both on the part of the buyer and the seller. </p><p>  In fact, no documents are actually asked from a person.  Simply tell the seller which particular phone model you want to purchase.  Further, everything will depend on the specific location of the transaction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new phones" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1650681.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What you need to buy </h2><p>  How are new phones sold?  The population often wonders what to bring with them to conclude a deal with the store.  What papers may they require? </p><p>  It has already been said that a lot depends on a particular outlet.  Most often, a citizen only needs money to get a mobile phone.  This will be enough. </p><p>  Of course, no one will sell the phone to a very small child.  But a teenager will be able to bring the idea to life.  For safety reasons, you can apply for a minor permission of parents to purchase a mobile phone.  This technique will protect against failures. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Accordingly, an identity card is not such an important document for the sale of a telephone.  It is not always necessary.  Especially when it comes to a new gadget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone purchase" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1650678.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Credit and installment plan </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the proposed scheme is relevant only for those who decide to immediately buy a phone in a store.  Loans and installments are separate transactions.  It follows that buying a mobile phone will be slightly different.  What exactly? </p><p>  Firstly, loans and installments are offered exclusively to adult citizens.  Secondly, it is necessary to confirm your income documented.  And this is just the beginning. </p><p>  Do I need a passport when buying a phone in installments or on credit in a store?  Yes, without fail.  Without it, a citizen cannot make a purchase.  As already mentioned, you will additionally have to bring with you a certificate of income (form 2-PIT). </p><h2>  With hands </h2><p>  In today's commodity market, some smartphone models are expensive.  And they prefer to buy "with hands."  For example, used.  This situation is not the rarest.  In Russia, it is common - you can see a lot of ads for the sale of gadgets, not just mobile phones.  What to prepare for the future buyer? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Do I need a passport when buying a phone "with hands"?  It all depends on which seller came across.  Often, an identification card is required from the buyer.  Second-hand children try not to sell phones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to buy a mobile phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1650683.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In addition, it is recommended that you ask the seller for identification.  It is advisable to request a copy and original or take photos of the passport.  This technique will help protect the buyer from fraud. </p><p>  Accordingly, a passport is required for some operations.  It can be neglected if the person immediately pays for the purchase in the store.  In other cases, an identity card is one of the main securities involved in the transaction. </p><h2>  With sim card </h2><p>  Do I need a passport when buying a phone?  As already mentioned, for some transactions this is a mandatory paper.  And sometimes it is not needed.  For example, when paying for the entire purchase (new) in the store, an identity card is not requested. </p><p>  Only exceptions are everywhere.  Therefore, one should not think that a passport will not be asked from a buyer in a store.  We can say with confidence - ID must be presented when it is planned to purchase a device with a built-in SIM card. </p><p>  The thing is that the phone number requires registration.  To do this, a passport is required.  This means that all persons who have this document have the right to conclude a transaction, unless otherwise specified in the charter of the trading network. </p><h2>  From map </h2><p>  Some problems may arise when payment is made by card, by bank transfer.  Payment in cash does not require an identification card, if it is not a loan or installment plan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what documents are needed to buy a phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1650680.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The seller has the right to request a passport from a citizen if new phones are paid by bank transfer.  For example, with a bank card.  In practice, this phenomenon is rare. </p><p>  Nevertheless, this fact will still have to be taken into account.  Especially for those who prefer to use contactless payment.  To confirm the operation, the pin code from the card is not requested.  Therefore, the seller has the right to claim a passport in order to ensure the security of the transaction.  This is not necessary to be surprised. </p><h2>  Additional Warranty </h2><p>  Do I need a passport when buying a phone?  It has already been said that this document is necessary only in certain circumstances.  And this is important to consider. </p><p>  It is safe to say that buying used phones without an ID card is a risky business.  It is important to request a passport from the seller (and the buyer too). </p><p>  In the store, a passport is required not only when applying for a loan or installment plan.  It is noted that when purchasing an additional warranty on the device, it is important to have an identity card with you.  Without it, the transaction will be denied.  More precisely, it will turn out to buy a phone without a SIM card, but to purchase an additional guarantee or number is not. </p><h2>  Buyer Memo </h2><p>  Now you can think about what to look for when buying a phone.  This transaction requires a careful attitude of the consumer.  Otherwise, the citizen runs the risk of either buying a bad device, or even face deception. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="buy used on phones" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1650682.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Among the main tips for buying a mobile phone, the following points are distinguished: </p><ol><li>  Make a deal is best in official retail chains.  Used gadgets should not be bought. </li><li>  If you want to buy a "used" phone, you must definitely check it before paying.  It is recommended to pay attention to the condition of the housing, as well as to the integrity of the structure.  It‚Äôs best to request documents from your seller‚Äôs mobile device.  In this case, it is necessary to verify the serial numbers on the device and in the documentation. </li><li>  When buying "on hand" you need to ask for an identity card.  It would be better if it was a civil passport. </li><li>  Be skeptical of low device prices.  Mobile phones today have different price categories.  There are expensive models, and not really.  If the gadget itself is expensive, then the understated cost is an explicit indication of the disadvantages of a particular device. </li><li>  When choosing a model in the store, you can ask to demonstrate the quality of the device.  In some cases, it is recommended that you try to make a phone call. </li></ol>

    <p>  Perhaps this is the end of all the recommendations.  From now on, it is clear what documents are needed to buy a phone.  In fact, you can do it only in cash.  The deal under study is not complicated in itself.  Therefore, you should be very worried about the documents provided during its implementation only when it comes to purchasing used devices.  Newer phones are easier to buy. </p>
