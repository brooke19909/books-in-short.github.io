  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Trip to America. Experienced Traveler Tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  America is the only part of the world divided into two continents.  If a lot has been written about the countries of Latin America, then such a huge country in <span>North America,</span> like the USA, remains a white spot for travel agencies.  Despite all the difficulties and visa problems, every year thousands of Russians visit this country.  Many of them are attracted by great opportunities for outdoor activities, unique natural areas, beach vacations and various attractions. </p><p>  The USA is among the countries with a high income level and therefore there is a particularly <span>urgent problem</span> for tourists how to see more and pay less.  Let‚Äôs try to figure out how best to travel to America and save time and money.  First of all, you need to choose a method of transportation.  The best of them is a trip by car, because America is a country on wheels, all other modes of transportation are simply impractical. </p><p>  In order to achieve the goal of your trip: to see as much as possible, a trip to America must be carefully planned.  A route developed in detail will help to save not only time and money, but also nerves, and this is no less important on the road.  The Internet has a lot of information about the United States, so you need to know in advance how to get to the places of interest to you, to clarify the mode of operation and the cost of tickets for entry.  Reservation of motels and campsites for spending the night through the same Internet or travel agencies will avoid problems, you will not need to look for an overnight stay when your eyes are already sticking together. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The peak season for tourists in the United States is in the summer months, but experienced travelers are advised to visit the northern part of the country in the fall, and the central and southern in the spring.  A trip to America at this time will allow you to avoid crowds of tourists, and even give you the opportunity to get significant discounts on air travel and other travel services.  The climatic conditions will also be much more comfortable, for example, instead of the sweltering summer heat in the Grand Canyon, you can enjoy the flowering of the surrounding vegetation in spring. </p><p>  A trip to America will be much more profitable and more fun if you travel not alone, but in company.  The cost of transportation and overnight will be reduced immediately.  In addition, there are annual passes to <span>national parks</span> (one pass is valid throughout the country), such a pass gives the right to visit the reserve free of charge to everyone who is in the car with its owner.  Thus, the pass pays off after visiting several reserves, and in total there are about 390 in the United States. Overnight on the way not in the city center, but closer to the outskirts, you will spend not only less money, but also save travel time. </p><p>  Get up early in the morning, sleep off and be lazy at home, in this case the expression ‚ÄúTime is money‚Äù is relevant.  Each extra hour will allow you to get closer to the purpose of the trip, and you can more fully enjoy exploring the sights.  In addition, arriving earlier in popular tourist destinations, you will be spared the crush in a large mass of tourists who will come here later.  Regarding nutrition.  <span>Holidays in America</span> spent on wheels will leave you more impressed if you do not spend precious time visiting restaurants.  Look for places where there is a buffet, where you can eat quickly and eat any amount of food for a fixed amount, you can‚Äôt take anything out.  In extreme cases, you can be content with eating sandwiches. </p><p>  It‚Äôs better to refuel with gasoline on highways; in cities, gasoline is usually a bit more expensive.  The cheapest gasoline in the <span>states of Texas</span> and New Mexico, then the price of gasoline is constantly growing, this must be taken into account when refueling the gas tank again.  And another important tip: take care of your strength, do not overwork, remember that your trip to America is primarily connected with vacation.  Try to observe the usual regimen, and in any walks do not forget to take water, sun protection cream and a hat.  Happy Travel! </p>
