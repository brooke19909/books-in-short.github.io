Traveling through its cities can be an ideal option for a honeymoon.  However, if your wedding was a long time, then timed the trip to another event.  From this pleasure will not be less.  Favorite cities for Russian tourists are Milan and Venice.  I would like to note that the distances between the settlements here are not at all the same as in Russia, so the journey from one to another will not take much time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="from Milan to Venice how to get" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1817820.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The journey begins </h2><p>  A trip to Italy must be planned in advance.  Consider the most attractive sights and interesting places where you certainly want to visit and use the navigator to build a route.  Today we are interested in a tour from Milan to Venice.  How to get from one city to another with minimal time and maximum comfort. </p><h2>  Where are we going first </h2><p>  We recommend that you first visit Milan.  This is the most populated city in the country, which attracts tourists with the opportunity to stroll through the many boutiques and plunge into the noisy, nightlife.  But that is not all.  This is a real gastronomic center of Italian cuisine.  Here you can taste delicious traditional dishes and drinks, and you will remember them for many more years in a row. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Below we will take a closer look at how to get from Milan to Venice, but for now, let's stay a little longer in this wonderful city.  Be sure to visit historic sites and attractions.  For example, the incredibly beautiful Gothic Duomo Cathedral, the oldest shopping arcade of Victor Emanuel Gallery, the medieval <span>Sforza Castle, a</span> picturesque park.  However, get ready for the fact that walking around the city center is quite expensive.  And if money remains catastrophically small, then it is time to move from Milan to Venice.  How to get to the most romantic city, we‚Äôll talk now. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="from Milan to Venice by train" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1817818.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Railway </h2><p>  This is the most economical mode of transport worldwide.  Italy is no exception.  However, the quality of service in wagons that travel across Russia and Europe is strikingly different.  Therefore, the trip from Milan to Venice by train is enjoyable and tireless. </p><p>  Let us tell you a little about what the internal Frecciarossa trains are.  This is a convenient, fast and comfortable way to travel.  A wide chair and luggage space are provided.  The car has air conditioning and sound systems, electrical outlets and monitors, Wi-Fi is available.  Since it is fashionable to get from Milan to Venice relatively quickly, meals are not included in the price, but there is a cafe-bar and restaurant here, so if you didn‚Äôt have time to have lunch, then you will pass the part of the way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="distance from Milan to Venice" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1817636.jpg" width="400"></div>

The distance from Milan to Venice is only 273 km.  By European standards, it‚Äôs almost nearby.  The Russian tourist, who for the first time abroad, is somewhat shocking.  It's to ride all day.  Not at all, there are excellent roads for any type of transport. </p><p>  What do you think, knowing the distance from Milan to Venice, how many times will it take on your journey?  You won‚Äôt guess, only two hours if you use the fast train. </p><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  The interest is understandable, especially when you consider that we have already spent most of the savings in point No. 1. Based on cash balances, you can just choose which train you will use.  Usually they <span>focus on what</span> is left less - time or money.  From Milan to Venice by train can be reached in 120 minutes, and it costs 30 euros one way.  If it is too expensive, then take a regular ticket.  The price is two times lower, that is 15 euros, and you will go only an hour longer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="italy trains" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1817638.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A little about the trip itself </h2><p>  It should be noted that Italy's trains are very comfortable.  Snow-white curtains, clean tablecloths, polite staff, the impression is the most pleasant.  Places on the tickets are not indicated, so sit where you are comfortable.  A deliveryman of various delicacies will surely pass through the car, seducing with the aroma of coffee and pastries.  If you want, you can have a bite. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What else do you want to add?  Trains in Italy have a smooth ride.  In addition, on both sides of the railway you can see the Adriatic Sea.  It seems that you are not driving, but swimming.  But here you slow down the path and stop at the river bus.  We transfer to it, pay 6.5 euros and go to the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tour milan venice" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1817816.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Flight </h2><p>  At such a distance, many of you frown.  Indeed, this is not the most convenient option.  Despite the fact that flying quite a bit, you have to make a huge number of transfers.  First of all, you need to <span>get</span> to the airport.  In this case, it is Malpensa.  In order to get to it, <span>you need</span> to spend about 60 minutes of personal time.  Then another registration, and, finally, the flight itself.  There are no direct flights, a transfer is required.  Four hours later, you arrive at the Marco Polo airport, and from it still go to Venice itself.  At a cost of 200 euros, a rather cumbersome route. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bus milan venice" class="if" height="292" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1817641.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  From Milan with a guide </h2><p>  Traveling by land looks a lot easier and more convenient than air travel.  In any case, the Milan - Venice tour is most often carried out in this way.  And this is not surprising, it is very convenient and fast.  An excursion from Milan to Venice will cost about 600 euros from a group of three people.  The price includes moving to Venice and a <span>tour</span> of the most beautiful places.  This is the square of San Marco, Campanile.  Typically, excursions visit a glass workshop and observe the work <span>of blowing various products</span> .  And, of course, every tourist wants to ride on the legendary gondolas.  By evening, the group returns. </p><h2>  Shuttle Buses </h2><p>  Tour operators use their own cars for excursions.  But this is not the only opportunity to get to Venice by highway.  Ordinary buses run between cities.  Near the train station you can buy tickets and hit the road.  This is a great option for traveling, especially considering that the road surface in Italy is perfect.  At the same time, buses cannot be compared with those that service city routes with us.  They are roomy, comfortable and safe. </p><p>  True, there is one minus.  Bus Milan - Venice does not go on a direct route.  To make such a trip, you will first have to call in the city of Padova, where there are flights every other day.  The road will take about 5 hours.  A ticket costs about 25 euros.  And already from here you can transfer and go to the city on the water.  If you have a lot of free time, then <span>calmly</span> take such a trip. </p><h2>  By car </h2><p>  By the way, you can rent a car in the city and go on a trip on it.  If you drive well and own a card, then this is a great option.  Do not forget to get acquainted with the route in advance and indicate on the map how to get from Milan to Venice yourself.  Between these cities, a high-quality, modern freeway has been built, on which you can ride with a breeze.  However, renting a car will cost much more than a bus trip.  In addition, the mentioned freeway is toll.  To go to her, you will need to <span>pay</span> 43 euros.  As a result, the amount will be quite impressive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get from Milan to Venice on your own" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1817649.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, there are many options for traveling Milan - Venice.  The most economical and convenient is the movement by rail.  Second place can be left behind the car.  It is very comfortable and fast, but expensive.  Although, if not financially constrained, then why not.  The third place is occupied by a regular bus.  A huge loss of time, but not too high a price.  With a guided tour you can move around even if you are not a member.  To do this, you need to be at the place of departure and simply agree with the driver.  Finally, the last in our ranking is air travel.  Too many transplants, long and expensive.  Traveling in Italy may be the most interesting for you and family members. </p>
