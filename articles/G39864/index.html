The main distinguishing feature of such devices is a higher sensitivity compared to shelf analogs.  However, a floor-mounted home audio system will work fully only if it is provided with a powerful amplifier, otherwise you will get just large speakers. </p>

    <p>  Such devices can be equipped with two, three or more frequency bands, but not in all cases the number of speakers corresponds to the ‚Äúcavity‚Äù indicator.  Very often, manufacturers equip their systems with two ‚Äúbass‚Äù, then it is called 2.5-way. </p><p>  Let's try to identify the most distinguished models, presenting you a small overview of <span>speakers</span> from famous brands. </p><h2>  Sonus faber amati anniversario </h2><p>  One can safely say about this system: "Made by hand in Italy."  Even a cursory glance at this model will be quite enough to say that we have extremely high-quality and good acoustics from a famous brand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Similar to a spindle on top, and in profile resembling a lute, this serious structure is assembled from twelve maple bars carefully adjusted to each other and fastened with a patented glue with a vibration-absorbing composition.  Active acoustics with a cross-section of this kind excludes the occurrence of standing waves, plus everything, will provide the user with excellent damping of the ‚Äúcabinet‚Äù. </p><p>  The manufacturer offers its fans only two finishes - black (graphite) and wood (violin).  Like the great creators of the impeccable instruments of Stradivarius and Guarneri, the brand hides from prying eyes the formulation of its varnishes, glues and subtleties of technology, emphasizing that the home audio system, in fact, is the same means of playing music as the violin.  That is why this model got its name in honor of the violin cases of the master Andrea Amati from ancient Cremona. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  Sonus Faber are equipped with a double ring tweeter with a total diameter of 25 mm, without ferromagnetic fluid, but with an element that optimizes the radiation pattern.  Sound efficiency corresponds to the ‚Äúopen acoustic camera‚Äù scheme, that is, the design of a 150 mm mid-range driver is made using the principles of Kellogg and Faraday. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>Active speakers are</span> equipped with two 220 mm woofers with aluminum-magnesium diffusers plus a coil with a significantly increased working stroke.  Each head is unloaded to its own port of the bass reflex and is located in the rear of the structure.  All phase-amplitude characteristics are balanced, and the input impedance value is optimized for the separation frequencies of 350 and 4000 Hz (optimal acoustics).  Reviews about Sonus Faber are extremely positive, and both ordinary users and music lovers leave them, so everyone can recommend this modern creation. </p><h2>  T + A KS 300 </h2><p>  The 300th model was made the flagship of the entire series.  The system turned out to be quite compact and somewhere elegant even with dimensions of 95 cm (height) and 19 cm (width) - stylishly, simply and efficiently. </p>

    <p>  This outdoor acoustics embodies the concept of a general approach to sound emphasis and know-how in technological solutions.  All components that were involved in the design of the model are a continuation of the original T + A series and, at the same time, unique developments of the brand‚Äôs engineers. </p><p>  The case consists of extruded aluminum, which provides the entire structure with rigidity and stability, and thanks to the exquisite solutions of local designers, acoustics, speakers, and the whole appearance are saturated with elegance and high cost. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The side walls of the body are damped with a patented material that is able to absorb any sound, while suppressing vibration for the entire structure, and at the same time reducing resonance vibrations. </p><p>  Woofers with an accuracy of a millimeter are selected in their parameters to the total volume of the case.  Due to the carbon fiber reinforced diffusers, the output produces an ultra-deep and extremely accurate low-frequency sound, even despite the volume level. </p><h2>  Series Features </h2><p>  Mid-range performance easily covers the entire vocal range from 200 to 2000 Hz, turning the sound into a dynamic, natural and incredibly lively perception tool.  The diffuser, made by the latest GreyCone technology, has special notches that free it from any resonances, and due to the flexible suspension, the operation of the mobile system is completely controlled and has an excellent sound overview.  <span>Acoustic systems of</span> such a plan have not yet been invented, and the legendary ring radiator of high frequencies from T + A can, without any effort, cover frequency ranges up to 40,000 Hz and even higher.  The overall sound picture looks dynamic, airy and fast, without any signs of sharpness or stiffness. </p><p>  A carefully calculated separation filter involves dividing the frequencies into three bands.  It uses components of only the most excellent quality, and the characteristics are carefully optimized.  The filter does not allow loss of linearity of the speaker‚Äôs movements and keeps the sound within the established range.  As a result, even large and heavy-duty signals do not present any difficulties for a three-way system.  KS-300 is an excellent model and excellent acoustics.  Reviews of the system are mainly in a positive way, the only thing users complain about is the modest color scheme, but this, as they say, is an amateur. </p><h2>  Vienna Acoustic Beethoven Baby Grand </h2><p>  This model from the famous brand "Grand" can also be called the flagship of the company.  ‚ÄúBeethoven‚Äù is a reflection of the superiority of the entire line of Vienne speaker systems, which allows you to enjoy excellent sound both at large concert venues and at home. </p>

    <p>  The model turned out to be dynamic, open and extremely musical, because the device combines two 6-inch speakers with a low frequency, one with an average one, and this is completed by a tweeter with a silk diffuser. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The sound from the speakers is transparent and natural, and the mid and high frequencies are perfectly balanced.  Two bass reproducers complement the whole picture, where the user has an amazing balance and sound uniformity.  Beethoven is really high-quality, modern and just beautiful acoustics.  Reviews about the model are all in a positive way, so it is extremely difficult to find any critical points or nuances.  Some owners complain about too sharp legs of the system that scratch the floor, but this can be easily solved with a small rug or the principle of "put and do not touch." </p><h2>  Opera seconda </h2><p>  Acoustics ‚ÄúMarshal‚Äù pleased us with the model ‚ÄúOpera‚Äù.  As in the previous lines, a closed box was used as the sound design for this series.  The new model received some visual updates, but the design principle itself has not changed at all, and why change what works great. </p>

    <p>  Good acoustics are equipped with a 2.5-way design, and mid-range drivers were developed in conjunction with Scanspeak.  The diffusers are coated with super high-quality aluminum with the addition of mastic to further reduce resonances.  The speakers are poured into the case and have a reinforced structure. </p><h2>  System specifications </h2><p>  The high-frequency section is equipped with a silk diaphragm and an innovative cooling system that uses <span>ferromagnetic fluid,</span> and the working range of the emitter has an increased indicator of 30 kHz.  It is also worth noting that the amplitude of movement of the working diaphragm is almost 1 mm (twice as many competing analogues), allowing high-frequency emitters to reach a higher level. </p><p>  The tweeter is practically not sensitive to any vibrations that come from other speakers of the system.  All this due to the resonant frequency (860 Hz) and because of the thick front panel (30 mm).  Second level acoustic filters have excellent circuitry, which is made on two separate boards and is located at a considerable distance from each other.  This is done in order to reduce the unpleasant effect of mutual induction of the coils, and in addition, allows you to get rid of the microphone effect. </p><p>  All structural elements undergo careful selection and testing at all stages of production, so it is safe to say that Opera gives an accurate musical signal and correctly constructs sound scenes (surround speakers).  Reviews about the model are completely positive, so there‚Äôs just nothing to complain about, maybe only the price, but all high-quality speaker systems are subject to this ‚Äúailment‚Äù. </p><h2>  Epos m 16i </h2><p>  "Epos" is a floor-mounted 2.5-way speaker system with a phase-inverse type.  The model looks equally good both as a stereo system and as a home theater.  The series received an improved tweeter with an aluminum dome (25 mm), ferrofluidic cooling for the coil and a beautiful magnet made of ferrite, which greatly improved the transparency of the sound compared to its predecessors. </p><h2>  Speakers </h2><p>  A speaker with medium frequencies (140 mm), together with a polypropylene diffuser, is mounted in the structure next to the tweeter and is separated from the low frequencies by a special section.  The speakers operate in the optimal frequency range thanks to a first-order filter (one tweeter - one capacitor). </p>

    <p>  <span>The woofer</span> differs in the average <span>speaker</span> by the presence of a dustproof matrix instead of a phase distributor, and the port of the phase inverter output to the rear of the structure has symmetrical tubes to reduce sound flow turbulence.  The design also provides for bypassing, and all key terminals are located at the anodized aluminum head. </p><h2>  Yamaha NS 777 </h2><p>  The Yamaha Acoustic Kit from the NS Series is a three-way bass reflex floor in a stylish and distinctive package.  The model has a Waveguide horn design, which means the presence of woofers with reinforced PMD membranes and a high-class branded cabling from Monster Cable.  This allows the system to play the most complex digital audio signals and accompany movies with any kind of music sources. </p>

    <p>  In addition to its superior technical characteristics, the Yamaha speaker kit has a specific and at the same time elegant design, recognized by millions of fans of the brand.  The case is made in black polished with a light speaker insert, which is typical for brand products. </p><p>  The size of the mid-range speaker remained the same from the previous rulers (130 mm), the sensitivity (89 dB) and the scope of the frequency range - 30-35 000 Hz changed.  The rated power of the system does not exceed 100/250 W with a resistance of 6 ohms.  Bi-Wiring and detailed filter settings are also available.  The model is perfect for both professional and amateur needs. </p>
