However, if they are placed in a simple plastic or clay pot, then the living area will look too banal and simple.  It‚Äôs sometimes too expensive to buy ready-made pots at the store, and it‚Äôs not always possible to pick up the capacity of the desired color or pattern. </p><h2>  Foreword </h2><p>  Our article will help you find a way out of a difficult situation, which describes in detail how decorating a flower pot with the help of different materials.  They are quite accessible to every housewife and for sure, if you look well, the necessary elements will be found in the house.  After all, the most ordinary items are used for decoration.  This includes scraps of cloth or burlap, the remains of lace, small sea pebbles or bizarre-shaped shells that can be brought from a trip to the sea coast. </p><p>  To make the decoration of the flower pot look original, the craftsmen use twigs and pieces of broken ceramic tiles or old dishes, even egg shells are used.  If you carefully read the article, then you can make any craft without much difficulty.  For attaching decorative elements mainly use thick PVA glue.  Acrylic paint and varnish can be useful for decorating a flower pot. </p><h2>  Paint drawing on a pot </h2><p>  Often, housewives want to see some pattern on a flower pot.  It can be a repeating ornament - geometric or floral.  If the master knows how to draw well, then a pot decorated with flowers or plot pictures will look beautiful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Potty in the nursery" class="if uuid-2293750" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293750.jpg"></div><p>  In the nursery, you can decorate a flower pot using images of heroes of popular films or cartoons.  The child will be very happy having SpongeBob in his room. </p><p>  First, the surface of the pot is completely covered with acrylic yellow paint.  This will be the background for the future image.  Then, with a simple pencil, the facial features of the hero are applied.  Using different colors, you can quickly transfer them to a yellow background.  If you do not know how to draw, this will not be on the way to the realization of a creative idea, since any hero can be found on the Internet.  If you are not at all friends with a pencil, then there is also an option.  You can find the usual coloring with the desired character.  Having printed the desired image on the printer, it remains to simply transfer it to the pot.  To do this, you can use a carbon paper or indentation with a sharp pencil. </p><p>  Then the details are painted.  After the product has completely dried, you can start transplanting the flower. </p><h2>  Stamping a picture on a plastic pot </h2><p>  Decoration of plastic flower pots can also be done with acrylic paints, but it is better not to completely cover the surface, since the pot has a fragile structure and can be deformed by pressure, while the paint will crack and sprinkle over time.  If you want to place a picture on such a pot, then choose colored plastic so that you do not need to do a solid background color.  The drawing may be small.  For this, templates are often used that are cut out either from plastic or from cardboard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.practicallyfunctional.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pot stamping" class="if uuid-2295285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2295285.jpg"></div><p>  You will also need acrylic paint and a sponge.  In order not to get smeared, it is advisable to adapt the sponge to some kind of stick.  The template is applied to the center of the pot.  The sponge is lowered into the paint of the desired color, gently press it on the edge of the can, so that excess paint comes out.  Only then, with drawing movements along the template, the drawing is transferred to the flower pot. </p><p>  You can do this decoration of flower pots with your own hands in the center of the product, or you can apply a pattern in a circle from below to above.  Then the template is cut long so that when bent, it covers the entire surface of the pot. </p><h2>  Cloth wrapping </h2><p>  Decoration ideas for flower pots can be different.  As well as materials for crafts.  If you have a piece of bright fabric with a floral pattern after sewing, you can make the design of the pot, as in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uk.lady-vishenka.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decoration of the pot with a cloth" class="if uuid-2295244" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2295244.jpg"></div><p>  First, the perimeter of the pot is measured in its widest part and the narrowest below.  Then you need to draw a trapezoidal pattern on the fabric.  The top line is the size of a wide measure, plus 1 cm on each side to overwhelm the fabric.  The lower strip also has a length corresponding to the lower part.  They also leave a couple of centimeters, as pieces of fabric are glued with an overlap so that the pot is not visible.  Additionally, you need to add a few centimeters at the top and bottom, since the fabric after gluing will need to be bent inward so that the container itself is not visible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The pot is carefully coated with PVA glue, on which the workpieces are applied.  Having pressed a hand over the entire surface of the fabric, we evenly align the material so that there are no wrinkles on the fabric. </p><p>  The remaining pieces of fabric on top and bottom need to be cut into thin strips, then when gluing on the round bottom and the top of the pot there will be no wrinkles.  The bottom is not completely sealed, the hole for excess fluid must be left. </p><p>  The decoration of the flower pot with a cloth ends with the application of a layer of PVA or acrylic varnish on top of the fabric.  After the surface dries, you can start transplanting the plants into a beautiful pot. </p><h2>  Country style </h2><p>  Natural fabrics are in fashion now, so you can use burlap when designing a flower pot.  The material can be glued to the product by adding a couple of decorative elements, for example, lace or satin ribbon bows. </p><p>  Decorating a flower pot with burlap can be done without glue.  It is enough to cut a square from the fabric and put a pot on its middle, connect all the corners at the top. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="burlap decoration" class="if uuid-2295232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2295232.jpg"></div><p>  In order for the burlap to hold and not slip, a decorative bandage is sewn in advance.  A satin ribbon edging is sewn onto a strip of burlap.  You can use a wide strip of satin, then a thin rope can be inserted into it to tie a bandage.  And you can use a thinner ribbon and at the end just leave the edges not stitched. </p><p>  Such decorative elements from burlap are used temporarily, for example, when there is a party in the fresh air or a wedding in a private house.  On the veranda for guests or around the alley along which the newlyweds go to the table, such pots with bright colors are displayed.  After the feast, the burlap must be removed, since when watering the flowers, the fabric will become wet. </p><h2>  Using hemp rope </h2><p>  If you want to use natural decor for decorating flower pots, then sticking with hemp natural rope layers is the best option.  To do this, you can coat the pot with PVA glue and, starting from above, attach the rope, tightly winding it around the circumference of the plant container. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.marthastewart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gluing with a rope" class="if uuid-2293756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293756.jpg"></div><p>  You can decorate the craft by making braids of several threads with the help of braiding.  After applying the main winding to the pot, the pigtail is placed with a strip above or below the pot.  It is also glued on PVA.  It turns out a voluminous detail that diversifies the decoration of a flower pot.  The photo above shows how the finished work looks. </p><h2>  Sticking an egg shell </h2><p>  You can decorate the surface of the flower pot with any material, for example, pasting the shell in a circle broken into small parts.  To do this, remove the inner film and rinse the shell well.  Then everything is laid out on a dry cloth for drying.  Then that part of the surface that will be covered with shell, PVA glue is smeared.  It should have a thick consistency. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="egg shell crafts" class="if uuid-2293742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293742.jpg"></div><p>  Parts of the shell can be either large or small, depending on the selected pattern.  You can glue the surface completely, or you can create an ornament or a wavy line.  It is also interesting to combine this material with others.  Subsequently, the shell can be painted in any color.  The applied shell looks original on some colored background.  Some masters pre-paint the shell, and then paste it.  To consolidate the result of the work, you need to cover with acrylic varnish the entire surface of the pot after gluing with such a fragile material.  A layer of varnish will hold the egg shell and prevent it from falling out. </p><h2>  Gentle pot coating </h2><p>  You are already familiar with decorating the surface of flower pots with a cloth.  This manufacturing option has similarities.  All work is carried out in the same way, only they have lace not necessarily on the entire surface.  You can stick the material on PVA glue in strips, changing lace tapes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="liltigertoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sticking lace" class="if uuid-2293721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293721.jpg"></div><p>  Any such additional elements can be added to such material, for example, to create a magnificent bow from satin ribbons or to combine with a plain or color fabric. </p><h2>  Marine theme </h2><p>  Decorating a flower pot with shells brought from vacation will help to consolidate the seascape and pleasant memories of a great time in memory.  If the shells are smooth and without voids, then they are glued to the surface with superglue immediately, correctly placing the various types. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="making pots with shells" class="if uuid-2293735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293735.jpg"></div><p>  If you collected shells with a void inside, then before sticking on the pot itself, you must fill in the data void.  It is best to use finely chopped pieces of paper or newspaper.  The shell is completely filled after soaking the paper in the glue.  When the crafts are completely dry, and it takes at least twelve hours, you can begin pasting the pot. </p><h2>  Ceramic Mosaic </h2><p>  Originally, you can design the appearance using broken into small pieces of tiles or utensils.  You can add some kind of mosaic to the picture, or you can simply place them in a chaotic manner.  Stick the tile onto the pot using mounting glue.  But this is not the end of the work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ceramic Mosaic" class="if uuid-2293725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2293725.jpg"></div><p>  To keep the surface of the pot smooth, you need to putty the applied layers.  When the putty dries, its excess is washed off with a sponge dipped in water.  This craft is very strong and durable.  You can decorate large concrete flowerbeds in the garden area in this way. </p><p>  The options presented in the article are made without much effort, such crafts can be done even by an amateur.  Good luck </p>
