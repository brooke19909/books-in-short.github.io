Today, Bosch is a global manufacturer and continues its development in various industries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General description of the refrigerator Bosch KGN39VI15R </h2><p>  Let's look at this model in more detail.

    <p>  Thanks to the silver color of stainless steel, it fits perfectly into absolutely any interior.  The device is controlled by the integrated electronic system.  For those who are used to storing frozen foods, this is ideal, since the average daily rate is 14 kg. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The maximum temperature in the freezer can be adjusted to -24 degrees, which indicates the possibility of deep freezing of products.  Thus, even after a few months they retain their quality.  This is an excellent way to freeze summer preparations - vegetables, herbs, berries, mushrooms.  As for the type of defrosting, the last function in the field of technology called No Frost is provided here.  The device defrosts on its own and does not allow frost to accumulate, preventing full operation and creating an additional load. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Specifications of the refrigerator Bosch KGN39VI15R </h2><p>  This model rightfully belongs to class A (energy-saving), since the manufacturer claims that the refrigerator does not consume more than 383 kW per year.

This is a great option for families with small children, as the noise level does not exceed 42 dB. </p>

    <p>  For comparison: this is the level of ordinary voice.  This is a practical option where many additional features are missing.  The refrigerator is designed to perform quality basic work on food storage.  It is worth noting only the ‚ÄúOn-vacation‚Äù mode, when the user goes on a trip for a long time.  In this case, the adjustment is made independently. </p><h2>  Internal organization </h2><p>  Bosch manufacturer cares about the comfort of its customers, so the internal device is made in such a way as to separate food and organize the space as conveniently as possible.  In addition to the main shelves made of thickened glass, one can note an additional <span>shelf for wine</span> and a cell in the side door for storing eggs.  Also, the refrigerator with the lower Bosch KGN39VI15R freezer has the ability to outweigh the door in a convenient direction without changing the position of the device itself.  Despite the presence of an electronic display, such events can be carried out independently, without calling a specialist.  A detailed work plan is contained in the instructions. </p><h2>  Precautionary measures </h2><p>  Bosch KGN39VI15R is a good refrigerator.  In order for the device to serve faithfully for a long time, it is imperative to follow the operating rules that are prescribed in the attached instructions.  The very first requirement of the manufacturer regarding the rules for safe operation is the appropriate location of the device.  The refrigerator should not be placed close to heating elements, for example, next to a hob or oven.  This leads to additional load, and over time, the device may simply fail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bosch kgn39vi15r refrigerator specifications" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2041175.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  In addition, it is not recommended to place the refrigerator close to the wall.  The minimum distance that must be observed is 1-2 cm. It is imperative that the air circulates and does not allow the refrigerator to overheat.  It is not recommended to place the device so that it is exposed to direct sunlight.  This may cause overheating.  Installation of the device must be carried out by level.  For leveling from the bottom, special twisting legs on a rubberized base are provided. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  By obvious advantages, in accordance with reviews on the Bosch KGN39VI15R refrigerator include: </p><ul><li>  Attractive design in metallic color with a convenient electronic display on the outside of the door. </li><li>  No Frost does all the work for the owner, so you do not need to defrost the refrigerator yourself.  It is enough to turn off the appliance once a year to simply wash it from the inside. </li><li>  Despite the large capacity, visually it looks quite neat and does not spoil the interior. </li><li>  Ergonomics and many additional storage sections contribute to the proper storage of products, and also make use as comfortable as possible. </li><li>  The electronic display is designed in such a way that even older people can handle it. </li></ul>

Generally speaking, the Bosch KGN39VI15R is undoubtedly a good refrigerator that will fit perfectly into any kitchen of modern consumers.
