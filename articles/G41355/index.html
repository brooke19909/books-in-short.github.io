Crochet patterns for blouses</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many of the fair sex, fond of needlework, in the wardrobe there are things crocheted.  Especially loved are summer blouses, which are ideal for socks and with trousers, and with shorts, and with skirts.  When knitting summer blouses, preference is given mainly to openwork options. </p><p>  You can create such beauty with your own hands.  This takes a minimum of time, but is very pleased with the result.  If you decide to learn how to crochet things yourself, then do not stop there and try to do more than just simple work.  After all, only those things that use a lot of elements look beautiful. </p><h2>  What tool and thread are suitable for crocheting summer wardrobe items? </h2><p>  If as a result of your work you want to get a beautiful and light version of clothing, then you need to use cotton yarn.  It has a different density.  The <span>thicker the yarn,</span> the larger the thing.  Crochet threads such as <span>merino wool</span> and iris are also suitable. </p><p>  Before buying yarn, you need to decide what things you want to do - shawls or wraps, or maybe jackets or cardigans, tops or T-shirts?  Natural material is not suitable for all types of products, it can stretch after washing or sit down.  This point should always be considered before starting work, as it will be a pity for the time spent, if subsequently the item is not worn with pleasure. </p><p>  Natural crochet threads are: </p><ul><li>  linen - always the same color - straw, because this material does not absorb paint;  they fit very well in the pattern, the products dry quickly after washing; </li><li>  cotton - have a variety of colors, dry for a long time and may decrease in size; </li><li>  Woolen - require some care. </li></ul><p>  Experienced craftswomen for their work still choose artificial yarn - polyester or acrylic.  These threads do not deform, after washing they retain the shape of the products and do not cause allergic reactions on the body. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For crochet work, the moment of choosing his number is very important.  The larger the knitting tool in diameter, the larger the fabric, and vice versa.  To carry out summer blouses, choose the average numbers of crochet hooks.  Much attention is paid not only to the type of tool, but also to the comfort of its use.  For work, you can use both metal hooks and plastic, there are also wooden or combined ones, when the handle and the tip itself are made of various materials.  It is best to choose a solid tool, then there is a guarantee that it will not break. </p><p>  You also need to know that each hook number means a certain thickness of the thread. </p><h2>  How to crochet an openwork top? </h2><p>  Many models can be performed independently.  The most common summer wardrobe item is the top.  Crochet summer blouses, patterns and descriptions of which will be given below, must be made of artificial yarn. </p><p>  This variant of the top looks very impressive. </p>
