Where can I find the rope town</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  People who live in big cities need to at least occasionally rest from the constant noise and fuss.  Solitude in nature with family and friends.  Many do so, go to picnics.  Such a rest gets bored very quickly.  Although it is much more interesting than sitting in apartments, it‚Äôs all the same monotonous.  You can somehow diversify your daily life with an active holiday, which is much more exciting than sitting in a clearing, even at a juicy barbecue. </p><h2>  Resting in a new way </h2><p>  But not everyone can afford a trip to the mountains or to a sports base.  And not only because such trips are expensive (after all, you need to hire an instructor, buy some equipment), but also for other reasons.  For example, if there are children in the family, you will not leave them alone at home or at the base, and it is very dangerous to take them with you to the mountains. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rope town on Krestovsky" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21218/445163.jpg" width="475"></div>  Therefore, savvy entrepreneurs have long come up with an interesting entertainment for lovers of outdoor activities with their whole family - the rope town.  Many probably guessed by name what it was.  A lot of taut ropes, nets that you need to climb or climb.  There are structures that are more suitable for children, and there are complexes for real extreme sports.  They include hundreds of obstacles, hundreds of meters of suspension tracks and bridges and similar structures.  Let's take a closer look at what a ‚Äúdecent‚Äù rope town looks like.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The device of the rope town in Orekhovo </h2><p>  As a rule, these complexes are located near the city, where there are parks, reserves or natural forests.  This is done mainly so that, in addition to entertainment, people can breathe fresh air.  If there are mountains or rough terrain near the city, then this area can be taken as a basis.  In the absence of such conditions, the presence of trees between which hanging logs, <span>cable cars,</span> stairs and other devices will be sufficient is sufficient.  Also, to overcome some places you will need unusual vehicles: trolleys or cable bicycles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rope town Voronezh" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21218/445390.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  By the complexity of the obstacles, the tracks can be divided into children and adults.  Regardless of the type of track, they are completely safe.  An example is the sports base in Orekhovo.  The rope town here meets all safety standards.  For this, competent instructors are hired, but the basis, of course, are carbine systems, safety cables, in some cases mats and stretch nets. </p><p>  There are also rope towns where there are climbing gyms and ice-fields.  Those who like structures where you need to climb and climb rocks are given special climbing equipment and ice axes.  As a rule, there are also bicycle trails, usual areas for sports recreation and various competitions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Let's take a closer look at several of these towns in Russia. </p><h2>  Rest on Krestovsky </h2><p>  The rope town on Krestovsky Island (St. Petersburg) is a great vacation for the whole family.  Clean air, natural sounds, an inexhaustible flow of energy and unforgettable adventures await anyone who is ready to spend their free time here.  The town on Krestovsky includes several <span>obstacle</span> courses, ascents, descent on the troll, there are also many contests and events. </p><p>  The park has a system of various discounts, including for large families, and the sale of season tickets.  The more days you are going to spend in this wonderful place, the more profitable for you. </p><p>  In addition to the usual outdoor activities, the rope town on Krestovsky offers its services for holding various corporate parties and birthdays in the territory. </p>

At the end of each track there is a <span>special offer</span> - a descent on the troll, which leaves an unforgettable experience.  If you wish, you can go through various mountain climbing master classes and not only, for example, you can try yourself as a crossbow shooter.

    <h2>  We train children in harmony with nature </h2><p>  Today, sports take on attractive and original forms.  An interesting option for leisure activities was the rope town.  Voronezh in its own way seeks to diversify the pastime of the townspeople.  Sports activity in such a place does not resemble boring and grueling hours of activity in an indoor hall.  A mobile rest against the backdrop of a beautiful landscape, crystal clear air, forest coolness attracts people of different ages and backgrounds to the rope complex.  Here the mind, imagination and feelings wiped out by daily life come to life, therefore a person receives full-fledged impressions.  The safety, diversity and complexity of the routes was taken care of by the project organizers. </p><p>  In this rope town, there are several types of tracks both for the whole family to pass, and for extreme single players.  Depending on whether the family has small children, you can choose the complexity of the route. </p><p>  For extreme sportsmen, there is an obstacle course, which includes, in addition to simple rocking bridges and stairs, climbing walls, crossings, trolls, and even snowboarding.  Such multicomponent and complex tracks require some physical training and set age limits.  But this does not mean that the visit to the town is intended only for people with professional sports training.  For those who do not fall on the most difficult track, there are many alternatives.  The rope town (Voronezh) consists of routes of varying complexity.  These are the same multicomponent complexes.  They consist of rope steps, bridges of boards, suspended and fixed logs, various platforms, but with a changed height and difficulty of passage. </p>

    <h2>  A unique vacation in Lipetsk </h2><p>  The next park, which is located in Lipetsk, can please us with even more amazing routes.  In it you can try out combined types of obstacles.  They look very interesting and at the same time require special perseverance to overcome. </p><p>  The fact that all these obstacles are at a height of 14 meters gives an even greater sporting excitement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rope town Zadonsk" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21218/445388.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Naturally, not everyone will be able to climb to the height of a <span>shaving flight</span> and examine Lipetsk from it.  The rope town, despite its inherent extreme, is a completely safe place.  It clearly requires the implementation of the rules for each visitor, therefore, all routes are designed for specific age categories, and observation platforms, attractions, stairs, transitions to them are located at different heights. </p><h2>  Only a dry and safe track </h2><p>  For each visitor a safety training is given, then equipment is issued.  Depending on the type of track, it can be different, but in any case of high quality.  Lipetsk Park opens the door for all visitors, regardless of gender, age and physical fitness. </p><p>  The work of the park in Lipetsk is interrupted only when it rains and the track becomes slippery in some areas.  In general, the main role is played by the safety of customers, for this high-quality briefings are conducted and, most importantly, there are special fastenings and safety ropes along the entire route. </p><h2>  Amusement park in Zadonsk </h2><p>  An amazing and unusual place for entertainment is the rope town.  With its forest hugs, Zadonsk daily meets hundreds of outdoor enthusiasts and even extreme sports enthusiasts on the threshold of such a complex.  For many people, after the first visit, this type of relaxation becomes a favorite: anxiety, internal fatigue, mental stress and everyday bustle leave here.  And the tone and good mood do not leave for a long time. </p><p>  Located in a picturesque forest area and originally designed by design engineers, it attracts with an unusual landscape and makes you imbued with fabulous impressions that remain in your memory for a long time. </p><p>  Like any other rope town, it consists of a number of routes, each of which, in turn, is overcome with an individual set of difficulties and features.  Some of them need to be crossed on foot, while underfoot there will be not the usual asphalt, but <span>rope ladders,</span> suspended logs and rope nets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rope town in Zadonsk" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21218/445909.jpg" width="600"></div>  Others can be overcome only with the help of special tools and carbines, such as a bicycle track, on which a bicycle without tires is mounted, and it is necessary to ride a rope on it, or a descent on a troll that joins your life belt.

    <h2>  There is a case for everyone </h2><p>  For those who do not allow circumstances to take such an active vacation, the good news is that the rope town in Zadonsk also has several tennis courts, a bike path and even a billiard room.  Thus, everyone will find something to do.  And if bad weather breaks out on the street, then all visitors will be able to hide from it and continue their rest, having no less fun. </p><h2>  We train fun and correctly </h2><p>  Having fun is the main task for any visitor to the rope town.  But at the same time, being in the fresh air and receiving intense loads, your body grows stronger.  It is also a great place to develop leadership abilities or begin to get rid of indecision and fears. </p><p>  Therefore, no matter which rope town you choose for yourself, it will be remembered for a long time, and you will definitely want to repeat the trip. </p>

Firstly, with regard to equipment: not in every town it is issued, so this information must be clarified.  Secondly, it is necessary to take comfortable shoes and clothes with you that do not constrain movements.  And thirdly, do not forget about mosquitoes, ticks and other troubles that occur in nature.
