Currently, potential visitors to this magical corner of the globe are forced to overpay for the selection of a place and its reservation.  But a possible alternative to this approach is the global web, which allows you to buy a tour to this archipelago at minimal cost.  It is about his best hotel complexes that will be discussed in this material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheap All Inclusive Hotels in Maldives" class="if uuid-2566789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2566789.jpg"></div><h2>  About the Maldives.  What kind of place is it? </h2><p>  Before we look at the best all-inclusive hotels in the Maldives, we will determine what kind of place it is.  This archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean and includes many islands.  The climate in this place of the globe is very warm, and nature pleases with diversity.  All this allows you to create the most convenient conditions for relaxation. </p><h2>  Where can I get a tour? </h2><p>  There are two different ways to buy a tour package to the Maldives All Inclusive hotels.  One of them is to take the help of a specialized agency in which his representative, according to your recommendations, selects a tour and offers a price for it.  In addition to air travel in two directions, the price of rest will also include accommodation, meals, airport transfers and insurance.  Also in this figure will be included and the premium of the travel agency for the services rendered and paperwork.  But you can try to save money and take advantage of the relevant information resources on the global web.  In this case, you do not need to overpay for insurance and a travel agency premium. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandleisure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Best All Inclusive Maldives Hotels" class="if uuid-2566791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2566791.jpg"></div><h2>  All Inclusive or Ultra All Inclusive power system? </h2><p>  Also, before choosing a vacation spot, you need to consider another important point.  It concerns the power system.  In some hotel complexes, the All Inclusive concept operates.  In this case, the menu offered to the vacationer is abbreviated and includes only dishes, local drinks and a limited amount of alcohol.  Some hotels in addition to this minimize the power supply system.  For example, a visitor to the complex is free to eat in the main restaurant, but in the bar he can no longer do this, and will be forced to pay an additional fee.  As a rule, this concept is mainly offered by 4-star All Inclusive hotels in the Maldives for the reason that they seek to minimize the cost of leisure.  Other hotels have a different catering concept called Ultra All Inclusive.  In this case, there are no restrictions on the menu, as well as on the place of consumption of the products.  This concept is mainly used in expensive five-star premium hotels. </p><h2>  Recommendations regarding the selection of a vacation spot.  Reviews </h2><p>  Now we‚Äôll decide on a list of recommendations on how to choose Maldives All Inclusive hotels.  Feedback is the factor that you need to pay attention to first.  Description and photographs always characterize the hotel complex on the positive side, and it is not easy to distinguish between those "pitfalls" that can ruin any vacation.  But in the reviews in most cases the real state of affairs is indicated.  Moreover, it is recommended to view them not on one information resource on the Internet, but on several.  This will create a more holistic picture of a potential vacation spot. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandleisure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maldives All Inclusive Hotels. Description" class="if uuid-2566792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2566792.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel complex Paradise Island Resort &amp; Spa 5 * </h2><p>  This is one of the best holiday destinations among all-inclusive Maldives hotels.  Its description indicates that it is located on a separate island.  Moreover, all of its infrastructure is strictly within its borders.  All rooms in this complex are located in clean and well-kept villas or bungalows.  The view from the windows in all cases overlooks the Indian Ocean, and this creates a very romantic atmosphere in them. </p><p>  The hotel complex includes one outdoor pool, where you can swim year-round, and four specialized restaurants.In this hotel you can immerse yourself in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean and watch the life of its inhabitants, ride a surfboard, fry a barbecue and just have a great time time. </p><p>  Although officially in this hotel there is a food system called All Inclusive, but in fact it needs to be called Ultra All Inclusive.  The visitor can eat in any of his restaurants and taste Italian, Japanese cuisine.  That is, there is certainly something to choose from.  In addition to this, there are Bageecha, Dhaavani and Lagoon restaurants.  The first of them is considered the main one and offers vegetarian or halal dishes.  And the other two also offer their visitors a pre-formed menu. The rather large size of the island allows visitors to the complex both to retire and find a noisy company and have a great time in it.  According to the site of booking.com, the rating of this complex is 8.6.  Moreover, it is formed on the basis of reviews.  That is, it is one of the best hotels in this part of the Indian Ocean. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Royal Island Resort &amp; Spa Hotel 5 * </h2><p>  This hotel complex, as discussed above, is located on a separate island.  In this case, this is Baa Atoll, which is part of the Maldives archipelago.  Visitors to this hotel can only be accommodated in individual villas.  In all cases, the view from the windows overlooks the Indian Ocean.  There is also a separate sitting area in each room. </p><p>  The list of entertainment at this hotel includes diving, surfing, water skiing and parachuting.  But the number of restaurants has been reduced to one.  But he has an advanced menu that matches even the highest demands. </p><p>  Separately, it should be noted the coastal strip of this hotel.  The sand on the beach is snow-white, and the water is clean and clear.  At the same time, dense emerald vegetation comes close to it.  Due to the improved infrastructure, the rating of this complex according to the booking.com resource is higher than that of the previous one, and is already 9.0 points. </p><h2>  Bandos Maldives Hotel 4 * </h2><p>  This holiday complex belongs to the All Inclusive group of budget hotels in the Maldives.  Again, the presence of four stars can significantly reduce the cost of tours.  But at the same time, the level of hotel service decreases.  There is no separate entrance to the ocean, like the previous two hotels.  All rooms of the complex are located in houses that are located fairly close to each other. </p><p>  The advantages of Bandos Maldives 4 * include the power system.  Within its framework, there are such restaurants: Gallery (the main one, which concurrently serves as a dining room), Koon Thai (Thai cuisine), Sea Breeze (Western and international cuisines with the obligatory inclusion of seafood) and Umi Yaki (Japanese cuisine).  That is, there are certainly no questions regarding nutrition. </p><p>  This hotel has its own sandy beach.  It‚Äôs only four minutes to go to him.  Everything necessary for a comfortable stay on its territory is.  The rating score of this hotel is 8.5 on a ten-point scale.  Its key advantage is low prices, but the level of service is practically not inferior to any five-star hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maldives All Inclusive Hotels. Reviews" class="if uuid-2566793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2566793.jpg"></div><h2>  Kurumba Maldives complex 5 * </h2><p>  On a separate island of North Male, this hotel is located, like any other similar Maldives All Inclusive hotels.  Photos of its territory are really pleasing to the eye.  There is a coral reef of its own, which can be observed during a dive. </p><p>  Eight separate restaurants with different menus and four bars.  And for the most part they work as part of the All Inclusive power system.  Separately, it is worth noting the Athiri Bar, from which you can admire the beautiful sunset during dinner.  All this is complemented by three pools and three tennis courts. </p><p>  There is also a SPA center on site.  Moreover, he carries out not only cosmetic procedures, but also therapeutic ones.  An impressive number of sightseeing tours can offer its visitors this complex.  According to booking.com, this hotel was rated 9.0 by vacationers.  That is quite high.  Its only minus is higher prices in comparison with the previously considered four-star hotel.  He no longer has flaws. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maldives All Inclusive Hotels. A photo" class="if uuid-2566794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2566794.jpg"></div><h2>  Coco Palm Dhuni Kolhu 5 * </h2><p>  This holiday complex is located on the island of Tulado.  It is located far enough from the main island of the Male Archipelago (the distance is 124 kilometers) than all the previously considered all-inclusive Maldives hotels.  From the international airport on a hydroplane to fly to him for about half an hour.  Therefore, this is the most secluded hotel, which is best suited for honeymooners. </p><p>  Three large restaurants located on its territory will make it possible to create even the most sophisticated menu.  All hotel rooms are in separate villas and have a separate exit to the ocean.  Like the previous complex, the rating of this hotel is 9.0 points according to visitors to booking.com.  It has two drawbacks: high cost and inconvenient location. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.minicart.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="4 Star All Inclusive Hotels in Maldives" class="if uuid-2566797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2566797.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel Rating </h2><p>  Now, we‚Äôll rank the Maldives All Inclusive hotels that we previously reviewed.  This list takes the following form: </p><ol><li>  Royal Island Resort &amp; Spa 5 * - 9.0. </li><li>  Kurumba Maldives 5 * - 9.0. </li><li>  Coco Palm Dhuni Kolhu 5 * - 9.0. </li><li>  Paradise Island Resort &amp; Spa 5 * - 8.6. </li><li>  Bandos Maldives 4 * - 8.5.  The only four-star hotel included in the rating received the lowest score, and this has a fairly simple explanation - the level of service is still lower, but this difference is not so significant. </li></ol><p>  Well, the best among them is Royal Island Resort &amp; Spa.  He has the best service and the most optimal location. </p><div class="photo" data-original="paradiseintheworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maldives All Inclusive Hotels. Rating" class="if uuid-2566798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2566798.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As part of this review, the most popular Maldives All Inclusive hotels to date have been reviewed.  Some of them get higher points, some - lower.  But the difference between them is so insignificant, so a four-star hotel looks preferable from the standpoint of cost.  If the issue of price fades into the background, then you can choose already starting from personal preferences and wishes.  It is also necessary to take into account the specialization of the hotel complex.  Some of them are designed to receive elite guests, others are for newlyweds, and some are for noisy youth companies. </p>
