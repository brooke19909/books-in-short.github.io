    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First of all, you need to soak and dye a piece of linen textile with a fragrant solution.  To prepare it, you need to take a pinch of cinnamon and 2 teaspoons of instant coffee and cocoa.  Stir these products in a saucepan and pour half a large glass of hot water.  Add 1 tablespoon of PVA glue here and mix the solution thoroughly.  Put the fabric in the resulting mass and hold it there for about 5 minutes.  Squeeze the flap, spread in a warm place and allow to dry.  After ironing it with an iron. </p><p>  We cut out a pattern in the shape of a heart from paper.  Transfer it to the fabric, circle with a pencil.  Next, we fold the textiles twice and, departing from the contours of the sketch by 0.5 cm, cut out two identical elements. </p><h2>  Assembly of parts and decoration </h2><p>  We sew the blanks along the contour outlined with a pencil.  We leave a hole 2 cm long, through it we turn out the crafts on the front side.  We fill it with filler, and we make out the hole with a <span>hidden seam.</span>  We try to shove the sintepon (or other selected material) as tightly as possible, distributing it evenly. </p><p>  Now, fragrant hearts made of fabric, made with our own hands, we will decorate.  Using a brush, apply the remaining aromatic solution from coffee and other ingredients.  Leave to dry.  You can speed up this process if you put the product on a warm battery or window sill, where the sun's rays fall.  After drying, sew a loop of twine or braid.  We decorate the surface of the souvenir with decorative buttons in the form of hearts, flowers, coffee beans or any other.  You can embroider in the form of the initials of your beloved or tender words.  If you have artistic abilities, then you can paint the product with acrylic paints.  All decorative elements are also coated with a fragrant solution and dried.  Fragrant vintage hearts made of fabric made in this way will definitely not leave indifferent those to whom you give them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hearts from fabric photo" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/369554.jpg?1396949439314" width="571"></div>

Training </h2><p>  If you have basic sewing skills, then to make such a product is not difficult.  Bright pillow made of knitted fabric in the shape of a heart looks simply gorgeous.  It can become a wonderful decorative addition to the overall interior of your home, and a wonderful gift for a loved one.  Before you learn how to make a heart out of fabric in the <span>form of an application</span> for a pillow, we will familiarize ourselves with the list of materials necessary for work.  We will need the following materials and tools: </p><ul><li>  small pillow; </li><li>  red knitwear, cut into pieces measuring 38 x 38 cm, 25.5 x 38 cm (2 pcs.) and a strip of 4 x 150 cm; </li><li>  fabric with a pattern that harmoniously matches the color scheme with square knitwear, with sides measuring 30.5 cm; </li><li>  cardboard; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  a piece of chalk; </li><li>  sewing machine. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a heart from fabric" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/369561.jpg?1396949482529" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  For appliques on a pillowcase, we make hearts from fabric </h2><p>  With our own hands we sew a cover on a small pillow.  If you don‚Äôt have one, then you can quickly make it at home.  To do this, cut out two identical square parts from natural fabric (linen, cotton, chintz), stitch them.  Then the product is turned out, stuffed with filler.  Sew the hole and that's it - the pillow is ready. </p><p>  Let's talk more about how to sew a pillowcase.  We fold the cardboard in half and cut out of it a 22 cm tall heart-shaped figure. Its width should also be 22 cm. We transfer this template to the fabric with a pattern.  We cut out, departing from the contours of 2.5 cm. We bend one of the knitted details of a rectangular shape by 0.6 cm along the long edge and hem.  In the same way, we arrange one side of the second such blank.  Now about how to make a heart out of fabric.  On a square knitted piece in the middle we put a figure from textile with a pattern, pin it with pins.  We sew the edges of this workpiece together with the square, departing from the contour by 0.6 cm. We cut off the excess edges.  Turn the square to the wrong side.  From above (on the area where the heart is sewn) we put a template from cardboard and draw a circle around it with chalk.  We make an incision in the center of the workpiece and carefully along the contour outlined with chalk, cut out the shape.  It turns out a square knitted piece with a ‚Äúwindow‚Äù in which the application in the form of a heart is located.  We sew a long textile strip along the middle with large stitches.  Then we pull the ends of the threads, forming a frill.  Its length should be such as to completely frame the heart.  We sheathe the application with it, thereby masking the seams along the edge of the "window".  Rectangular parts are imposed on the square, wraping them on top of one another.  We sew the cover around the perimeter, departing from the edge of 0.6 cm. We turn the pillowcase out, iron it and put it on the pillow.  The product is ready. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fabric hearts" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/369557.jpg?1396949521313" width="600"></div>
