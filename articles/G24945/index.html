Having its own unique style, which successfully combines the traditions of old pre-Petrine Rus with Western European art, this <span>architectural monument</span> is distinguished by a high level of building craftsmanship.  The decorativeness, artistic polyphony and the use of various materials combined into a single whole made it possible to create a truly unique work that gives a feeling of celebration, enthusiasm and optimism, which is so characteristic of Russian fairy tales. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kolomenskoye palace of alexey Mikhailovich" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/268922.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>The village of <span>Kolomenskoye, the palace of</span> Alexei Mikhailovich in the Middle Ages</strong> </p><p>  This small village has a rather rich history.  It housed the residence of several Russian tsars.  As early as the 16th century, under the basil III in Kolomenskoye, the hipped Ascension Church was erected.  Then the royal mansions appeared.  Then Ivan the Terrible visited here, during which the Church of the Beheading of John the Baptist was built in the nearby village of Dyakovo.  The residences of the first Russian Tsar from the <span>Romanov dynasty Mikhail</span> Fedorovich were also located here.  In Kolomenskoye there was a headquarters of the leader of the uprising Ivan Bolotnikov and the impostor False Dmitry II.  Here, later, the palace of <span>Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich</span> was built <span>.</span>  Kolomenskoye, in which he regularly visited, was his any residence.  It was during the reign of Alexei Mikhailovich that Kolomensky flourished.  The residence was erected from 1667 to 1673 and had 270 rooms.  The single palace ensemble included wooden mansions, which housed the Kazan Church, Kormovoi, Sytny and Khlebny Yards, Colonel and Order Chambers, and guards.  The territory was surrounded by a high fence, which could be reached through the Front, Rear or Garden Gate, and gardens were laid out around the palace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palace of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich Kolomenskoye" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/268927.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the capital of the Russian state was transferred to St. Petersburg, the palace of Alexei Mikhailovich located in the village of Kolomenskoe gradually fell into decay and was subsequently dismantled by order of Catherine II.  At the same time, detailed drawings of the palace complex were prudently made. </p><p>  In the XVIII century, Prince P.V.  Makulov built a new palace on the site of the old one, the lower two floors of which were made of stone, and the upper two floors were made of wood.  However, this was not the palace, since it was built according to the project of the prince himself. </p><p>  <strong>New life of the old palace</strong> </p><p>  The idea to recreate the palace as a museum reserve, from which only fragments of the foundation remained, arose in the 90s of the last millennium.  With the support of the Moscow government, a set of measures was taken to collect the preserved information and study the surviving remains of the foundation.  Due to the fact that over the years a whole <span>natural complex</span> managed to take shape at the place where <span>Kolomenskoye</span> was located <span>, the estate-palace of</span> Alexei Mikhailovich was rebuilt in full size on the site of the former village of Dyakovo in the period from summer 2007 to autumn 2008. Despite the fact that the palace is not quite in the place where the royal residence was once located, its orientation relative to the cardinal points was violated, and modern materials were used in the construction, the palace externally fully corresponds to the preserved drawings and  writings.  The grand opening of the palace, which is currently located in the city of Moscow at the intersection of 1st Dyakovo Gorodishche Street and Andropov Avenue, took place on September 4, 2010. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kolomenskoye estate Alexey Mikhailovich Palace" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/268929.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The palace of Alexei Mikhailovich reconstructed in the village of Kolomenskoye is open daily from 10 to 18 hours.  You can get to it by taking the metro to the Kashirskaya station.  The basis of the interior composition of the museum is its artistic decoration and interior decoration, which with maximum accuracy give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe life and life of the reign of <span>Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov.</span> </p>
