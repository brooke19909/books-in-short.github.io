People come here with pleasure to admire the pristine nature, to go fishing or relax from the bustle of the city.  Peace, which is typical of these places, captivated more than one heart.  The beaches of the <span>Istra Reservoir</span> are a favorite place for most Muscovites.  On its shore you can see private houses of famous people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beaches of the Istra reservoir" class="if" height="244" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13974/245240.jpg" width="466"></div>  The Istra Reservoir was created in the 1930s.  Artificially formed by the constructed Kuybyshev Dam, it began to fill with water and today stretches for about 24 km, its area is 3360 hectares.  The main function is the water supply of the city of Moscow, it also acts as a regulator of fluid flow from the pool to the river. <br><br>  The cultural significance of the Istra Reservoir is a tourist destination, an exciting kayaking.  Dozens of sanatoriums and recreation centers, leisure centers, including yacht and golf clubs, equestrian centers, ski resorts, etc. are located along the banks. Most people in the midst of the summer season prefer to come to these places on the beaches of the Istra reservoir.  Rest in silence is vital for a modern busy person, and local attractions are the best suited for such purposes.  By the way, this territory received the unofficial status of a health resort near Moscow. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beaches on the Istra reservoir" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13974/245241.jpg" width="600"></div>  Cozy beaches on the Istra Reservoir are located in the vicinity of the village of Trusovo, which is closest to Moscow.  It offers entertainment on <span>catamarans, motor</span> boats.  In general, the beaches are equipped with everything necessary.  For safety, there is a rescue station. <br><br>  "Small Berezhki" - a place for nudists, which is also included in the category of "beaches of the Istra reservoir."  Convenience on it you can not look, but the beach is sandy.  It is most preferable to come here with a tent.  This place will also be remembered for the fact that 100 meters from it is the cottage of the great singer - Alla Pugacheva. <br><br>  Lack of shipping, a taboo on the construction of facilities at a distance of 50 meters from the coast, on which the beaches of the Istra reservoir should exclusively function, <strong>&nbsp;</strong>  environmental prohibitions to preserve the natural heritage at a decent level - all this speaks in favor of this place.  Here is a paradise for fishermen, a variety of fish is found: perch, roach, pike, large zander, and others. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where you can swim in the suburbs" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13974/245238.jpg" width="600"></div>  Where can I swim in the suburbs besides the Istra reservoir?  The beaches of the Klyazminsky and Pirogovsky reservoirs offer a plunge on a sultry day.  One of the places is called "Bay of Joy", it is located near the village of Sorokino, it is considered the favorite beach of Muscovites due to the developed infrastructure and boat trips.  It even provides an animation program for children, previously agreed with the administration.  Good beaches near Moscow are considered places near Elektrostal, Solnechnogorsk, Klin, Fryazino, Dmitrov and Balashikha.  The water here is clean and everything you need is present. <br><br>  And finally.  Huge landfills can be found on the shores of the Istra Reservoir.  <span>The negligent attitude of</span> tourists towards ecology is amazing!  If the situation does not improve, then one of the most beautiful and clean places will turn into a landfill, which you will not want to come to for a vacation!  Be prudent - clean up after yourself!  Protect the Russian heritage, because the natural possibilities are not unlimited!
