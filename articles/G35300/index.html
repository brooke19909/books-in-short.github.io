To begin with, until October of the last (fifteenth) year, the hotel was called Sofitel Palm Beach Djerba.  For fans of the Sofitel hotel chain, nothing needs to be added here.  And for those who did not have the pleasure of relaxing in the offices of this chain around the world, we can say that it is famous for its high level of service. </p><p>  Now the company has ceded the coastal part of its holdings to the new owner.  Away from the sea was the Sofitel Palm Beach Djerba hotel, which, due to the small distance from the beach, is decorated with only four stars.  But Sensimar didn‚Äôt get worse from switching to new hands (Palm Beach Hotels Tunisia).  And recent reviews clearly show this.  On two sides, Sensimar is surrounded by front-line hotels: Palm Beach Club and Fiesta Beach Club. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sensimar Palm Beach Palace" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1530433.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located </h2><p>  Sensimar Palm Beach Palace is located on the northern tip of Djerba - the southernmost island of Tunisia.  The hotel is twenty kilometers from Zarzis International Airport.  The nearest town to the hotel is Midoun.  To its center, as well as the renowned Houmt Souk Market, is about thirteen kilometers.  The hotel is located along with other hotels in the Touristik zone, away from mosques and Muslim life of the local population, but among palm trees, sandy beaches and entertainment venues.  Sensimar positions itself as a vacation spot for adults.  They accept only those guests who are over eighteen years old.  Reviews say the hotel is close to evening entertainment centers.  And if you want to plunge into the life of Tunisia, then you can get to Houmt Souk in ten minutes by taxi or public transport.  By the way, the bus stop is just in front of the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Sensimar Palm Beach Palace (Tunisia): reviews </h2><p>  All tourists really liked the hotel.  Those who traveled a lot around the world claim that they did not see such luxury and level of service even in luxury hotels in Egypt and Turkey.  The hotel resembles a palace from an Eastern fairy tale, and this impression is not dispelled by the rooms and food in restaurants.  The fact that the hotel is intended only for persons who have reached the age of majority, was very pleasant to the guests.  From children it would be necessary to rest. </p>
