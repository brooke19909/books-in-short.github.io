It happened in the imperial residence, in Tsarskoye Selo.  Nicholas from early childhood prepared for the imperial fate.  At eight years old, the young prince began active development of the curriculum of the classical gymnasium, additionally taking courses in botany, anatomy, physiology, mineralogy, zoology and languages.  In addition, an important place in the education of the prince was occupied by military affairs, strategy, </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the last Russian tsar from the Romanov dynasty" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/262916.jpg" width="437"></div>  economic sciences, political science, law and so on.  Since childhood, the last Russian tsar from the Romanovs found attraction to military service.  Which, in general, was quite typical for the nobles of that time.  While not yet a monarch, he served regularly in the Preobrazhensky military regiment.

    <p>  <strong>Reign of the last emperor</strong> </p><p>  Nicholas II ascended the throne, being 26 years old, at the end of 1894.  Already the events that occurred during the coronation cast a shadow on the name of the last Russian Tsar.  We are talking about the tragedy on the Khodynka field, when the poor organization of the celebration led to a mass crush in which more than a thousand people died, and tens of thousands were left with injuries.  For this event, the last Russian tsar from the Romanov dynasty was nicknamed "bloody."  Unfortunately, the troubles of the Russian Empire did not end there.  Most historians agree that the monarch was not a strong personality, often letting go of state affairs and not daring to take decisive actions when the country simply needed urgent </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="name of the last Russian tsar" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/262918.jpg" width="400"></div>  transformations.  By the beginning of the 20th century, Russia was increasingly moving towards becoming a raw-material colony of Western states that had gone far in their technical, social and economic development.  A similar thing has already happened with the once powerful Iran and Turkey, which also failed to rebuild their societies on the path of capitalist development.  The last Russian tsar from the Romanov dynasty and subsequently repeatedly made miscalculations that worsened the situation of the state: this was the mediocre Russian-Japanese war with the initially significantly higher potential of the Russians, and an absurd half-attempt to crush the 1905-07 revolution (bloody Sunday), and the assumption of a subsequent mess in the state, the Black Hundred pogroms.

    <p>  However, it should be noted that, despite the generally disappointing picture, the positive aspects of this period can be found.  These include the reforms of Minister Peter Stolypin.  This is especially true of the agrarian sector, where the head of government tried to create a strong stratum of independent peasants (similar to American farmers), isolating them from centuries-old communities, and at the same time to develop land in Siberia by issuing free land allotments.  The reform really began to give positive results, but it was not brought to its logical conclusion, being interrupted first by the death of the chief reformer of the state, and later by the pan-European war. </p><p>  <strong>The collapse of the empire</strong> </p><p>  The last straw of public discontent was the setbacks in World War I, which the last Russian tsar from the Romanov dynasty won only formally and only thanks to the defeats of the Germans on the Western Front, where William II was forced to sign surrender.  The war extremely depleted the resources of the country and the people, splashing out first in the <span>February revolution of</span> popular discontent, and later in the October <span>revolution</span> .  After the first rebellion, the royal family was arrested.  The stormy months on the eve of the October Revolution, the overthrown monarch spent as a high-ranking prisoner, first in Tsarskoye Selo, then in Tyumen, Tobolsk and Yekaterinburg.  At the height of the civil war, the Bolsheviks decided to destroy all the representatives of the dynasty, thus depriving their opponents of trump cards in the form of legitimate applicants to the throne.  The king and his whole family were shot on the night of the sixteenth to seventeenth of July 1918. </p>
