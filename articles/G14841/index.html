"There is no baby food, they have no idea what diapers are!"  They will exclaim.  But all these fears are generated by myths about the elitism of Europe and the "underdevelopment" of countries on other continents.  In this article we will try to fully cover the rest in Tunisia with a child.  Feedback from parents who were not afraid to go to this African country with their own children served us as an informative base.  Which resort to choose for your vacation?  Are there any hotels in Tunisia specializing in the reception of young and very young travelers?  When is the best time to travel to this country?  What to do with the child, when the beach and the sea will bore him?  We will try to answer these questions in our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in tunisia with baby reviews" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2021811.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Pros and Cons of Tunisia </h2><p>  The absence of visas for a short stay, a short flight, kilometers of wide sandy beaches, a long holiday season - all this makes the country in northwestern Africa very attractive for families.  But, if you compare Tunisia with such leaders in the tourism industry as Egypt and Turkey, then this state reveals some disadvantages.  The Mediterranean Sea off the coast of northwest Africa, although warm, is not full of species of underwater inhabitants.  Divers there may seem bored.  Yes, and troubled waters often throw algae ashore.  Egypt with its Red Sea goes far ahead of Turkey and Tunisia.  The last country is taking its first steps in the field of tourism business.  Tunisia has fewer hotels with children's animation than in Turkey.  But nothing beats the amazing Barbary exotic.  She is present everywhere in Tunisia.  And the resorts of the country are so different from the impersonal Turkish and Egyptian Antalya and Marmaris, Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia hotels for families with children reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2021799.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, the beach season there lasts from April to November.  But this is for adults.  The deep Mediterranean Sea in April is still cold, and seasoned people dare to dive into its waters.  In November, the water remains warm, but the mornings and evenings are quite fresh.  And the winds - a sign of the approaching winter - begin to make their way to the bones.  In July-August, in principle, a vacation in Tunisia with a small child is possible.  Reviews assure that the sea warms up to temperatures very comfortable for a gentle baby organism - + 26-28 degrees.  But in the summer months, tourists recommend bringing a child to the beach in the morning and evening.  The period from eleven to sixteen hours should be carried out if not in an air-conditioned room, then at least in a deep shadow.  But if you want your baby to splash around in the sea and be able to freely build sand castles from morning to evening, then you need to wisely choose the time when to go with your child to Tunisia on vacation.  The best time for children is the periods: from May to mid-June and September-October.  But even then, do not forget at home sunscreen with a high level of SPF. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia families with children best hotels reviews" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2021821.jpg" width="600"></div>

In Tunisia, unlike Turkey, there are no youth resorts or quiet seaside villages designed exclusively for families with children.  In every town in this African country you can find hotels specializing in the reception of young tourists.  Reviews about holidays in Tunisia with children recommend choosing a resort based on vacation time and the age of the child.  For example, if your child is still too small to be interested in excursions, go to Djerba.  This island is the warmest place in Tunisia.  In the sea you can bathe your child in the second half of April.  Clean sand and a smooth entry into the water are available in Mahdia.  But if your child has grown up, is no longer satisfied with sculpting Easter cakes from sand and longs for other entertainments, do not take him to such resorts as Nabeul, Tabarka or Gammart.  There is absolutely no entertainment for children outside the hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Tunisia with a small child reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2021798.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  How to choose a hotel for families with children in Tunisia? </h2><p>  Hotels in this country have long mastered "narrow specialization."  And if in Tunisia there are no "children's" resorts, then there are hotels for families.  But, choosing a hotel by this parameter, several important points should be clarified.  Firstly, a mini club.  They are available in all hotels that specialize in children's vacations.  But Tunisia is a favorite vacation spot with the French, British, Germans and Dutch.  Therefore, in some mini-clubs the child will not be accepted if he does not speak English or other European languages.  And the nannies in such hotels do not speak Russian. </p><p>  Other mini-clubs have a tough age limit and you will have to deal with your own three-year-old baby or 13-year-old teenager.  But there is a choice: you need to contact Russian tour operators collaborating with Tunisian hotels.  For families with children (reviews mention this several times), such hotels attract Russian-speaking animators.  You should also make sure that the hotel has a large green area with a shallow pool.  It would also be nice to have well-shaded playgrounds.  You should not choose a city hotel on the third or fourth line so that trips to the sea do not turn into torment for your child. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia djerba holidays with children reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2021828.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tunisia, families with children, best hotels: reviews </h2><p>  Particularly scrupulous parents who do not trust the African exotic should consider booking a chain hotel.  In this case, you always know what level of services at the hotel awaits you.  Of the five-star hotels, reviews recommend Iberostar Royal, which is located in Mansour.  This hotel even has a children's menu, which is rare for Tunisia.  Of the "fours" ahead of all, "Palm Azur 4".  This hotel specializes in children's activities.  Not only that: it has Russian-speaking animators in the mini-club.  The reviews claim that the all-inclusive system at this hotel provides excellent food.  Breakfast includes freshly squeezed fruit juices.  Palm Azur 4 has a large area with a well-shaded garden.  And what about those tourists who cannot afford a five- or four-star vacation in Tunisia with a child?  Reviews recommend choosing the Dar Hiam hotel.  Guests of this three-star hotel are allowed to use the entire infrastructure of the neighboring, more expensive.  ‚ÄúDar Khayyam‚Äù is located on the first line from the sea and has a very nice and clean beach, which is praised by many tourists.  The well-landscaped hotel has three pools.  She works on the All Inclusive system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about holidays in Tunisia with children" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2021862.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Do not worry about this item, going on vacation in Tunisia with a child.  Reviews assure that the national cuisine of this country is replete with fruits and desserts.  Main dishes can be islets for a tender children's stomach.  But in hotels in Tunisia, which have long been hosting tourists with children from Western Europe, they are ready to serve boiled rice, mashed potatoes, pasta, chicken breast or fish fillet for young guests.  Even in three-star hotels, you can choose dishes for the child.  For breakfast, pancakes, yoghurts and granola are served there.  If your child is very small, you should not take a bunch of jars with baby food on the road.  Tunisian pharmacies sell local or French counterparts, which are several times higher in quality than Russian ones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia holidays with children reviews of tourists prices" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2022807.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fun for kids.  Hammamet </h2><p>  Every parent wants to make their holidays in Tunisia with their child more emotional.  Reviews assure that in Hammamet there are plenty of such entertainments, both for schoolchildren and for very young children.  You can plunge into the atmosphere of ancient Carthage, and at the same time ride 18 water slides in the Carthage Land water park.  This place has a worthy competitor.  In the water park "Flipper" 13 adults and six children's water attractions.  In the zoo Friger Park, visitors will see different animals, as if descended from the pages of the tale of Dr. Aibolit.  And then you can go to the Fabiland children's amusement park.  There is a skating rink in Hammamet with real ice. </p><h2>  Tunisia, Djerba: holidays with children </h2><p>  Reviews assure that there are many hotels on the island, on the territory of which there is entertainment for the youngest guests.  This is a water slide, and a mini-ranch or a small zoo.  In Djerba, you can take siblings of all ages to the only crocodile farm in Tunisia. </p><h2>  Entertainment for children in Sousse </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists about holidays with children in Tunisia and prices for it, repeatedly mention this resort.  You can buy a ticket to this paradise from 21 and a half thousand rubles.  In Sousse, children will not be bored.  This resort has a unique ‚ÄúIce Cream Museum‚Äù.  It presents over a hundred kinds of goodies.  And in Sousse there is a botanical garden ‚ÄúOasis of El Kantaoui‚Äù, an amusement park ‚ÄúHergla Park‚Äù, where not only adults but also children can experience a rush of adrenaline in go-karts, a menagerie and a whole town of water entertainment ‚ÄúAquapalas‚Äù. </p>
