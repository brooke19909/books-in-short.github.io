    <p>  <span>It is better to stop to rest in Vishnevka in the Krasnodar Territory (reviews of tourists confirm this) in the private sector.</span>  <span>Today it is a justifiable choice: comfortable and economical.</span>  <span>Rest in Vishnevka involves not only being on the beach.</span>  <span>Very close to the village is Sochi National Park, and five kilometers away is a picturesque waterfall, with a touching name - "Tears of Laura."</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>Rest in these places will cost inexpensively.</span>  <span>Prices in Vishnevka are quite affordable, especially when you consider the quality of relaxation and the magnificent nature.</span>  <span>The village stretches along the coast for several kilometers, located mainly along the Black Sea.</span> </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  <span>Weather in Vishnevka of the Krasnodar Territory has a good rest.</span>  <span>The climate here is subtropical, humid.</span>  <span>The average annual air temperature is + 13.5 ¬∞ C.</span>  <span>In summer, the weather in Vishnevka in the Krasnodar Territory does not differ in sweltering heat: the average July temperature is around + 24 ¬∞ C.</span>  <span>In winter, the air does not cool below + 6 ¬∞ C.</span>  <span>About 1,400 mm of precipitation falls annually, most of which falls in the winter.</span> </p><h2>  Boarding houses </h2><p>  <span>On the territory of the Lazarevsky district there is a boarding house "Petrel", which belongs to Moscow State University.</span>  <span>It was built in 1963.</span>  <span>Previously, it belonged to the Sochi Resort Management.</span>  <span>Private boarding house "Helios", also located in the village, used to be part of the "Petrel" and had a not too original name - "Petrel-1".</span>  <span>An interesting fact: in 1904-1927, where the Petrel is today, academician V.
