Ldzaa is a small resort-type village most visited by tourists.  Picturesque places, cozy beaches, low cost of living - all this makes it very popular. </p><h2>  Resort Feature </h2><p>  The village of Ldzaa was located (in Soviet times it bore the name of Lizawa) in the bay of Cape Pitsunda.  This picturesque place is surrounded by relict pines.  Today, this village is very attractive for tourists.  The freshness of the air, beaches of sand, the presence of centuries-old attractions attract guests from many countries.  It can be families with children, lovers or a group of friends.  Important prices for accommodation, which are famous for Abkhazia, are important in choosing a place for recreation.  Ldzaa is ready to give tourists a measured, relaxing holiday.  This is due to the fact that the patency of tourists here is several times less than in larger tourist cities. </p><p>  Pitsunda Reserve is famous for its special kind of pine, striking in its uniqueness.  It is on this territory that the village of Ldzaa (Abkhazia) is conveniently located.  Pine trees growing throughout the cape have created a unique microclimate.  Tourists will remember the sea air for its crystal clearness for a long time.  And coniferous forests saturated the air with a healing aroma.  The beach is completely surrounded by trees, which creates incredible natural beauty. </p>

    <h2>  Where to stay in Ldzaa (Abkhazia) </h2><p>  The private sector is the best place to stay.  Among tourists, Lizawa is better known as the Fish Factory.  In the village, this is the name of the small microdistrict.  The district received this name in honor of the main street, which bears a similar name.  Every tourist knows that relaxing in the Fish Factory is cheap and comfortable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ldzaa is an ideal place to relax.  This can be explained by the lack of industrial enterprises in the village.  The local population lives mainly through the organization of tourist vacations.  In order to attract as many vacationers as possible, the prices for accommodation and entertainment here are several times lower than in other resorts located in the neighborhood.  I would like to note that for residents of a modern metropolis who want to hide from civilization, Ldzaa (Abkhazia) is ideal. </p><p>  The private sector is the best place for tourists here.  More vacationers decide to stay in one of the houses located on the main streets of Lizawa.  It is almost impossible to find a house in which there would be no room for people who came to rest. </p>

    <h2>  Beach in the village </h2><p>  It is worth telling in more detail about the sea, which Abkhazia is famous for.  Ldzaa is located in the bay.  Due to the fact that there is no open water, the arrival of large waves and cold air flows is not necessary to observe.  All this determines the purity, warmth of the sea. </p><p>  The beach stretched along the coast for four kilometers.  On the coast you can find several separately isolated beach sites.  All of them are spacious enough, this allows you to avoid the "crush" among vacationers.  The surface of the beaches is covered with sand and pebbles.  Each tourist can choose his favorite beach.  But, as long-term practice shows, vacationers most often prefer to relax in the sand.  This is understandable, because it is much more pleasant to walk on it with bare feet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
