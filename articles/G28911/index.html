    <h2>  How it all began </h2><p>  Plows are high-speed vessels with a flat bottom.  They were actively used in the XI-XVIII centuries to move along rivers and lakes.  Therefore, it is they who are depicted on the coat of arms of the village of Strugi Red. </p><p>  People began to settle on this territory in the Stone Age.  This is confirmed by archaeological finds.  To this day, burial sites dating back to the 13th century have been preserved.  The land here has always been fertile, so the settlers planted vegetables and grains, as well as fruit trees.  They kept cattle.  The dishes and clothes were made by ourselves. </p><p>  In the XIII century, the inhabitants of these places built plows, so one of the villages received the same name.  During the reign of Peter I, ship boards were also made here. </p>

    <h2>  Why so called </h2><p>  But how did it happen that the plows turned red?  Oddly enough, this name was given to the village of Belaya.  In 1856, a railway passed by and the station, respectively, was called Belaya.  But there were several stations with that name in Russia.  Therefore, in order to avoid confusion, the word "Strugi" was added to the word "White" and it turned out Strugi-Belaya. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And there is nothing strange that after the October Revolution, when the Red Army liberated settlements from the White Guards, this village was renamed Strugi Red.  By the way, they became a dacha <span>urban type</span> in 1925 by decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. </p>

    <h2>  What was there </h2><p>  At the Belaya station, a depot was located, which eventually became the site of the initial railway school, and then the school.  After World War II, the building had to be restored.  It equipped the train station.  And before the war, since 1932, there was a camp in the village.  The military came here for summer training to engage in tactical and shooting training, and they also studied topography.  Since the Red Strugs were chosen as their location, a map of this area was compiled in detail. </p>

    <h2>  Did not give up </h2><p>  In the Great Patriotic War, the inhabitants of the village took an active part.  Many of them were mobilized.  Those who remained in the rear supplied the front with horses and carts.  The Strugi Reds (Pskov) and the surrounding area gave the war 5,000 fighters, and only 2,000 returned.  Three residents of the village became Heroes of the Soviet Union, two became <span>full holders of the Order of Glory,</span> many received high military ranks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the beginning of the war, the Strugi Reds were abandoned by our troops, but already in February 1944 they were freed from the Nazi invaders. </p>

    <h2>  To remember </h2><p>  In honor of this event, a stele was installed in the village on Sovetskaya Street.  In general, there are many monuments commemorating the feat of the Russian people in World War II.  There is also a <span>mass grave,</span> above which stands the monument ‚ÄúThe Grieving Mother‚Äù. </p><p>  During the war, the Germans shot partisans, civilians and soldiers in the village.  At this place an obelisk is installed.  On Victory Street, the IS-3 Tank mounted on a pedestal symbolically looks. </p><p>  Although Strugi Krasny <span>(Pskov Oblast)</span> has a long history, during the war years everything was destroyed that could serve as a historical or architectural monument, with the exception of several buildings.  For example, the shop of the merchant Kalashnikov (1914) now serves as the Book store.  And the linen warehouse, owned by the merchant Pavlov, became a cafe. </p><p>  But, unfortunately, here you can see mainly only houses of modern construction.  The building was designed by architect B. Klenevsky.  And in 1958, the Strugi Reds were recognized as <span>an urban-type settlement.</span>  The history of the village can be found in the local museum of local lore, which was opened in 1991. </p><h2>  Interesting exhibits </h2><p>  The museum exposition begins with an exhibition of antiquities discovered in the described area.  The following is a story of how the village lived in pre-revolutionary times.  So, the merchant D. Pavlov, whose photographs are presented right there, invested a lot of money in the development of the settlement.  At his expense, a store, school, church, sawmill and library were built.  By the way, local residents today earn by making lumber.  They even export them. </p><p>  The museum has many exhibits dedicated to World War II.  People who are not indifferent to the history of their land work in it.  Thanks to their efforts, commemorative signs were installed in the area indicating the places where any events occurred or the famous compatriots lived.  The museum is often presented with exhibits, so there are a lot of various objects from different eras that are interesting to see with your own eyes. </p>

    <h2>  Sights of the village </h2><p>  In the Strug-Krasnensky district there are many remarkable places related to the history of our country.  For example, an inconspicuous postal station in the village of Zalazy is interesting because it met A. Pushkin and V. Kuchelbeker.  The Decembrist was there when he was transferred to the Dinaburg fortress in 1827. </p><p>  And in the village of Tvorozhkovo there is a beautiful Smyato-Trinity Convent.  In Soviet times, it was closed, but now it is being repaired and partially rebuilt.  Nuns already live in it.  It is interesting to see Feofilova deserts.  It was founded by two revered saints - Theophilos and Jacob.  The relics of the first of them have the ability to have a healing effect. </p><p>  Our homeland is great.  To get to know her better, you should visit places like Red Strugi (Pskov).  Despite the seemingly insignificant villages throughout Russia, their history can be important and instructive for future generations. </p>
