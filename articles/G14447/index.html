Why is he called that?  Experienced tourists tell different things about this.  But the most believable version, probably, is that it is in this place that the sea has an amazing turquoise color and seems deep, almost bottomless.  Or maybe the whole thing is that camping is on the edge of a cliff.  Rest here is offered in fairly Spartan conditions, so it is suitable for adults, physically prepared people with their own vehicles.  Although families often come here for a real "wild" vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Camping blue abyss Gelendzhik" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1902367.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "Blue Abyss" (Gelendzhik): how to get and location </h2><p>  Camping is located between the village Divnomorskoe and the <span>resort of Janhot.</span>  It is approximately five to six kilometers from each resort.  To get here, you need to get to Gelendzhik.  Then after Divnomorsky move towards Dzhanhot.  On the way, you will see a sign for camping.  You turn right.  The road here is not asphalt, but a country one.  First she walks through the forest, and then along the cliff.  The farther, the more the condition of the road leaves much to be desired, and all the turns are already near the "Abyss".  So the best transport you can get here is an SUV.  Camping is located in a forest overgrown with relict <span>Pitsunda pine,</span> on a high cliff above the sea.  The place is very quiet and peaceful.  To the beach from the camping "Blue Abyss" (Gelendzhik) walk about a quarter of an hour.  But all this time you have to go down a steep scree.  You can come here on foot along the shore.

It is so complicated that in the most difficult places ropes and metal cables are pulled.  Therefore, shoes need to be taken here convenient, without sliding soles.  The height of the slope is about 50 meters.  Near the sea there is a small ladder.  The <span>Gelendzhik lighthouse is</span> visible <span>.</span>  The strip of beach is quite thin, but the water is clean and very clear.  Pebbles are large, stones and rocks are on the shore.  To enter the water, it is best to get "coral" slippers.  Nearby there is another bay with a good gentle entry into the water and small pebbles, but it is chosen by nudists.  But this is one of the most picturesque and sparsely populated coasts on the Black Sea.  And all this beauty is bordered by snow-white cliffs.  If you take a walk along the shore towards Dzhanhot, you can find a spring, so if you want to drink at sea, then you are provided with good water. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists often describe the stunning nature and healing air around the "Blue Abyss" (Gelendzhik).  They often use photos of the sea and mountains as illustrations to their reviews.  And they write that in these places amazing energy.  The prices for rest are moderate.  In 2017, they paid 300 rubles a day for parking the car, and 250 for each person in the tent. But there are complaints among the positive reviews.  For example, tourists do not like too steep descent to the sea - they say that in some places it is dangerous, especially with children.  And here is poor mobile communications.  But basically strong and confident people who are not afraid to tear themselves away from civilization and live in a tent come here to rest, they are not afraid of height and difficulties.  And as a reward they get a stunning beauty of the forest and the amazing sea.  As well as aromas of salty and coniferous winds, which mix together in an amazing way.  It is said that this place resembles Thailand, only with picturesque stones instead of sand. </p>
