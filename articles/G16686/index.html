The Maldives or the Balearic Islands, London or Frankfurt, Shanghai and even Baku - at all these resorts and cities you can find a chain of hotels that amazes the imagination with luxury buildings, room decoration, sophisticated cuisine, and the highest quality of services.  But most of all Jumeirah hotels in its "homeland" are <span>in the United Arab Emirates.</span>  And their number is off the charts in Dubai.  In this city, there are lonely hotels and entire hotel complexes.  One such thing, Madinat Jumeirah, will be discussed today.  Prices for accommodation in such palaces are rather big, but the rest in them is focused on the most demanding, you might say, capricious customers.  Here we will study their opinion.  What can I get by paying a ticket to a luxury hotel of the Jumeirah chain, such as Madinat (Dubai, UAE)? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Madinat Jumeirah" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1504966.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Madinat Jumeirah Hotels </h2><p>  As the name implies in our article, we are not talking about one hotel.  The Madinat of the Jumeirah network is a whole town of oriental comfort and sophisticated luxury.  Like many other chain operations in Dubai, this complex stands on the prestigious Jumeirah beach coast.  What hotels are included in the resort "Madinat"?  First of all, these are the huge Al Qvasr, Al Nasim and Mina A'Salam.  Near these boutique hotels, consisting of multi-storey buildings, there is also Dar Al Masyaf.  It consists of twenty-nine bungalows.  And closer to the promenade and the sea are seven luxurious cottages, united in the hotel "Jumeirah Malakiya Villas."  The layout of buildings of buildings and bungalows, restaurants and other buildings recreates the ancient Arabian town, where the colorful architecture organically fits into the landscape, with its blooming oases, canals (their total length is about three kilometers) and hanging gardens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Madinat Jumeirah Dubai" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1504972.jpg" width="600"></div>

Hotel "Madinat Jumeirah" (photos of travelers clearly demonstrate this) is a full-fledged resort with developed infrastructure.  Guests of the complex have the opportunity to visit all the bars and restaurants available on its territory, and there are as many as forty.  All bathing pleasures are available at Talise Spa.  For sports there is a Talis Fitness with the most modern fitness equipment.  And even for the sake of shopping, you do not need to leave the territory of the complex.  Shopping center ‚ÄúSouk Madinat Jumeirah‚Äù is designed as an oriental bazaar.  What city without transport?  On the territory of "Madinata" electric cars run around the clock.  The guest of the complex can use them for free.  Moreover, such golf carts will take Madinat guests to such <span>Dubai attractions</span> as Bourges Al Arab, Wild Wadi Waterpark and Jumeirah Beach Hotel.  And if you want to get somewhere else, a free bus will take you to the nearest metro station.  Abrah water taxis run through an extensive network of canals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels Madinat Jumeirah" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1504969.jpg" width="600"></div>

By the way, the Jumeirah International chain owns such sights of the city as the Wild Wadi water park, the Burj Al Arab skyscrapers, the Jumeirah Beach Hotel and the Ward Trade Center Residence.  The hotel complex is located half an hour from <span>Dubai</span> International <span>Airport.</span>  Golden Souk is the city‚Äôs most famous bazaar, located nineteen kilometers from Madinat.  And 6 km there is a golf club and a huge shopping center.  As you can see, the Madinat complex of the Jumeirah hotel chain is a city in the city.  It has everything you need for a good rest.  Even the most demanding customers were satisfied with the location of the complex and its territory with developed infrastructure. </p><h2>  Hotel "Jumeirah Al Qasr" </h2><p>  Now we will consider in order all the resort hotels.  Al Qasr is the main jewel in the crown of the Madinat Jumeirah complex.  The photo represents the real residence of the Sheikh, where traditional architecture is successfully combined with the modern concept of comfort.  If the word "Madinat" in Arabic means "city", then "Qasr" is a "palace".  The name is quite justified.  One main entrance to the hotel looks no worse than the site in front of Versailles.  The wide avenue is decorated with gilded statues of Arabian stallions.  Tall palm trees lined up in two rows, like a company of guardsmen.  We pass into the hall blinding with luxury and rise to the rooms.  Some category names speak for themselves: Royal Suite, Ocean Deluxe King, Executive Arabian, Junior Suite Suite, etc. Each bedroom has antique furniture.  Each bathroom has a noble marble finish.  The design of the rooms does not let you forget that you are in the East.  And luxurious decoration allows you to feel like a hero of the Thousand and One Nights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Madinat Jumeirah photo" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1504975.jpg" width="600"></div>

They are served a daily breakfast.  They can take advantage of a free shuttle service.  The guests of the ‚Äúsuites‚Äù in ‚ÄúAl Kvasra‚Äù are members of the exclusive ‚ÄúClub Executive Lounge‚Äù and ‚ÄúPremium Leger Club‚Äù.  Some rooms have an equipped kitchen and dining area.  Others have a living room.  But all the rooms of the hotel have beautiful balconies overlooking the Persian Gulf or the pacific canals through which small abra boats scurry endlessly.  The simplest room at Al Kwasrah is fifty-five square meters.  The ‚Äúroyal suite‚Äù has three hundred and thirty-two, and the ‚Äúpresidential suite‚Äù is one hundred and eighty.  Reviews say that staying in such rooms emphasizes prestige and gives an unforgettable feeling of self-confidence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Madinat Jumeirah UAE" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1504968.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Dar Al Masyaf </h2><p>  Tourists called this hotel a calm haven.  In the Madinat Jumeirah complex, it is like an oasis of serenity and tranquility.  The hotel consists of twenty-nine detached two-story houses, made according to the canons of Arabian architecture.  Each of them has its own patio.  Dar Al Masyaf Villas are surrounded by lushly flowered gardens and water channels.  Between the villas, paths meander along which it is very pleasant to walk.  You can feel in the Arabic "Venice", a ride on the abre.  In a word, the hotel "Dar Al Masyaf" is chosen by lovers of a refined, but calm and secluded relaxation of a premium class.  If sheikhs are supposed to live in the previous Madinata Jumeirah hotel, then they live in the villas ... they just got out into the countryside.  A butler is attached to each such bungalow, ready to take care of all the little things of life. </p><h2>  Rooms at Dar Al Masyaf </h2><p>  Refined luxury reigns in the bright and airy rooms of the villas.  The rooms on the upper floors have balconies.  The lower level rooms are adjacent terraces on which you can sunbathe.  The rooms in the villas are also divided into categories.  There are also those that do not consist of one bedroom with a bathroom.  But in the simplest room there is antique furniture.  The design of the rooms is made in the Arabic style with warm, golden-red shades.  The bathroom has a rain shower and marble trim.  Some of the villas that host the suites, such as Arabian Summer House or Golf Ocean Suite, have their own pools.  Villas "Malakia" are filled with special luxury.  They are the pearl of the Madinat Jumeirah, an oasis of solitude and relaxation.  Room in the "Malakie" consists of two bedrooms.  Each of them has its own balcony.  The bathroom has a jacuzzi.  There is also a kitchen corner with a bar.  And the villa has its own swimming pool, lawn and gazebo.  Inhabitants of "Malakia" are also members of prestigious clubs and are entitled to services as VIP clients. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Madinat jumeirah dubai reviews" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1504970.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel "Mina A'Salam" </h2><p>  The name of this hotel in the complex-campus "Madinat Jumeirah" (Dubai) translates as "Harbor of the World."  The name is also not accidental.  Getting into ‚ÄúMina A'Salam‚Äù is like plunging into the past of the United Arab Emirates, when there was no oil and tourism, and navigation was the main sector of the economy.  The harbor of the world opens the gates to the entire resort.  The paths through the picturesque gardens begin from it, the canals stretch from it, openwork web stretching throughout the complex.  Thus, the inhabitants of this hotel - as the reviews say - find themselves in the heart of Madinata, in the center of all events.  Mina A'Salam is mainly chosen by business travelers who want to be close to the entire infrastructure of the hotel complex.  But vacationers in pairs or families will also be comfortable here.  The hotel building looks like a palace from Arabian tales.  And the rooms in it also do not dispel the magic of oriental hospitality. </p><h2>  Hotel Al Nasim </h2><p>  This is the smallest hotel in the Madinat Jumeirah complex (Dubai).  Reviews claim that it has recently opened, everything in it pleases with novelty.  But this hotel has already managed to win several prestigious awards at competitions of local hoteliers.  The hotel building is small, five-story.  It surrounds a water harbor where trees grow on artificial islands.  It should be said that this hotel is located closer to the sea than all the others in the complex.  From the spacious and bright rooms, the Persian Gulf is not only visible, but also audible.  Sea breezes and smells of iodine flies in the windows.  Also visible is the skyscraper ‚ÄúBourj Khalifa‚Äù.  The rooms are decorated in a very interesting style.  They combine the motives of the Bedouin culture and modern comfort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Madinat jumeirah reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1504974.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Based on the high level and luxury of the rooms, one can also assume how delicious, varied and elegantly fed in the Madinat Jumeirah hotel complex.  Reviews say that a guest of any hotel can visit all the restaurants and bars in this resort town.  And there are more than forty of them.  Upon check-in, vouchers are issued - one for lunch and dinner for each day of residence.  What restaurants do tourists recommend visiting?  All of them are wonderful and awarded.  The most praised tourists were the Mexican La Tortuga, the Spanish Al Hambra, the Arabic Haimat Al Bahar and the Italian Tuscany.  For an extra charge of forty-three dollars per person, you can visit a la carte restaurants.  Of these, tourists praise the Thai Pai Tai.  You can have a great evening at 360 degrees.  The name of this restaurant suggests that the view from its windows opens panoramic. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  There are no pools in the Madinat Jumeirah complex.  But it‚Äôs not after them, but over the warm sea that tourists travel to the UAE.  Madinat Jumeirah has its own beach, which stretches for two kilometers.  Next to it is another hotel chain.  It is called Jumeirah Beach.  The entire infrastructure of this hotel (pools, restaurants, animation) is available for guests of Madinata.  On the beach, guests are treated to free fruit and refreshments with cool, damp towels.  In addition to swimming in pools and at sea, tourists recommend trying other water pleasures.  Children and adults will love the Wild Wadi, a water park that also belongs to the Jumeirah network.  The apotheosis of negi - this is how the guests of the Talise spa center described the hotels.  There are all conceivable types of bath services (such as an infrared sauna or yoga classes). </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Needless to say, the Madinat Jumeirah Hotel (United Arab Emirates) provides its guests with a variety of services to make their stay luxurious.  There is also a mini-club for children (it is located on the territory of the Jumeirah Beach Hotel).  Most of all, vacationers liked the fact that you can move around on the vast territory of the complex for free on golf carts and in small boats.  Most of the photographs of tourists are dedicated to this ‚Äúown Venice in Dubai‚Äù. </p>
