Sew and knit them in various styles and for all ages. </p><p>  Crocheting a skirt is one of many and very common ways to create this wardrobe item.  This lesson itself will bring you endless pleasure, but the result will delight not only you, but also many others. </p><p>  Light crocheted fishnet skirts are a great replacement for shorts and trousers.  Gentle, they will give your appearance elegance and airiness.  In such skirts, all women become attractive.  The main thing is to choose the right length, pattern and thread for knitting - and you will be provided with an easy correction of the flaws of your figure. </p><h2>  Attractive and eye-catching </h2><p>  A common feature of all crocheted skirts is their unusualness, convenience and uniqueness, and the use of lace patterns in knitting gives them an elegant festive look. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.interweave.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="warm skirt" class="if uuid-2577554" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2577554.jpg"></div><p>  Summer office skirts need a lining.  Openwork skirts of maximum length are very good - they are suitable for everyday wear and for a festive event.  A trip to the sea is useful <span>beach skirt.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This article includes several options for crocheting skirts, their patterns and description. </p><h2>  The choice of yarn for knitting skirts </h2><p>  In summer, a thin lace skirt is the perfect way to look smart.  This is not hot, but it looks amazing!  Openwork patterns are suitable not only for the hot season, but also for the autumn-winter period.  Take wool yarn, pick up a warm lining and shine! </p><p>  The correct selection of yarn for creating skirts is the most important condition for the beauty and convenience of the finished product.  For each season, it is different in composition.  Summer things are excellently obtained from the following types of threads: </p><ol><li>  Lanas Stop Cabl√© 5. They are made exclusively in Italy, using only the best mercerized cotton raw materials.  Very suitable for weightless openwork.  It has a rich palette of colors and gleams slightly.  The touch is very pleasant. </li><li>  Domestic <span>Semenovskaya Yarn</span> "Birch" - absolute viscose.  Knit and get great pleasure!  Its only drawback is that viscose is a ‚Äúfloating‚Äù material, it will crawl with wonderful folds.  Although knitting skirts is a plus. </li><li>  Yarn "Dubrava" - linen and viscose.  Flax fiber helps to keep in shape, viscose will not allow shrinkage of flax during washing.  A knitted fabric is cool and silky, flowing with weak knitting.  The remarkable appearance does not lose even with active wearing. </li></ol><p>  For winter creativity, wool is optimal - the skirts will be warm and comfortable.  Better let it be smooth threads - a fluffy skirt will add kilograms to your sides. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Knitting Skirts: Tips for Beginners </h2><p>  Many inexperienced knitters often wonder how to crochet a pattern for knitting a skirt. </p><ol><li>  Some types of skirts fit without patterns. </li><li>  The best way is fitting by attaching to the finished product. </li></ol><p>  If you are not very good at "reading" patterns for knitting openwork, it is easier to knit a skirt from separate small parts, and then connect them with a needle or crochet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted fabric motifs" class="if uuid-2577470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2577470.jpg"></div><p>  You can try to connect it from motifs - hexagons.  Size can be changed by adjusting the number of elements in the rows. </p><p>  You will need: </p><ul><li>  <span>cotton yarn</span> (150 g / 396 m) - 550 grams; </li><li>  hook number 3; </li><li>  lining in thread color; </li><li>  elastic. </li></ul><p>  Tie 25 hexagons, connecting them according to the pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Hexagon knitting pattern" class="if uuid-2577522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2577522.jpg"></div><p>  Spread them in 5 rows.  After all the motifs have been tied and connected, align the skirt at the top, filling the space between the motifs and the belt with air columns and double crochets.  Continue to knit, referring to the pattern.  Tie a belt with a width of 3-4 centimeters and sew it. </p><p>  Next, make a lower skirt, attach to the belt from the inside with two seams, forming a drawstring for the elastic.  Stretch the elastic - and the skirt is ready! </p><h2>  Complex skirt with frill for a girl </h2><p>  For little charms, you can associate a wonderful skirt with frills.  To get started, measure the circumference of the hips at the widest part and decide how long your product will be.  There will be no problems with yarn either - for knitting children's things they usually take cotton thread.  This is the best option, since such a yarn does not cause an allergy in a child, it passes air well and is not hot in it.  For crocheting a skirt for a girl four to six years old, 250-300 grams of yarn should be enough.  Also stock up with a satin ribbon in tone of a thread for a belt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pakbit.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Skirt with frill" class="if uuid-2577477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2577477.jpg"></div><p>  Tie a chain of air loops equal in length to the circumference of the hips plus 2 centimeters (for shrinkage of the finished fabric).  Connect in a ring. </p><p>  Now, in a circle, knit 14 rows with double crochet, making increments through equal segments (if necessary). </p><p>  Next, continue to knit 14 rows of loin mesh (rapport - 1 double crochet, 1 stitch loop).  In order for the canvas to expand, do not make 1 double crochet, but 2 in one loop of the previous row and an air loop between them.  Add evenly in every tenth loop.  To make the skirt more magnificent, you can add more often. </p><p>  The net is connected, without tearing the thread, continue knitting the shuttlecock according to the pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.viazaniymirdetstva.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="scheme for knitting shuttlecocks" class="if uuid-2577509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2577509.jpg"></div><p>  You will need to tie 2 more of the same shuttlecocks according to the proposed scheme.  Place them in the second and ninth rows of the net.  Fasten the first row of each tier to the upper half-loops of the fillet grid.  Tie the top of the skirt, pass the ribbon belt and go decorate your baby. </p><h2>  Pineapple pattern in summer skirts </h2><p>  A wonderful thing - crocheted openwork summer skirt.  For women in the hot season, this is the perfect option.  Light and airy, making the image weightless and attractive.  Pay attention to the straight white skirt connected by the pineapple pattern.  She will look great on young girls and older women. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet kit" class="if uuid-2577473" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2577473.jpg"></div><p>  Measure the hips and determine the length. </p><p>  First make a belt.  Dial a chain of air loops that is equal to the width of your girdle and continue to knit with single crochets until its length becomes equal to your waist + 2 cm. </p><p>  Further, according to the scheme, evenly distributing over the belt the number of rapports necessary for the width of the skirt. </p><p>  After tying the required length, tie the edge of the skirt with single crochet columns, and then with the "crustacean step". </p><p>  Sew the belt to the skirt, insert the ribbon or the back of the drawstring for the elastic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="postila.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="scheme &quot;Pineapples&quot;" class="if uuid-2577461" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2577461.jpg"></div><h2>  For winter </h2><p>  Woolen skirts carry the opportunity to be romantic and tender, not allowing to freeze even in winter.  A unique skirt, knitted with a square pattern, will be a stylish and versatile piece of clothing.  You can wear it in a wide variety of combinations: with stiletto heels, with boots with thick soles, with bright silk blouses and wool sweaters, with a fur vest or leather "leather jacket" - an infinite number of options. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stolbik-plus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="warm skirt" class="if uuid-2577500" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2577500.jpg"></div><p>  For knitting you will need: </p><ul><li>  700 g of thick yarn; </li><li>  hook number 5. </li></ul><p>  Knit according to the pattern. </p><h2>  Maple Leaves Pattern </h2><p>  A skirt using such a pattern will turn out well from thin summer yarn, and from warm winter.  This luxurious pattern is an imitation of maple leaves, and the ability to choose different colors of threads will make the model picturesque.  All leaflets are knitted separately, and then stitched into one fabric in random order (or mess - as you like). </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maple leaves" class="if uuid-2577485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2577485.jpg"></div><p>  Description of the skirt crocheted.  Based on the maple leaf scheme with symmetrical edges.  It is better to tie leaves that will be different from each other.  To do this, just make some edges longer and others shorter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="maple leaf outline" class="if uuid-2577494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2577494.jpg"></div><p>  First, tie a lot of sheets of different colors and sizes.  Next, sew them, after washing and ironing.  So that there are no problems with opening the unsuccessfully fitted sheet, sew first with large stitches with a thread of contrasting color. </p><p>  After that try on a skirt.  If everything suits you, you can fix everything with a working thread. </p><p>  To align the edge, work with the free knitting technique - tie all free (holey) places with chains of air loops.  Tie a belt and sew it to the skirt. </p><p>  For an average length, approximately 850-900 grams of yarn will be needed.  The combination of three colors looks perfect: red, yellow and brown. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  There are a lot of models of crocheted skirts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.knittingmatters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet skirts" class="if uuid-2577526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2577526.jpg"></div><p>  Is it difficult to knit skirts?  Of course not.  It‚Äôs much harder to just get started.  But if you learn crochet, creating wonderful, unique and unique things will become very easy and pleasant! </p>
