Indeed, the market now offers a huge number of devices from different manufacturers, which attract attention with their characteristics and capabilities.  So what is the end result?  Let's get it right.  In today's review, we will consider the best tablets up to 10,000 rubles, which can be safely recommended for purchase.  It will be interesting! </p><h2>  Turbopad 724 </h2><p>  So, the device from the Russian company TurboPad, model 724, opens the list of today's tablets. This device will be an excellent solution for those who do not have a lot of money, but at the same time have a desire to get a tablet with good functionality. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Externally, the Turbopad 724 looks good, but it is quite typical for devices in the low price range.  The case is made of plastic, the back side is stylized as a wooden surface - it looks unusual.  The prints on the case are almost invisible, which cannot be said about the front part, where there simply is no end to them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="andro-help.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="good tablet up to 10 thousand rubles TurboPad 724" class="if uuid-2597848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2597848.jpg"></div><p>  The arrangement of elements is standard.  On the right is the power button, volume rocker and internal reset button.  On top is a headphone jack and micro-USB for charging.  Also under the upper removable part are slots for two SIM cards and a memory card.  On the back there is a camera eye with a flash and the main speaker, and on the front panel there is only a display, front camera, various sensors and a speaker. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The device screen has a diagonal of 7 inches and a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels.  Type of IPS matrix.  In general, the screen, as for a 7-inch tablet up to 10,000 rubles and its class, is not bad, with rich colors, but not without drawbacks.  The brightness margin is weak, it is difficult to make out the information on the display in the sun.  Viewing angles are not bad, but again, when tilting, you can see how the picture begins to "yellow", then "violet".  Also, the lack of a protective coating should be attributed to the disadvantages of the screen. </p><p>  Turbopad 724 runs on a Spreadtrum SC7731 processor with 4 cores and a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz.  RAM installed 1 GB, and internal memory - only 8 GB.  For graphics, the Mali-400MP2 video accelerator is responsible.  Especially fantastic opportunities from the "iron" should not be expected, but at least it works more or less smartly.  Play heavy games on this tablet will not work, but simple and not too demanding - definitely yes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="all-test.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TurboPad 724 Tablet Review" class="if uuid-2597849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2597849.jpg"></div><p>  From wireless technologies there is Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GSM and 3G.  LTE, alas, is not provided. </p><p>  As the OS is Android 6 in its purest form.  The system‚Äôs speed is good, but sometimes the animation slows down - a weak processor and a small amount of RAM affect it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  About cameras, you can only say that they are.  The front camera has a resolution of 0.3 megapixels, and the main - 2 megapixels. </p><p>  The battery also does not shine - only 2500 mAh.  From a full charge, the tablet is able to work for no more than a day, and then with moderate use.  In medium or full activity, the tablet may no longer "survive" until evening. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  Advantages of the device: </p><ul><li>  Price - about 4000 p.  average. </li><li>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof work. </li><li>  Ability to use as a telephone. </li><li>  Design. </li><li>  Almost does not get warm. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  A mediocre screen. </li><li>  Lack of protective coating on the screen (quickly scratched). </li><li>  1 GB of RAM. </li><li>  Weak performance in medium to heavy games. </li><li>  Cameras. </li><li>  The quality of the materials. </li><li>  Weak autonomy. </li></ul><h2>  Archos 80 oxygen </h2><p>  We pass to the next model.  Another relatively inexpensive but good tablet with an 8-inch display is the Oxygen 80 from Archos.  The device is noticeably distinguished by its characteristics against the background of some competitors, in particular, there is a Full HD-screen, and a metal case, and the hardware is not bad.  However, first things first. </p><h2>  Model description </h2><p>  The tablet externally performed quite well and is not particularly similar to most of the same type of models.  The case is made of metal, but not completely - on top and bottom there are inserts of frosted plastic under the antenna. </p><div class="photo" data-original="new-tec-test.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="review tablet Archos 80 Oxygen" class="if uuid-2597847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2597847.jpg"></div><p>  The back side is practically empty, since it has only a camera eye.  On the front panel, too, everything is standard: a display, a front camera and various sensors.  On the right side are the power button and volume rocker. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Most of the connectors are located on the upper end: 3.5 mm for headphones, micro-USB, HDMI and a slot for a memory card.  There is also a hole with an internal reset button and an external speaker.  At the bottom of the Archos 80 Oxygen there is only a microphone. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The tablet has a screen with a diagonal of 8 inches, while the resolution is 1920 x 1200 pixels.  The pixel density here is 283 ppi, and the matrix type is IPS.  Alas, there is no protective coating, so scratches will appear on the screen. </p><p>  In terms of image quality, the display is objectively good.  The viewing angles are excellent, the color reproduction is good, with bright and saturated colors.  There is also a margin of brightness, in the sun the information remains completely readable. </p><p>  The processor in the tablet is from <span>Mediatek, MT8163A.</span>  The CPU has 4 cores that operate at a frequency of 1.3 GHz.  As a video accelerator is Mali T-720MP2.  RAM 2 GB, built-in 32 GB. </p><div class="photo" data-original="new-tec-test.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet up to 10,000 thousand rubles Archos 80 Oxygen" class="if uuid-2597851" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2597851.jpg"></div><p>  This device is very good in performance.  The system works smartly, by the way, the OS here is Android 6 in its purest form.  Brakes, glitches, microfreezes - there is nothing like this in the work.  As for the games, then everything is fine with them too.  Most modern toys will calmly launch on the tablet, only to comfortably play some of them will have to lower the graphics settings to low or medium. </p><p>  A set of wireless communications is standard: Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth.  But there is no GSM-module, as well as 3G, 4G. </p><p>  There are two cameras in the device: front-facing at 2 megapixels and the main at 5 megapixels.  The first one is good for video communication, and the second one can be used only in rare cases, since the photo quality is very mediocre. </p><p>  The battery of the device has a capacity of 4500 mAh.  At first glance, this is a good indicator, but in practice, from a full charge, the tablet can work for a day, but no more. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the Archos 80 can be safely called one of the best tablets up to 10,000 rubles in the ratio of price and quality. </p><h2>  Pros and cons of the model </h2><p>  Advantages of the device: </p><ul><li>  Metal case. </li><li>  Nice screen. </li><li>  Nice hardware. </li><li>  Performance. </li><li>  HDMI port </li><li>  Loud speaker. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  There is no protective coating on the screen. </li><li>  Cameras. </li><li>  There is no SIM card slot and GSM module. </li><li>  Average autonomy. </li><li>  Lack of 3G and 4G. </li><li>  Heat. </li></ul><h2>  Prestigio Wize PMT3131D </h2><p>  Continues the rating of <span>budget tablets</span> Prestigio Wize PMT3131D.  This is a fairly balanced device in its characteristics, which is perfect for not too demanding customers. </p><h2>  Description of Prestigio Wize </h2><p>  About the design of the tablet, you can not really talk, because it is not noticeable.  The case is made of cheap plastic with a matte finish, so that prints do not remain on it. </p><p>  At the top there is a headphone jack and a micro-USB port.  On the left side is the power / lock button, volume rocker and a hole with an internal reset button. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onlinetrade.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="inexpensive tablet up to 10,000 rubles Prestigio Wize PMT3131D" class="if uuid-2597845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2597845.jpg"></div><p>  As for the back side, there is only a peephole of the camera and an external speaker.  The upper part, by the way, is removable on the tablet, under the cover there are 2 slots for SIM cards and a slot for a flash drive.  On the front side, in addition to the display, there is still a front camera and several sensors. </p><p>  As you can see, the device on the "exterior" is very simple, but given the price of the Prestigio tablet (5,800 rubles), then, in principle, there is nothing wrong with that. </p><h2>  Tablet Specifications </h2><p>  The device runs on a Mediatek MTK8321 processor, which has 4 cores and a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz.  The RAM here is 1 GB, the internal memory is 16 GB, and the Mali 400 is used as a video accelerator. The tablet works quite fast, but in some places there are slowdowns in the animation.  Also, do not install too many applications on the device, otherwise it can seriously slow it down. </p><p>  The screen here is 10 inches with a resolution of 1280 x 800. Not the best ratio, but what is, that is.  The color rendering display is very mediocre.  On the one hand, it has good bright and rich colors, good saturation, contrast, but on the other - a small margin of brightness, average viewing angles, plus there are color inversions when the device is tilted.  There is no protective coating either; the screen is poorly readable in the sun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onlinetrade.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prestigio Wize PMT3131D Tablet Review" class="if uuid-2597853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2597853.jpg"></div><p>  Android 6 operating system with a proprietary shell, which, frankly, is an amateur.  There are no complaints about the speed of the firmware, but again, this is only so far few applications are installed on the device. </p><p>  There is nothing to say about cameras - they are purely for show.  You should not use them, because even some button phones remove better. </p><p>  The set of wireless capabilities here is as follows: Wi-Fi, GPS, GSM, 3G, Bluetooth. </p><p>  The battery has a capacity of 5000 mAh, which is good.  From a full charge with a not very intense load, the device is quite capable of working for a little more than a day. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of Prestigio Wize </h2><p>  Advantages of the device: </p><ul><li>  Reasonably priced Prestigio tablet. </li><li>  Good filling (for your money). </li><li>  Assembly. </li><li>  Battery. </li><li>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof work. </li><li>  Display (for its advantages). </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  Housing made of cheap plastic. </li><li>  Cameras. </li><li>  Display (for its cons). </li><li>  No 4G. </li><li>  1 GB of RAM. </li><li>  Bad sound from the external speaker. </li><li>  Performance (when loading the tablet with applications). </li><li>  Heat. </li></ul><h2>  Tablet from Lenovo </h2><p>  Another inexpensive Chinese but good tablet is the Lenovo Tab 4 TB-7504X.  Pay attention to this device for the following reasons: high-quality screen, Android 7, good build and the presence of LTE. </p><h2>  Model Description Tab 4 TB-7504X </h2><p>  In appearance, the tablet is difficult to say anything.  On the one hand, it looks nice and compact, but on the other - it is very similar to many competitors.  The case is plastic, assembled efficiently.  On the back side, by the way, matte plastic with a slightly rough surface, but nice to the touch, is used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onlinetrade.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="good and inexpensive tablet Lenovo Tab 4 TB-7504X" class="if uuid-2597852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2597852.jpg"></div><p>  On the front side there is a display, a speaker, sensors and a front camera.  The peephole of the main camera is located behind.  At the bottom there is a microphone, and on top are a headphone jack and a micro-USB port. </p><p>  On the right side are the volume control buttons and the power / lock button.  On the left side, under the plug, are hidden slots for SIM cards and memory cards. </p><h2>  Model specifications </h2><p>  Lenovo Tab 4 TB 7504X works, like most other models, on a 4-core processor from Mediatek MT8735.  The processor frequency is 1.3 GHz.  The video accelerator here is Mali T-720, and 2 GB of RAM is installed.  There is also a version with 1 GB of RAM, but this is too small. </p><p>  ‚ÄúIron‚Äù, in principle, is not bad, but you should not expect special performance in medium and heavy games. </p><p>  The tablet screen has a diagonal of 7 inches and HD resolution of 1280 x 720. The IPS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãconfigured quite well.  Viewing angles are good, the picture looks saturated, with the correct color reproduction and contrast.  There is also a margin of brightness, but in direct sunlight, the information on the display will have to be examined.  But there is no protective coating here, so the film will have to be glued in any case. </p><p>  The operating system in the Android 7 tablet with a proprietary shell.  And here not everything is so cool.  From time to time, the device starts to slow down terribly, freezes appear, animations are buggy, applications crash, etc. The main reason why this happens is a poor setup of your own shell and errors in the firmware.  So the first thing that will need to be done after purchasing the device is to go into system updates and update the firmware, where all the glitches and problems have already been fixed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onlinetrade.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenovo Tab 4 TB-7504X Tablet Review" class="if uuid-2597850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2597850.jpg"></div><p>  The cameras in the device are mediocre.  A 2 megapixel front camera is suitable only for video communication, and a 5 megapixel main camera is suitable only for the most extreme cases, for example, when you need to take a picture of a transport schedule or something like that. </p><p>  Wireless interfaces are presented in full: Bluetooth, GPS, LTE, GSM, Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G. </p><p>  The battery here is weak, only 3500 mAh, but with not very active use of its charge may last a little more than a day.  With moderate activity, the tablet will have to be charged every night. </p><p>  In principle, in terms of price and quality, this is perhaps one of the best tablets up to 10,000 r.  On the market. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of Tab 4 </h2><p>  Advantages of the device: </p><ul><li>  Screen. </li><li>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof work. </li><li>  Android 7. </li><li>  LTE </li><li>  Nice hardware stuffing. </li><li>  Build quality. </li><li>  Compact and ergonomic. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  Unstable OS shell (need firmware update). </li><li>  Medium battery. </li><li>  Cameras. </li><li>  Bad external speaker. </li><li>  Combined tray (either 2 SIM cards, or 1 SIM and a memory card). </li></ul><h2>  Huawei Mediapad T3 8.0 </h2><p>  Well, and closes the list is a very suitable and even a <span>gaming tablet</span> up to 10,000 rubles - Huawei Mediapad T3.  In order to understand why this is a good tablet and why you should pay attention to it, you need to get to know it better. </p><h2>  Description of Huawei Mediapad T3 </h2><p>  In terms of design, Huawei is not much different from previous devices, but it looks attractive and stylish.

On the right is the power button, volume rocker and slots for a memory card and SIM card under the flap.  Left is empty.  At the top there is only a headphone jack, and at the bottom is a microphone and micro-USB port. </p><p>  The front side has a display covered with a protective glass, a front camera, sensors and a speaker.  On the back side, only the main camera lens. </p><p>  In fact, this is the best tablet up to 10,000 p., Which can be found on the market with such characteristics and performance. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of the Mediapad T3 Tablet </h2><p>  The screen size of the tablet is 8 inches, resolution is 1280 x 800 pixels, and the pixel density is 180 ppi.

Video accelerator Adreno 308, RAM 2 GB, built-in - 16. </p><p>  The operating system costs Android version 7 with subsequent updates.  As a shell installed proprietary EMUI 5.1.

For their money, they all have very good characteristics.
