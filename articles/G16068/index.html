    <p>  <span>The British constitution</span> has one very striking distinguishing feature.  It consists in the fact that there is no document in it that would be the main law for the United Kingdom.  Democratic English society has long lived without a constitution, and all thanks to the fact that in 1215 the Magna Carta was adopted in the country.  If we compare the level of development of public relations in these years other countries were located, then the emerging democracy in England (thanks to the charter) arouses great respect. </p><p>  Since its inception, the Magna Carta has remained at all times symbolic and the main part of the unwritten, but clearly executed English constitution.  The word ‚Äúcharter‚Äù is literally translated from Greek as ‚Äúhandwritten document‚Äù.  Most often it is used in a figurative meaning, namely, as a word: ‚Äúrights‚Äù, ‚Äúprivileges‚Äù. </p><p>  How did it happen that it was in England that this amazing document was born, which changed the lives of people for many centuries and ensured a worthy existence for its inhabitants? </p><p>  The Magna Carta was announced and signed on June 15, 1215 in the Thames River Valley, not far from the town of Rannimed.  At that time, King John the Landless ruled, and he was famous for his unfair governance.  Outrage and bribery reigned in the country because of his connivance.  The Magna Carta was created as a necessary measure to combat the existing lawlessness, which was growing more and more in the country every year. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The situation was so complicated that, for example, the king himself could take the land from the vassal without a court or introduce levies at his discretion, which exceeded the established ones.  He introduced excessive payments and taxes under any pretext, with the sole aim of enriching the treasury.  Litigation was conducted carelessly, and the one who had the most money won.  In fact, an official bribe was given to a government official.  The judicial system has been paralyzed.  In addition, King John the Landless unleashed the wasteful in the war with France, thereby ruining the country. </p><p>  He was opposed by the opposition in the person of the barons and the church, which was on the side of the indignant and showed sympathy for them.  The participation of the latter was not unreasonable, since the king conducted his rule so unreasonably that even with the <span>pope he</span> ruined his relations. </p><p>  The Magna Carta of 1215 was precisely the document that was supposed to restore order to the country.  It was written in Latin and 63 historical articles were presented in it.  This document had another name - "Baron articles."  King John was forced to agree to the terms of the rebel barons, and the Magna Carta of 1215 was born.  It provided for the most important thing - it was to limit the king‚Äôs power by creating a special council of 25 barons.  According to this document, after filing an application from four members of the council, it was allowed to ‚Äúpress the king by all means‚Äù (Article of Charter 61). </p><p>  Important changes followed this in the relations between the king and the church, as well as between the barons and free people.  The king ensured the freedom of the church, gave it special privileges and guaranteed immunity.  He also promised that taxes and fees would be collected by decision of the general council of the kingdom. </p><p>  Article 13 guaranteed liberties to London and other cities, and article number 36 gave a significant impetus to the successful development of trade and crafts.  The Magna Carta of 1215 contributed to the consolidation and stabilization of the United Kingdom.  Articles 41 and 42 became equally important. They ensured freedom of entry and exit for foreign and local merchants.  In addition, the Great Charter secured the rights of large feudal lords to own property. </p><p>  Article 39 turned out to be the most significant, since it was therein that guarantees of property as well as personal inviolability of each citizen were named.  It stated that a free person can be arrested, imprisoned or deprived of property only by legal decision of the judges.  Article 45 required the election of qualified judges as well as worthy officials.  The Grand Charter guaranteed that it would ensure that arbitrary arbitration was eliminated (art. 40).  The result of its creation was the beginning of the abolition of feudal dependence, and its provisions became the basis for the further development of a great democratic country. </p>
