    <h2>  Orleans story </h2><p>  The founders of the city are the Gaul tribes, who built it as a port on the Loire River and used it as the economic and transport center of France.  However, in 52 BC.  e.  it was destroyed by Roman troops led by Julius Caesar. </p><p>  The revival of Orleans took place 200 years later, when Emperor <span>Marcus Aurelius</span> came to power <span>,</span> in honor of which he was given the name Aurelianum (1275).  This name has been around for 17 centuries, during which, due to phonetic transformations in the language, it began to read like Orleans (France). </p><p>  After the fall of the Roman Empire, Aurelianum became the capital of the kingdom, a few hundred years later - the capital of the duchy, which was ruled by relatives of the French monarchs. </p><p>  The geographical location of Orleans was chosen due to its proximity to the river trade routes along which ships brought goods from all over the world to France.  Then they were transported by land to Paris, located just 100 km from the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Over the past century, Orleans was repeatedly attacked and waged, and in the VI century.  for 38 years it becomes the religious center of the country due to the church cathedrals (priest meetings) held here.  For some time after the division of the Frankish state, the city becomes the capital of the Orleans kingdom.  Starting from the X century.  it is considered the second city in France, giving way only to Paris in importance. </p><p>  One of the important events took place in the XIII century.  - This is the opening of the university, thanks to which the city becomes the scientific center of France. </p>

    <p>  Another memorable date in French history, but more tragic - in 1572 there was Bartholomew‚Äôs night in this city, which became the finale of the religious war between the Huguenots and Catholics.  Almost one thousand Huguenots died here by violent death on one night. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The city survived another siege in the 1870s, and then was captured by the Prussian army. </p><h2>  The return of power to the Bourbon dynasty </h2><p>  The beginning of the XIX century.  the country was marked by great historical cataclysms: after the fall of Napoleon, the Bourbon dynasty returned to power.  This process was interrupted when Napoleon, escaping from the island of Elba, where he was serving his exile, tried to return to power.  However, his 100-day rule ended with the rout that the combined armies of England and Prussia inflicted on him at the Battle of Waterloo.  After this, Napoleon was exiled to the island of St. Helena. </p><p>  Beginning in 1814, the stage of the Restoration of the Bourbons and Orleans in France begins in history.  First, Louis XVIII came to power, then Charles X, who were brought by the younger brothers to the king <span>Louis XVI</span> executed in 1792 during the First French Revolution <span>.</span>  This time becomes a period of secret societies and various conspiracies in which former adherents of Napoleon and numerous Republicans participated. </p><p>  Louis XVIII was already old, he left unchanged the Civil Code and the administrative structure of the state, with him the French Constitution was adopted, modeled on the English. </p><p>  Charles X had intentions to promote the party of ultra-royalists to government posts, but since 1827, after the elections, liberals began to come to the posts of ministers.  In France, the Bourbons and Orleans (8th grade studies this at the lessons of history) as a result of an incorrect government policy and the discontent of ordinary citizens, a situation developed that led to another revolution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Revolution of 1830 </h2><p>  July 1830 was marked by a revolution in Paris, during which Charles X was overthrown, and the last French king Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orleans (wore the title since 1800) sits in his place. </p>

    <p>  From the revolution until the end of 1848, France, the Bourbons and Orleans, adhered to the policy of the Reformed Charter (1830), the basis of which was religious equality, the reorganization of suffrage and the weakening of the influence of royal power.  In this regard, <span>Louis Philippe</span> received the nickname "citizen king."  The period of his reign was accompanied by the instability of the country's social life, the numerous conspiracies of his opponents, republican uprisings and even attempts on his life. </p><p>  The situation of the poor in France, the Bourbons and Orleans, did not change from the revolution of 1830 either: after the economic recovery in the early 1840s, a recession began, unemployment began to grow, and the impoverishment of workers continued.  Beginning in 1846, a depression ensued in the country's economy, accompanied by peasant unrest.  February 1848 was marked by the erection of barricades in the streets of Paris and popular unrest, this was the beginning of the Second Republic.  King Louis Philippe fled to England, abdicating the throne. </p><h2>  Restoring Orleans after the war </h2><p>  During the Second World War, the city from 1940 to 1944 was in the hands of Nazi troops.  During his release, American aviation completely bombed the city center, most of the buildings and monuments were destroyed. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, in the postwar years, many buildings were rebuilt according to old designs and drawings, preserving the style, but taking into account modern transport capabilities. </p><h2>  Orleans, France: Attractions </h2><p>  One of the symbols of Orleans, the townspeople consider Jeanne d'Arc, who in this city became famous as a warrior and a winner, so most of the city's attractions are dedicated to her. </p><p>  The main cathedral of Orleans (France) - St. Croix, built in the XIV century.  in imitation of the Parisian Notre Dame.  It was erected on the site of the temple, in which Joan of Arc celebrated the victory along with the army and the townspeople.  On the east side, the facade of the temple is made in the Gothic style, on the west - in a completely different, Romanesque.  This happened due to its destruction in 1568 by the rebellious Huguenots.  During the XVI-XIX centuries, the cathedral was reconstructed, to which completely different architects and builders were alternately involved.  The most recent bell towers were built, from which, thanks to their height of 80 m, a beautiful view of the whole city opens.  The stained glass windows of the cathedral illustrate the life story of a girl who saved the city from a siege. </p>
