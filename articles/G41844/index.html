    <h2>  Location  Kemer, Beldibi </h2><p>  Hotel "Selchukhan" (Turkey) is surrounded by the Tor Mountains.  It is located fifteen kilometers from the center of the village of Kemer.  To get to it, you need to fly to Antalya, and then either use the transfer, or take a bus or dolmush to Beldibi.  From the airport, this area is forty kilometers away.  From the bus station of the city of Antalya - twenty.  Historically, this territory has long been called Lycia.  The village itself, as already mentioned, was built exclusively for tourists, halfway from Antalya to Kemer.  It houses mainly expensive fashionable hotels, as well as shops and entertainment centers.  Minibus number 28 goes from here to Kemer. You can take a walk in Beldibi through beautiful parks that stretch towards Antalya. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Selchukhan Turkey" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/663263.jpg" width="600"></div>

A lot of fruits - watermelons, melons, grapes.  The staff is polite, well-trained, always smiling.  For two weeks, many did not have time to try everything.

The tables are clean, dirty dishes are cleaned instantly, the cook always walks in a white cap. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey beldibi hotel selchukhan" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/663272.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Turkey Kemer.  Hotel "Selchukhan".  Hotel Service Reviews </h2><p>  A gym, a hammam and a sauna in the spa for hotel guests are free.  But if you want to undergo a massage course or do cosmetic procedures, such as peeling, then you will have to pay an additional amount for this.  For children there is a mini club with a playground for games.  You can pack your luggage before flying home, but this is also a paid service.  In the night club "Fly" guests can enter without money.  But you have to pay for drinks. </p><p>  The hotel has good animation.  There are always some contests or activities by the pool during the day.  Children can always find a job for their liking.  Every Tuesday, the hotel hosts the Turkish Night show and has live music on Fridays.  There are many tourists here, of different nationalities - our compatriots, Europeans, and tourists from Asia.  The staff speaks Russian quite tolerably.  If you have any problems, you should contact the hotel manager, whose workplace is opposite the reception.  The Internet here catches not only in the rooms, but throughout the territory, including on the beach. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey beldibi selchukhan" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/666832.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Sea and pool vacations </h2><p>  "Selchukhan" is a hotel (Turkey), which has its own beach.  To get on it, you need to cross the road.  All the way to the sea is about seven minutes in the park.  The coast is large-pebble, so slippers will not interfere.  The beach is not bad, equipped, with cabins, sunbeds and mattresses, towels and umbrellas.  Everyone has enough space and amenities.  A plastic pier was built for better entry into the water.  If you go down to the sea along it, you will immediately go to the depths.  Drinks at the beach bar - both strong and cocktails - are available in unlimited quantities.  There are even refined liquors such as Baileys. </p><p>  The water is very clean and warm, even at the end of the season.  On the left, eight hundred meters from the beach, there is still a wild coast.  There are small pebbles and beautiful rocks with pine trees, but there is no shadow at all.  The hotel has two more pools - children's and with slides.  You can spend time there in case of stormy weather.  But in any case, tourists praise the slides very much.  The older children are completely delighted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey kemer hotel selchukhan 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/663283.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  County Trips </h2><p>  Of course, tourists mainly visit this hotel for a beach holiday.  But there are those who specifically choose this area, which is famous for Mediterranean Turkey - Beldibi.  Hotel "Selchukhan" is approximately the same distance from Kemer and Antalya, and you can easily get there by bus to take a walk on your own.  Go to one place and another a little more than a quarter of an hour.  Bus number six, which leaves from the Migros supermarket, will take you directly to the center of Antalya.  There you can explore the old fortress, walk through the local cafes and make purchases at the Turkish bazaar.  You can visit the beautiful ruins of the ancient city of Phaselis on your own.  There are connecting routes in Kemer.  Well, if you want longer excursions, then it is better to purchase them on the streets of the village. </p><h2>  Turkey Kemer.  Hotel "Selchukhan 4 *" - traveler reviews </h2><p>  This country hotel is good for a relaxing holiday, for families with children, as well as for lovers to walk in the mountains or go on excursions.  Service and food are of higher quality than in some neighboring fives.  The night club is beyond praise.  Animation works all day and in the evenings, as usual.  For a four-star hotel, this hotel is very good, and the vast majority of those who rested there are going to come here again.  After all, this hotel is located in the midst of beautiful mountains, pine trees and warm air filled with pine needles everywhere.  Staying here is healing both for the soul and for the body.  Of all the options that resort Turkey offers, Beldibi ("Selchukhan") is the best choice. </p>
