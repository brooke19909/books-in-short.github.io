In 2009, a survey was conducted by the All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion.  He showed that more than half of Russians have no idea why the Cold War is called the Cold War.  The history of our country contains many interesting facts, each of which deserves attention. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nuclearno.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why the cold war is called cold" class="if uuid-2468931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2468931.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Over the past time, serious changes in politics and economics have occurred in our world.  Mankind is again on the verge of a confrontation between the two systems.  So why is the cold war called cold?  The essence of this phenomenon is the misunderstanding that has developed since 1945. </p><h2>  History of the term </h2><p>  The term itself was coined by George Orwell, an outstanding American writer.  He tried to explain why the cold war is called cold in his article "You and the atomic bomb."  The author formulated the idea that due to the high cost of manufacture, the need for intellectual resources, only some states will be able to afford nuclear weapons, while the rest of the country will face the fear of military operations. </p><p>  CIA founder Allen Dulles called this situation ‚Äúbalancing on the edge‚Äù of devastating attacks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1949, only two major powers had atomic weapons: the USSR and the USA.  It was precisely between these countries that a serious confrontation developed, which in the West began to be called the Cold War. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.timetoast.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="confrontation between powers" class="if uuid-2468942" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2468942.jpg"></div><h2>  Block system </h2><p>  Its essence lies in the emergence of two large blocs of states with different economic and ideological systems.  The liberal-capitalist camp was formed by Western Europe and the USA, and the Soviet Union and its allies created a communist bloc with a state economy based on clear planning and allocation of resources. </p><p>  We continue the discussion of why the Cold War is called the Cold War.  Orwell predicted that tensions between the US and the USSR would not lead to direct conflicts.  His hypothesis was fully confirmed, because all the "hot wars" were indirect, waged by other people.  For example, the war in Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan.  Both states continued to build up arms and develop new types of weapons.  A similar process was called the "arms race." </p><div class="photo" data-original="sciox.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why the cold war is called cold essence" class="if uuid-2468945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2468945.jpg"></div><p>  At the end of the eighties of the last century, when the Soviet Union decided to reduce the production of nuclear weapons, the countries of the West went for rapprochement with the USSR. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Speaking about why the Cold War is called the Cold War, we note that the United States was very enthusiastic about the Soviet proposal at first.  Due to weak leadership and serious internal contradictions, the Soviet Union plunged into a prolonged economic crisis. </p><p>  A situation arose in which the countries of the West and the USA no longer had a serious nuclear adversary, they declared themselves victors in a long cold war, began to rebuild the world, forgetting about the agreements reached with the Soviet Union. </p><p>  So now find out why the cold war is called the cold.  The years of the beginning and end of this confrontation are known even to schoolchildren.  Starting after World War II, a misunderstanding based on the production of nuclear weapons ended in December 1987, when an agreement was signed in Washington by Reagan and Gorbachev.  The essence of the agreement is a reduction in the number of missiles manufactured. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thinglink.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="relations between countries" class="if uuid-2468963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2468963.jpg"></div><p>  For a long time, the United States of America and the Soviet Union did not have worthy rivals, so the arms race is a kind of contest of power and strength between these two major world powers.  After lengthy official negotiations, the situation was able to change for the better. </p><p>  Both states were interested in reducing the number of nuclear weapons produced.  What is currently happening between Russia and the USA?  After certain agreements were reached, the world breathed a sigh of relief, relaxing after the opening of the Iron Curtain between our country and the United States of America. </p><p>  It is still difficult to clearly talk about how relations between Russia and the United States will develop further, but, unfortunately, recent political events are a serious threat to them.  According to experts, the risk of a resumption of the Cold War between major world powers is great. </p>
