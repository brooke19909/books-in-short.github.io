  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Eagle regiment near the village of Mezmay</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Eagle Regiment is one of the popular natural attractions of the Krasnodar Territory.  This place is visited daily by independent tourists and excursion groups.  It offers a beautiful view of the Lagonaki Highlands, the village of Mezmay, the natural tract of Ivanovo Polyana, the gentle slopes of the Zaud and Mezmay mountains.  In the distance, you can see the ranges: the Main Caucasus and Azish-Tau. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The Eagle Regiment is a recess in Lenin's rock, extending in depth from 1.5 to 5 meters and a height of up to 3 meters.  The distance from the base of the cliff to the shelf is about 70 meters.  The ledge rises above the village of Mezmay by 300 meters, above sea level by 1000 m. The shelf, as the place is affectionately called, got its name thanks to the large birds of prey that live here.  Some say that they are eagles, others believe that vultures and bearded men. </p><div class="photo" data-original="komar.bitcheese.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the Eagle Regiment" class="if uuid-2755558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102939/2755558.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Lenin Rock, in which the Eagle Regiment is located, is located in the vicinity of the Mezmay village in the Absheron region of the Krasnodar Territory.  From a certain point of view, the mountain resembles the profile of the leader of the proletariat of the USSR.  Lenin Rock is part of the ridge of Guam.  The mountain is made of limestone.  It has a karst relief, thanks to which you can find caves, ledges and shelves in it.  This area is characterized by a mountain-forest belt of vegetation.  The path to the Eagle Regiment passes through the forest of hornbeam and oak, there are alder, walnut and dogwood.  Ferns, raspberries, currants, gooseberries, and viburnum are common in the forests.  On the route along Mount Lenin, there are observation platforms with extensive panoramas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": Dack9, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top view of the Eagle Regiment" class="if uuid-2755603" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102939/2755603.jpg"></div><h2>  Routes </h2><p>  Almost any person can get to the Eagle Regiment if they have the patience.  This trip does not require special equipment and climbing skills.  There are 3 main ways: </p><ul><li>  The shortest route is 2.5 km, but is considered the most difficult.  The trail sharply gains a height of 300 m. Beautiful panoramas open on this route.  The path begins from the village council of the Mezmay village, runs to the end of Club Street and leads to the path to the right of the dirt road.  In winter and in rain, the route is considered impassable. <div class="photo" data-original="tri15.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The route from the village of Mezmay" class="if uuid-2757190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102939/2757190.jpg"></div></li><li>  The other way is easier.  He goes around a sharp rise.  This route to the Eagle Regiment at Mezmay begins on Podgornaya Street.  It is 100 meters longer than the previous one. In the rain, it is also not recommended for passing. </li><li>  Another route to the Eagle Regiment, the easiest, runs about 5 km from the village.  The distance is 2.7 km.  Climbing 120 m. It starts from parking at the side of the road.  This path is best for travelers aged and for families with small children. <div class="photo" data-original="tri15.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Route from the highway" class="if uuid-2757198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102939/2757198.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  When passing the path to the Eagle Regiment, tourists can stop to rest in Lysaya Polyana.  There are logs on which you can sit.  From it you can enjoy the views.  Also on the trail there is another regiment, on the way to Eagle.  It is smaller in size, but it also offers a beautiful overview. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can go down through Moonglade.  There are several large stones (because of this, it was called Lunar).  Go left to Romashkova Polyana (in June it is covered with daisies), and after it turn right to the drag (old road), which will lead to the trail.  The trail is located on the right bank of the Kurdzhips River to the railway. </p><p>  Another option for the descent is to follow the same road that you climbed.  At the same time, it is not necessary to go to Lysaya Polyana.  You can walk along the trail to the village. </p><p>  The journey to the Eagle Regiment from Mezmay and back takes about 3 hours.  Marks are made along the route.  The coordinates of the Eagle Regiment are N44 12.618 E39 56.226.  Rising to the shelf, it is important to turn in time and not leave along the path to the top of the mountain.  It is better to take a walk early in the morning, as a little later there are excursion groups.  It is desirable to choose clear weather without fogs, otherwise part of the review will not be visible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": Dack9, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mezmay village with the Eagle regiment" class="if uuid-2755562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102939/2755562.jpg"></div><h2>  What to take on a hike </h2><p>  To make the trip a success, you need to take the necessary things with you: </p><ul><li>  water (you may not find it along the way); </li><li>  snack; </li><li>  comfortable shoes with non-slip soles; </li><li>  headdress (especially in hot and sunny weather); </li><li>  camera; </li><li>  first-aid kit; </li><li>  mosquito repellent; </li><li>  a flashlight, preferably a headlamp (if you plan to stay until the evening); </li><li>  a map; </li><li>  matches; </li><li>  hiking sticks (optional, but convenient). </li></ul><p>  Currently, the Mezmay village is developing in the direction of tourism.  To help travelers there is the Mezmay Information Center (MIC).  A new <span>asphalt road is</span> laid to Mezmay <span>,</span> which greatly facilitates the passage of vehicles.  In the settlement there are guest houses.  In addition to the Eagle Regiment, near the village there are such attractions as the Kurdzhip gorge, Sandikov and Palmovy falls, the cave and Isichenko waterfall. </p>
