And often complain about the weather.  And all because the climate of Hurghada, and especially Sharm el-Sheikh, is still not the same as in Cuba or Thailand.  In winter, strong winds can blow in Hurghada, lowering the air temperature to +15 C. Do you want comfortable weather for sunbathing and sea bathing?  Then you need to move south to the equator.  This has long been understood by Egyptian hoteliers who literally from scratch build resorts on the shores of the Red Sea.  One such place is Marsa Alam.  It is located almost three hundred kilometers south of Hurghada, on the same latitude as Edfu, which stands upstream of the Nile than the sultry Luxor.  Therefore, you can not worry about the hardships of winter weather in Marsa Alam.  In this article we will comprehensively consider the hotel Fantazia Resort Marsa-Alam 5 * - the leading hotel in the new resort. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The lack of its own airport somewhat impeded the development of Marsa Alam.  The warm Red Sea is, of course, good, but the bus route from Hurghada is not long - 271 km.  The problem was solved when the Marsa Alam airport was built at the beginning of the 2000s.  Own hub for a town with a population of eight thousand?  No, the airport was built specifically for foreign tourists.  But it is located 85 kilometers from the hotel Fantazia Resort Marsa Alam 5 *.  On a map of the Red Sea coast, this hotel is located twenty-four kilometers south of the resort of Marsa Alam.  The hotel positions itself as a place of calm and secluded relaxation.  For miles, there is nothing but the desert and the sea.  Many tourists record this fact in a positive.  No construction nearby.  There are no screams, music, car horns from the street.  Annoying sellers do not roam the beach.  In a word, the coast, untouched by civilization, is a real small oasis in the desert.  But the way from the airport (if your transfer package does not include a transfer) can be overcome only by taxi. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The specifics of Marsa Alam </h2><p>  The main feature of this resort is the Red Sea itself.  Experts say that the beauty of coral reefs and the diversity of their inhabitants, Marsa Alam is far superior to the popular Ras Muhammad on the Sinai Peninsula.  Therefore, the resort has recently become the new Mecca for divers.  Literally every hotel has its own scuba diving school.  And Marsa Alam is seventy kilometers of beaches untouched by civilization.  The virgin purity of white sand is guaranteed to you.  But what is not in Marsa Alam is nightclubs, discos and the usual shopping in Egypt.  People come here for another - overseas, pristine nature and silence.  Reviews say itâ€™s positive that all the hotels in this resort are brand new.  The rooms are equipped with modern standards for a comfortable stay.  Preference is not given to multi-storey buildings, but to a bungalow complex where guests can relax. </p>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The hotel Fantazia Resort Marsa Alam 5 * was built in 2008 and until 2011 was called "Shorez Fantasy Resort".  The hotel stands on the very shore of the Red Sea and has its own seven-meter-long sandy beach.  The climatic conditions here are such that the daily temperature of air and water, even in January, does not drop below +24 C. The hotel complex is a scattering of two- and three-story cottages.  Separate buildings are occupied by the reception and the main restaurant.  The territory of the complex resembles a marvelous Arabian garden.  Palm trees, exotic plants and flowers grow everywhere.  The hotel complex has three swimming pools and six restaurants.  Since the hotel is located in a secluded area (only south and a short distance from it is Sol and Mar Dolphin House 4), the administration is doing everything possible to entertain its guests.  The animation here is at a high level.  Excursions are constantly organized, and the hotel itself has tennis courts, a spa, gym and diving school. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Where live </h2><p>  The rooms for guests in the Fantazia Resort Marsa-Alam 5 * are divided into only two categories: standard and suite.  For large families, twin rooms with a shared door are provided.  The specificity of the guest rooms is such that each of them has a sea view.  All rooms have a large furnished balcony, and those on the ground floor have a terrace.  The suite consists of two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a living room.  But in the standard rooms there is a separate sitting area with a sofa, a minibar and a flat-screen TV.  Furniture and plumbing are brand new, and the rooms are decorated, according to reviews, very beautifully, in warm, rich colors.  Individually controlled air conditioning provides an in-room climate.  A spacious safe holds a laptop.  In the bathroom, in addition to daily replenished cosmetic accessories, there is a hairdryer.  Clean the rooms every day. </p>

    <h2>  How to eat </h2><p>  In the hotel Fantazia Resort Marsa Alam 5 * the all-inclusive system is practiced.  You can also pay half board, but tourists do not advise doing this: the hotel is in the middle of the desert, you canâ€™t buy food anywhere, and drinks (except breakfast) are paid.  For their guests, the hotel waiters set the main meal in the main restaurant "Fantasy".  Themed dinners are held there every day.  Reviews say that in a week you can make a fascinating gastronomic excursion into the cuisines of Italy, France, China.  The main restaurant also has an open terrace, where you can eat al fresco overlooking the pool.  For a fee, a romantic Ã  la carte dinner can be arranged.  For this, there are two restaurants: Italian cuisine "Valentina" and seafood - right on the beach.  Guests resting on the All Inclusive system can order local refreshments and alcoholic drinks free of charge in the hotel bars (in the lobby of the main building and the Gazebo cafe on the beach). </p><h2>  How to entertain </h2><p>  Taking into account the isolation of the Fantazia Resort Marsa Alam 5 * hotel, the administration does everything possible so that guests do not feel cut off from the world.  The hotel has two animation teams at once.  The first serves the main contingent of vacationers - Italians, and the second - all the rest.  The language of communication for young people is English.  But the second team has a girl from Ukraine who speaks Russian.  There is a diving school on the beach.  For younger guests, there is a shallow pool, a games room and a playground.  A spa is available for a fee.  But the fitness room and fitness equipment are in free access.  Equipment for some sports games, such as boccia, darts, beach volleyball, billiards, is available for free.  Will have to fork out for the services of a tennis court and horse riding. </p>

    <h2>  Where to sunbathe and bathe </h2><p>  The Fantasy Marsa Alam Hotel has its own 650-meter beach, lined with umbrellas and sunbeds with soft mattresses.  Towels are provided free of charge.  There is no need to occupy sunbeds in the early morning, since the main contingent of vacationers here is Italians.  A feature of the local beach is a narrow entry into the sea.  Corals are treated with reverence as a national treasure.  Therefore, only in one place the path for entering the sea is cleared.  You can go to sea from a long pier along the ladder - immediately to the depth.  Reviews say that you just need to get acquainted with the underwater world of coral reefs - if not with scuba gear, then at least with a mask and snorkel.  Little yellow fish are used to being fed and swimming close to people in shallow water.  There are three pools in the hotel.  In winter, one of them is heated.  There is an indoor pool and a spa. </p>

    <h2>  Where to go </h2><p>  Tourists should take advantage of the southern location of the hotel Fantazia Resort Marsa Alam 5 *.  Marsa Alam as a resort is not remarkable: this fishing village has recently been built up with hotels.  It is much more interesting to go to the Wadi Hammamat valley.  It was once the shortest route from Thebes to the Red Sea coast.  Who knows, maybe Moses led his people out of Egyptian slavery by it?  A one-day excursion to Luxor will not involve a long bus ride, because this city is much closer to Marsa Alam than to Hurghada.  And, of course, you should go on an excursion to the Abu Simbel temple complex.  Reviews are advised not to miss the presentation of "Light and Sound", which is organized in front of four colossi at the entrance.  The tourists were very impressed with the ride on ATVs to the Wadi Himal reserve, where gazelles live.  Many praise sea voyages to coral reefs. </p>

    <h2>  Fantazia Resort Marsa Alam 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Those who visited the hotel were mostly satisfied with the trip.  Most tourists choose the hotel "Fantasy Marsa Alam" for its privacy and excellent services on site.  Beautiful rooms with new furniture really liked the tourists.  Food in the restaurant is organized to please Italians, who make up the lion's share of vacationers.  Lasagna, all kinds of pastas, tiramisu and other goodies are served for meals.  Pools and landscaped grounds are beyond praise.  The staff is friendly, but, unfortunately, does not speak Russian. </p>
