    <h2>  Resort Location </h2><p>  <span>Issara Resort 3 *</span> hotel is located near the popular Patong Beach (no more than a 15-minute walk from it).  It is also worth noting the relatively convenient location of the hotel relative to the airport, the road from which will take no more than 40 minutes.  This is the central part of Patong, where all city and resort life is concentrated. </p><h2>  Resort Hotel Rooms </h2><p>  Hotel of category 3 * Issara Resort 3 * <span>(Phuket, Thailand)</span> has 76 guest apartments, which are divided into two main categories: </p><ul><li>  <em>Superior room</em> is a spacious apartment designed to accommodate two adult guests.  They are not allowed to accommodate an extra bed, and therefore, if children come with adults, they must be accommodated in existing beds in the room.  There is a small seating area where there is a pair of soft armchairs and a floor lamp. </li><li>  <em>Deluxe room</em> is the embodiment of elegance and luxury, as well as a high level of comfort.  It is worth noting that these rooms are two-room: that is, the bedroom and living room are separate.  Three guests can accommodate as much as possible here, as upholstered furniture can serve as a place for an additional guest. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  There are some drawbacks to the Issara Resort 3 * hotel.  Reviews of tourists highlight the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  when the deposit is returned to you, carefully look at the bill (hoping for the carelessness of tourists, you can slip a regular candy wrapper, which is nothing more than a souvenir product); </li><li>  in rooms old, full of holes and dirty towels - it is better to bring your own from home; </li><li>  the bathroom is in poor condition - everything is rusty, the plumbing is leaking, and the tiles are covered with mold in the Issara Resort 3 * hotel (photos of tourists confirm the neglect of the bathroom); </li><li>  cleaning the room is very superficial, and tips do not fix this situation (so it is better not to waste money in vain); </li><li>  the windows of some rooms practically abut against a neighboring hotel (and the point here is not only that the sun does not fall into the room, but also that someone is constantly watching you from the windows opposite); </li><li>  breakfasts are served very early, so if you went to bed late, then in the morning you can just skip this event (the menu is also very modest, and nobody will allow you to take food with you); </li><li>  there are very few sun loungers around the pool; </li><li>  before hot water flows from the shower, you need to lower it for several minutes and languish in anticipation; </li><li>  after you inserted a key card into a special connector, the ability to turn on electricity will appear no earlier than in 10 minutes; </li><li>  if you have booked an <span>apartment</span> in advance <span>, this</span> is not a guarantee that you will be accommodated in a reserved room, or that the hotel will generally have free places; </li><li>  if you wake up late, then around noon they will refuse to clean your room, reasoning that the staff has already left. </li></ul>
