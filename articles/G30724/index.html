    <h2>  Israel Attractions </h2><p>  It is not surprising that the Promised Land is one of the most popular and sought-after destinations for tourists.  Travelers from all countries come to Israel to get in touch with unique shrines, plunge into ancient history and relax on the shores of the Red or Dead Sea. </p><p>  The attractions of this land are unique.  In no other place is it possible to see so many sacred relics and places of worship.  Most of the <span>holy places of Israel are</span> concentrated in Jerusalem: this is the <span>Church of the Holy Sepulcher</span> and the Dome of the Rock Mosque, the Church of St. Mary Magdalene and, of course, the Wailing Wall - one of the main attractions of the Promised Land.  It is a sacred place located on the western slope of the Temple Mount - part of an ancient wall erected around the temple built by King Solomon.  The name "Wailing Wall" she received in the sixteenth century.  Today, Jews and tourists here pray or forgive sins, leaving in the crevices notes addressed to the Almighty. <br>  Among the sights of Israel, one cannot fail to mention those located in the sacred for all Christians Nazareth - the city in which Christ's childhood and youth passed, and where the miracle of the Good News occurred.  Above the cave of the same name rises a beautiful Catholic church in honor of the Annunciation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Interesting places for tourists </h2><p>  It is a mistake to think that in the land of Israel there are only places of worship and holy places.  In this amazing country, there are many interesting museums to visit.  The Promised Land is considered not only the birthplace of three religions, but also the cradle of civilizations.  Therefore, the historical value of this area is difficult to overestimate.  Among the places that are necessarily included in sightseeing tours for tourists are museums such as fine arts, Israel, the Holocaust Memorial Museum, Bible countries and others. </p><p>  The colorful colors of the city streets, the multinational hubbub and artifacts of all the major world religions are another reason that thousands of travelers are drawn to the hot, but surprisingly interesting Israel.  And the proximity of such natural monuments as the <span>Dead Sea</span> and the Judean Desert, beach resorts, etc., only increases the army of tourists. </p><h2>  Masada Fortress </h2><p>  Israel, being a tiny piece of land surrounded by seas, deserts, forests and mountains, today has become a modern country, plagued and built by many generations of Jews.  And if you list all the iconic places of this state, then one of them is worth a visit.  The top ten most popular tourist attractions include Masada Fortress in Israel.  Excursions are booked by every traveler. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Very often among Russians this word causes some bewilderment.  The reason is that the Masada fortress is associated with the Israeli intelligence service Mossad.  However, there is no connection between them.  The word "masada" is of Greek origin; in Hebrew it means "fortress."  This ancient legendary building is listed as a World Heritage Site.  It is located off the coast of the Dead Sea - only twenty kilometers away.  The ancient Masada fortress is located near the city of Arad, next to the Ein Gedi highway. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  It was built in the twenty-fifth year BC by Herod I the Great, whom history knows as a cruel villain who, out of fear of losing his throne, ordered to kill all the babies in Bethlehem.  So he tried to get rid of his main enemy - the newborn Christ.  However, Herod I the Great left another trace in history - as a construction king.  It was he who expanded the <span>Temple Mount,</span> reconstructed the Second Temple, and built an Amphitheater in the suburbs of Jerusalem, in which horse racing and gladiatorial battles were subsequently organized. </p><h2>  Construction goals </h2><p>  In honor of his dead brother, King Herod also erected a mausoleum with a tower.  He is also credited with the restructuring of Samaria and the port of Caesar, an amazing temple located on the island of Rhodes, as well as the founding of Herodion and Hesevon in today's territory of Jordan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Standing on top of an impregnable cliff, in a deserted desert territory, Masada fortress had several tasks.  Firstly, it was supposed to be a refuge where King Herod and his family could hide during the wars, and secondly, they kept gold and weapons here. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Masada Fortress rises 450 meters above the Dead Sea.  It stands on the site of the Hasmonean period, which, judging by the documents, is dated to the thirtieth years before our reckoning.  And today, tourists are shown here how skillfully arranged water supply and baths resembling Roman baths.  Masada fortress was mainly used to preserve weapons and food supplies here, but the king‚Äôs close associates knew that his inexhaustible reserves of gold were hidden here. </p><h2>  Inaccessibility </h2><p>  On all sides the building is surrounded by steep cliffs, and only from the side of the sea a narrow ‚Äúsnake‚Äù path led up to it, which exists today.  On the west side, the ancient Masada fortress is connected to the outside world along a path that was built on a mound laid by the Romans.  The route is about thirty minutes. </p><p>  Masada fortress is built on a cliff top, which is crowned by an almost flat plateau with dimensions of approximately 300 x 600 meters.  It was on this trapezoidal site that there was a synagogue, the royal palace itself, armory depots, auxiliary buildings, pits for collecting and subsequent storage of rainwater.  A powerful fortress wall surrounds the plateau perimeter.  Its total length is 1400 meters.  The height of the fortress wall was about four meters.  It has 37 towers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Judean Desert" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1317361.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Archaeological finds </h2><p>  And today, tourists can see the palace in the fortress, in which Tsar Herod hid with his family during endless wars, the synagogue in which he prayed, fragments of amazing mosaics.  Water reservoirs cut down in the rock massif, as well as hot and cold baths, amaze with their engineering thought.  But the most amazing find, judging by the opinions of archaeologists and historians, is the synagogue.  It has long been customary to believe that the Jews did not need it, since they had a Temple.  However, this finding surprised specialists.  The fact is that the Masada fortress was reconstructed at a time when the Second <span>Jerusalem Temple</span> still existed <span>,</span> which was restored by Herod himself.  Nevertheless, a synagogue existed in it.  I must say that a similar find was found among the ruins of the ancient fortress of Gamla.  It was this that proved that the question of the existence of a synagogue among the ancient Jews was not connected with the Temple. </p><h2>  Annals </h2><p>  In the seventieth year of our calendar, the Romans, having crushed the rebellion, were able to capture and destroy Jerusalem.  However, for the final celebration of the victory, they still had to seize the Masada fortress, in which the few surviving rebels managed to take refuge.  It would seem that the latter is no longer in danger.  After all, the Masada fortress, which was surrounded by steep cliffs and a high fortress wall, was still considered impregnable.  But against the rebels, who numbered about a thousand people, and along with children and women, stood an experienced and, most importantly, large army of the Romans.  Therefore, the besiegers managed to surround the fortress.  Having broken numerous military camps around it, the Romans began to build a huge embankment, which was to become the road to the fortress wall. </p>

    <p>  So, the Romans besieged the fortress, set up several military camps around it and began to build a giant embankment against the fortress wall.  It was intended not only to advance infantry, but also to transport throwing guns, as well as ram.  The fate of the fortress was a foregone conclusion.  The rebels had nowhere to wait for help.  The appearance of the Roman army inside the fortress, the destruction of its walls by ramming was expected in the coming hours.  But the proud Jews, not wanting humiliation and slavery, including for their children, took the most desperate step.  The defenders of the fortress, deciding not to leave any trophies to the Romans, burned down all the property in the fortress.  They left only food and water, thereby showing the legionnaires that they did not have a lack of provisions, nevertheless they made a choice in the direction of death, preferring to die free. </p><h2>  The most tragic page in history </h2><p>  After that, <span>lots</span> were <span>cast:</span> ten soldiers selected as a result killed all those who were hiding in the fortress at that time, both their close comrades and women and children, including their own.  Then they chose one who, having killed the other nine, committed suicide.  This tragic page in the annals of the famous ancient fortress was conveyed to our days by <span>Josephus,</span> writing about it in a book called The Jewish War.  He, relying on the stories of two women and several children who managed to hide in a cave and subsequently talk about what happened, truthfully conveyed everything that was said by the witnesses.  The reliability of his story was confirmed by archaeological finds - several tablets on which were written the names of those who participated in this deadly lot.  In addition, the ruins of the camps defeated by Roman legionnaires have survived to this day. </p>

    <h2>  Masada today </h2><p>  Today, you can climb to this attraction, which is included in almost any sightseeing tours in Israel, by the cable car built to it.  The cost of the trip is about twenty dollars.  Daredevils and lovers of overcoming obstacles can reach the fortress both along the "snake trail" from the Dead Sea, and along the earthen rampart built by the Romans during the famous siege.  However, most tourists still choose the cable car. </p><h2>  Tourist info </h2><p>  At the foot of the snake trail, parking is provided for cars.  There is also an information center where tourists can purchase tickets to enter the fortress, as well as to climb the funicular.  There is also a museum in which artifacts discovered during archaeological excavations are laid out.  In fine weather, the Masada fortress turns into a concert hall where music is played and cultural events are organized. </p>
