    <h2>  Useful information for guests </h2><p>  Any hotel has its own internal rules, and Orion is no exception.  Rhodes boasts a huge number of resort hotels, and in each of them the order of residence may vary slightly.  As for this institution, it will be useful for guests to know the following: </p><ul><li>  registration and check-in of newly arrived guests begins strictly after two in the afternoon, but after paying the amount indicated in the price list, you can use the early check-in service (this is possible only if there are free rooms); </li><li>  on the day of departure, you must return the keys to the room before noon (but if you do not want to expect your late flight at the airport, use the late check out option, which implies an hourly fee); </li><li>  children under the age of two years stay in rooms for free, and if necessary, they can be provided with a cot; </li><li>  hotel policy does not allow more than one extra bed; </li><li>  this resort hotel does not provide the possibility of staying with pets, and therefore, for violation of this rule, the administration has the right to refuse the guest to provide services; </li><li>  if you plan to arrive at the hotel without booking a room, notify the administration in advance of your arrival; </li><li>  upon registration and check-in, each newly arrived guest is required to pay a fixed amount of the deposit, which will be refunded upon eviction if you do not cause material damage to the hotel (this amount can be paid in cash or by credit card); </li><li>  the guest can be checked into the hotel only if a valid photo ID is provided; </li><li>  if a child under 7 years old does not need to provide an extra bed, then for his stay in the room there is no charge. </li></ul><h2>  Resort Rating Services </h2><p>  A good option for a summer vacation can be considered a resort complex Orion <span>Hotel Rhodes 3 *.</span>  <span>Rhodes is</span> visited by many tourists, and based on their ratings, you can make a certain impression about the services of a hotel.  So, if we talk about this institution, then the guests gave it the following ratings (out of 5 possible): </p><ul><li>  The hotel infrastructure has earned a rating of 4.3 points.  In general, guests are satisfied with everything, but some little things (for example, inconvenient parking) can ruin the impression. </li><li>  The hotel earned 3.7 points for the quality of service.  The staff is very polite and attentive, but the almost complete absence of animation affects the final assessment. </li><li>  The resort hotel has got a solid four.

Near the beach, shops, transport interchange and everything you need. </li></ul>

It is worth paying attention to the following comments: </p><ul><li>  meeting with the manager at the reception leaves the most pleasant impression; </li><li>  the staff does its job well, but is almost invisible; </li><li>  the prices in the hotel restaurants are not overpriced and practically do not differ from the cost of dishes in other similar establishments of the resort; </li><li>  the hotel is located very close to the sea, literally 5 minutes walking step - and you are on the beach; </li><li>  Convenient location relative to urban and tourist infrastructure; </li><li>  very spacious balconies adjoin the rooms, and therefore garden furniture, a dryer are freely placed here, and there is still room; </li><li>  pleasant design of the room (the situation is very similar to home); </li><li>  bath towels are changed daily; </li><li>  large clean pool; </li><li>  The rooms are equipped with new TVs; </li><li>  good and clean plumbing; </li><li>  there is a lot of greenery and decor on the territory - it is clear that it is carefully looked after; </li><li>  the staff is friendly and caring; </li><li>  I am glad that the room has a refrigerator; </li><li>  the lobby area is completely finished with natural wood, which provides a beautiful appearance and pleasant aroma; </li><li>  the hotel made a fairly fresh repair (albeit modest); </li><li>  in the lobby area there are wide window sills with mattresses for seating; </li><li>  delicious cocktails are served at the pool bar; </li><li>  if the guests do not like their number, then it is possible to change it without any additional charge. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there are a number of significant shortcomings and shortcomings in the work of such a resort institution as Orion Hotel Rhodes.  The reviews contain a number of negative comments, the most significant of which can be considered the following: </p><ul><li>  the beds are very uncomfortable - after sleeping on hard mattresses and flat pillows, the back hurts terribly; </li><li>  sometimes there are malfunctions with the air conditioner - instead of cold air it‚Äôs warm; </li><li>  breakfasts are very modest and monotonous (scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs and the like); </li><li>  the restaurant rarely serves fruit, which is very strange for Greece, where they grow in huge numbers (most likely, the bulk is exported); </li><li>  the kitchenette in the room is essentially useless, because it is not intended for the preparation of hot dishes; </li><li>  bed linen is completely covered with small holes (although it is worth paying tribute to its cleanliness); </li><li>  the air conditioning in the restaurant works very poorly, and therefore being there is extremely unpleasant; </li><li>  most rooms do not catch wireless Internet; </li><li>  air conditioning in the rooms is very noisy; </li><li>  the restaurant serves cold food (it seems that they do not even try to warm it); </li><li>  housekeeping leaves much to be desired (maximum that you can count on maids to dust); </li><li>  to get to the beach, you need to cross the roadway (the main disadvantage is that cars are in no hurry to give way to pedestrians); </li><li>  to eat anything for breakfast, you need to come to the dining room early in the morning; </li><li>  towels for the beach at the hotel do not give out, and therefore take with you if you do not want to spend money on them at the resort; </li><li>  loud music plays in the pool bar almost until morning, and therefore the guests whose windows open here are unlikely to be able to relax; </li><li>  sockets and switches require repair or complete replacement; </li><li>  in many rooms the keys are broken and simply rewound with electrical tape; </li><li>  even if you have booked a room in advance, upon arrival it may turn out that the hotel does not have free places; </li><li>  very dirty elevators (but given that there are not many floors in the buildings, you can simply not use them); </li><li>  in the bathroom there are many small ants (the problem is especially acute in the rooms on the ground floor); </li><li>  it is not clear why maids after cleaning spray the room with an air freshener, and therefore the rooms have to be ventilated for a long time; </li><li>  although a clothes dryer is provided on the balcony, clothes pegs are not provided; </li><li>  very lengthy registration procedure. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is the convenient location of the Orion Hotel Rhodes 3 * resort.  Faliraki is a small village, but this does not mean that travelers will have to be bored here.  There are many cafes, restaurants, night clubs and other entertainment venues.  In addition, in the immediate vicinity of the hotel there is a bus stop, so you can go for a walk in neighboring cities.  Perhaps the only drawback of the location of this hotel can be considered that on the way to the beach you need to cross the road with busy traffic.  Unfortunately, in Greece it is not customary to let pedestrians pass, and therefore it is necessary to wait a long time for the window between passing cars. </p><p>  The territory of the Orion Hotel Rhodes 3 *, although small, but there is a lot of space for relaxation and walks.  The garden, pool and other areas are very carefully looked after.  As for the building itself, it is also pretty enough, although the architecture is old-fashioned.  The interior of the lobby area is very pleasant and pleasing to the eye.  As for restaurants and bars, they need not only repair, but also the replacement of equipment, especially air conditioners, which absolutely can not cope with their functions.  The hotel is quite quiet, with the exception of the site near the pool.  If you like silence, check the location of your room in advance. </p><p>  The rooms of the Orion 3 * hotel (Rhodes), although modest, but quite comfortable.  There is a fairly fresh repair, although there are some drawbacks.  In general, going on vacation to this hotel, you should pre-configure yourself that in the budget "troika" you will not find five-star luxury.  thus, no disappointments will befall you.  It has everything you need to fully relax and restore strength between trips to the sea and trips to exciting excursions. </p>
