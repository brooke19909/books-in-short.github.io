    <p>  As part of the psychological and pedagogical disciplines, <strong>the vocational training methodology</strong> is one of the leading in the preparation <strong> </strong>  teachers <strong> </strong>  vocational training in various industries.  Distinctive features of the structure of this discipline are substantive and procedural components.  The content component includes didactic, diagnostic and conceptual components.  Process - the mental activity of trainees and trainers in the acquisition and assimilation of knowledge and skills, as well as the management of this process. </p><p>  Today, <strong>the vocational training methodology is</strong> developing in two main directions.  The first concerns the development of vocational training methods, the second - the relatively independent development of private methods used in the study of technical disciplines: technical mathematics, drawing, electrical engineering, etc. </p><p>  Possession of a method is a requirement for the professional activity of a teacher.  Methodological knowledge is associated with methods and techniques, as well as the personality and creative approach of the teacher himself.  The <strong>vocational training methodology</strong> considers the learning process a separate discipline in an educational institution as its object of cognition.  The subject of knowledge is pedagogical knowledge and design skills, the use of such teaching aids that help regulate the educational activities of the teacher and the cognitive activity of students in the development and acquisition of professional knowledge, as well as the ability to apply this knowledge in practice. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The objects of knowledge of technical sciences are technical systems and devices, but <strong>the vocational training methodology</strong> does not set as its task to study these systems and devices, to form methods for their research.  The object of her knowledge is the public educational and educational process itself by the means of the science that is being studied. </p>

    <p>  <strong>The main components of the vocational training process and their relationship</strong> </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>  It should be noted that the <strong>process of vocational</strong> <strong>training</strong> is systemic.  The essence of this type of training is the formation of knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary for subsequent professional activity. </p><p>  The components of the vocational training process include the content, goals, methods, means, forms and outcome of the training.  Together, they form an integrated learning system, the main factor of which is the learner's activity.  The backbone components are united by the attitude to the activity. </p><p>  Goals provide for solving problems of different classes and types, which students must learn, forms, methods and activities undertaken to solve them, the content, structure and forms of generalization of knowledge gained. </p><p>  An important component that is included in the <strong>process of</strong> <strong>vocational training</strong> is its content.  It provides subject to study topics and subjects that are included in the program or course of an educational institution. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  One of the components is the <strong>forms of vocational training</strong> .  They should be understood as the organization of the educational process, which is determined by goals and current tasks, the ways in which knowledge is transferred and acquired.  Forms should correspond to the content and complexity of the tasks put forward before the learning process, to contribute to their effectiveness. </p><p>  Theoretical and practical training are functional <strong>forms of vocational training</strong> .  Thanks to theoretical training, the process of knowledge formation takes place, practical training forms the ability to apply the acquired knowledge in future practical activities. </p><p>  Another component of the vocational training process is the training method, which provides for such a form of activity that is aimed at obtaining knowledge and developing abilities. </p><p>  Learning means are considered material and natural objects, as well as those that man has artificially created, and which are used as carriers of educational information and a tool to achieve the goals set in the educational process. </p><p>  Learning outcomes should be understood as an assessment of the skills of students acquired in the learning process. </p>
