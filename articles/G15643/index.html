The mysterious underwater world, blue lagoons with lush green palm trees, sun and sand - all these are the beaches of the Maldives.  The islands are a complete delight not only for romantic couples, but also for families with children. </p><h2>  What are the Maldives </h2><p>  The beaches of the Maldives are rightly considered the best in the world.  It is here that all admirers of beach and sea recreation seek to come.  Maldives is an island country located in the Indian Ocean.  The small Asian state consists of 1,196 atolls of volcanic origin.  The stunning beauty of the places cannot be expressed in words.  Blue lagoons, coral reefs, soft white sand, tropical vegetation - all this is the Maldives. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beaches maldives" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2132927.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The islands are a respectable resort.  You can relax on them throughout the year, because the weather here is beautiful, I any time of the year.  The main advantage of the beaches of the Maldives is their cleanliness and beauty.  The high season lasts from November to February. </p><h2>  Country advantages </h2><p>  The white sandy beaches of the Maldives are located on the coast of numerous coral atolls.  They are the main pride and attraction of the country.  Thanks to them, the <span>Republic of Maldives</span> gained such fame.  Every day, thousands of guests fly to the islands in the hope of enjoying a wonderful holiday.  The beautiful beaches of the Maldives are not in vain so loved by tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maldives beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2132936.jpg"></div>

Here you can simply enjoy the sun, palm trees, the sea and tropical fruits.  Tourists have the opportunity to relax in a peaceful environment, enjoying the natural beauty of the islands.  There are no extraneous noises in the Maldives; during your holidays you will be surrounded by stunning landscapes and the sound of waves. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions on the islands </h2><p>  The country is located in the monsoon subequatorial climate zone, and therefore there are only two seasons here: wet and dry.  No large temperature differences are observed during the year.  In January and February, the temperature does not drop below +17 degrees, in the remaining months it does not exceed +32 degrees.  Precipitation on the islands is not more than 2.5 thousand mm per year, and it rains, as a rule, at night or in the evening and is of short duration.  The temperature of the water all year round ranges from + 27-29 degrees.  The sea is usually calm and quiet, storms and waves are possible in December and June. </p><h2>  The best beaches of the Maldives </h2><p>  We can say with confidence that the entire coast of the islands is perfect for relaxation.  But tourists highlight the best and most beautiful beaches of the Maldives.  Among them are Naladhu, Banyan Tree, San and Nika.  All of them are distinguished by lush tropical vegetation and a variety of marine life. </p><p>  Some of the beaches of the Maldives have beautiful lagoons.  The best of them are on the atolls of Baa, Ari, Daalu, South Male, Faafu. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful beaches maldives" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2132937.jpg"></div>

The <span>resorts of the island</span> have all the conditions for doing water sports, fishing and visiting excursions.  On Baa, guests are offered a high level of service and an incredibly comfortable, relaxing holiday. </p><p>  You can go diving in the northern part of Daalu.  The Faadu Atoll has bars, spas, restaurants, pools, massage parlors, gyms and more.  But southern Male is also of interest for its marine reserves.  Surfers love to visit Kanduma Island from March to September, at which time the weather is ideal for surfing. </p><p>  In general, it is worth noting that the atolls have a variety of islands, among which you can find little explored and lost, as well as well-equipped for recreation.  As we have already mentioned, the Maldives includes 1192 islands, among which there are very small atolls, on which only one villa is located. </p><p>  As a rule, one island is built on each island.  Only in the Maldives you can live not only in rooms, but also in bungalows built directly on the water.  The houses are on stilts and are sometimes equipped with a glass floor so that you can admire stunningly beautiful fish without leaving the premises.  If you have chosen such a bungalow for yourself, then you should first look at the weather forecasts, since it is not very convenient to get to it during storms. </p><h2>  Vaadhu island </h2><p>  Vaadhu Beach in the Maldives can be called the most famous in the world.  The island of the same name is a real branch of the starry sky.  Glowing beach in the Maldives will give unique emotions.  With the advent of dark time, a million lights are lit on it.  The phenomenon is incredibly beautiful, it is more like magic.  In the waves rolling on the shore, lights wake up.  All the beaches of the island begin to glow.  From the point of view of science, this phenomenon is very common and is associated with chemical reactions that occur in simple organisms.  Such small creatures are called phytoplankton.  They do not make the entire Indian Ocean shine, but only the coastal zone, since the luminescence is associated with a mechanical effect on plankton, which glows to respond to irritation.  It is for this reason that at the time of rolling the waves, one can observe such beauty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="luminous beach in the maldives" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2132939.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This phenomenon can be seen not only in Vaadhu, but also on other beaches of the Maldives.  However, it is on Vaadhu that such a phenomenon manifests itself to the greatest extent.  Many tourists bathe in the "starry sky".  However, according to their reviews, it can be said that swimming with phytoplankton causes little discomfort.  But still the action is unusual and interesting. </p><p>  The neon glow causes a lot of enthusiasm for every tourist.  Phytoplankton stains blue at the edge of the sand and the water itself.  Wandering around the sea and splashing water at such a time is a real miracle. </p><h2>  Beach Features </h2><p>  The beautiful beaches of the Maldives have their own specific rules that should be followed: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maldives island beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2132941.jpg"></div>

    <ol><li>  On all islands, including the coast, it is forbidden to drink alcohol.  Also, you can‚Äôt bring such drinks to the country and even more so buy them in stores.  Drinking alcohol is very severely punished.  You can order a small amount of drinks for dinner only at the tourist restaurants.  There are also floating alcoholic bars that float on the sea, and you can only get to them by boat. </li><li>  On the islands it is strictly forbidden to swim naked.  On those atolls where the local population lives, wearing bikinis is even prohibited.  In the Maldives, you can only swim in the water dressed.  On large islands, usually one of the beaches stands out especially for tourists.  In such places, sunbathing in swimsuits is allowed. </li><li>  But on the island-resorts the situation is slightly different.  In most of them you can swim in swimsuits and there are no strict rules.  But in others it‚Äôs the opposite.  Family-run hotels may not allow bikinis. </li><li>  An interesting fact is that in those institutions that are located on the territory of reserves, you can only walk barefoot along the beach so as not to disturb the ecosystem.  In addition, it is worth knowing that pets are not allowed in the Maldives. </li></ol><h2>  Male </h2><p>  Male is the capital of the Republic of Maldives.  The city is on the list of the smallest capitals in the world.  The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMale is only two kilometers square.  And yet, in such a small town, a third of the country's population lives.  The Maldives is generally a very sparsely populated country.  If you decide to visit the capital, then it will amaze you greatly, since it is too different from other islands.  By the way, Male occupies almost the entire atoll. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best beaches maldives" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2132949.jpg"></div>

    <p>  After a tropical paradise, the city impresses with slopes and skyscrapers.  Not so long ago, in the south of the island, a recreation area was equipped for local people and tourists.  However, according to spa visitors, the beaches of Male (Maldives) cannot be compared with the coast of atolls. </p><h2>  What you need to know about local beaches? </h2><p>  If you want to spend a vacation on the beaches of the islands of the Maldives, then you should know some of the nuances: </p><ol><li>  Almost 80 percent of the land of the atolls is covered with sand, so you should take the appropriate shoes with you.  Shoes with high heels are unlikely to be useful to you, if not at an event in a luxurious and expensive hotel. </li><li>  Clothing on site can be normal, but when going on an excursion to the islands where there are locals, you need to dress in such a way that your knees and shoulders are covered. </li><li>  If you are an avid angler, then remember that you can‚Äôt fish on the beaches.  This is done only on organized fishing. </li><li>  When diving while swimming or diving, do not tear off or pick up corals from the bottom. </li><li>  In the Maldives, small coastal sharks live.  They are harmless to humans, but you should not get close to them.  But the ramps are quite dangerous for humans. </li></ol><h2>  Fulhadhu Beach </h2><p>  Fulhadhu is a beach located on the island of the same name.  This place can be called unique.  In the Maldives, there are usually islands inhabited by locals, or hotel atolls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maldives photo beaches" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2132950.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Fulhadhu - has a small area.  A part of the island is occupied by a village, and tourists rest on the remaining part.  At their disposal are several kilometers of whitened fine sand, tropical vegetation, clear water and a sand spit.  It is worth noting that there are very few holidaymakers here, so a relaxing holiday is guaranteed. </p><h2>  Finolhu Kanifushi </h2><p>  <span>This beach</span> is located in Baa Atoll.  There is a unique spit on the island, along which you can take long walks in the ocean, visiting three completely <span>uninhabited islands</span> with excellent beaches and a beautiful bottom without fragments of coral. </p><h2>  Amilla Fushi </h2><p>  Amila Fushi is a private island located in the Baa Atoll.  All its beaches are simply impeccable and quite diverse.  There are areas with palm trees, partly reminiscent of the Caribbean, and part of the coast is overgrown with shrubs.  Sunset at sea is gentle and comfortable, but immediately the coral bottom begins. </p><h2>  Riti-ra </h2><p>  Riti-Ra is an artificial island with the longest coastline in the Maldives.  All the beaches on its territory can be safely called ideal - a flat bottom without corals, white sand, palm trees.  Of the minuses of this place, only the absence of snorkeling can be distinguished, since there are no corals or sea inhabitants at the bottom. </p><h2>  Gili Lankanfushi </h2><p>  Gili Lankanfushi is an unusual <span>island in the Maldives.</span>  On its territory there is a hotel with two-story villas, which are made in the style of Thai prisons.  But such a design of the institution does not spoil the excellent beaches with palm groves and sand spit. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who have visited the <span>Maldives</span> at least once <span>(photos of the</span> beaches are given in the article) certainly call the islands a real paradise.  This place is simply unique.  It is as if created in order to enjoy the unhurried beauty of the ocean and the finest white sand in the shade of palm trees. </p><p>  The Maldives has an amazing underwater world.  For this reason, all tourists are engaged in diving here.  There are training centers on the islands even for those who previously had no idea about scuba diving.  Picturesque, beautiful coral reefs are worth a look.  No less interesting are underwater caves and sunken ships.  In local waters there are sharks and stingrays, they can also be seen.  If you are afraid of these marine life, then you should choose a secluded lagoon for diving.  Reef sharks reach a length of three meters, but it is still scary to face them closer.  But turtles are very cute creatures that are not at all afraid of humans.  In general, the local underwater world is incredibly rich and diverse.  According to tourists, relaxing in the Maldives, you should definitely dive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Maldives beaches" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2132951.jpg"></div>

    <p>  All beaches in the Maldives are beautiful and comfortable for relaxing.  Of course, some of them have coral fragments that, in general, do not interfere with relaxation.  The rest of the clean sand and rich vegetation guarantee a memorable vacation. </p>
