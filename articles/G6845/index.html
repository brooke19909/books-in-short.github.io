    <h2>  Where is the state of Qatar located? </h2><p>  On the northeastern outskirts of Arabia, on the small peninsula of the same name, is the small country of Qatar.  The state is the monarchy of the Islamic world - the emirate.  On the mainland border, it is adjacent to Saudi Arabia, and the rest of the state has access to the <span>Persian Gulf.</span>  The capital of Qatar is the city of Doha.  Where is the city located?  Qatar, like its capital, is located in the Middle East.  The terrain here is mostly deserted.  Naturally, such a geographical location directly affects many factors, such as climate, flora, fauna, etc. </p><h2>  Briefly about the state and its history </h2><p>  Despite the small area of ​​Qatar (11,500 sq. Km), the state is considered the richest <span>country in the world.</span>  Qatar receives such benefits thanks to the largest oil and gas reserves.  The Emirate is a member of the Organization of Gas and Oil Exporting Countries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The history of the emirate of Qatar begins in the period BC.  Records of people living in these territories were left by Herodotus and Pliny.  The peninsula becomes the state in the 7th century AD, when Islam comes to this territory.  Of course, this was influenced by where Qatar is located, and more precisely, neighboring states. </p><p>  The formation of Islam takes place under the influence of the neighboring <span>Arab caliphate.</span>  For a long time, Qatar was in the Ottoman Empire.  After its collapse, the state became a protectorate of Great Britain.  In 1971, the country gained independence and became officially called the state of Qatar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the state of qatar" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1227576.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <h2>  Relief </h2><p>  In order to properly characterize the relief of a given area, it is necessary to pay attention to where Qatar is located.  According to the physical and geographical characteristics, its entire territory is a desert.  Only in the north occasionally appears flat terrain and a few oases.  The southern region is slightly elevated and is represented by high sandy hills. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The climate of these places also directly depends on where Qatar is located.  It is tropical, continental type and very dry.  There is no winter in these territories, and in summer the temperature can rise to 50 ° C with a plus sign.  The average temperatures in January reach + 16 ° , in July - + 32 ° .  In this regard, the flora and fauna of the country are very scarce.  Mostly here live reptiles, rodents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the city of qatar" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1227562.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Inland waters </h2><p>  Of course, if you understand where Qatar is located, it immediately becomes clear that there are practically no rivers on the peninsula.  There are also waterways that dry up in the summer.  However, the inhabitants of the country learned how to obtain drinking water by desalination of sea water.  There are underground sources in the oases, but they are not enough throughout the country.  Thanks to them, only the northern regions are provided. </p><h2>  Governing body </h2><p>  According to the state system, Qatar is an <span>absolute monarchy.</span>  However, in the Islamic world, this word means something else.  The fact is that the emirate is a monarchy of the non-hereditary type.  That is, all power (executive, legislative, judicial and military) may not necessarily be inherited.  Due to the state system in Qatar, it is forbidden to create political parties or trade unions, as well as to conduct various kinds of political demonstrations.  There is an Advisory Council for consultation on diplomatic and public affairs in the country.  It includes 35 people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Qatar where is located" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1227563.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Administrative divisions and population </h2><p>  Qatar consists of 7 regions - municipalities.  The population is 1,900,000.  More than 90% of the population lives in the capital Doha and the suburbs of the capital.  According to the national composition, about 40% of the population are Arabs (this is understandable, given the location of Qatar), 18% are Pakistanis and Indians, 10% are Iranians and 14% are representatives of other nationalities.  About 80% of the population are Muslims, 9% profess Christianity.  Other religions are also common. </p><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  The state economy is mainly focused on oil and gas production.  85% of the extracted gas and oil products are exported, replenishing the country's budget by 70%. <br>  The country has developed many industries.  25% falls on the service sector, but agriculture in the country does not develop at all.  Only some northern regions, due to their close proximity to oases, have the opportunity to garden and grow date palms.  From livestock, nomadic tribes are engaged in the breeding of goats, sheep and camels. </p><p>  Qatar is also developing in the military sphere.  Officially, he has been cooperating with the United States in this regard since 1992. One of the major foreign centers of the United States Army is deployed here. </p><p>  The number of armed forces of Qatar is more than 12 thousand people.  Of these, 8.5 thousand - land forces, 2.1 thousand, marines - 1.8 thousand. </p><h2>  Terrorism </h2><p>  The Republic of Qatar (where the state is located, described above) has been repeatedly accused of interacting with various <span>terrorist organizations of the</span> planet.  The reason for this was the presence of the popular television channel Al Jazeera in Doha.  There were speeches and messages from famous terrorists, for example, Osama bin Laden. </p><h2>  Tourism </h2><p>  In terms of tourism, the state is also gradually developing.  People say that Qatar is the <span>United Arab Emirates</span> 10 years ago.  Holidays on the ocean goes well with shopping and diving in the Persian Gulf. </p>
