Russia not only gained access to the Baltic Sea and increased its territory, but also moved to the rank of superpower, with which the whole world should now reckon. </p><h2>  Foreign policy of Peter I, the causes of war </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Tsar Peter was enthroned at the age of ten, he took over the reins of power only in 1689.  By this time, as part of the Great Embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãthe young tsar had already managed to visit outside of Russia and feel the difference.  In the years 1695‚Äì1696, the more experienced reformer tsar decided to compete with the Ottoman Empire and started the Azov campaigns.  Some goals were achieved, the <span>Azov fortress</span> was captured <span>,</span> control over it secured the southern borders of the state, but Peter was not able to get a full-fledged exit to the Black Sea. </p>

    <p>  Reforming the army and creating a more modern fleet, Peter I decided to return his own lands and gain access to the Baltic Sea, thereby making Russia a sea power.  Ingria and Karelia, which were torn away by Sweden in the Time of Troubles, did not give rest to the autocrat-reformer.  There was one more circumstance - a very ‚Äúcold welcome‚Äù in Riga of the Russian delegation led by Peter.  Thus, the Northern War of 1700-1721, the main events of which turned the tide of world history, was for Russia not only a political decision, but also a matter of honor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The beginning of the confrontation </h2><p>  In 1699, the Northern Union was concluded between the Commonwealth, Denmark, Saxony and the Russian Empire.  The aim of the association was to weaken Sweden, one of the most influential powers at that time.  Each of the countries pursued its own interests and had territorial claims against the Swedes.  The Northern War of 1700‚Äì1721 is briefly divided into four main periods. </p>

    <p>  The period 1700‚Äì1706  - The first and not the most successful for Russia.  In 1700, the first battle on Narva took place, in which Russian troops were defeated.  Then the military initiative passed from the hands of the opponents.  In 1706, the Russians defeated the Swedish-Polish forces near Kalisz.  Peter I tried with all his might to leave the allies of Augustus II - King of the Commonwealth, but the <span>Swedish king</span> nevertheless split the coalition.  Russia was left face to face with the powerful flotilla and army of Charles XII. </p><h2>  Second stage of the Northern War </h2><p>  The Northern War of 1700-1721, the main events of which are related to the confrontation exclusively of the Swedish-Russian troops and flotillas, moved on to the next stage.  1707 -1709  can be described as the second stage of the Russian-Swedish war.  It was he who became a turning point.  Each of the belligerents increased its power: increased the size of the army and armaments.  Charles XII nurtured the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãseizing some Russian territories.  But in the end, he dreamed of completely dismembering Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Russian tsar, in turn, dreamed of the Baltic and the expansion of its territories.  Nevertheless, the international situation favored the enemy.  Great Britain did not provide assistance to Russia and in every way on the international scene provided political support to Sweden.  The Northern War of 1700-1721  became exhausting for both sides, but none of the monarchs agreed to a moderate cease-fire. </p>

    <p>  Approaching the borders of Russia, Swedish troops occupied territory beyond territory, planning to move to Smolensk.  In August 1708, the Swedes suffered several tactical defeats and decided to go to Ukraine, with the support of hetman <span>Ivan Mazepa.</span>  But the vast majority of Ukrainian peasants and ordinary Cossacks perceived the Swedes as invaders, giving them widespread resistance.  In June 1709, the <span>Battle of Poltava took place,</span> which became a turning point in the war.  Peter I and his military leaders defeated the Swedes.  Karl and Mazepa fled to Turkey, but refused to sign the surrender.  Thus, the Northern War of 1700-1721, the main events of which unfolded on the territory of Russia, Sweden was actually lost. </p><h2>  The third period of confrontation </h2><p>  From 1710-1718  the third stage of the confrontation between countries began.  Events of the Northern War of 1700-1721  of this period were no less saturated.  In 1710, the Northern Union resumed its existence.  And Sweden, in turn, managed to drag Turkey into the war.  In 1710, she declared war on Russia, thereby delaying a large army over herself and preventing Peter from delivering a decisive blow to the Swedes. </p>

    <p>  To a large extent, this stage can be called the period of diplomatic wars, since the main battles were fought on the sidelines.  Great Britain tried in every possible way to weaken Russia and prevent it from invading Europe.  And Russia, meanwhile, was establishing political contact with France.  In 1718, a peace agreement could be signed, but the sudden death of Charles XII during the siege of the fortress in Norway led to the change of monarch and for some time delayed the signing of the peace.  Thus, the Northern War of 1700‚Äì1721, briefly and conditionally divided into 4 stages, did not promise Sweden's victory as early as 1718, but Queen <span>Ulrika Eleanor</span> hoped for outside help. </p><h2>  The final stage of hostilities in the Northern War </h2><p>  The final stage of hostilities - 1718-1721.  - described by historians as a passive period.  Active hostilities for three years was not conducted.  The entry into the war of Great Britain on the side of Sweden gave the latter confidence in his possible victory.  In order to prevent Russia from gaining a foothold in the Baltic states, the international community was ready to drag out a military conflict.  But the British troops did not render any real help to the supporters, and the Russian flotilla defeated the Ezel and Grengam islands, and several Russian campaigns carried out several successful campaigns.  The result was the signing of the Nistadt Peace. </p><h2>  The results of the Northern War </h2><p>  The Northern War of 1700‚Äì1721, the main events of which led to the complete defeat of Sweden, became that ‚Äúwindow to Europe‚Äù, which not only brought Russia to a new international level, but also made it possible to compete on the world stage with developed European hegemons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Northern war 1700-1721 main events" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20759/683963.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Tsarist Russia became an empire.  Russia gained recognition in the international arena.  The annexation of the original Russian territories and access to the Baltic took place.  The result was the founding of new cities, including St. Petersburg.  The naval potential of the state has substantially increased.  Russia has become a member of the international market. </p>
