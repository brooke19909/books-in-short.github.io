Crimean sights in the palm of your hand</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Between Alushta and Yalta, the resort village of Gurzuf modestly sheltered.  From the east, west and north it is densely covered by mountains, which excludes the possibility of penetration of cold winds.  Favorable climatic and natural conditions just caressed Gurzuf.  Attractions of the resort can be seen at almost every step. </p><p>  Soul mates </p><p>  The twin rocks of Adalara are rightfully the hallmark of Gurzuf.  True, they are more likely not twins, but twins, since they differ slightly in shape and size.  These two rocks are located 300 meters from the coast, which allows tourists to swim to them on a catamaran or on a mattress.  It should also be noted that the sea here is always very clean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gurzuf attractions" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/218029.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  More than one ship sank in the cliff area, so diving enthusiasts can feel like a real treasure hunter and look for treasures. </p><p>  Exotic motives </p><p>  Few people know that in Gurzuf there is a magnificent landscape park.  On 12 hectares, 110 species of foreign and local shrubs and trees are represented, which are under constant care. </p><p>  It is so pleasant to admire graceful cypresses, magnificent cedars, fragrant magnolias, magnificent pine trees and many other types of plants.  By the way, this park is 10 years older than the more popular <span>Nikitsky Botanical Garden.</span>  Is it not enough to visit Gurzuf?  Attractions of the resort are concentrated here in the most successful way.  Therefore, you absolutely do not need to drive around in search of picturesque places throughout the <span>southern coast of Crimea.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Failed volcano </p><p>  Ayu-Dag has always been associated with many different legends.  It is believed that the Bear Mountain (another name for it) is a powerful energy and mystical center.  The mountain itself is a huge "bubble", which was formed as a result of the rise of molten magma from the bowels of the earth, which froze in the shape of a mountain. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, Bear Mountain is an incredible place thanks to which many tourists dream of getting to Gurzuf.  Sights (photo of Bear Mountain see below) of the village do not end at the mysterious Ayu-Dag, and we go further. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gurzuf sights photo" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/218031.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Manor Chekhov </p><p>  On the seashore is the Chekhov House-Museum.  The house itself has a rather modest appearance, you will not find any architectural excesses and elaborate interior.  In 1898, the famous writer acquired a small one-story cottage and spent a lot of time here with pleasure. </p><p>  The wonderful landscapes that open directly from his window prompted him to write such masterpieces as The Cherry Orchard and Three Sisters.  The status of the Belaya Dacha Museum has been received since 1921. </p><p>  The smell of past glory </p>

Sights of the Black Sea resort can actually be listed indefinitely.  Of course, it is impossible not to mention the famous Artek camp, which is located next to Gurzuf.  What pioneer did not dream of visiting Artek?  The emergence of the camp in this area is due to the fact that the healing air and fantastic views simply bewitched the creators of "Artek".

    <p>  True, after 1991 the prestige of the camp declined slightly.  But today, thousands of children from many countries have a rest in this international center all year round. </p><p>  In conclusion </p><p>  Probably not a single tourist who has been here at least once, just could not help but fall in love with Gurzuf.  Attractions near the village are also impressive.  You can visit the small, but no less beautiful reserve ‚ÄúCape Martyan‚Äù.  If the limited sizes do not impress you, then you can climb the highest pass in the Crimea under the name of Gurzuf saddle.  An incredible picture opens from here: at the same time you can see the sea, Ayu-Dag, Gurzuf and distant Simferopol. </p><p>  Do not believe?  Then go to Gurzuf, Crimea.  Sights of all Crimea are concentrated in this fabulous resort just for you! </p>
