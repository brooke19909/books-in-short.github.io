  <section class="page js-page"><h1>When is it more profitable to take a vacation for money, season and comfort?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every officially employed employee has the right to annual paid leave.  It is fixed and guaranteed by Russian labor legislation.  Solving the question of what time of the year it is better to go on vacation is individually for each.  If possible, this date is consistent with family, friends, or upcoming events. </p><p>  Fans of winter sports are best guided by January-February.  For those who like to relax and sunbathe at sea, the period from May to September is suitable.  On the example of this year, we will analyze how to choose the right date for a vacation and when it is more profitable to take a vacation in 2018.  Not only seasonality and comfort will be considered, but also the financial side of the issue. </p><h2>  How long is the vacation in 2018 and how is it calculated? </h2><p>  When it comes to the benefits of vacation, you should take into account only paid vacation.  All other types in which non-working hours are not paid will not be considered in this article. </p><p>  There are some rules that you need to know before making a vacation: </p><ol><li>  The provision of annual paid leave to employees is the responsibility of the employer. </li><li>  Time of rest must be used in the current year.  Unused days do not transfer to the next year. </li><li>  To calculate the duration of vacation in the Russian Federation, a calendar system of calculation is used. </li><li>  The sum of all vacation days, in addition to the usual weekdays, also includes weekends. </li><li>  The maximum limit of the amount of vacation is not limited.  This is due to the peculiarity of the employees' labor activity, as well as the possibility of summing up with additional days of rest. </li><li>  Take a vacation in advance - you can‚Äôt.  Vacation is accrued only for the period worked. </li><li>  For all the time spent on paid leave, the employer is obliged to keep the person with the current wage. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.vbhbj.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="when is it more profitable to take a vacation in 2018" class="if uuid-2569587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2569587.jpg"></div><p>  For most of the Russian population, leave lasts 28 days (4 weeks).  According to the Labor Code, leave can be divided into shares.  In this case, one condition must be met: one of the parts of the vacation must be at least 14 days, and the rest can be divided at the request of the employee.  Most employers are inclined towards the smallest fragmentation of leave, as this reduces the number of errors in the work of the personnel department, and also takes them much less time for paperwork.  It should be understood that the frequent departure of an employee on vacation puts the company at a disadvantage, any boss will try to avoid this.  Thus, the most frequent vacation model in our country is 2 periods of 2 weeks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are certain categories of citizens whose number of vacation days is increased.  Here are the specific numbers: </p><ol><li>  Ordinary worker - 28 days. </li><li>  Workers with disabilities - 30 days. </li><li>  An employee less than 18 years old is 31 days old. </li><li>  Teaching staff - 42 and 56 days. </li><li>  Workers associated with chemical or weapons production - 49 and 56 days. </li></ol><h2>  What should be considered when planning an annual vacation? </h2><p>  There are three options that can help you determine when it is more profitable to take a vacation.  It is worth taking them into account and try to choose the most successful date for at least one of them.  Predicting a vacation by several parameters at once is a much more difficult task. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sctelco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it profitable to take a vacation in May 2018" class="if uuid-2569590" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2569590.jpg"></div><p>  Excellent rest conditions: </p><ol><li>  Monetary gain. </li><li>  Benefit by the duration of the vacation (number of days). </li><li>  Holiday comfort. </li></ol><h2>  From a financial point of view </h2><p>  Most often, working citizens care about which month it is more profitable to take a vacation for money. </p><p>  The following points must be considered: </p><ol><li>  The amount of vacation pay.  With stable wages, the amount of cash payments for the vacation period does not change.  In the case of an increase in monetary allowances, it is worth waiting a few months for the average annual size to increase, this will allow you to get more vacation pay.  With a decrease in wages, you should rather go on vacation, without waiting for a decrease in average annual earnings. </li><li>  The salary that will be received for that part of the month that you have worked.  If there are more days in a month than on the vacation you take, the rest of the days will be worked out and a salary will be calculated on them.  Therefore, in order to receive as much money as possible for the current month, it is necessary to select the vacation time for the months with the most calendar days. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="expertbeacon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what month is more profitable to take a vacation" class="if uuid-2569589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2569589.jpg"></div><p>  In the Russian Federation in 2018, the number of calendar working days in a month varies depending on the holidays, as well as the number of days off that fall on this month.  This parameter must be taken into account when deciding when it is more profitable to take a vacation.  It is also necessary to take into account individual schedules that are set at a number of industries and public services. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For most workers, the most profitable months to go on vacation will be November and August, since they account for 23 business days. </p><h2>  Is it profitable to take a vacation in May? </h2><p>  To increase the duration of the vacation, you can select a date taking into account public holidays.  It is worth recalling that when such days coincide with vacation, it increases its duration.  On the contrary, the postponed days off do not increase the vacation period, therefore it is necessary to take leave before or after. </p><p>  The longest vacation will be if you leave it immediately after the New Year's weekend.  But at the same time, the amount of money earned for this month will decrease significantly due to the small number of days worked. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.glassdoor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it profitable to take a vacation in May" class="if uuid-2569586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2569586.jpg"></div><p>  The second month of the year, the most profitable for the duration of days, is May.  As a rule, May holidays in many companies and government agencies are considered non-working days.  And if, by agreement with the employer, you can arrange a vacation between public holidays, for example, from May 3 to 8 (11) 2018, you can extend your vacation.  But it is worthwhile to understand that weekends in this case will not be paid.  Therefore, the employee will lose part of the income.  For this reason, those who planned a vacation this year and wondered whether it is profitable to take a vacation in May 2018, abandoned this venture. </p><h2>  What season is the best time to relax? </h2><p>  In this case, the concept of comfort and convenience is determined personally by everyone.  For those who would like to spend a vacation period in the snowy mountains and go skiing, it is necessary to focus on the cold months of the year - from January to March. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.muirenhof.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why is it unprofitable to take a vacation" class="if uuid-2569591" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2569591.jpg"></div><p>  Those who were going to spend free time to improve their personal plot, the best time to go on vacation would be the period from May to October. </p><p>  If you have any specific events, you need to navigate based on their date of holding. </p><p>  Since most of Russia is not in the most favorable climatic conditions, for people living here, the question is: ‚ÄúWhen is it more profitable to take a vacation?‚Äù  obvious.  Most people prefer to take vacations between June and September.  This is due to the desire to spend this time in the more southern regions of the country or even abroad. </p><h2>  When and why is it unprofitable to take a vacation? </h2><p>  The most unfavorable time for rest paid by the employer from all points of view will be January and February.  This is due to the small number of working days in January and February.  Accordingly, there is very little to earn over these months.  In this case, the employee will have to rely only on vacation pay.  Also, do not forget that these are the coldest months on our territory, and they are suitable only for lovers of winter holidays.  But it is worth paying attention to the fact that due to such a low demand for tourist vacations during these months, many organizations give big discounts on tours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="viewscenes.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="winter vacation" class="if uuid-2569592" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/2569592.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The solution to the question: "When is it more profitable to take a vacation?"  remains individual for each.  Moreover, according to the schedule, not every year it turns out to relax in the summer.  Given all the nuances regarding the financial issue regarding earnings, cost of vouchers, length of vacation, seasonality, etc., the employee will be able to choose for himself the most favorable time for annual paid vacation. </p>
