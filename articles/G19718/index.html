    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  <span>Residential complex "Voskresensky" is currently commissioned, almost all apartments are sold and occupied.</span>  <span>If we turn to the reviews of the first settlers, we can conclude that the project was a success.</span>  <span>Today it is one of the best in the city.</span>  <span>All work was carried out efficiently and on time, residents do not experience communication problems.</span>  <span>We were also pleased with the small utility bills - all thanks in large part to the use of advanced technologies and construction innovations.</span> </p><p>  <span>Due to high-quality modern double-glazed windows that are installed in each apartment, including on the balcony, it was possible to protect residents from noise coming from the street, as well as provide excellent thermal insulation properties.</span>  <span>Of course, sometimes you can find negative reviews, but most of them are entirely related to dishonest work of public utilities, which poorly clean the streets after snowfall, and do not provide proper cleanliness in the local area.</span>  <span>At the moment, the problem is solved, which means that all residents can enjoy the comfort and coziness that the complex gives.</span> </p><h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  <span>Many believe that apartments in a new building are unacceptable luxury.</span>  <span>But contrary to prevailing stereotypes, we want to prove that buying a property in a new house is an excellent investment, even if the apartment was purchased on a mortgage basis.</span>  <span>Only in new buildings are the wishes of modern residents taken into account, only new buildings are surrounded by all necessary infrastructure, which guarantees the necessary level of comfort and safety.</span> </p>
