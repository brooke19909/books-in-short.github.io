Regardless of the color, style, furniture of the room.  They delight the guests' eyes, and for many women it is a pleasure to take care of your favorite flower.  But what to do when you like the look, but you completely forget about taking care of the plant.  I would like to have such beauty in the house, but there is no desire to water, loosen the earth, transplant, and get rid of pests.  Moreover, you have to wait until a sprout, bud and only then a flower appears from the seed.  Salvation for you - beads crocuses!  This material is very versatile.  It has a variety of colors, shapes, sizes.  With it you can create anything you want, and it will not be difficult for even a beginner. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beaded crocuses" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41737/1215900.jpg" width="288"></div></h2><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  It‚Äôs worth starting with determining the color scheme of the future plant.  Usually it is lilac and all its shades, but there are also yellow, white, bluish.  So, in order for you to get crocuses from beads, a master class on weaving which you will see below, you need to take: </p><ul><li>  The wire.  It has the ability to bend in any direction, so the finished product will look very natural.  For some technicians, a fishing line is suitable. </li><li>  Lilac beads.  You can take several shades to make a smooth transition, it looks very impressive. </li><li>  Orange beads are needed to create stamens. </li><li>  Green beads - for leaves. </li><li>  Green threads, the shade should be as close as possible to the color of the leaves. </li><li>  The remaining materials will be needed for jewelry, this will be written below. </li></ul><p>  That's all that is useful for work, do not forget to take a good mood with you too - and then you will definitely create beautiful flowers from beads.  Crocuses will look harmoniously in the apartment or will be a great gift. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Simple weaving </h2><p>  If you are just starting to learn the basics of beadwork, then try to create simple, less natural crocuses from beads.  Weaving patterns are more understandable, and even a child can use them.  Working process: </p><ol><li>  Cut a fishing line about 25 centimeters long.  We need not only to weave a petal, but also leave a distance to connect it into one flower. </li><li>  Take the lilac beads.  Place one bead in the center of the wire. </li><li>  Pass one end into it from the opposite side of the hole to securely fasten the bead in place. </li><li>  Now put two beads on one of the edges, and insert the other into the holes of the beads, heading towards the first end. </li><li>  Tighten and put on three more beads, repeat the same as in the last step. </li><li>  Increase the rows of one bead until you reach five. </li><li>  Start reducing the row to one. </li></ol><p>  It turned out a rhombus.  These figures need to do three more pieces. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocuses from beads master class" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41737/1215907.jpg" width="525"></div></h2><h2>  Leaves and Stamens </h2><p>  The middle is even easier.  Take a wire ten centimeters long.  String about seven beads on it and twist the loop.  That‚Äôs all, just two steps.  Now take the petals and twist together with the core for the remaining ends. </p>

    <p>  For leaves we take 30 centimeters of wire, at the end we make a loop so that nothing slips, and string about 50 beads.  Move three of them to the side.  Without touching the extreme, push the wire into the other two beads.  Now the edge is pointed.  String another 50 beads onto the second edge.  Twist both ends.  Attach the remaining wire to the flower.  There should be two leaves in total. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thread the stalk so that it is green, not metal.  Spread the finished product, slightly bend the edges.  It turned out pretty pretty crocuses from beads, a master class just for beginners. </p><p>  But a more beautiful product requires more effort.  Now we need to master another technique. </p><h2>  Circular weaving </h2><p>  Having mastered this technique, you will get flowers as close as possible to real ones.  More materials will be needed, but worth it.  Crocuses from beads are woven according to the following principle: </p><ol><li>  Cut the wire length of 50 centimeters. </li><li>  After ten centimeters from the edge, twist the wire five centimeters.  One edge is short, and the second is long, and he will do all the work. </li><li>  A short wire is the base, we string five beads on it, and bend the working wire to the side at a right angle. </li><li>  Now we put 6 beads on a long one.  We form an arc, fixing the working wire to the main one from above. </li><li>  String another 6 beads and fix the bottom of the base. </li><li>  As you can see, it turned out two semicircles, separated by a straight line. </li><li>  Make four more pairs of arcs in the same way. </li><li>  Make sure that roundness is maintained.  The advantage of the wire is its flexibility, so you can easily tweak the shape. </li><li>  When done, twist both ends at the bottom. </li></ol>

    <p>  All you need to do three such small petals.  But to create a whole flower you need to weave three large petals.  To do this, take a wire length of 70 centimeters, back off the edge 15, and twist to 7. String eight beads on the base, and always ten on the working wire.  You should get five pairs of arcs. </p><h2>  Details </h2><p>  The details are stamens with leaves.  This is made in almost the same way as in the first method: </p><ol><li>  String eight beads onto a fifteen-centimeter wire. </li><li>  Center them and twist the rest so that there are four beads on each side. </li><li>  It turned out one loop, and for a flower you need three. </li><li>  Mask the wire with green threads. </li><li>  Twist the parts together. </li><li>  Create two leaves according to the same principle as in the first case. </li></ol><p>  It will be difficult for someone to weave crocuses.  The bead pattern is light, but not everyone can figure it out, but leaves and stamens are a simple task for everyone. </p><p>  Now connect all the elements together.  In the center is a stamen, around it there are first small and then large petals, then leaves.  Twist everything and wrap it with green thread. </p><h2>  Completion </h2><p>  Make some flowers.  Crocuses from beads will be an excellent bouquet for home decoration or in addition to a gift.  They can be wrapped with beautiful paper, put in a pot or vase.  The store sells small figures of butterflies and ladybugs, which will complement the whole image, sitting on the leaves. </p>
