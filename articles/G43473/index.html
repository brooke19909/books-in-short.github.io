It is not surprising - because with the help of modern web technologies you can conclude quite profitable deals and save time.  At the same time, many potential buyers are afraid to get caught by scammers and therefore are increasingly interested in <span>what the cash on delivery is</span> and whether it makes sense to choose this <span>payment method.</span>  They say that it is quite safe and very profitable for both the customer and the merchant.  Is it really?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is cash on delivery" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/253752.jpg" width="246"></div>

    <p>  <strong>What is cash on delivery?</strong> </p><p>  The essence of this method is that the sender instructs the postal communication object to recover a certain amount after delivery from the addressee (recipient) and forward it to the address indicated in the corresponding form.  Moreover, both a state-owned communications company and any commercial organization, such as New Mail, can act as a courier.  <span>Cash on delivery</span> is used, as a rule, for parcels and parcels with an assessment of the investment, i.e. valuable.  Probably, many have already had the question: ‚ÄúIs it possible to send letters using it‚Äù?  The answer is possible, but only if they are of declared value.  Therefore, if the weight of the item does not exceed one hundred grams, it can be sent with a valuable letter and thus save some on delivery services.  Speaking about what is cash on delivery, it should be noted that the amount of the evaluation of the parcel can in no way be less than its value.  All necessary information is indicated on a special form for mail transfer, and for parcels there are sometimes double forms on which you need to indicate both the data for the parcel and for the transfer of funds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Many buyers who managed to test what the cash on delivery is in practice have already managed to make sure that this method of delivery is very convenient and reliable for acquiring expensive items from new sellers who have not yet had time to recommend themselves.  After all, you can be sure that the money will not be lost and the goods will definitely come.  At the same time, despite all the obvious advantages, it cannot be said that this method of sending will always be the best for both parties.  The disadvantage for the buyer is that the cost of receipt inevitably increases, since tariffs for valuable mail items are greater than for simple ones.  In addition, you still have to pay a commission for sending money to the seller.  All this can so increase the total cost of the goods received that it will become equal to the price in a regular store.  Again, if you decide to place an order by cash on delivery, do not forget to check the purchase directly at the post office.  It may well be a rogue who fills the inside of the parcel with various debris, which you will find only when you come home.  Therefore, you should always remember that the name "cash on delivery" does not mean absolute confidence that the purchase will go smoothly.  However, the given example is rather a rare exception than a frequent occurrence.  As for the seller, for him this option of delivery is only an additional way to attract more potential buyers and earn trust.  Unlike an advance payment, the term for receiving funds may increase up to 14 days.  And besides, there is always the possibility that the buyer suddenly changes his mind and does not take his order.  In this case, the shipped goods can only be returned in a month, and you will have to put up with the cost of shipping. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cash on delivery order" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/253734.jpg" width="600"></div>  <strong>Conclusion</strong> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Thus, cash on delivery justifies itself if the order has great value for the buyer, and the seller is little known and still cannot boast of a large number of positive reviews.  That is, when guarantees are needed.  Otherwise, if the purchase from such a seller is not the first time or the price of the goods is not too high, it will probably be better to choose an advance payment. </p>
