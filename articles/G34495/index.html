    <p>  Kalutara is located near the capital of Sri Lanka (42 kilometers).  The airport is also nearby, from which the resort can be reached by train, taxi, car or bus. </p><p>  The region is known for its coarse sand beaches.  The resort is even called the "golden coast".  But entering the sea is a fairly steep slope, so swimming during a storm is not recommended.  All beaches of the coast are surrounded by lush tropical vegetation, which creates the illusion of inaccessibility, remoteness from the hustle and bustle of cities. </p><h2>  What is worth doing while relaxing in Kalutara </h2><p>  Tourists vacationing at the resort in February should definitely visit the Navam Perahera parade (annual), which is magnificent and grand in the city.  On this day, on the back of the largest elephant, sacred relics are taken out of the temple, and thousands of local residents have the opportunity to bow to them.  And at night the city dresses up in the bright lights of illuminations. </p><p>  No less interesting for tourists will be a walk along the beautiful Kalu Ganga River.  On a water trip depart from the island of hermits. </p><p>  As souvenirs for relatives on the island you can buy anchor sauce with spices and exotic fruits, curry, red masala sauce. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tangerine beach hotel 4 sri lanka kalutara" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1592026.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Vacationers like to visit the temple of Dagoba Kalutara Vihara, near which the Bo tree grows.  Fruits and flowers are presented to him as a spiritual sacrifice in order to gain enlightenment or to fulfill the most cherished desire.  Also in Kulatar you should see a very beautiful waterfall, which can be reached in half an hour by tuk-tuk. </p><h2>  Entertainment and attractions of the resort </h2><p>  The ruins of an ancient fort and an old Dutch canal are still preserved in Kulatar.  Walking around the city, you can see houses built in the colonial style.  Tourists should definitely visit the Gangatilaka Vihara Stupa, which is the most striking historical place.  It is so huge that it is visible even at the entrance to the city.  Inside the building is hollow, which is a fairly large architectural rarity. </p><p>  In the vicinity of the city is the oldest Buddhist temple in Sri Lanka - Dagoba Kalutara Vihara.  The most expensive part of the decoration of the temple are 74 murals, which depict scenes from the last earthly life of the Buddha himself, as well as his 550 previous lives.  And the sacred tree Bo near the temple gained such a high status, since it was under it that the Buddha gained enlightenment.  The temple is valid to this day, its vaults are daily announced by the singing of the monks during the performance of the next religious ritual. </p><p>  In addition, other temples operate in the city.  Thousands of pilgrims visit the temple of Asokarama daily.  In this sacred place, disadvantaged city dwellers always find help.  In the religious world, this place is considered a well-known charitable organization.  Tourists are extremely interested to see the Pyrite Buddhist ceremony here, which is one of the most wonderful acts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tangerine beach hotel 4 sri lanka photo" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1592037.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is also a Christian church in Kalutara that organizes festive processions of Sri Lankan Christians on holidays. </p><h2>  Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 * (Sri Lanka): reviews </h2><p>  This place is loved by Russian tourists.  Speaking about the hotel, I want to refer to the reviews of vacationers who visited the Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 * (Sri Lanka).  Photos shown by tour operators do not always reflect the reality.  Therefore, let's discuss in more detail the impressions of tourists about the rest in the hotel, which will help us to form a more real picture. </p><p>  The first thing that vacationers pay close attention to when choosing a vacation destination is the ratings formed on the websites according to the reviews of tourists.  Such information can be seen on the same "Booking".  What is the rating of guests who visited Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 *?  The rating of the complex is 7.4 (‚ÄúGood‚Äù).  And this means that most of the guests were satisfied with the rest in the hotel. </p><p>  What impression does the Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 * make?  The reviews of all guests are filled with admiration for the vast territory.  The fact is that next to the hotel is a five-star complex.  Both of them belong to the same network.  And therefore, their territory is almost a single whole.  Tourists can use the infrastructure of both hotels.  It's nice that the whole area is cleaned daily and looks very well-groomed.  Cute little chipmunks calmly run along it, herons and monitor lizards walk.  The living creatures do not interfere with the tourist at all, but rather decorate the hotel.  What can the hotel offer Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 *?  Reviews of tourists indicate the presence on the hotel territory of beautiful ponds, fountains, green lawns, palm trees, flowering plants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel tangerine beach hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1592045.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the ground floor in the lobby there are beautiful waterfalls and fountains, as well as the reception service.  The hotel is decorated in a national local style.  The hotel is guarded.  Local or just strangers cannot penetrate into it, therefore everything is normal with security. </p><h2>  Room Reviews </h2><p>  What rooms does the Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 * provide?  Guest reviews regarding the apartments are contradictory.  The rooms are spacious and equipped with everything you need.  There are even dishes, tea sets (they are replenished daily), and in the evenings they bring a plate for the fumigator (mosquito repellent).  Each room has a fan and air conditioning, a large balcony.  The ground floor apartments have their own street access with their own tables and chairs. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to room service, which offers the hotel Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 * (Sri Lanka).  Service, according to guests, is not at the best level.  This is especially true for room cleaning, which men do here.  They perform it daily, but not very high quality, they often don‚Äôt wipe the dust at all, they simply sweep away the dirt, replenish the soap and gel, and change towels.  Experienced tourists are advised to leave a dollar in the room, this greatly improves the quality of cleaning.  According to holidaymakers, hotel rooms need redecorating. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel tangerine beach hotel 4 quality of service" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1592040.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The complex does not have a clear cleaning schedule, it can be done at any time, which is not very convenient, since the cleaners can visit the apartments at the most inopportune time. </p><p>  In general, the rooms are acceptable, but need more careful attention from the staff. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  As a rule, tourists buy tours with breakfast included.  It is served as a buffet.  Regarding nutrition, guest reviews are highly controversial.  According to vacationers, breakfast is not varied.  A standard set of products is served daily. </p><p>  But at the same time, the food ordered in the restaurant from the menu is very tasty.  Tourists visiting the island for the first time need to understand that local dishes are prepared with many spices, almost all of them contain curry.  Near the hotel there are many cafes where you can always eat. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel ... </h2><p>  How do guests like the Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 * in Sri Lanka?  Reviews of tourists, as well as the general impression of the complex, are twofold.  On the one hand, sandy beaches and the sea, exotic nature, the hotel grounds and many other advantages of the hotel cannot but impress.  On the other hand, there are minor flaws that spoil the overall picture.  If you do not consider yourself a spoiled holidaymaker, then you can visit the Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 *.  The quality of service at the hotel is quite acceptable.  All the main comments of tourists relate to cleanliness throughout the hotel.  Guests can enjoy the on-site spa. Massages are also available.  Pools fit very well into the overall picture, one of them has a bar, and around it there is an excellent relaxation area with sunbeds and umbrellas.  Towels are provided free of charge near the pool, but they are not allowed to take them to the beach. </p><p>  The whole territory is very beautiful, you can walk endlessly on it, enjoying nature.  There are no crowds at the hotel, this is due to the presence of a decent space that allows travelers to disperse. </p><p>  The coast deserves special attention.  As we have already mentioned, the complex is located fifty meters from the sea.  A wide beach strip is covered with large golden sand, iridescent in the sun.  According to tourists, the complex does not have its own beach.  Vacationers can use the public.  There are no deck chairs or umbrellas on the coast, but there are rescue towers with attendants.  Local shores have a fairly steep entry into the sea, so increased attention is required in the water.  In addition, it is not recommended to swim in the storm due to strong currents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel tangerine beach hotel 4 rating" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1592076.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tourists relaxing in the hotel recommend visiting excursions and interesting places on the island.  However, taking tours at the hotel from representatives of tour operators is not worth it.  On the beach you will always find a lot of local guides who will offer you interesting trips at more affordable prices.  In addition, you can arrange an individual excursion, then for the whole day you will have time to see all the most interesting and learn a lot about Sri Lanka. </p><p>  A lot of souvenirs are always sold near the hotel. If you bargain, you can buy them at a normal price.  A supermarket and a market for fruits and vegetables are nearby, and can be reached by transport. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  The hotel we are considering can be attributed to a good budget option for relaxing on an exotic island.  If you are going to enjoy the sea and warmth, you may well stay at Tangerine Beach Hotel 4 *.  But spoiled tourists, accustomed to comfort, should find another option.  The complex is very beautiful from the outside, and inside it is decorated with dignity.  But still there are flaws in the service at the reception, in the restaurant, when cleaning the rooms.  In addition, guests note that linen and towels at the hotel have long been in need of replacement.  The complex has a number of advantages, which slightly fade against the background of some disadvantages.  But overall the hotel makes a very good impression, you can have a good beach vacation here. </p>
