    <p>  Italy is adorned with magnificent cathedrals, wide squares and wonderful parks. Modena is no exception.  One of the most famous sights of the city is the Duomo Cathedral.  It was built from stones left on the ruins of buildings of the Roman Empire.  Interestingly, the initiators of the construction were the townspeople.  Due to errors in construction calculations, the old church could collapse at any time, as a result of which it was decided to build a new cathedral in its place.  In 1106, construction work was completed.  After that, the cathedral opened its doors to parishioners.  The Duomo impresses with its magnificent decor and sculptural compositions; its facade is decorated with a series of bas-reliefs that tell the biblical story of the creation of man.  The author of this work is the famous Wiligelmo.  The cathedral is also known for the fact that Saint Geminianus is buried in its walls, which the city residents consider the patron saint of Modena.  The bell tower of the Duomo has the name Garlandina.  From the height of its tower, a beautiful panorama of the city opens, the height of the bell tower is 86 meters.  Inside you can see the frescoes of the fifteenth century and a copy of the epic "The Stolen Bucket" by Alessandro Tassoni, a monument to which is installed on Piazza Torre. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="modena attractions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/1053175.jpg" width="333"></div></h2><h2>  Other temples </h2><p>  All the churches and temples of Modena are worthy of attention.
