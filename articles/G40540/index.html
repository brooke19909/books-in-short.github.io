Most Russian tourists are accustomed to rest in Turkey only in the five and four hotels.  But the "C grade" is quite good, offering high-level service.  One of such inexpensive, but quite decent hotels is Club Seatime 3 stars.  Here they are deliciously fed, wonderfully entertained, and offer many interesting and useful leisure options.  But first things first. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Seatime 3" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/975856.jpg" width="538"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The 3-star Club Seatime Hotel is 2 km from the small Turkish village of Konakli, across the road from the sea.  It is 17 km from Alanya, and from the airport in Antalya, where almost all international planes arrive, including flights from Russia - 95 km, or about 1.5 hours by transfer.  Comfortable buses provide travel agencies that provide trips to this hotel.  You have to spend so much time on such a short distance, because tourists are brought to the hotels closest to the airport along the road.  There is an excellent wide road near the hotel, minibuses stop at which you can get to Alanya and the nearest villages.  Having crossed this road (on a safe crossing), vacationers get to the sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Seatime 3 reviews" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/975850.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Very beautiful design of the territory of the Club Seatime 3 * hotel.  The photo shows how this hotel looks in the evening.  It‚Äôs even hard to believe that the area it occupies is only 11 thousand square meters.  This was enough for the designers to harmoniously place here 3 sleeping buildings, three swimming pools, a bar, a playground, a parking lot, a gift shop and other Turkish goods, a stage where evening shows are held.  The whole territory is surrounded by greenery and flowers.  Particularly aesthetic appearance is created by neat tiled paths along which energy lamps stand and are dotted with bushes of ever-blooming rhododendrons and roses.  The main entrance to the hotel is made in the form of a castle tower, which immediately sets up something fabulous and pleasant. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Hotel Club Seatime 3 stars meets its guests in a cozy lobby, where comfortable lounge chairs are installed, the lobby is open.  The hotel reception is open around the clock.  Here you can take things to the locker room, order a taxi, an excursion, call a doctor, rent a car, put valuables in the safe for saving, order the services of a professional photographer, hand things in the laundry, and solve all pressing issues with the hotel manager Mustafa.  Hotel Club Sea Time (Club Seatime) 3 stars began its work in 1998.  17 years is not such a long experience, but in 2011 there was a reconstruction.  The hotel infrastructure includes a housing stock, swimming pools, two restaurants, a poolside bar, a beach bar, a private beach, a sauna, a Turkish bath, a shop, sports fields - volleyball on the beach, a tennis court on site, a five-a-side football field and a playground for playing basketball. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Club Sea Time Club Seatime 3" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/975857.jpg" width="551"></div>
