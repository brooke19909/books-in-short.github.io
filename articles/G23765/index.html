    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  More recently, breathalyzers could only be seen in the hands of state traffic inspectors or medical professionals.  Today, more and more motorists want to purchase them for independent use at home.  This device will allow you to control <span>the alcohol content in the blood</span> and reliably find out whether it is possible to drive. </p><p>  Breathalyzer is an accurate device that can determine the concentration of alcohol in human blood.  To perform the analysis, you only need to properly exhale a certain amount of air into the device. </p><p>  After a quick analysis, the result can be seen on the display.  The unit in which alcohol intoxication is determined is called ppm.  One ppm shows that one liter of blood contains one gram of ethyl alcohol.  That is, if the device shows 0.3 ppm, then in one liter of blood contains 0.3 grams of alcohol. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first devices capable of assessing intoxication of a person appeared in the 30s of the twentieth century in the United States.  They could not show exactly how much alcohol is in the blood, but they determined fairly reliably whether the test person drank or not. </p><p>  The quantitative content of <span>alcohol in the blood is</span> also of great importance.  Devices that can determine the degree of intoxication appeared in 1953.  Over time, their accuracy increased, and medical workers had the opportunity to very quickly check a suspicious driver or employee for sobriety. </p>

    <h2>  What is the difference between different types of breathalyzers </h2><p>  To make an analysis for alcohol, you just need to exhale air into the device through a special tube - the mouthpiece.  Mouthpieces for breathalyzers can be either disposable or reusable.  There are models without mouthpieces, but their accuracy is slightly lower. </p><p>  The exhalation should be long, about 5-6 seconds.  This is necessary so that the volume of exhaled air is enough for analysis.  When the appliance is ready, it will sound a click or beep.  After that, the tester will quickly process the received material and display the measurement result on the screen. </p><p>  The device consists of several parts.  Actually, this is the analyzer itself with a sensor, a mouthpiece and a display.  The measurement accuracy depends primarily on the type of analyzer.  They can be of several types: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Semi-proximal sensors are sensors in which alcohol vapors are burned. </li><li>  Electrochemicals are able to determine the concentration of ethyl alcohol in the blood with the help of a special reagent, which enters into a chemical reaction with ethanol. </li><li>  Photometrics can absorb alcohol vapors by infrared radiation. </li></ul>

    <p>  Devices with semiconductor sensors are inexpensive, but they can have an error of up to 20%.  Verification of breathalyzers of this type should be carried out more often.  In addition, the analyzer will have to be changed every three months. </p><p>  More expensive and reliable are electrochemical devices.  In this case, you do not have to constantly change the sensor, but it needs to be periodically configured.  The error during the change will not exceed 10%, which is a good result for home use. </p><p>  The most durable and accurate are devices with a photometric sensor.  However, the cost of such breathalyzers is high.  Most often, sensors of this type are used in professional devices. </p>

    <h2>  Features for choosing a breathalyzer </h2><p>  Those who drink alcohol may need to measure blood alcohol levels.  This is necessary to make sure that the driver is sober and can drive.  To determine which device is best for you, you need to think about a few points in advance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Price </h2><p>  First decide how much you are willing to spend on a breathalyzer.  The price of the device depends on the type of sensor, brand awareness and quality of components.  The more expensive the device will be, the more accurately it will show the result.  If exact numbers are required from him, and is to be used often, then preference should be given to a well-known brand product.  How much can a breathalyzer cost?  The price of high-quality devices starts at 2,000 rubles.  Cheaper devices costing 500-1000 rubles do not differ in measurement accuracy and durability. </p><h2>  Frequency of use </h2><p>  When choosing a breathalyzer, you need to consider how often it will be used.  Agree that buying the most expensive device does not make sense if it will be used once or twice a month.  But if the device is used often, and even by several people, then the breathalyzer should be professional. </p>

    <h2>  Accuracy and certification </h2><p>  Car fleets, medical facilities and other organizations that need to determine sobriety buy exclusively certified devices.  After the due time, breathalyzers should be checked in certified laboratories.  The error of professional devices is negligible and amounts to only 0.1%. </p><p>  For breathalyzers for personal use, certification is not required.  Therefore, the error when measured by a non-professional breathalyzer can reach significant values: from 10 to 20%.  Therefore, a simple device for home use can only be approximately estimated whether a person is sober. </p><p>  Vapors of alcohol are kept in the breath for a long time, so the device will be able to accurately determine whether a person drank in the near future and whether he was able to completely sober up after yesterday's holiday. </p>

    <h2>  Service cost </h2><p>  Any breathalyzer needs maintenance.  For example, for some models you need to buy replaceable mouthpieces for breathalyzers.  In addition, the device may fail.  You should be aware that not all testers can be repaired.  Devices related to the low price range, after a breakdown, you just have to throw it away. </p><p>  It is best to choose models in which you can replace the most important part (analyzer) with your own hands or with the help of a wizard.  Also, before buying, you need to clarify whether it is possible to get spare parts for the selected model. </p><h2>  Instrument Parameters </h2><p>  What parameters should I look for when choosing breathalyzers?  The top of the best devices is based on the analysis of several parameters: </p><ul><li>  Accuracy is one of the most important indicators. </li><li>  <span>Measurement</span> stability <span>.</span>  <span>The accuracy of the</span> readings should not be reduced even after a large number of measurements. </li><li>  Reliability.  The device must not fail and break quickly. </li><li>  Convenience of use.  It is necessary to think over where and how the device will be used.  For business trips and long trips, a compact device is suitable. </li><li>  Availability of spare parts and consumables. </li></ul><p>  To navigate a huge selection of devices, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with brief reviews of the best breathalyzers of different price categories. </p>
