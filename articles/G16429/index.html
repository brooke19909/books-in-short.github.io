    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  It has already been said that the Dessole Cataract Resort Hotel (Sharm El Sheikh) is part of a larger complex.  We can say that it is on the “second line”, but tourists pass to the beach through the territory of Lavinia, the services of which they can also use.  Therefore, many vacationers consider this a big plus - in fact, buying a ticket to one hotel, they can actually spend time in both.  The hotel itself is small, but very comfortable.  Its territory is a beautiful garden surrounding a huge pool.  It is divided into separate corners and terraces.  In the middle of the garden are two-story cottages. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there and what is nearby </h2><p>  To get to the Dessol Cataract Resort (Sharm El Sheikh), you need to fly to the international airport on the <span>Sinai Peninsula,</span> which is fifteen kilometers from the hotel.  But since the security of this hub has been a big question lately, tourists can arrive in Cairo, and then get to Sharm with local airlines, or <span>Eilat (Israel).</span>  Many Egyptian hotels already arrange transfers from the airport of a neighboring country.  Moreover, in this case you do not have to buy a visa - you can use the Sinai Ounli stamp.  The hotel is surrounded by numerous shopping, entertainment centers and Naama Bay clubs.  Those who chose the “Desolé Cataract” for their vacation do not have time to get bored, they don’t even need animation.  Probably, there is no more music than rattles on Naama Bay anywhere else on the Sinai Peninsula.  True, you need to go there only in the evening.  Rare cafes work during the day, but with the onset of darkness, real life begins.  And it boils until four in the morning. </p>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Hotel guests go to the sea through the neighboring hotel - Lavinia.  They can use its beach.  In order to get there, you need to walk about two hundred meters through a beautiful park.  The trip to the beach itself takes five minutes at a relaxed pace.  It has everything for relaxing on the sea - sunbeds with mattresses, deck chairs, <span>parasols.</span>  The entry into the water is sandy, shallow on the right and deeper on the left.  You can go to the beaches of neighboring hotels.  Very clean, decent bar.  Excellent coastline, sand shiny, shallow.  Right by the water you can order a massage, various masks, body wraps - just like in Tunisia.  There are rental masks, diving courses.  Many boats and boats are nearby the pier.  And guests receive beach towels right in the room, and they are changed along with the rest of the laundry.  A lot of fish and corals, so swimming with a mask is a pleasure.  The water is so clear that marine animals can be seen at a depth of fifteen meters.  After all, this is Sharm el Sheikh.  The Dessole Cataract Resort Hotel has a very large freshwater pool.  In addition to it, there is also an artificial reservoir for children.  Both pools close at sunset.  In general, the heat in Egypt, as tourists say, is much better tolerated than in Turkey, and the breeze from the sea allows you to spend almost the whole day on the beach. </p><h2>  Prices and Shopping </h2><p>  The average cost of a ticket to this hotel is from 5 to 10 thousand rubles per day per room, depending on the type of accommodation, season and tour operator.  A visa costs $ 25, but if you do not travel outside the Sinai Peninsula, you can save on it.  Naama Bay has rather high prices, as in any tourist area.  One way out is to bargain skillfully.  Well, if you don’t want to bother with this, then tourists are advised to go to the Zhenina City shopping center, to the Peak and Kerry supermarket or to Carrefour.  There are fixed prices, they are much lower.  Here you can buy water, cigarettes, fruits.  Just keep in mind that only <span>Egyptian pounds</span> are accepted here <span>.</span>  Nearby is a souvenir market.  Smoking a hookah costs from one dollar, but with good tobacco and service it will cost 5-7 dollars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sharm El Sheikh Dessole Cataract Resort" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1038672.jpg" width="600"></div>

Many people like a trip on a bathyscaphe or on a glass bottom boat, when you can watch corals and fish without diving.  Excursions to Tiran Island and to the Ras Mohammed Nature Reserve are also popular.  Experienced tourists are advised to start exploring Sharm with a sightseeing trip.  Then, on your own minibus, you can get to the Old Town and the market in 20 minutes.  With children, you definitely need to go to the Hollywood Sharm entertainment center, where there is a special amusement park, Jurassic Park with moving dinosaurs, and the largest and most beautiful singing fountains.  And here there is a scene where from time to time the stars of the world stage.  ATVs and motorcycle safaris are preferred by young people.  And if you are not afraid of distant travels and difficulties and are interested in the history of Christianity and Judaism, welcome to Mount Moses and to the monastery of St. Catherine. </p><h2>  Impressions of the Dessole Cataract Resort Hotel (Sharm El Sheikh) </h2><p>  Tophotels gave the hotel a rather high rating - more than 4.5 points.  Indeed, tourists who leave reviews about the hotel, talk about their wonderful vacation and assure that they will certainly return.  There is an excellent well-trained staff, professional chefs, delicious and varied food (every day they offer to try some new dish).  Nice cleaning.  Great animation.  Awesome location.  The hotel is mainly designed for young people, for those who come to sunbathe, swim, hang out at parties and go on excursions.

It will face the courtyard.  Children also like the hotel, and they want to return to the Dessole Cataract Resort Hotel (Sharm El Sheikh), photos and reviews about which their parents post on all travel sites and social networks. </p>
