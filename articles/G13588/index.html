    <p>  This can happen even in the Primasol El Mehdi Hotel Mahdia 4 * hotel (Mahdia).  Most travelers consider it rather prosperous in this regard.  Judging by their reviews, many of its guests didn‚Äôt even hide their phones, laptops and money when they left the room.  And everything always remained in place.  But a couple of negative reviews about this hotel in terms of theft are still there.  Therefore, future hotel guests should be safe and try never to tempt the hotel staff. </p>
