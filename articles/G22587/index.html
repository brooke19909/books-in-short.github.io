Absolutely everyone was doing paper folding, not even realizing what origami was doing.  Competitions for range were held.  From paper create a variety of crafts of aircraft with which you can play.  You can make them both by folding a sheet of paper, and cut them according to templates. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider several options for making an airplane out of paper with our own hands in different ways.  With them, the child will be able to play for a long time, some can be launched independently on a flight. </p><p>  It is best to take medium-weight paper for work, so the plane will be strong, and it will be easy to bend the sheet for crafts.  If you went to the country, and the child wanted to play pilots, then you can even use a newspaper or magazine sheet.  For crafts for the holiday of February 23, you can make a dad a plane from colored double-sided paper for the printer as a gift to your father and then colorize it by adding small details. </p><h2>  Origami airplane </h2><p>  The easiest way to make a paper airplane with your own hands is to fold a rectangular A4 sheet.  You can try first on a simple notebook paper.  First, the sheet is folded in half vertically. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper airplane" class="if uuid-2535760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2535760.jpg"></div><p>  Then the corners are bent at right angles to the central bend, and this must be done twice.  The sharp nose of the plane hides inside, and the made craftsmanship folds in half along the fold line.  The wings before the training flight need to be spread, and you can launch the liner into the air. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Supersonic aircraft </h2><p>  Next, consider another version of the paper airplane.  With his own hands, even a younger schoolboy can do it.  This model has an elongated nose, so it looks like a supersonic modern aircraft.  The diagram below provides step-by-step instructions for making such a paper craft.  To make it easier to figure it out, the figure is made of colored paper.  This makes it easier to understand where the bend is. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dcri.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Origami airplane" class="if uuid-2535720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2535720.jpg"></div><p>  For work, a rectangular sheet of paper with a density of 80 g / m <sup>2</sup> is taken.  First, the bend is performed in a central vertical line.  Then, as in the previous craft, the corners are bent into the middle twice.  Then the sharp nose of the aircraft leans down to the very bottom. </p><p>  The resulting part of the workpiece resembles a trapezoid in shape, the upper corners of which are bent inward, but not to the end.  A triangle should appear in the center of the aircraft, which leans down to form an even line with previously bent paper (Figure 5). </p><p>  The long nose is returned to its previous position, and the aircraft itself folds in half in the center and additional folds are made on the body on the left and right by 1-1.5 cm. A small strip is also bent on the wings above.  At the end of the manufacture <span>of a paper airplane</span> with your own hands, it is advisable to carefully level it with your fingers again, then it will fly better.  You can try to start the craft in the room and on the street in the wind, then it will fly much further.  You can make several copies of different colors and run them in turn, determining the winner. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Good flying plane </h2><p>  You can make a liner out of paper with your own hands, which will perfectly cross the entire room from one wall to the opposite.  The rectangle is traditionally bent in half, but the bend is already horizontal.  Having determined the middle of the vertical line with a ruler or by eye, the lower corner is bent inward by a couple of centimeters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fast flying airplane" class="if uuid-2535984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2535984.jpg"></div><p>  Then the wings are unbent along a diagonal line that extends 2 cm from the bottom edge. The corners that will protrude beyond the bottom of the plane must first be aligned with the edge of the craft with your finger and then wrapped inside. </p><p>  It remains to make two folds of the body at the same distance from the center line.  Ensure that all folds are smoothed carefully over a paper-assembled airplane.  According to the scheme with your own hands, you can create a beautiful craft as a gift to a friend or dad for a holiday.  If the work is done correctly, it will show excellent results in competitions for the flight range. </p><h2>  Voluminous craft </h2><p>  For the game, the child can make a plane out of dense material.  To make it voluminous, it is most convenient to use a cardboard sleeve from toilet paper.  You will need a sharp knife, corrugated paper, push pin.  The sleeve acts as an aircraft body.  The wings and the transverse parts of the tail are cut out of thick paper in the form of rectangles with rounded edges.  The details differ in size, for the tail the element is made much smaller. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinkstripeysocks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Volumetric aircraft" class="if uuid-2535744" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2535744.jpg"></div><p>  They are simply inserted into the slots cut in the sleeve.  The tail is cut out by a rounded right-angled triangle and is also inserted tightly into the slot on the sleeve from above.  How to make a plane out of paper with your own hands?  All that remains is to draw the rotor blades and cut out the complex parts with scissors along the contours.  So that you can attach the screw in front of the aircraft, the inside of the sleeve is covered with a circle that can be glued with tape or thin strips of paper.  At the end, a screw is attached to this part on the pushpin, and from the inside it bends sideways. </p><h2>  Plane plane </h2><p>  Do it yourself do-it-yourself paper airplane using a template.  It‚Äôs enough to be able to draw a little.  You can use the craft option below.  Consists of a template of 3 elements.  This is a body that can be cut out of dark-colored double-sided paper.  Then draw a pair of wings, which subsequently need to be cut in half and glued on both sides of the middle of the hull. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hellowonderful.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make an airplane according to a pattern?" class="if uuid-2535738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2535738.jpg"></div><p>  In the same way, the details are cut out to the rear of the aircraft, glued to them next to the tail of the liner.  Everything, <span>with your own hands an airplane made of paper</span> , you can start the game. </p><h2>  Cutting pattern </h2><p>  Passenger aircraft can be assembled from thick paper by collecting all the prepared parts in the recesses and cracks in the body. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krioul.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Airplane template" class="if uuid-2535743" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2535743.jpg"></div><p>  After all the patterns are drawn, as in the figure above, they are cut with scissors.  Before putting all the parts together, you can first color them, draw portholes, write the name of the liner, make strips or a beautiful symbol of the manufacturer. </p><p>  Now you know several ways <span>to make a paper airplane</span> with your own hands.  Try to make your favorite model at home with your child. </p>
