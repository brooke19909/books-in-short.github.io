The building, built in the national style, successfully fits into the surrounding landscape.  The hotel is only 10 years old.

And this fact already speaks of how high the level of service is. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Medina Solaria Thalasso 5 * has all the standard and additional amenities.

    <h2>  What else do tourists say? </h2><p>  The reviews left about the Hotel Medina Solaria Thalasso 5 * (Tunisia) can often be useful.  Some travelers like to give advice for the future to those who are just about to go here.  Attention note the successful location of the hotel.  In the immediate vicinity there are many different shops and shopping centers.  If you exit the main entrance and turn left, you can see their diversity.  A little further is the water park and amusement park. </p><p>  Another recommendation: you should prepare for the fact that there are large lines at the airport.  And all the local money is better spent to him, because in duty free they do not accept.  There are, of course, shops prior to passport control, but there are poor choices and inflated prices. </p><p>  If you draw conclusions, we can confidently say that Medina Solaria Thalasso 5 * (Yasmine) is ideal for people who want a budget and good rest in Tunisia.  Especially the hotel is recommended to lovers of delicious and varied food, as well as to connoisseurs of attractions.  A hotel is rarely empty during high season.
