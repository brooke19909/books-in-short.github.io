Check iPhone Activation by IMEI</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When ordering a new IPhone smartphone from abroad or buying from hand, the future owner often doubts the authenticity of the phone.  After all, the market for such gadgets is teeming with counterparts and fakes, which are cheaper, but have nothing to do with a real smartphone.  Check IMEI IPhone and carefully examine its appearance - the first thing to do so as not to run into a cheap and low-quality thing.  However, it is not always possible to quickly carry out the verification procedure when purchasing, and not everyone knows how to conduct it. </p><h2>  How to identify a fake in appearance </h2>

Also, the complexity is the new <span>IPhone models that</span> are only on sale, and the domestic consumer is not always aware of the appearance details.

    <p>  In most cases, you can notice some discrepancy in appearance.  First of all, look carefully at the configuration and the device itself: <br>  • The original IPhone does not have a retractable antenna, stylus or slot for a memory card. <br>  • The back panel of this Apple device cannot be removed, you cannot see the battery, much less place a SIM card under it (as in standard phones). <br>  • This gadget only works with one SIM card and specially cropped. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In appearance, you can independently distinguish a gross fake from a high-quality original thing.  On a real IPhone on the case, you can find an inscription that makes many think that the device is not the original: “Designed by Apple in California.  Assembled in China. ”  In America, they are only developing the functionality and appearance of the device, and the entire assembly is carried out at factories in China, therefore, despite this inscription, you will get a high-quality device. </p><h2>  How to distinguish from the original IPhone in internal functions </h2>

Look carefully at the menu.  Since the Russian language is one of the most difficult, and manufacturers of analogs of expensive phones clearly save on translation, sometimes delusional errors can be seen in menu items and application names.
