    <h2>  Tablets today </h2><p>  To begin with, before, the navigator was understood as a separate electronic gadget responsible for tracking the location and providing information on the further route of movement.  Given this functionality, it is not surprising that navigators are most often used by drivers to know how to shorten the path, where traffic jams have now formed, how to get to the right destination, and more.  Other functions, except as described above, they did not perform. </p><p>  Today the situation has changed.  Any smartphone or tablet controlled by the operating system can perform this task no less efficiently.  Most importantly, you do not need to look for a tablet with a navigator separately, since any gadget is equipped with the latter by default.  It turns out that you can only find for yourself the optimal (in cost and technical parameters) tablet computer in order to use the delights of navigation without any special restrictions.  Given the widest range of such devices in stores, this can be done very easily today. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Navigation Tools </h2><p>  The question is how a simple smartphone or tablet can replace a specialized navigator.  After all, he does not have any special means for this.  We answer: a tablet with a navigator is just a mobile device that is equipped with a GPS module and software that allows you to ‚Äúsynchronize‚Äù the readings of the first with the data of maps of the area.  Thus, on a pre-installed <span>Google</span> Map <span>tablet, the</span> user sees the ‚Äúpoint‚Äù (himself) in real time.  For a more accurate verification, you only need to connect the mobile Internet (for this purpose, to work away from civilization, we need a tablet navigator with a SIM card).  And that‚Äôs all - you have in your hands a complete tool for determining the location and for moving along the route you need. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet with navigator Price" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1127644.jpg" width="600"></div>

In the event that you have a tablet with a navigator, things are easier.  Just download the application you need (from a directory like Google Play or the AppStore), after which your device will have more features: new maps, convenient position tracking tools, and more.  The list of various software solutions that facilitate interaction with the device is quite wide.  Their advantage is that among them there are a lot of free solutions, unlike maps for navigators. </p><h2>  We find the best solution </h2><p>  Since almost all modern tablets have GPS, it‚Äôs not difficult to find the best option (the best value for money for this gadget).  Just think about what functions (in addition to navigation) you need.  Or do you want to work with such a computer as a full-fledged mobile device (and want this electronic assistant to be equipped with a powerful processor, high-quality camera, battery with additional capacity, and so on?).  Combining all these characteristics, we get a truly suitable option. </p>

    <p>  In this article we will focus on the ‚Äúminimum‚Äù.  Our tablet should be a navigator on the road and, in addition, it should be an inexpensive tablet navigator (after all, why, one wonders, pay more). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Inexpensive tablets </h2><p>  Of course, speaking about the available devices, first of all, various Chinese gadgets come to mind.  This may be a Haier Hit 3G computer (with 4 GB of memory, a 7-inch display and a 2-core processor) worth 3 thousand rubles.  By purchasing such a device complete with a starter pack of any of the operators (with the connected mobile Internet function), you will get a ready-made navigator. </p><p>  Another example is the Digma Optima tablet.  The screen here has the same dimensions as the model described above, but the cost reaches 4,590 rubles due to the increased up to 8 GB of memory and a quad-core processor.  Of course, in practice, such a device will work more ‚Äúsmartly‚Äù and stably. </p>

    <p>  If you want something even more functional, we bring to your attention Lenovo Tab 2 A7-20.  This device will cost 7500 rubles, but complete with it, in addition to navigation capabilities, a higher-quality screen and a processor exceeding the level of performance will be provided. </p><p>  For those who would like to see the route more accurately, there is an option to order the Digma Plane 10.7 computer, which is the same in cost, but slightly worse in performance.  He can also become a full-fledged assistant on the road, but with a screen measuring 10.1 inches, it will be even more convenient in everyday work.  Remember that this is just another tablet with GPS. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúSpecialized‚Äù devices </h2><p>  However, there are gadgets on the market that are positioned as computers for navigation.  Thus, if you purposefully search for a tablet with a navigator for a car, you will very quickly find Explay products.  These are low-cost devices that are simply equipped with a software package for orienting themselves on the ground and making routes.  In particular, we are talking about a special application ‚ÄúNavitel Navigator‚Äù.  It is designed specifically for motorists, since it takes into account details such as road interchanges, information about certain features of the route.  This means that working with them is no less convenient than using Google Maps or Yandex.Maps.  But in the case of the latter, you can also get up-to-date traffic information.  On the other hand, what prevents you from installing the Navitel package on a simple tablet by purchasing this application on Google Play? </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The advice of motorists who discuss how to buy a tablet with a navigator (the price, however, is not always relevant in such forums, so we won‚Äôt mention it), it is best to have a separate gadget that is constantly present in your car.  If you want to ‚Äúshare‚Äù your smartphone, you will have to constantly open the cards after you start moving, and if you have a second device, everything will be configured ‚Äúby default‚Äù.  However, there is another nuance. </p><p>  Many people write that one tablet navigator with a SIM card can serve you as a personal assistant not only in cars, but also in everyday life.  Why buy a bunch of equipment, which then only takes up space?  From the point of view of this position, of course, it is best to have one device that is universal for all tasks. </p><p>  Therefore, perhaps, it is impossible to clearly state what to do in this situation.  In some cases, a tablet with a navigator, the price of which is minimal, will be more convenient than your smartphone, which will need to be constantly configured, and in some cases, the opposite.  Therefore, you yourself must decide how it will be most convenient for you. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  And you can buy any tablet with a navigator for a car, since the vast majority of them are equipped with special GPS modules.  Therefore, the need for a separate navigator disappears. </p><p>  Separately, after buying such a device, we recommend viewing applications from Google Play.  They have different interfaces, capabilities and functions, so you will still need to figure out how to use the tablet as a navigator.  Believe me, there‚Äôs nothing complicated about this, especially if you are already using an Android device. </p>
