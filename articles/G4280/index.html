    <p>  You can climb to the fortress with elevators with entrances, equipped opposite the resort beach of Postiguet.  You can climb the elevator for a certain small fee, but lovers of especially thrills can take a walk uphill along a rather long staircase with bridges. </p><h2>  Ancient history of the castle </h2><p>  Once upon a time, in the third century BC.  e.  Greeks built defensive impregnable fortifications.  A very good location for the bastions was strategically chosen.  Thanks to this position of the fortress, it was convenient to observe the entrances to the city and hold power over a large territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fortress Santa Barbara (Spain)" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1384123.jpg" width="600"></div>

Its history is full of numerous events. </p><p>  One of the most heroic historical moments is the year 1296.  At that time, the commandant of the fortress named Nicholas Paris, who protected her from the enemy army of King Jaime II, fighting to the last, immortalized his name.  With one hand, stained with the blood of enemies, he held a sword, and with his other hand held tightly the key to the fortress.  According to legend, the enemies could get it only by cutting off the hand of the commandant-hero only after his death.  And now, at the highest point of the castle, an inscription is carved on the feat of Nicholas Paris. </p><h2>  About the destruction and reconstruction of the castle </h2><p>  During the long time of its existence, the Santa Barbara fortress changed its owners several times and, accordingly, was reconstructed.  In January 1844, during the uprising led by Colonel Pantaleon Bonet, the castle was occupied by them, but, in connection with the betrayal of one of his subordinates, Bonnet himself fell into a trap.  And in the end, the castle was captured by the people of Espartero.  All rebels were executed directly in the walls.  In place of their execution today stands the Memorial dedicated to the Martyrs of Liberty, which is dedicated to the fallen comrades of Pantaleon Bon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Santa Barbara Fortress: A Story" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1384125.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The castle received serious damage during the war of 1873.  He was badly injured as a result of his shelling from the Spanish battleship Numancia, led by rebels from Cartagena. </p><h2>  20th century castle </h2><p>  In the late 1930s, the Santa Barbara fortress, during the Spanish Civil War, was used as a prison for captured Republicans.  Witnesses of those times are the inscriptions and prints on the walls that they left.  After the war ended, the fortress was desolate for some time, and only thanks to the city authorities did it become a unique monument of historical heritage. </p><p>  Since 1963, the restoration of this building began.  2 elevators were built, raising visitors to the fortress in just one minute to the very top of the mountain (path length 204.83 meters). </p><h2>  Fortress today </h2><p>  Thus, the fortress of Santa Barbara today is perfectly equipped for convenient viewing by numerous visitors. </p><p>  In addition, great concerts and festivals take place here on summer nights, and picnics are organized in the winter.  On the territory of the lowest level are tables and benches. </p><p>  Inside the castle you can visit informative exhibitions. </p><p>  If you find any way out of the fortress, you can go down the so-called Great Wall of China (Spanish) and get into the preserved old quarter called Barrio Santa Cruz.  These are narrow streets with white houses, where the voices of children chasing a soccer ball are heard. </p><p>  The observation platforms of the fortress open up an amazing panorama combining an excellent city, a view of the beautiful sea, road forks, a beach, a port and neighboring cities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fortress of Santa Barbara in Alicante: address" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1384152.jpg" width="600"></div>
