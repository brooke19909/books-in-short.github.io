    <h2>  Why do you need corrugated paper pompons? </h2><p>  There are many reasons to make the decoration mentioned above.  So, white pompons from corrugated paper can literally transform the hall where the wedding will be held.  You can decorate a room using these elements in several ways: hang them above the table, in the place where the newlyweds will sit, or throughout the room.  It is worth noting that in the second case it is better to place the balls at different heights, evenly distributing them throughout the room.  In addition, napkins provided for each guest, as well as trays with sweets and bottles with drinks, can be decorated with small paper pompons.  In this case, not only the newlyweds will feel special at the holiday, but also every guest present at it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Paper pompons are also useful during a meeting of a newborn or a celebration of christening, because they can become worthy substitutes for ordinary balls, which often burst, scaring children.  Such decorations are best hung in the child‚Äôs room, where he and his mother will now spend a huge amount of time. </p><p>  Decorating a room or clearing in a similar way is also reasonable for celebrating the birthdays of older children.  In this case, it is worth giving preference to pompons of different sizes and colors. </p><h2>  Preparation of materials and tools </h2><p>  Many modern companies involved in decorating rooms for various events, offer to purchase ready-made products for decorating the halls.  However, it is much nicer to make colorful paper balls with your own hands.  In addition, the product will cost less in this case.  And so that you do not have to spend a lot of time and effort on the design of the premises, pay attention to the master class below.  You can make pompons of various sizes and colors from corrugated paper, but first you need to stock up on the right materials and tools. </p><p>  So, you will need standard and corrugated paper, scissors, glue, a thin wire or a stapler, a ruler, simple and <span>colored pencils, and a</span> decorative ribbon for hanging. </p>

    <h2>  Creating a blank for a regular pompom </h2><p>  To make a pompom, you need 8 sheets, the width of which will determine the diameter of the finished product.  All paper must be stacked and then folded with an accordion.  The width of each bend should be 1.5-2 cm. Next, exactly in the middle, the workpiece must be carefully bandaged with wire.  In the same place you need to fix the decorative tape - if pompons from corrugated paper are planned to be hung.  Further, it is necessary to give the desired shape to the edges of the workpiece on both sides - most often a semicircle is chosen for this purpose.  Now it remains only to spread out all the layers of the decoration.  It is worth noting that this must be done very carefully so as not to tear the paper. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Paper honeycomb pompons: making a template </h2><p>  Another interesting option for decorating the halls are pompons from corrugated paper in the form of honeycombs.  True, their manufacture will require more time and effort, compared with the first option.  Start with the preparation of the template.  So, a standard sheet of paper must be cut to a length of 25 cm, after which, using a ruler and a colored pencil, draw across the lines in 5 cm increments, and then divide these stripes in two in a different color, that is, in the middle of each, for example, a blue line, should pass pink.  Now the template should be set aside and you can proceed to the next step. </p><h2>  Preparation of blanks for the manufacture of paper pompons-honeycombs </h2><p>  You need to take a sheet of corrugated paper and fold it in half until you get a rectangle the size you want to see ready-made paper pompons.  Next, the workpiece must be cut along all fold lines, as a result of which many individual rectangles will be obtained - there should be about 40 of them in total, so one sheet will most likely not be enough, and actions similar to those described above will need to be done several times.  You also need to draw a circle on a standard sheet, the radius of which corresponds to the width of the rectangle, and cut it in half. </p>

    <h2>  Assembling pompoms-honeycombs: master class </h2><p>  Already knowing what to make of corrugated paper and having all the blanks at hand, we can proceed to gluing the plates.  To do this, put one of the rectangles on the sheet with the lines that was prepared at the beginning, and grease the places matching the pink stripes with glue.  Then put another workpiece on top and cover with glue the area of ‚Äã‚Äãblue lines.  Such actions, alternating layers, must be done until all the rectangles are used.  The glued stack of paper should be put under some heavy object and wait for the glue to completely dry. </p>

    <p>  After this, it is necessary to attach the previously prepared semicircle to the stack of glued blanks and cut paper along its contour.  Then glue one part of the semicircle to one side of the workpiece, having previously put a thread under it for hanging, and the other from the back.  At the base, you need to cut out a small depression, leaving the side ‚Äúlegs‚Äù, making it easier to make pompons from corrugated paper at the final stage.  Now it remains only to deploy the product - and you can use it for its intended purpose. </p>
