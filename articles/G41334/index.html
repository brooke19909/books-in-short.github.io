  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cities of the Czech Republic: list, features, attractions and interesting facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The most beautiful city in the Czech Republic is Prague.  Not a month is enough to reevaluate all her wonders.  Very often it turns out that tourists who were planning to ride for a week throughout the country are limited in the end to the capital of the Czech Republic.  This city does not let go of itself.  You fall in love with him at first sight, from the first breath, you dream of returning to him, like an old friend.  But after a tourist enjoys communicating with Prague (perhaps it will only take a few trips), it will be interesting: what‚Äôs next, what else will the country surprise, which cities of the Czech Republic will catch their puffed imagination? </p><p>  And there is something to surprise.  There are a large number of beautiful cities, as if descended from a children's book of fairy tales.  And in one trip, even in a few, you can‚Äôt see them all, but you want to visit everyone.  But from the long list of Czech cities you can still choose the most interesting routes. </p><h2>  Cesky Krumlov </h2><p>  Cesky Krumlov is one of the most beautiful and beautifully preserved historical cities of the Czech Republic and Europe.  This place in the south of the country keeps a unique atmosphere, the center of the region has not changed much since the XVI century.  The large castle complex proudly rises above the winding Vltava River, a labyrinth of paved streets and tiled roofs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cz.prague-stay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cesky Krumlov" class="if uuid-2294670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2294670.jpg"></div><p>  After Prague Castle, old Krumlov is considered the second largest castle in the country.  One day may be enough to make a short tour, but if you stay longer, you can definitely find a number of secret corners.  Most of the three hundred Gothic and Renaissance houses on the winding streets of this city today serve as hotels, shops of traditional Czech crafts, galleries or jewelry stores.  The town has many cozy basement pubs and restaurants serving traditional Czech cuisine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pilsen (Plze≈à) </h2><p>  The names of some Czech cities in Russian sound funny.  That is the name of this city in the western part of the country, which is considered the fourth largest population in the <span>Czech Republic</span> .  Since 1295, Pilsen has been known all over the world for Pilsen beer.  It (together with the Belgian city of Mons) was chosen as one of the European cities of culture in 2015.  The proximity (only 90 km) to the capital makes Pilsen a convenient tourist attraction.  This is especially true for beer lovers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cz.prague-stay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pilsen with unique architecture" class="if uuid-2294723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2294723.jpg"></div><p>  Here is the 13th century Gothic cathedral of St. Bartholomew with the highest tower in the Czech Republic, the Renaissance Town Hall, the Great Moorish-Romanesque Synagogue (the second largest in Europe), 20 km of underground tunnels and cellars of the Plze≈àsk√©ho Prazdroje brewery, where you can learn the whole history of local production beer. </p><h2>  Olomouc </h2><p>  The next in the list of Czech cities is the Moravian Olomouc with its university atmosphere.  More than 25,000 students study at the same time in the city.  Olomouc is famous for being the largest student crowding in Central Europe. </p><p>  The city is located on the Morava River in eastern Bohemia.  There are many historical buildings and churches, large squares, fountains.  On the largest square in Olomouc, you can see the Holy Trinity column, which is the largest baroque statue in the <span>Czech Republic</span> .  The column was built between 1716 and 1754.  St. Wenceslas Cathedral, the palace of the Roman archbishop, the Gothic church of St. Maurice, the 15th-century town hall are not all the sights of the city.  And the stunning Church of the Visitation of the Virgin Mary in St. Kopechka was honored by Pope John Paul II in 1995. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="cz.prague-stay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Olomouc Student City" class="if uuid-2294788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2294788.jpg"></div><h2>  Mari√°nsk√© L√°znƒõ </h2><p>  The city once bore the German name Marienbad.  Compared with other wonderful cities of the Czech Republic, this is a very small resort town located near Karlovy Vary.  This is a quiet refuge among those that are not too crowded with tourists.  The city boasts an abundance of greenery and many houses, impressive elegant architecture.  The magic of the charming resort is enhanced by the green hills surrounding the town.  Most of the buildings were built during the golden period of the 19th century, when noble people, celebrities and European sovereigns came to Marianske Lazne and Karlovy Vary to relax, try out various spa treatments and improve their health near healing springs. </p><p>  The history of the city has only two centuries, but the village of U≈°ovice, located here at the springs, has existed since 1273.  The first mention of healing waters dates back to 1341.  In 1868, Marienbad was declared a city.  At that time, Marianske Lazne was one of the leading resorts in Europe.  Such great personalities came here as Goethe, Chopin, Thomas Edison, Wagner, Franz Joseph I, Russian Tsar Nicholas II and many others.  At the time of the greatest glory and popularity of the resort, up to 20 thousand guests a year came to Marienbad. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cz.prague-stay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marianske Lazne spa town" class="if uuid-2295082" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2295082.jpg"></div><h2>  Brno </h2><p>  One of the best cities in the Czech Republic and the second largest (370 thousand inhabitants) is considered Brno.  The location of the city (it is located near Prague, Vienna and Bratislava) and the fact that Brno is surrounded by beautiful landscapes with magnificent forests of South Moravia makes it an important tourist attraction.  Here you can see many attractions, including interesting buildings, museums, shops, theaters, clubs and the like.  Brno is a city of art galleries, exhibition centers and festivals. </p><p>  Among the most interesting sights of Brno are the ≈†pilberk Castle, the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul, the world-famous villa, which has become the pinnacle of modernism and much more.  It is worth mentioning two objects that especially attract tourists: one of the most important monuments of the Gothic architecture of Moravia - the Basilica of the Assumption and the labyrinth under the old cabbage market.  To learn about the Moravia region with its wine cellars and traditions, start with Brno.  You don‚Äôt have to disappoint. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cz.prague-stay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Brno in the Czech Republic" class="if uuid-2295204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2295204.jpg"></div><h2>  Trebon (T≈ôebo≈ô) </h2><p>  This is one of the very old cities of the Czech Republic.  It is located in the south of the country.  Its origin dates back to the middle of the 12th century.  The city reached its peak of fame and prosperity in the second half of the 15th century under the ruler Peter IV of Rozmberk (1462-1523).  Due to the characteristics of the surrounding countryside with a complex system of ponds, he developed fishing in Treshebon, which gave the city a good profit.  Since 1611, the Habsburgs and Schwarzenbergs became owners of the city, the castle and the surrounding land.  Today, the city owes its fame to tourism, agriculture and spa resorts.  This charming city boasts ancient fortresses and many attractive attractions.  Among them are the main square and large carp ponds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cz.prague-stay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trebon city in the Czech Republic" class="if uuid-2295670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42964/2295670.jpg"></div><p>  These are not all the cities that the Czech Republic can surprise.  Znojmo, Karlovy Vary, Mlada Boleslav, Pruhonice, Kutna Hora, Pisek, Telc, Pardubice, Ostrava and others are amazing places worthy of admiration.  Their architecture, medieval monuments, surrounding nature, traditions, national cuisine will be remembered for a long time and will leave a lot of pleasant memories. </p>
