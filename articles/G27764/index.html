It broke the myth of the invincibility of the Tatar-Mongol hordes, which for a long time held captive many of the peoples inhabiting Eurasia. </p><p>  In connection with the tragedy that occurred in Ukraine, another Odessa Kulikovo field also gained fame.  What is the connection between the long-standing battle and the death of defenseless people at the hands of nationalists?

    <h2>  Honoring Heroes in the Peter Age </h2><p>  In Russia, the tradition of creating military memorials was laid down by the first emperor, Peter the Great.  The construction of locks did not prevent the tsar from visiting the site of the famous battle that laid the foundation for the unification of the Russian lands.  The centuries-old green oak forest, to cut down trees in which it was forbidden by the highest command, was also the first Russian nature reserve.  This living monument has become a shrine where every patriot can bow to the feat of ancestors.  Until that moment, the only material objects reminiscent of former glory were relics recovered from the land by cultivators.  During the plowing, the settlers who founded the villages (Zelenaya Dubrava, Tatinsky Brody, Red Hill and Don) often came across fragments of swords, shields, arrowheads and <span>pectoral crosses of the</span> heroes who took the last battle.  And there were legends, legends and folk memory, passed down from generation to generation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  After World War II </h2><p>  The rise of <span>national identity that</span> occurred after the reflection of the Napoleonic invasion, stirred up in the people the memories of past victories.  The glorious city of gunsmiths, Tula, could not stay away.  Kulikovo field has become an object of veneration.  Through the efforts of the provincial authorities, with the help of the clergy, merchants and popular support, the first structures began to be erected here, perpetuating the feat of Dmitry Donskoy squad.  Initially, large-scale construction was conceived, which had a double purpose: to pay tribute to the heroes of the last war, instructing them to conduct excursions and stories about their and former exploits, and to perpetuate the memory of the participants of the battle, which was more than four centuries old.  To fully implement this plan then failed due to lack of money. </p>

    <h2>  Temples and monuments of the century before last </h2><p>  Only in 1850, Kulikovo Field, or rather, Red Hill, was decorated with a monument by A.P. Bryullov - an obelisk erected in honor of Dmitry Donskoy.  Another element of the memorial, the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin, was designed by A.G. Bocharnikov for almost twenty years, and was completed in 1884.  The main Orthodox monument, the church of St. Sergius of Radonezh, completed the ensemble in 1917.  Then for many decades this holy place was plunged into oblivion.  The new Bolshevik authorities were not up to the heroes of bygone eras; they had enough of their own ... </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Scientific approach </h2><p>  What is famous for Kulikovo field?  The Tula region, on the territory of which a memorable historical event took place, in the sixties of the last century became a place of excavation and research, which, together with already available materials, made it possible to give a scientifically sound description of the course of the battle, its phases, and to determine the places of the most fierce battles.  Now scientists with a high degree of probability know what role the Kulikovo field played in history.  <span>The Museum (Tula Local Lore)</span> at the same time opened a specialized branch to systematize the expositions, the task of which was given a specific task: to identify and substantiate the most probable hypothesis of the events of early September 1380.  It was not easy, but historians did it. </p><h2>  Place of battle </h2><p>  The landscape of those places where Kulikovo Field is located has changed significantly over the centuries.  In order to restore the situation in 1830, it was necessary to recreate it on maps and layouts.  Over the past centuries, deforestation has been carried out, the soil has been weathered, the relief has leveled off.  Nepryadva and Don became smaller, which also made reconstruction difficult.  Nevertheless, you can imagine the picture, as well as restore the tactical plans of Dmitry Donskoy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Military advice and battle plan </h2><p>  It is known that Kulikovo Field is located five kilometers from the current village of Monastyrshchino.  From a military point of view, the place was chosen successfully.  Considering that the bypass of the Mongol-Tatar hordes was a favorite technique, the Russian prince excluded him from the possible arsenal of the enemy, protecting both flanks with water obstacles - the Smolka and Nizhny Dubik rivers.  The main trick was an ambush regiment, hiding in Green Dubrava.  It was formed from selected heroes. </p><p>  The Kulikovo field is large, its area exceeds thirty square kilometers, but the main damage to the enemy was inflicted on a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãit - three hundred and five hundred meters. </p><p>  But even before the tactical plan matured, a military council took place, in which the governors and princes took part.  Some of them, foreseeing the difficulties associated with crossing the Don, proposed to take up defense on the left bank, without overcoming the water barrier.  To <span>this, Prince</span> Dmitry gave an answer that would sound like this in a modern adaptation: ‚ÄúIt would have been better not to go against godless forces than, having arrived, to do nothing.  Today we will go for the Don, and we will put our heads there for our brothers! ‚Äù </p><p>  Battles rarely take place according to the prepared plan, but this time almost everything worked out.  Where the village of Tatinka now stands, bridges were erected, and the horsemen found fords.  It was on the night of September 8, managed to observe secrecy. </p><p>  Before the battle, Prince Dmitry did not sleep, he urged the soldiers to fight boldly and not spare themselves.  On a foggy morning, a three-tier combat deployment took place.  Infantry stood in the Front Regiment, then the Big Regiment (the main striking force) was built, Dmitry personally commanded it.  There was also a reserve, designed to support the direction in which a critical situation would arise.  A reserve regiment disguised in Green Oak Forest under the command of governor Bobrock and Vladimir Serpukhovsky had a special role to play.  The life of the whole squad and Dmitry himself depended on their actions. </p><h2>  The enemy and his forces </h2><p>  Momai moved slowly, confident in the power of his army.  It was numerous and surpassed those forces that could oppose the Russians.  In addition, there was a connection with the Allied Tatars by the squads of Oleg Ryazan and the Lithuanian Prince Jagaila.  An hour before noon, the vanguard, consisting of Genoese mercenaries, entered Kulikovo Field and took a frontal position opposite the Russian army.  I watched the maneuvers from Red Hill Mamai, without foreseeing any complications and surprises.  According to tradition, in the neutral zone between the troops the single combat of the best warriors took place.  Tatars put Chelubey against the Russian monk Peresvet.  The forces were equal, no one wanted to give in, both soldiers died.  And then it began ... </p><h2>  And the battle struck </h2><p>  For a long time, historians judged the collisions of a battle by its description in Zadonshchina, a document written by an unknown author, perhaps immediately after the battle or a little later.  The frontal collision of two armies occurred with a large mutual number of victims.  The advanced regiment was crushed and split like hay, then the turn of the Big Regiment, that is, the main forces of the Russians, came.  Having shifted the main direction of the strike to the left flank, the Tatars pressed it to Nepryadva, threatening coverage.  It seemed to Mom that his victory was close, but here, according to a tactical plan, the Ambush Regiment hit, causing a panic and the flight of the enemy.  The Russians pursued the Tatars, razi them mercilessly.  Upon learning of the massacre, the allies expected by Mamai fled without ever entering the battle. </p><p>  They buried the fallen heroes for eight days.  Moscow triumphed, meeting the winners on October 1.  Prince Dmitry received the title of "Donskoy". </p><h2>  About strategic issues </h2><p>  An expert in tactics commander deserves respect, but only a wise strategist deserves the title of genius.  Just looking at the map of Russia, you can realize what Kulikovo Field meant to our history.  Tula region in its current borders is on the way from the Volga to the north-east of the country.  Having concentrated the largest military group in the history of Russia in the Kolomna region, Prince Dmitry decided to repulse Mamaia, who wanted to punish the rebellious Moscow for refusing to pay tribute and stop her desire to gain full sovereignty. </p><p>  The horde was preparing a ‚Äúbig campaign‚Äù, the future of this predatory force depended on its results, the Tatars were extremely determined.  There is no doubt that if they could get the upper hand on the Kulikov field, then the punitive expedition would surpass all the most daring assumptions in cruelty.  In this sense, the victory of Dmitry Donskoy was strategic in nature, opening up a historical perspective for Russia. </p><h2>  In recent decades </h2><p>  In 1980, when the sixth anniversary of the great battle was celebrated, the church of St. Sergius of Radonezh was restored.  The exhibition held in the village of Monastyrshchino is timed to coincide with this date.  Forestry workers did a lot to recreate the historic landscape.  After Russia gained independence under the law ‚ÄúOn the Days of Military Glory‚Äù (1995), a decision was made to create the Kulikovo Field historical reserve.  The museum continues its scientific work, it is open to visitors.  <span>The memorial complex</span> also includes a memorial cross in Green Dubrava, the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a monument to Dmitry Donskoy and the alley of Memory and Unity. </p>

    <h2>  Odessa Kulikovo field </h2><p>  If, getting out of the car at the Odessa train station, you ask the local townsman where Kulikovo Field is located, you can be sure that he will not send you to Tula, but will point your finger through the fence.  Indeed, despite the fact that almost all the years of the existence of the USSR, this square bore the name of a revolution (at first it was simple, and then, so that they wouldn‚Äôt think, it was Oktyabrskaya), everyone called it the old-fashioned way, like under the tsar. </p><p>  Once, two hundred years ago, the station district was the outskirts of the city.  Here the border of Porto Franco passed (now it would be called a <span>free trade</span> zone <span>),</span> indicated by a moat, and in general there was a wasteland, which was used for combat exercises by soldiers of the Odessa regiment, dressed in black uniforms with red epaulettes.  This place enjoyed a dismal reputation, and state criminals were executed and buried here.  There was a prison nearby.  But by the end of the century, all these fears had become a thing of the past, the country was developing very quickly, and Odessa with it.  Kulikovo field has become the place of evening promenades and even attractions. </p><p>  During the years of the Civil War and intervention, they again began to bury here, and all in a row.  Victims of urban battles, haidamaks, accidental deaths, some soldiers of the foreign corps found peace in Kulikovo field and were forgotten.  They remembered in 1967 only the heroes of the revolution, to whom a mournful squat monument was erected next to the final stop of trams on routes 17 and 18.  The city expanded very far from the imaginary line where the Kulikovo field designated its border. </p><p>  Later, the regional party committee was built on it, then it became the House of Trade Unions. </p>

    <h2>  Odessa rallies </h2><p>  Having become a part of independent Ukraine, Odessa remained a distinctive city and mainly Russian-speaking.  It cannot be said that the townspeople unanimously supported Maidan, as well as to state the opposite.  Sympathies were divided, in spring rallies often spontaneously and spontaneously occurred, during which there were skirmishes, most often verbal. </p><p>  The thing is that the residents of the southern city (and not only them) were not asked whether they liked or not what was happening in Kiev.  The principle of democracy, which Odessa has always been famous for, absorbed with the first breath of free air, was violated.  Kulikovo Field has become a place where people who did not accept the ideals of the "heavenly hundred" peacefully expressed their protest.  Eyewitnesses can confirm that the townspeople (most often the elderly) did not commit any aggressive actions.  They just stood, talked quietly, listened to music and watched a large plasma TV on which Russian news was broadcast.  For this, many of them were killed.  And burned. </p>

    <h2>  May 2 tragedy </h2><p>  The official version says that after the match between Chernomorets and Metalist, patriotic fans decided to march along which unknown ‚ÄúGRU agents‚Äù (in the sense that it is not known whether they were GRU agents) opened fire from pistols.  There were even victims, although it was not possible to find them; the protesting nationalists did not let the police or doctors into the bodies lying on the asphalt covered with clothes.  Then they generally disappeared somewhere, which suggests that the victims were not so dead.  Then the uncontrollable (in <span>appearance) crowd,</span> having smashed the tents on Greek Square, moved towards the place where the "forces of evil", that is, the entire Odessa "anti-Maidan", were concentrated.  Kulikovo field was filled in a matter of minutes by aggressive young people armed with gasoline, plastic bottles and firearms.  Having driven the protesters into the House of Trade Unions, they proceeded to the main point of the plan - the murder.  Again, according to the official version, the victims burn themselves ... </p>
