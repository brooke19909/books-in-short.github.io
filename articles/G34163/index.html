Maintaining optimal biological, sanitary and hygienic balances is a prerequisite for maintaining a water body.  For this, various means are used from filtration plants to aeration systems.  A separate stage in the comprehensive cleaning can be called the elimination of mechanical impurities.  This function is performed by a water vacuum cleaner for the pool, presented on the market in many versions and modifications. </p>

    <h2>  General information about water vacuum cleaners </h2><p>  Surface debris in the water surface of the pool is eliminated by the simplest devices like nets.  However, particles of debris deposited at the bottom must be removed with specialized equipment.  Vacuum cleaners of this type can have different devices and technical parameters, but they are mandatory provided with brushes, hoses for removing impurities, a pre-filter and a pump.  During operation, an underwater vacuum cleaner for the pool cleans the surface of a layer of unwanted particles and immediately sucks them into a special container.  Moreover, the path from the brush to the waste bin is also divided into several technological gaps.  The main one will be the already mentioned filtering.  Devices that filter out large debris particles are directly connected to the collection containers.  The rest of the water can be sent to the sewer or to the units for further purification - for example, to a septic tank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Manual devices </h2>

    <p>  Such models are suitable for the care of small pool structures - frame or inflatable.  The optimal volume is 40 m2.  Manual vacuum cleaners are equipped with telescopic rods, due to which the departure length of the working equipment is regulated.  At the end of the device, 1-2 brushes are installed, which directly eliminate the layers of dirt from the surfaces of the bottom and walls of the structure.  Nozzles are connected to a hose, which, in turn, provides the output of dirty particles.  At the other end, a hand-held pool water vacuum cleaner is connected to the plumbing system and the pump that is pumping.  This option is characterized by a high cleaning rate, but, again, it is effective only in working with small areas.  It is not only the laboriousness of the manual principle of care, but also the modest performance of the unit. </p><h2>  Semi-automatic versions </h2><p>  In semi-automatic vacuum cleaners, the brush elements have a more complex device, which just focuses on servicing large areas.  But the main differences are in functionality and wide management capabilities.  In particular, technically advanced devices allow for the regulation of water pressure.  In addition, the very direction of the equipment on the target surface is made without manual effort.  Holding on special suction cups, a semi-automatic underwater vacuum cleaner for the pool slowly moves along the bottom, cleaning its surface.  Otherwise, the principle of action remains the same.  Collected dirty water goes through one or several stages of filtration, and then goes to a garbage container.  It can be either included in the basic device of the vacuum cleaner, or interact with the unit through additional communications.  Also, the possibility of removing contaminants directly into the sewer or septic tank is not ruled out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Automated vacuum cleaners </h2>

    <p>  Fully automatic machines are also called robotic vacuum cleaners.  This is a separate high-tech segment, which presents models for the care of voluminous deep pools.  What is good about automatic technology?  The workflow in this case gets rid of human participation.  Compared to semi-automatic units, robotic devices move independently and set themselves the direction of movement.  Thanks to the sensors, a water vacuum cleaner for the pool with automatic detects areas with contamination and eliminates them.  But also there remains the possibility of controlling the equipment from the side.  Typically, a complete set provides a remote control through which you can control the operation of the vacuum cleaner. </p><h2>  Intex Pool Water Vacuum Cleaner </h2>

    <p>  Intex is known for high-quality pools, but it also produces no less worthy equipment for their maintenance.  For example, model 28001 is a semi-automatic vacuum cleaner designed to remove dirt on the bottom surface.  But you must immediately take into account that the unit works only when it is possible to pair with ground tanks.  As for management, human participation is also not required - the device itself moves along the working area, periodically pushing itself away from the walls of the structure and changing direction.  In terms of productivity, the Intex pool water vacuum cleaner can be attributed to the middle segment.  Its power potential provides pumping of water at a speed of 6 m3 / hour.  That is, it can be used both for maintenance of rigid structures and for inflatable pool models. </p><h2>  Pool cleaner Bestway </h2><p>  Manufacturer Bestway is a direct competitor to Intex in the market for pools and hydrological devices.  In this case, the vacuum cleaner kit modification 58234 is interesting. This is a hand-held device designed to care for structures with a diameter of about 4.5 m. The package includes brush mechanisms, a corrugated hose, a trash can for trash and a filter pump.  As the manufacturer indicates, the Bestway pool vacuum cleaner in this design is capable of working with a capacity of 3800 l / h.  But in choosing this solution, one should also consider the limitations of physical access to surfaces.  So, the hose has a 6-meter length, and a rod with an extension can extend to 280 cm. </p>

    <p>  Already as an option, users of this kit can purchase special holders and adapters that expand the application of the device.  This, in particular, allows the use of a water vacuum cleaner for pools even of complex construction.  Especially given the lack of restrictions in the direction of movement of equipment. </p><h2>  AstralPool Shark Model </h2><p>  A fairly simple, but functional and ergonomic vacuum cleaner, provided with a triangular brush mechanism.  The developers focused not so much on manufacturability as on the structural advantages of the equipment.  The working elements of the Shark pool vacuum cleaner are made of high-strength ABS plastic.  The use of this material determines the protection of the brush from mechanical damage, the negative effects of frost and direct sunlight. </p>

    <p>  The design of the apparatus also includes a telescopic handle with a diameter of 32 mm.  With its help, a vacuum cleaner for cleaning the pool can be used both in the care of shallow containers, and in work at professional facilities.  Of course, the performance in this case will be low, but the price tag of 1.5 thousand may justify such an acquisition. </p><h2>  How to choose the best vacuum cleaner </h2><p>  The choice should be determined according to several parameters.  First of all, it is necessary to correlate the performance of the pump and filtration unit with the volume of the tank.  Next, you can proceed to the principle of operation - manual, semi-automatic or automatic.  A universal solution can be called a semi-automatic device, but manual models are more effective in working with complex zones.  Robotic systems should be purchased for large-area structures.  Also, do not forget about the device of the brush nozzle.  It must be borne in mind that the best water-based cordless vacuum cleaners for swimming pools work with at least two nozzles - with soft and hard nap.  Brushes should cope with the elimination of mucus on the surface, and with the selection of large debris. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  Sophisticated cleaning equipment is expensive and this is especially true for hydrological devices.  Therefore, before buying, it is important to determine how, in principle, the presence of a vacuum cleaner for the pool on the farm will be justified.  The reviews indicate an effective solution to the problem of cleaning surfaces using such a technique, but their disadvantages are also noted.  For example, connecting a pump and a filtration device in itself requires additional organizational and energy costs.  At the same time, cleaning can be performed in the traditional manual way, but only in conditions of emptying the pool.  If the task is to ensure regular comprehensive cleaning with minimal physical effort, and the associated costs are not of particular importance, then an underwater vacuum cleaner may well be a useful acquisition. </p>
