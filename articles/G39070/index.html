Baikal is rightfully considered to be such a picturesque corner of pristine nature - the <span>deepest lake</span> on the planet, which is also one of the oldest.  Does Baikal freeze in winter?  Of course, yes, and the ice, which covers a unique reservoir, is also one of the most beautiful sights, combining numerous shades of blue.  It is winter time that is the best for a trip to Lake Baikal, which is also called the Small Sea. </p><h2>  Unique Baikal Lake </h2><p>  This beautiful lake is located in Central Asia, in the south of Eastern Siberia.  It serves as the border between the Irkutsk region and the Republic of Buryatia.  Baikal contains about 19% of the world‚Äôs supply of fresh water, which is grandiose in itself.  In addition, this water is so free of all minerals that it can safely replace a distilled liquid.  And the purity and transparency of the lake allows you to see stones and other objects at a depth of up to 40 meters.  Baikal in winter and summer is an absolutely amazing sight.  The depth of the Small Sea averages 730 m, the maximum figure is 1637 meters.  The uniqueness of the natural site is confirmed by the fact that Baikal has been on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1996. </p>

    <h2>  Flora and fauna of Baikal </h2><p>  The flora and fauna of the lake is diverse and rich.  About 2630 species of plants and animals live in a unique reservoir, more than 60% of them are unique.  You can find them only in this reservoir.  Such a large number of living organisms is explained by the fact that the water of Lake Baikal contains a very large percentage of oxygen in winter and summer.  In addition, this reservoir is considered the site of invertebrate species.  If we look at the numbers, then more than half of all varieties of freshwater mollusks, as well as shell crustaceans live in Baikal.  However, only some species of inhabitants can be found in the Angara, the only river flowing from the lake.  Also on the shores of Lake Baikal there are many diverse birds.  The rocky islands of the lake in spring are populated by gulls and cormorants.  Locals called this abundance of birds "bird market." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Lake <span>Baikal in winter</span> and summer </h2><p>  Current seasons have their own characteristics in this area.  Summer on Baikal can be called a very conditional time of the year.  In June, small icebergs are still observed on the water, and in August a cold wind - barguzin - is already blowing.  It is northern, therefore, when it is roaming around, it is impossible to walk without a jacket.  The middle of October is the time of the first frosts on the lake, when the fingers are numb in the water in a matter of seconds, and the surface of the lake is covered with hoarfrost in the morning.  There are much more sunny days than in any other region of Russia, including the Primorsky coast.  At the same time, it is almost never hot in the lake.  A similar climate has been established due to the large number of different winds that walk the territory.  The coolness that blows from the pond itself also played a role.  Thus, it is the rest on Lake Baikal in winter that will show all the charms of this beautiful lake.  Numerous reasons speak in favor of this choice, which will be considered in more detail. </p><h2>  Ice road ride </h2><p>  Probably there is no person who would abandon the crazy and funny idea - a ride on the icy expanses of the lake.  Is it possible to remain indifferent, knowing that only a thickness of ice separates the car from the water abyss and a half kilometers deep?  This disturbing thought encourages many adrenaline lovers to go to Lake Baikal in winter.  From February to the end of the first decade of April, the ice road through the reservoir is open to motorists.  However, one should not take much risk, despite the thickness of the ice and all measures taken for the safety of people, every year dozens of cars fall into the water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  That is why it is almost impossible to rent a car for a trip on your own.  There are only two options for a ride on the lake - come in your own car or contact a travel agency.  Given that tours to Lake Baikal are quite popular, there are many companies offering lake tours or the possibility of renting a car with a personal driver.  Such measures are more reliable and safer than an independent trip to the lake, warn the heads of travel agencies. </p><h2>  The world's largest ice rink </h2><p>  Another reason to visit Lake Baikal in the cold season.  During this period, the Small Sea becomes one huge ice rink.  That is why rest on Lake Baikal in winter can not be imagined without skates.  At the same time, the ice of the lake is simply fabulous: the main focus of the person is not on inspecting the colorful landscapes on the sides, but on what is under his feet.  This beauty contributes to the fact that many adults fall into childhood and begin to skate on the ice, like little ones.  This is an indescribable feeling of unity with nature and delight from its beauty! </p><p>  The purest water of Lake Baikal turns into ice, which has different shades - from light blue to piercing blue.  Skating rinks of various sizes open on the shores of the lake annually.  Some of them stretch along the entire length of the coastal village.  Skate rental and instructor assistance are included in the tourist service program. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  There are people who cross the entire lake on skates.  This is a whole journey, lasting hundreds of kilometers: it will be difficult for an unprepared person to pass it.  Moreover, the unpredictability of weather on the lake, especially in open areas, should be taken into account.  Some winds blow with such force that they can easily carry a person across the ice: he is powerless in this difficult situation.  Therefore, going out on ice alone is a rather serious risk. </p><h2>  Hot springs of the Small Sea </h2><p>  Winter holidays on Baikal cannot be imagined without visiting the thermal springs, which are located in the northern part of the lake.  You can go there for just one day or spend several days in this wonderful place.  <span>Recreation facilities on Lake Baikal</span> in winter take into account this need of tourists and organize such trips.  At the same time, people are provided with rather comfortable conditions - heated houses, good nutrition.  There are also small ice rinks at hydropathic centers that offer skate rental. </p><p>  Swimming during the snowfall is an unforgettable experience that everyone wants to experience.  The combination of beauty and usefulness of the procedure makes the adoption of healing baths extremely popular among vacationers.  Thermal springs vary in population and price category.  The largest concentration of tourists is observed, as a rule, at those sources that are more accessible for transport.  The higher the prices and the more difficult the route, the fewer people can be found on ponds. </p><h2>  Fishing on Baikal in winter </h2><p>  This is one of the most popular attractions that Lake Baikal offers in winter.  Fishing for some vacationers is a real sport, for others - a way to have a good time.  Ice fishing begins in January, when you can catch fish that the locals do not take seriously: perch, pike, silver raptor, dace.  The lower the degree on the thermometer, the thicker the ice level.  At this time, many go fishing in the "open sea" for impressive prey.  The hole is made an ordinary lumberjack, which eliminates the need to buy or rent large equipment.  Recreation facilities and travel agencies help in organizing fishing, offering many different tours. </p>

    <p>  Professionals say that the best time for fishing comes in March and lasts until the beginning of April.  At this time, the sun is already warming quite strongly: there is no need to freeze, moreover, the ice remains still thick, which does not interfere with ice fishing.  You can walk on it without fear, despite the spring sun.  As for the catch, it does not depend on the time of the year.  It's all about luck and human skill. </p><h2>  Diving on Baikal </h2><p>  One of the most unforgettable experiences you can get by visiting Lake Baikal in January.  Diving is an immersion in water from the ice of a lake through specially made lanes.  Diving near hummocks is especially popular.  Through the absolutely transparent ice of the lake you can see such trifles as the size of the shoes, written on the sole, facial expressions of people.  Of course, such a sight cannot leave anyone indifferent.  That is why diving is so popular on Lake Baikal.  In order not to get lost in the water and return to the ice hole, diving is carried out only with a safety cable.  Thus, winter diving becomes a great way to spend time on this beautiful lake and get an unforgettable experience. </p>

    <p>  Scuba diving is also possible in the summer.  Clean water will bring a lot of impressions even to a professional.  Through it, you can see to the smallest detail absolutely all objects on the surface.  Thus, diving on Lake Baikal is a year-round entertainment that does not depend on the season and weather. </p><h2>  Underwater caves and grottoes of Lake Baikal </h2><p>  A very beautiful sight.  All caves and grottoes are located under the water column.  The largest stretches more than 25 meters.  The width and height of the cave allows three scuba divers to freely fit inside, who can comfortably move around it.  The full-wave grottoes, which are numerous along the perimeter of the lake, reach an average of 20 meters in length.  Most of the indentations are filled with pebbles.  There is also a mysterious cave, visible at a depth from the surface, which is described by local fishermen.  However, scuba divers have not yet reached it, so it has not yet been investigated. </p><h2>  Unique seal </h2><p>  He is the main "highlight" of Lake Baikal.  The seal lives in the lake - the only seal in the world that lives in fresh waters and the only representative of mammals in the fauna of the lake.  It lives on the territory of the <span>Ushkany Islands.</span>  Quite often, he approaches the ships without being afraid of a person, however, he tries not to get close to scuba divers.  At sunset, you can see how the seal begins a mass movement to its rookery.  Without this spectacular sight, it is impossible to imagine Lake Baikal in winter.  However, as in the summer. </p>
