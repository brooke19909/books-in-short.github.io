This question is asked not only by the parents of children of kindergarten or primary school age, when the children are asked as a homework to master some kind of creative activity and make decorations on the eve of the holiday.  Joint creativity is an opportunity to spend time in an interesting occupation together with your soulmate or older children.  So why not make paper Christmas toys with your own hands?  This is the simplest and cheapest material, work with which does not require special knowledge and skills.  And there are so many interesting things to do, armed with colored paper, scissors and glue, felt-tip pens, desire and imagination.  So, let's begin.  How to make a paper toy on a Christmas tree? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kleo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a toy out of paper" class="if uuid-2286629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2286629.jpg"></div><h2>  Christmas tree balls made of paper </h2><p>  The traditional <span>decoration of the Christmas</span> tree is balls.  They can be glass, plastic, they can be bought in a store or made with your own hands from improvised materials, including paper.  For this, dense colored paper or cardboard, old magazines and postcards are suitable.  You can even use the covers of unnecessary exercise books. </p><p>  How to make Christmas toys from paper with your own hands?  It is necessary to take several sheets of thick paper or cardboard, the covers of old magazines, draw a circle with 21 compasses on them into an even circle of any diameter and cut them out.  The workpiece is ready.  Now each circle needs to be folded in half on one side and on the other hand to outline the center point. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Next, bend to the center only one side, bending the other two sides in the same way, you will get an even triangle.  In one of the circles, this triangle needs to be cut out - it will serve as a stencil for other details.  Now it remains to impose the cut triangle on the remaining circles, circle it with a simple pencil and bend the edges along the contour. </p><div class="photo" data-original="buhhelp-irk.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://buhhelp-irk.ru/igrushka-na-novogodnjuju-elku-svoimi-rukami-30.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make christmas toys" class="if uuid-2286633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2286633.jpg"></div><p>  The first 10 circles need to be glued together in a strip, but be sure to alternate - five down and five up.  Fold the resulting part in a ring, this will be the basis for the future Christmas tree toy.  Divide the remaining 10 blanks, 5 pieces each and glue into a circle, you get two peculiar caps.  These caps must be glued to the base ring.  Do not forget about the eyelet with which you can hang the toy. </p><h2>  A simple ball of paper stripes </h2><p>  New Year paper toys can be very simple, but no less interesting.  To quickly make a Christmas tree ball, you will need scissors, colored paper and ribbons for wrapping gifts.  Cut out several strips of colored paper.  Five pieces of such blanks will be quite enough.  They should be the same width, but of different lengths, from larger to smaller.  On the edges of the strips you need to make holes with a hole punch or an awl.  Now with the help of a clerical clip you need to assemble the ball so that the tape can be inserted into the holes.  It remains only to fix the entire structure with a packing tape. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Simple christmas toy </h2><p>  A simple ball-shaped toy that can decorate the Christmas tree is even easier to make.  From colored paper (you can use the pages of old magazines, special paper with a pattern, and so on) cut out at least 4 identical circles.  Now everyone needs to be folded in half, and each half glued to another circle.  Before gluing the latter, you need to put a loop in the toy, for which the ball can be hung.  If you glue more circles, the ball will be more voluminous.  By the same principle, you can do crafts of other forms: in the form of a Christmas tree, a snowman, cones, berries or sweets. </p><h2>  Christmas ball made of harnesses </h2><p>  What and how to make a toy out of paper if traditional smooth <span>Christmas balls are</span> bored?  You can experiment with other techniques for doing crafts, for example, make a ball from harnesses using decoupage or quilling technique.  For such a craft, you will need old glossy magazines or colorful newspapers (thin pages will be easier to curl and glue), scissors, a glue gun, the base is a ball of foam, foil, crumpled paper impregnated with glue. </p><p>  It is necessary to cut out several strips of paper and twist them into tight bundles, but so that the workpieces do not tear.  Next, you can begin to glue the base-ball with these blanks using a glue gun.  Press each harness well so that it does not peel off, but be careful - the glue is very hot, they can burn yourself.  When the ball is ready, let it dry for at least 10 minutes. </p><h2>  Decoupage ball </h2><p>  Homemade decorations using decoupage technique look very beautiful on the New Year's beauty.  To make such a designer ball, you need a base (such, by the way, are sold in needlework stores), glue, napkins with a beautiful pattern, or pages of an old book, magazine, thread and felt-tip pens to decorate a toy.  Napkins or sheets with which you will paste the toy, first need to be soaked a little in a solution of glue and water, and only then put on the ball base.  This is done layer by layer until the toy acquires the desired look.  If you glue the base with soft sheets (for example, pages from a magazine or a book without illustrations), you can write something on the ball with a felt-tip pen and wrap it with shiny thread several times.  Also, do not forget to form a loop. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="mag.relax.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper christmas toys" class="if uuid-2286643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2286643.jpg"></div><h2>  Quilling Jewelry </h2><p>  Very original paper toys are made using the quilling technique - this is the art of making volumetric or flat compositions from twisted strips of paper.  You will need glue, scissors, baking dishes, a ruler, old newspapers or magazines for such beauty, and better - special quilling paper.  A variety of decoration elements are also useful: braid, beads, beads and so on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="svoimirukamy.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://svoimirukamy.com/igrushki-na-yolku-svoimi-rukami.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper christmas toys" class="if uuid-2286630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2286630.jpg"></div><p>  If there is no special paper that is already cut in strips, cut color paper, newspapers, or magazines into strips.  The optimal width is 5 centimeters.  Now you need to fold each strip in half, straighten, fold the edges to the center and then bend in half again.  Lubricate the strip with PVA glue and start twisting.  The same actions must be repeated with all stripes. </p><p>  In a pre-prepared baking dish, place a twisted strip along the contour.  Next, fill all the free space with twisted strips, between each other, and also from above they must be fixed with PVA glue.  Wait until everything dries well, it will take several hours.  Now you can pull the toy out of the baking dish.  It remains to carefully attach the eyelet and decorate the toy at your own discretion. </p><h2>  Original christmas toy </h2><p>  Bright ice cream in a waffle cup is associated with hot times and relaxation, but even on a Christmas tree this craft will look quite original and festive.  To make such a toy from paper, you need thick beige paper for cups (it is better to take kraft paper or the one from which paper bags are made), as well as corrugated different colors for ice cream balls. </p><p>  Cut circles from kraft paper for a waffle cup, cut them into two parts and form a cone from each semicircle.  Glue it together.  The glasses are ready, it remains only to make bright balls of ice cream.  Crumple the corrugated paper in various shades into lumps.  For one Christmas tree toy made of paper with your own hands you will need two such lumps.  Now all that remains is to string ‚Äúcups‚Äù and ‚Äúice cream‚Äù.  Do not forget to leave the loops on top, for which you can then hang decorations on the Christmas tree. </p><h2>  Christmas paper candles </h2><p>  Candles made of paper are rather not a Christmas tree toy, but an original decoration for a festive table.  Such candles can be placed between dishes to create a festive atmosphere.  Making New Year's toys out of paper is very simple.  You only need glue, scissors and two shades of colored paper: yellow and red.  Use orange, yellow or red felt-tip pen to draw a flame. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a toy out of paper" class="if uuid-2286641" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2286641.jpg"></div><p>  First, cut two identical strips of yellow (orange is also suitable) or red paper.  Glue the edges of the strips perpendicularly, at a right angle.  Now you need to bend one strip on top of another, alternating them.  It will turn out an accordion.  Separately cut the base on which the ‚Äúcandle‚Äù will stand in the form of a circle or other shape, as well as a flame.  Do not forget to leave a place below the "flame" to stick it on the accordion.  Next, you only need to glue the accordion on the base circle, and glue the flame to the ‚Äúcandle‚Äù itself. </p><h2>  Volumetric snowflake </h2><p>  A mandatory <span>attribute of the New Year</span> holidays is snowfields.  Christmas tree snowflakes made of paper can be made large, voluminous, using the origami technique.  To make such beauty, you need to cut out six squares of the same size from white paper, each of them then fold diagonally and in half.  On the bend, you need to make cuts, make sure that they are parallel to each other.  Now you need to expand the square, and turn the resulting tongues and fasten together.  The outer parts of the snowflake are connected in the same way with the edges of other squares.  You can fasten a paper toy with a stapler, which is more reliable, or with glue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vse-sovety.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://vse-sovety.ru/17-rukodelie/15-novogodnie-igrushki-svoimi-rukami.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper christmas toys" class="if uuid-2286631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2286631.jpg"></div><p>  When the snowflake is ready, it can be additionally sprinkled with sequins or sequins, wrapped with shiny thread.  From large paper toys with your own hands you can make a garland or decorate them with the entire wall, a Christmas tree. </p><h2>  The easiest do-it-yourself garland </h2><p>  This is truly one of the easiest DIY paper-made Christmas toys.  Probably everyone in elementary school or even in kindergarten made such garlands of white or colored paper.  To diversify the craft, you can use instead of ordinary paper for crafting with drawings or pages of old magazines.  First you need to cut many strips of the same length.  The first strip is glued into the ring, each subsequent strip is glued in the same way, but first it must be threaded into the previous link of the garland.  Such a garland toy made of paper with your own hands can be made with a child of 4-5 years old. </p><h2>  Christmas wreath made of paper </h2><p>  Traditional Christmas tree toys made of paper - balls, snowflakes and snowmen, cones, sweets, but wreaths are not so common in our country.  But they are actively decorating houses in Germany, because this is an attribute of Lutheranism.  But you can make such an easy-to-make and interesting decoration for the Christmas tree without going into the details of the origin of the wreath. </p><p>  For a Christmas paper toy, you will need green and red colored paper, a stapler, a stationery knife, a ruler, PVA glue, a felt-tip pen and a simple pencil.  It is better if the colored paper is thick.  A sheet of green paper needs to be folded in half, a few centimeters away from the edge, and then draw lines under the ruler with a simple pencil at a distance of 1-2 cm from each other.  Now you need to cut the paper with scissors or a clerical knife along these lines and expand the sheet.  Fold a sheet of green paper in a tube in a horizontal direction and secure the edges along the entire length with a stapler.  The wreath is ready, it remains only to decorate it with a red bow cut out of paper and rowan berries. </p><h2>  Origami stars </h2><p>  In the origami technique, you can also make stars, which (if combined with a luminous garland) will truly create an atmosphere of magic.  Each sprocket will require a long strip of paper.  It is better to take the pages of old magazines or special paper for crafts with drawings.  The manufacturing scheme of such an original toy is below.  With stars you can decorate a Christmas tree or decorate an apartment in anticipation of the holiday.  Such Christmas tree toys are easy to make from paper; they attract the eye with their originality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vrukodelii.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper toys for new year" class="if uuid-2286632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51506/2286632.jpg"></div><p>  Christmas tree toys made of paper are space for imagination.  Even on the basis of the options listed above, you can come up with a few more interesting decorations that will create a festive atmosphere. </p>
