If we consider the segment of e-books and tablet computers, then there is constantly a merger, since these devices are somewhat identical in their capabilities. </p><p>  Initially, e-books appeared with TFT screens.  Their quality did not cause much enthusiasm, and <span>electronic paper</span> technology had a number of advantages. </p><p>  However, the PocketBook IQ 701 e-book is changing the way users see it, because better screens and powerful operating systems like Android come to the rescue. </p><p>  As a result, we have almost a tablet computer only with a bias in reading books. </p><p>  <strong>Technical features</strong> </p><p>  PocketBook 701 IQ has the following features: </p><ul><li>  Android operating system </li><li>  800 MHz processor; </li><li>  diagonal 7 "; </li><li>  touch screen with a resolution of 600x800; </li><li>  Wi-fi </li><li>  supported formats: FB2, DJVU, EPUB, DOC, TXT and other text formats; </li><li>  2 GB of internal memory. </li></ul><p>  Such a set of technical specifications may well provide everything necessary for any reader, so the PocketBook IQ 701 e-book can cause real interest. </p><p>  It is a universal device for reading electronic literature, moreover, the owner will have functional tools for working with electronic texts at hand. </p><p>  For all its characteristics, the PocketBook IQ e-book can be called an Internet tablet, although it may be inferior to them in capabilities.  But given that this is still an electronic book, much can be forgiven. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Appearance</strong> </p><p>  The appearance of the reader is quite simple, but not without style and even elegance - a rectangle with rounded edges, almost the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is occupied by the screen. </p><p>  It is worth saying that the quality of the display turned out to be on top - it has a pretty good color rendering, which is enough not only for reading, but also for viewing pictures and web pages. </p><p>  On sale, the PocketBook IQ 701 e-book appears in several versions - dark blue, red and white.  Each user will be able to choose a device for himself - due to different colors, a certain difference in style is created;  Many people like to express their preferences when choosing these gadgets.  A significant plus will be a stylish leather case that can protect the device from damage. </p><p>  <strong>Book features</strong> </p><p>  E-book PocketBook IQ 701 reviews earned positive.  Many users note its strengths.  Of course, someone will not like the large dimensions;  someone will say that 10 hours is too little;  there are those who don‚Äôt like the overall design. </p><p>  But it cannot be denied that the device has the highest functionality.  It is versatile and easy to use.  Not everyone appreciates the benefits of E-Ink technology in business, someone will say that traditional screens are better. </p><p>  In addition, you can not write off the opportunities that <span>the Android operating system</span> offers <span>.</span>  Access to the market with downloadable content, thanks to this, the user will significantly expand the meager capabilities of a conventional e-book. </p><p>  By installing a browser, clients of YouTube and other social networks, adding video players and audio players, as well as several useful office utilities, we get a full-fledged handheld computer and organizer that can replace even a tablet computer. </p><p>  <strong>Conclusion</strong> </p><p>  The PocketBook IQ 701 e-book <strong>is</strong> a universal gadget for those who want to get everything at once, without spending money on the purchase of several devices.

The interest in this model is high enough to provide it with a bright future, even among the constantly updated market of electronic ‚Äúreaders‚Äù and new generation tablet computers. </p>
