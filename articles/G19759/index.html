Connection Features and Reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Searching for a subscriber on a map of the world or city is a very interesting, sometimes even extremely useful service.  MTS, Beeline and MegaFon have a locator for this.  But newer operators called this feature a little differently.  For example, there is a "Geopoisk" ("Tele2").  How to use the program?  What is this all about?  What is the opinion of subscribers about the service?  Now we have to figure it all out. </p><h2>  Feature Description </h2><p>  Before using the Geopoisk service, you will have to think about what we will work with.  In general, as already mentioned, this is a way to search for a particular subscriber on an interactive map, a kind of locator that allows you to determine the location of a person. </p>

    <p>  True, "Geopoisk" at "Tele2" has its own distinctive features.  For example, you can only search for subscribers of a given carrier.  And only those who are within your home region.  While roaming and traveling, searches cannot be performed.  So do not rely on any unlimited possibilities.  Nevertheless, this is a very convenient service.  Geopoisk from the <span>Tele 2</span> operator will allow you to find a subscriber on the map at any time. </p><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  The terms of this opportunity, to be honest, not all subscribers will like it.  Indeed, the same MTS has more humane and interesting offers.  Nevertheless, one has to put up with a huge number of restrictions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, as already mentioned, you cannot search for <span>subscribers who are not</span> connected to Tele2.  It is also impossible to find on the map people who are in roaming or generally outside of your region. </p>

    <p>  Please note that the Geopoisk service is not free.  You will have to pay 2 rubles per day for it.  Plus, the traffic during the display of the map and location is also paid.  But already according to your tariff plan.  Now Tele2 wants to connect the ability to work with Geopoisk without charging traffic. </p><p>  But there are also positive aspects of working with this service.  For example, only those who are looking for people pay a monthly fee.  And "Geopoisk" provides the ability to determine your personal location.  That is, you are able to find yourself on the map.  This is a convenient feature when you lose your phone or steal it. </p><h2>  Calls </h2><p>  Well, we decided to connect Tele2 to Geopoisk.  How to use this service?  For this, as already mentioned, you will first have to activate the proposed feature.  The idea is implemented quite easily and simply.  For example, by calling your operator. </p>

    <p>  Dial 611 on the phone and wait for a response.  Next, let us know that you would like to connect Geopoisk to your phone.  Give your personal data (usually limited to first and last name), the number with which you will work, and wait.  The operator will inform that the application for work with the service has been completed.  In response, you will receive a special confirmation code.  It will be necessary to call the operator.  That's all, now you can use the "Geopoisk" service "Tele2".  How to find the location of the subscriber?  More about this later.  To begin with, we will study all connection methods. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Help requests </h2><p>  You can resort to a USSD request.  Perhaps this option attracts subscribers the most.  Many note that such commands are very convenient.  They help to independently resolve the issue of disconnecting / connecting certain services. </p><p>  To enable Geopoisk, you need to dial * 119 * 01 # on your smartphone.  Now click on the call button.  You will receive a message about the processing of the request.  After a while, the result of the operation appears.  That's all, the problems are solved.  Please note that this service is free.  Unless you can immediately charge a monthly fee for the day.  The amount of payment is not very large, so subscribers practically do not attach any importance to this. </p><h2>  Add numbers </h2><p>  So we hooked up the Geopoisk Tele2.  How to use the program?  You will have to start work by adding numbers to search.  Without this, you cannot bring an idea to life. </p><p>  Here, the consent of the second subscriber to work with Geopoisk is necessary.  Lack of confirmation of the operation will not allow you to search for a person.  This factor upsets some subscribers.  Especially those who want to quietly monitor their loved ones.  But all operators have similar restrictions. </p>

    <p>  How to use the Geopoisk service?  To add a number to the list of approved, dial * 119 * 1 * 7XXXXXXX #, where XXXXXXX is the subscriber‚Äôs phone, without 8 or +7.  Send a request and wait.  In response, your friend will receive a notification that they want to add him to be able to search on the map.  Confirmation of the action takes place by sending a special code to the number indicated in the message.  You will only see that the subscriber has given his consent. </p><p>  The same process must be carried out with all numbers.  By the way, subscribers note that "GeoSearch" "Tele2" has a very interesting and simple navigation, which is carried out by means of a USSD request.  This will be discussed in more detail below. </p><h2>  Navigation </h2><p>  How to use the "Geopoisk" service "Tele2"?  We have already learned how to add numbers, now you should pay attention to all other functions.  Indeed, without them, working with the program is simply impossible. </p><p>  To search for a particular subscriber, dial * 119 * 2 * 7XXXXXXX #.  Here XXXXXXX is the person‚Äôs phone number.  Everything is exactly the same as in the past case. </p>

    <p>  A list of all numbers available among the connected can be viewed by dialing * 119 * 3 #.  If you need to find a specific phone, enter * 119 * 3 * x * 1 #.  Here x is the number assigned to this or that user.  Deleting a specific number is carried out using a similar function, but 1 must be replaced by 2. If you want to get rid of a specific subscriber, use the combination * 119 * 4 * 7XXXXXXX #.  The card is cleared using the command * 119 * 0 #.  In principle, this is all that is needed for comfortable work with people search. </p><h2>  General opinions </h2><p>  What, in general, do Tele2 subscribers think about Geopoisk?  In truth, many are satisfied with this service.  Yes, it is not as convenient as that of MTS, but it works efficiently and accurately.  Some errors in determining your position may be, but not more than 15 meters on the map.  Such conditions are available on all locators. </p><p>  ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù subscribers are very disappointed with the fact that you can only search for those comrades who are connected to this mobile operator.  And when located outside the home region, Geopoisk cannot be applied.  All this is not able to force to abandon the implementation of the services of the Tele2 locator.  This feature is disabled, by the way, using the combination * 119 * 00 #.  From now on, we know everything related to the service "Geopoisk" ("Tele2").  How to use, connect and refuse work was considered as part of this review.  Now you can start the search at any time and enjoy the results. </p>
