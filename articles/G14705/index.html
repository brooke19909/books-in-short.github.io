  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rest in Karelia on the Great Lip</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  You can relax beautifully not only in foreign resorts, and the Great Guba of the Republic of Karelia is an excellent proof of this.  <span>Holidays in Karelia</span> will be appreciated by those who prefer silence and virgin nature to sultry and noisy cities, and fishing or a leisurely walk to discotheques or active shopping.  But you should not think that it is boring to relax in Karelia, because this is a place where both inveterate fishermen and hunters, as well as athletes or just ordinary people feel equally good. </p><h2>  Climatic features of the Republic of Karelia </h2><p>  <span>The climate of Karelia is</span> very mild.  It is not too hot or too cold here.  At any time of the year due to the abundance of precipitation, high humidity prevails.  The weather is very variable and can vary several times a day.  Winter in Karelia is very snowy, which also contributes to the influx of tourists who are fond of skiing or winter hunting. </p><h2>  Sights of the Great Lip </h2><p>  Karelia is a wonderful land, very rich in natural beauty and attractions.  Many who have been here at least once cannot forget this fabulous place and are eager to come here again.  If you decide to relax in Karelia, then you just need to visit these fabulous places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russianambience.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Karelia" class="if uuid-2653041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2653041.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Kizhi.  The open-air museum "Kizhi" is located on the island of Kizhi of the same name on the Great Guba.  On its territory there are more than 80 objects of wooden architecture.  Especially popular among them is the 22-head church. </li><li>  Slovak monastery.  This ancient building was erected in the 15th century.  It survived many wars, but still retained its former greatness.  Now it is attributed not only to the 7 wonders of Russia, but also to UNESCO sites. </li><li>  Ruskeala Park.  This tourist complex was created on the site of a former quarry for the extraction of marble.  The quarry eventually filled with groundwater, and coniferous and deciduous trees grow on its shore.  The size of the park is 460 per 100 meters. </li><li>  The Valaam Monastery was built on the site where Andrew the First-Called erected a stone cross during his trip to Russia.  This once-Russian monastery at this time went under the care of the Church of Finland. </li><li>  <span>Ruskeala waterfalls.</span>  These waterfalls are a favorite place for tourists who are fond of rafting, but those who are not interested in this sport will certainly appreciate the miraculous beauty of this area. </li><li>  The National Museum was founded in the 19th century and is still very popular among tourists.  In the museum one can see not only painting, but also household items of the peoples of Karelia. </li><li>  Kivach waterfall is perhaps the most picturesque place in the Republic of Karelia.  The waterfall appeared on a rock, at the confluence of two rivers - the Suna and Shui, and its height is about 10-15 meters. </li><li>  "Paanaj√§rvi" is a relatively young park, but loved by many tourists.  The park has a large number of tall mountains and the lake of the same name Paanaj√§rvi. </li><li>  Vodlozersky park.  This park belongs to the conservation area.  Its area exceeds 450 thousand ha.  Vodlozersky park is not all open for visiting, but only a small part of it (about 50 thousand ha), the conservation area is closed for visiting. </li></ol><h2>  Activities in the Great Guba </h2><p>  Tourists come to Karelia not only for cultural enrichment, this paradise is perfect for fishing and hunting.  However, it is worth remembering that many species of fish and <span>animals of Karelia</span> are listed in the Red Book, and their capture is severely punishable by law. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.kareliancountrycottages.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fishing in Karelia" class="if uuid-2661998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2661998.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to fishing and hunting, in Karelia you can swim in crystal clear lakes, go swimming in boats, go horseback riding, skiing and dog sledding. </p><h2>  Hotels and hotel complexes </h2><p>  <span>It is a mistake to believe that budget holidays and comfort are incompatible concepts.</span>  <span>Choosing tours in Karelia, you will surely be convinced of this, because only in this republic you can find comfortable hotel complexes for a quite budget price.</span>  <span>The following hotels are considered the most popular among both locals and tourists:</span> </p><ul><li>  <span>"Ladoga";</span> </li><li>  <span>"Gull";</span> </li><li>  <span>"Tourist Inn";</span> </li><li>  <span>Hotel "Gandvik";</span> </li><li>  <span>Petrozavodsk</span> </li><li>  <span>Hotel "Prival";</span> </li><li>  <span>mini-hotel "Ilma";</span> </li><li>  <span>club hotel "Prionezhsky";</span> </li><li>  <span>guest house "Margarita" (Velika Guba).</span> </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.saint-petersburg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel in Karelia" class="if uuid-2651930" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19607/2651930.jpg"></div><p>  <span>All of the above hotel complexes are equipped with everything necessary.</span>  <span>Each hotel has its own restaurant or cafe, wi-fi, pool, parking.</span>  <span>The rooms are equipped with everything you need, there is a microwave, electric kettle, iron and hairdryer, which is an additional plus in favor of service.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What can be brought from Karelia </h2><p>  Perhaps the most interesting and pleasant pastime on vacation is a shopping trip.  Shopping in Karelia will not be an exception.  You should definitely visit the local souvenir shops or the market to purchase souvenirs created by local craftsmen and needlewomen.  The products of local craftsmen are very appreciated among tourists, but the following products are most popular among them: </p><ul><li>  Zaonezhskaya embroidery (tablecloths, rushnyks, napkins); </li><li>  Shungite souvenirs; </li><li>  products from Karelian birch (caskets, snuff boxes, candlesticks, carved kitchen boards); </li><li>  gifts of nature (fish, mushrooms, berries). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="nosviatores.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Souvenirs of Karelia" class="if uuid-2650670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2650670.jpg"></div><h2>  Area Guide </h2><p>  If you decide not to buy a tour of Karelia, but go there on your own, then it is more advisable to purchase a detailed map of the area or a guide so that the whole vacation does not go in search of the desired object. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="62.2485885" data-lng="35.073229699999956" data-type="terrain" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/7/7/2/5772.png"></div><p>  You can get to Karelia both by bus, train, and by car.  The road to Karelia is in very good condition, so getting to the desired destination is not difficult. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.phone.k2000.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Road Karelia" class="if uuid-2650696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2650696.jpg"></div><p>  But to get to the Great Guba from the Medvezhyegorsk district, you need to drive about 240 km, and the road in this area is already far from ideal, so you need to go here without rushing, at medium speed. </p>
