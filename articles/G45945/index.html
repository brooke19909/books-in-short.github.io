    <h2>  Unknown Elder </h2><p>  Less than a year before the October Revolution, the prot√©g√© of the royal family was killed, their confessor and healer - Rasputin.  The facts of his death make everyone think about his life.  But the life of the old man was completely unusual. </p><p>  A man known by this name was born in the village of Pokrovskoye in the Tyumen province.  The exact year of the birth of Rasputin is unknown, since different sources give different dates.  His parents were peasants and bore the name of the New.  Why did Gregory change her?  Yes, because in the village he was known as a participant in orgies and drunken fights.  He was remembered as an unpleasant person with a <span>piercing gaze,</span> nervous movements and sloppy clothes.  The villagers paid attention to his prayers with like-minded people over the iron tripod with sacrifice, jumping over fire and fornication. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Rasputin Gregory, interesting facts about which are studied to this day, was ill a lot in childhood.  And he gained faith in God after a pilgrimage to the <span>Verkhotursky monastery.</span>  Then he made a trip to Mount Athos in Greece, to Jerusalem, made a trip to the holy places of Russia.  He married the peasant Praskovye, who bore him a son and two daughters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rasputin facts" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/558922.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  Sex and prayer </h2><p>  According to some sources, Rasputin was very strange.  Facts are a stubborn thing.  Among the admirers of the old man were many secular ladies who were ready to go to him in remote Siberia.  Gregory himself urged the ladies to have sexual intercourse with him, explaining that in this way they cleanse themselves of sins by giving them to him.  And he carried out the cleansing of his own sins with the help of repentance, because if a person does not stumble, he does not need to repent.  And without repentance, you will not get closer to God.  He prayed for hours in front of the icons, smashed his forehead, killed his flesh, and then again led a wild life. </p><h2>  Relationship with the Royal Family </h2><p>  Newspapers of that time were literally filled with tales of revelry, but the royal court considered him a saint and helped him in everything.  The favorite of the Empress Alexandra Fedorovna was Rasputin.  Interesting facts from the biography insist that only she trusted her children and the sick heir to the throne.  She explained the antics of the elder with the rumor of ill-wishers and called him a friend and God's messenger.  They also consulted with him about appointing someone to important posts.  There were rumors that there was a connection between the empress and Gregory, which the emperor was not at all happy about.  Probably, with his blessing, a conspiracy against the holy swindler took place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rasputin Gregory interesting prediction facts" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/558923.jpg" width="369"></div>

He invited Gregory to dinner, during which the elder was served food stuffed with <span>potassium cyanide.</span>  But surprisingly, the poison did not affect the guest.  Then they shot Rasputin, but although the wound was severe, he did not die.  The elder tried to run away, but a bullet point-blank knocked him down.  The conspirators pounced on and tied Gregory, stuffed into a bag and threw into the river.  Then an autopsy will show that he was still alive and even untied the ropes.  But he could not get out of the bag. </p><p>  The body of the contradictory old man was buried in a park in Tsarskoye Selo, but was removed from the earth after the February Revolution.  They wanted to burn him, but in the fire the corpse took a sitting position, which even more frightened those present. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting facts about rasputin" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/558925.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Gregory the Prophet </h2><p>  Rasputin Gregory owned many abilities.  Interesting facts: the predictions made by him came true!  They say that the elder knew about the future death of the royal family, about the revolution and the change of order, about the thousands of dead aristocrats.  He predicted that on a certain day after his death, Tsarevich Alexei would become very ill, and, surprisingly, everything came true.  He foresaw his death and the fate of the Russian crown, as well as accidents at nuclear plants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rasputin interesting facts from life" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/558926.jpg" width="372"></div>

    <p>  He also talked about terrible disasters, earthquakes, the decline of morality, the <span>cloning of people</span> and the dangers of these experiments, predicted a third world war, worse than the first two, and the world after that.  But this world is scorched by the blood of millions of innocents.  I would very much like that these predictions of Rasputin never come true. </p><h2>  Rasputin Gregory: interesting facts from a biography </h2><p>  Needless to say, he was an outstanding person.  But in addition to acting talent, he still had remarkable abilities.  Perhaps he mastered the art of hypnosis, was a medium.  The only surviving daughter of Gregory, Matryona, then recalled that his father drank a lot of alcohol, had connections with different women.  But since her husband was B.N.  Solovyov, a member of the Masonic lodge, then she could well hide the truth.  At the same time, she spoke very gently about her father, admitted that she loved him and still loves him.  Her book, Rasputin., Was repeatedly reprinted in Russia.  Why?". </p><p>  The blackening of the tsar‚Äôs confessor and his close associates was beneficial to the Soviet regime.  There is a version that the Bolsheviks, who then enjoyed increasing popularity, could have had a hand in the death of Gregory.  After all, they feared him no less than they hated some and loved others. </p><p>  Interesting facts about Rasputin: having taken a large dose of poison along with food on that fateful evening and drinking it with wine (which should enhance the effect of potassium cyanide), the holy elder did not die.  Perhaps the poison became harmless from sugar, which was sprinkled with cookies, or maybe it was stored incorrectly, so it lost its strength.  But he knew about his quick demise, since a note was found in the pocket of his sheepskin coat saying that he could be killed by peasants, then nothing threatens the monarchy in the country.  But if aristocrats shed his blood, the emperor‚Äôs family would not survive and the monarchy would fall. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rasputin interesting facts from the biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/558924.jpg" width="408"></div>

    <p>  After himself, Grigory Rasputin, whose interesting facts from the life we ‚Äã‚Äãare studying, left two books and many predictions.  They were recorded from his words, since the elder himself was illiterate. </p><p>  The murderers of Gregory escaped severe punishment.  This suggests that the conspirators acted with the permission of the emperor.  Yusupov was sent to his father‚Äôs estate in the Kursk province, and Dmitry Pavlovich was transferred to Persia. </p><p>  After the February Revolution, it became known that the abbess of the monasteries came to Princess Elizabeth Fedorovna several days after the death of Rasputin.  They said that on the night of the murder of the holy elder, incredible things happened in the cloisters.  Brothers and sisters experienced bouts of madness, emitted wild cries, blasphemed during the service. </p><p>  So who is Rasputin - a saint, a prophet or a swindler?  The question remains open. </p>
