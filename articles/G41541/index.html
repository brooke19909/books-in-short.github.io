What does an IBAN bank number mean?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If at least once in your life you had to make money transfers to European countries, then the concept of ‚ÄúIBAN code‚Äù is familiar to you.  It must be called by the sender to complete the transfer.  To find out the IBAN number, just go to any banking institution and open a current account.  Employees of some financial institutions may recommend a SWIFT code to the sender, with which you can also receive a transfer.  Then why is there a need for IBAN?  What is it?  And why is it not available at all banks? </p>

    <h2>  Basic information </h2><p>  We have determined above that an IBAN is required to complete an <span>international money transfer</span> .  What is it - let's find out.  This code is the international current account number of an individual customer.  It is drawn up in accordance with international standards for assigning numbers to accounts for EU countries and some other states. </p><p>  Since 2007, this code has become the unique official identifier of the beneficiary's account through which operations are carried out to transfer funds to bank customers located in the economic <span>zone of the European</span> Union in any currency.  Over time, other countries began to use it.  Now the number of countries using the code has grown to 62. But in the Russian Federation, such a standard for an account does not exist in the banking system, which is why banks refuse to issue it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  For Russian citizens, an IBAN account number may be required when making a money transfer to EU countries with crediting to the recipient's current account.  Information regarding the code is provided by the recipient himself, having previously asked his bank about it. </p><p>  Since 2007, banks have the right not to conduct money transfer operations if account numbers are not in IBAN format.  But this rule applies only to cases when the transfer is made in foreign currency, and only to the benefit of a person served by a bank in the EU and EEC countries.  Accordingly, by sending money, for example, to France without specifying an IBAN code, the sender will receive it back due to a refusal by the bank.  The money will not be returned in full, as the bank will withhold the amount equal to the return commission. </p><h2>  Code structure </h2><p>  Each letter and number in IBAN carries a specific meaning.  What does this mean, consider in more detail: </p>

    <h2>  Use of IBAN number by banking institutions of the Russian Federation </h2><p>  Transfers in favor of a citizen of the Russian Federation are made without an indication of IBAN.  To do this, just specify the SWIFT code. </p><p>  An IBAN account should be indicated only for external transfers from a current account opened with a bank of the Russian Federation.  And it is needed only if the payment goes to the address of a bank located in the EU and EEA or in other countries that have also begun to apply this standard of accounts. </p><h2>  What identifier is used for transfers from EU countries to the accounts of Russian banks </h2><p>  We wrote above that if funds are transferred from the EU and EEA countries to Russian accounts, then the IBAN is not indicated in the payment order.  What does it mean?  This means that the sender just needs to indicate in the document that the transfer is not carried out in the EU, but outside it. </p><p>  When sending money from Europe to the accounts of Russian banks, it is required to issue a payment order for external banking operations.  In this case, the following kind of information should be present there: </p><ul><li>  SWIFT code owned by the beneficiary bank; </li><li>  settlement account of the client of the recipient bank. </li></ul><h2>  How to find out the details for international cash transactions? </h2><ol><li>  Information on the necessary details, which are indicated in the payment documents when conducting international transfers, are on the official websites of banking institutions. </li><li>  If you have an account opened with a banking institution in another country that has the right to establish IBAN, for example, in Privatbank, you can find out information about the code in one of the following ways: by contacting a bank branch via the Internet banking system, or by calling the ‚Äúhot line‚Äù . </li><li>  In the banking system there is such a thing as an intermediary bank.  Its services can be used by banking institutions that are not able to directly perform international banking operations.  For example, Alfa Bank has signed an agreement with three financial institutions in Germany so that its customers have the opportunity to transfer funds to this state.  How exactly to make an international transfer, the bank staff will tell you. </li></ol><h2>  International payments with Sberbank </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is iban bank" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32473/777479.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  To make international payments from any of the countries (including the EU and EEA countries) through Sberbank, the following information must be present in the payment order: </p><ul><li>  name of the beneficiary bank; </li><li>  location of the branch that services the account; </li><li>  full name of the account holder; </li><li>  his passport details, TIN and checkpoint numbers; </li><li>  BIC, correspondent account and bank account of the recipient bank. </li></ul><p>  Perhaps additional details will be required, they can be found on the official website of the bank.  Sberbank‚Äôs IBAN is not listed there, but only because it does not exist in nature yet.  For international transfers, Sberbank uses only a SWIFT code, it must be called the sender of funds.  Units located in different regions have a different SWIFT code.  Information that is suitable for you can be found on the bank's website. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  Having studied all the information, it became clear <span>what is an IBAN</span> bank, and its function in the banking system.  Such a unified account standard can make processing of payments made by the banks of the EU and EEA and reduce the number of errors when specifying details, as the sending bank can verify the correctness of the indicated account number before making the payment. </p>
