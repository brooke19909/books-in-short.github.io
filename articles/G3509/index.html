You can choose for yourself numbers from the following list: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Superior room is a room reminiscent of a standard room, but the living conditions in it are somewhat improved.  This is achieved by increasing the living space, as well as adding some pieces of furniture. </li><li>  Superior Deluxe is a room that is almost similar to the previous one in terms of area, equipment and design solutions.  The status upgrade is due to the fact that the windows of these apartments are located on the sea side. </li><li>  Family rooms are designed to receive at least four guests, and therefore consist of two rooms (bedrooms).  An additional condition for comfort are two separate bathrooms. </li><li>  Family Deluxe has earned an elevated status due to the fact that from its windows a bewitching seascape opens. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Review of Caribbean World Soma Bay 5 * hotel in Egypt </h2><p>  The following comments can be found about this hotel complex, reflecting the positive impressions of tourists: </p><ul><li>  one of the most favorable price offers among five-star hotels; </li><li>  during registration, reception staff takes into account all the wishes of the guests regarding the accommodation; </li><li>  a pleasant moment is a plate of fruit upon arrival; </li><li>  a lot of greenery in the territory; </li><li>  nice clean beach with lots of sunbeds; </li><li>  good varied and satisfying menu (there are also enough dishes for children); </li><li>  live instrumental music in an Italian restaurant; </li><li>  good fun animation, which, however, is not imposed on those who do not want to take part in entertainment; </li><li>  For children, a fun disco is provided, as well as a movie theater with cartoons. </li></ul><h2>  Additional comments </h2><p>  The vast majority of tourists were very pleased with their stay at Carribean Hotel Soma Bay 5 *.  Guest reviews, however, contain an indication of a number of points that did not suit them very much: </p><ul><li>  the territory is a bit cramped due to the dense development of its buildings; </li><li>  key cards from numbers do not work periodically, and you have to call the wizard; </li><li>  too many spices and spices in food; </li><li>  queues and lack of seats in the dining room, as in fact the guests of two hotels ate there; </li><li>  too expensive wi-fi, which is not very high quality and speed (besides, in most five-star hotels it is completely free of charge). </li></ul>
