  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is it necessary to install a fire alarm?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When the number of household appliances increases in our house, apartment or other residential building, the likelihood of a fire due to a fault in the wiring or household appliances increases.  Ignition is also possible due to an increase in the load on the electric network, poor-quality connections and contacts.  Also, in some cases, registered cases of fires from a cigarette butt, which unscrupulous citizens throw from their balconies.  There are enough examples. </p><p>  At any enterprise, organization and preferably privately owned should be installed <noindex>  <span>fire alarm Price</span> </noindex>  , which consists of control panels, sensors and sirens, widely represented in the reliable online store GRION.  Qualified specialists of the company will help with the selection of equipment and installation, will take into account the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room and the technical parameters of security systems.  By installing it, you will protect your business and home.  Firstly, in case of fire, assistance will be provided during.  Secondly, your office or apartment will be under reliable protection from intruders from outside.  You can install these systems separately from each other, but by installing them together and tied on one control panel, such a system becomes much more efficient. <br>  To prevent a fire, the first 10-20 minutes from the start of a fire are important, if the Ministry of Emergency Situations has time to start an action to eliminate it by this time, the consequences and destruction will be minimal.  In order to provide timely notification, it is necessary to install a fire alarm.  In this regard, the law adopted a law on the installation of alarms in all production facilities, companies and other premises, without exception.  Enterprises that have not installed a fire alarm will not receive permission to conduct business. <br>  It consists of a computer to which the control panel, devices with touch sensors, actuators with relays and switches and warning devices that transmit a signal to the main computer of the dispatcher of the Ministry of Emergency Situations are programmed. <br>  Today, a fire alarm can be installed in apartments, houses and cottages.  By doing this, you increase the security of your estates and neighbors living nearby.  Installation of the system should be carried out by special firms with appropriate permits in their hands.  If you install privately, then you will have difficulty connecting to the main computer of the dispatcher of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, in which case the alarm will not be effective.  Before installing a fire alarm, make sure the competence of the company offering its services and whether it has a license to carry out work. </p></div></article>
