    <h2>  "Flamingo" (hotel 3 *, Adler) - reviews, shortcomings </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the opinion of travelers allows you to make the most objective opinion about the hotel.  Not only positive, but also negative impressions are caused by the Flamingo Hotel (Adler).  reviews of tourists note the following disadvantages of this institution: </p><ul><li>  the mattresses on the beds are already quite old and squeezed, and the springs painfully stick into the back; </li><li>  there is very good audibility between the apartments, and also noise from the street and corridors will interfere with you; </li><li>  due to the fact that the old building has common balconies, it‚Äôs rather uncomfortable to sleep with the door open; </li><li>  most rooms do not have a safe; </li><li>  the standard rooms have very old TVs, and the image quality in them is just disgusting; </li><li>  in most apartments there are no electric kettles (although you can borrow it from a maid for temporary use); </li><li>  quite often in the rooms they lay old gray linen with holes and spots; </li><li>  maids quite often forget to put clean towels instead of those that were taken into the wash; </li><li>  construction is underway near the hotel, and therefore instead of clean air and sea breeze you get dust and noise; </li><li>  daily cleaning is carried out only the first time after checking into the hotel, and then you have to personally ask the maids; </li><li>  some apartments do not have chairs on the balcony; </li><li>  since there is no elevator or ramp, it is very difficult to carry suitcases to the upper floors. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Many tourists choose Flamingos for their vacation (3 * hotel, Russia, Sochi, Adler).  This is mainly due to two reasons.  The first is a rather low price for accommodation under fairly comfortable conditions.  And the second reason is the incredibly advantageous location almost on the seashore.  In addition, for little money you can get high-quality and very tasty food here, almost at home.  It is important to have a good transport interchange, which will save you from having to spend money on a taxi to get to the place you need. </p><p>  Of the negative points, it is worth noting that the furniture and appliances in the apartments are quite old (especially for standard rooms).  The biggest problem is old mattresses with barbed springs.  In addition, guests do not like the fact that in building ‚ÄúB‚Äù there are no partitions between balconies, which makes it impossible to feel privacy and security.  In general, the Flamingo Hotel is a pretty good option for a budget sea holiday.  Here you can enjoy the clean beach, as well as incredibly beautiful views from the window.  Also, you can always have a tasty and satisfying meal in the cozy dining room. </p>
