Specifications and Specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As part of this review, a detailed and phased comparison of 6s and 6s Plus will be carried out.  These two models of smartphones were introduced in 2015.  At the start of sales, they provided an uncompromisingly high level of performance.  These models of mobile devices still receive software updates and are current devices.  It is their comparison that will be carried out in the material brought to your attention. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.quora.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Comparison of 6s and 6s Plus cameras." class="if uuid-3046727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3046727.jpg"></div><h2>  Delivery list </h2><p>  <span>A comparison of the 6s and 6s</span> Plus in terms of configuration indicates that the two models are identical.  Their delivery list includes the following: </p><ol><li>  Smartphone. </li><li>  Charger. </li><li>  Paper-based quick start guide. </li><li>  Stereo headset with high sound quality. </li><li>  Warranty card. </li><li>  A clip for removing the SIM card tray. </li></ol><p>  In the new state, this smartphone is impossible to buy.  But you can purchase a fully restored such a gadget.  Moreover, from the old device, only the motherboard remains, which undergoes comprehensive testing and a detailed performance check.  All other elements of the device at the recovery stage are replaced with new ones. </p><h2>  Hardware specifications </h2><p>  A comparison of 6s and 6s Plus from the point of view of the microprocessor devices used indicates that they are based on the same semiconductor chip - A9.  This is Apple's own development.  This chip includes two Twister compute modules.  Moreover, each of them works in nominal mode at a frequency of 1.8 GHz. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It also supports 64-bit computing and even now has a sufficient level of performance.  It has low power consumption.  Therefore, the autonomy of devices is beyond praise.  Also, the chip was manufactured according to the technological process with tolerance standards of 14 nm.  According to this indicator, it is practically not inferior to modern advanced devices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple iPhone 6s Plus" class="if uuid-3046734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3046734.jpg"></div><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The first significant innovation of these two models is the increase in RAM.  All previous iPhone series devices were equipped with 1 GB.  The heroes of this review were compulsorily equipped with 2 GB of RAM. </p><p>  Also, the changes affected the built-in drive.  Prior to this, such devices were equipped with 16 GB or 64 GB.  But in this series of mobile devices, it became possible to purchase a smartphone with 128 GB. </p><p>  But to install an additional memory card in this case is impossible.  The corresponding slot in this gadget does not exist.  Therefore, when choosing a smartphone, you must consider and buy a mobile device with the appropriate capacity of the built-in drive. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Comparison of the characteristics of the 6s and 6s Plus in terms of touch screens indicates that the last device has a diagonal of 0.8 ‚Äùlarger.  For the younger model of mobile phone, this parameter is 4.7 ", and for the older - 5.5".  Of course, on a device with a larger diagonal it is difficult to work with one hand, but at the same time watching movies becomes more comfortable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The screen resolution in 6s is 1334 x 750, and in 6s Plus - 1920 x 1080. Both the first and second cases use the IPS matrix.  Therefore, the image quality on the screen is really beyond praise.  At the same time, the pixel density is sufficient, and the picture will not be grainy.  That is, it is very, very comfortable to work on such a smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iphonehacks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Compare Apple 6s and 6s Plus" class="if uuid-3046736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3046736.jpg"></div><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  One of the main differences between these smartphone models is the main camera 6s and 6s Plus.  A comparison of their technical characteristics indicates that in the second case there is an optical stabilization system.  But in the younger model, this technology is not implemented.  Therefore, nominally, the quality of photos in a 6s Plus smartphone will be better.  Otherwise, the main cameras are identical.  They are based on a 12 megapixel sensor.  Also for shooting in the dark, the device is equipped with a double LED backlight. </p><p>  The front camera is based on a 5 megapixel sensor.  It allows not only to make telephone calls, but also to make very high-quality selfies. </p><h2>  Autonomy of the device.  Battery </h2><p>  The most advanced gadget is equipped with a 2750 mAh battery.  In the younger device of this line, it is 1810 mAh.  Both in the first and in the second case, the indicated capacity is enough for such a device to work for 24 hours with one battery charge, but with the most intensive use.  If the load is minimized, then you can already count on 2-3 days of battery life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Comparison of the characteristics of 6s and 6s Plus" class="if uuid-3046739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3046739.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  A comparison of the Apple 6s and 6s Plus in terms of cost indicates that the second device has a higher cost.  After the recovery, the younger device can now be purchased for 15,000 rubles as standard with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage.  In turn, the flagship with the same technical parameters is estimated at 21,000 rubles.  Is it worth it to overpay for a large diagonal and improved quality of photos, everyone should decide for himself.  There are no more significant differences between these gadget models. </p><h2>  Owners opinion </h2><p>  Of course, on the <span>Apple iPhone 6s</span> Plus it‚Äôs much more convenient and comfortable to watch videos.  If a smartphone is mostly bought for these purposes, then it is better to purchase a flagship.  It is also justifiable to acquire such a device to obtain high-quality photos.  Another reasonable argument for buying this modification of the smartphone is the convenience of working on a large screen.  In all other cases, there is no difference between these devices, and this is exactly what the experts and owners focus on in most cases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thenextweb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Comparison of 6s and 6s Plus" class="if uuid-3046740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3046740.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  A detailed comparison of 6s and 6s Plus was made in this material.  The differences between these smartphones are minimal.  Therefore, the choice of device should be determined based on the personal preferences of the potential owner. </p>
