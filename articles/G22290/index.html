    <h2>  Tourists on vacation </h2><p>  People who visited Ivana Palace 4 * (Sunny Beach) are happy to share their impressions.  The vast majority of holidaymakers make the choice in favor of this particular hotel because of its declared "star rating", other good reviews and more than reasonable prices. </p><p>  Especially good here in the last weeks of the season - at the end of September.  It is advisable to pay half board, as many cafes, bars and restaurants are closed.  After all, tourists are becoming less and less every day at the resort.  And this is for lovers of a relaxing holiday, because in September in Sunny Beach a peaceful atmosphere sets in.  And the hotel is not relocated. </p><p>  Many people note the excellent knowledge of the Russian language by the staff.  And besides, employees speak German and English with dignity, as people who have the opportunity to assess their knowledge of these skills say.  By the way, not only local channels are broadcast on TV.  You can find Russian and German.  However, it is unlikely that someone, while on vacation, actively watches television. </p><p>  The rooms are simple, good, but with a rather weak soundproofing.  If even at the height of the season you want to be in silence, you need to ask for apartments in the depths of the corridor.  The rooms there are really no noise. </p>

    <h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  In general, about the rest in Ivana Palace 4 * reviews leave mostly positive.  The apartments are cleaned daily and honestly.  The maids are very tactful and polite - they always tidy up the rooms when guests relax on the beach or have breakfast.  All the little things, like a safe and a refrigerator in the apartments, are free, and not like in many other hotels.  In the rooms themselves, everything is thought out to the smallest detail - there is even a socket for an electric shaver.  And on the balcony there is a table with chairs, an ashtray and even a clothes dryer. </p><p>  And the pool is not only large, but also clean.  His condition is constantly monitored here, and the smell of bleach is not at all felt.  The depth, of course, is not very large - about one and a half meters.  But the descent to it is convenient.  In general, to freshen up - that's it. </p><p>  Tourists are advised to take beach towels with them on vacation, as they are not issued at the hotel.  There are sun loungers near the sea, but paid.  If you do not want to splurge, you can throw a towel - the beach is clean, so it's nice to lie on the sand.  There are jellyfish and algae in the sea, but in August.  This should not be surprising.  After all, the sea is Black, and this is its characteristic feature. </p><p>  In general, if you want to relax on a budget in a good place, you can go here.  Many people were satisfied and even decided to return to Ivana Palace. </p>
