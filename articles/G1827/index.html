Some of them are widely known, such as, for example, Anapa or Sochi, but there are those about which much less is known, such as, for example, Yeisk.  And in vain, because this is a great resort. </p><h2>  Yeisk </h2><p>  The city of Yeysk is located on the coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov and is one of the five largest resort cities in the country.  There is a lot of entertainment and great weather reigns almost always, and local beaches are perfect for families with children.  The sea here has a very small angle, so you can not worry about the children.  Moreover, let‚Äôs say right away that this city is closer to the capital than the rest, therefore, travel will cost cheaper than to other cities. </p>

    <h2>  Why is it convenient to travel from Moscow? </h2><p>  Basically, all tourists, no matter where they are, first get to Moscow, and only then go to the desired resort.  The situation is exactly the same with Yeysk - it will be more convenient to travel the Moscow-Yeysk route than to travel from other cities. </p><p>  This is due to the fact that when leaving from the capital, tourists have many options for transport, and you can choose the most suitable.  From Moscow, you can easily reach Yeysk by train, bus, car, and even partially by plane. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, if you consider trains or buses, you can even choose the most suitable departure time. </p><h2>  A train </h2><p>  If we talk about <span>the Moscow-Yeysk train,</span> then it is only one, and goes only in the summer months.  Train No. 231 leaves daily at 00:15 from the Kursk station, and arrives at its destination at 5:25 in the morning.  Total travel time takes 29 hours 16 minutes.  Returning tourists takes the composition of No. 232C with departure at 08.48 and arrival at 14:19.  The distance Moscow-Yeysk when traveling by train is 1480 km.  According to Russian Railways, all cars are equipped with air conditioners that maintain normal temperatures. </p><p>  The route of the Moscow-Yeysk train passes through 25 stations on its way.  However, so that the train does not linger for a long time, almost all stops are small.  Only in large cities are longer stops.  These cities: Tula, Yelets, Rossosh, Likhaya, Sulin, Rostov. </p><p>  Moreover, there are a huge number of trains that go to the Starominskaya station, which is 70 km from Yeysk.  Almost all trains heading south travel past Moscow and this station, so that, in principle, the train can be reached without problems.  This is very convenient, because it allows you to select the desired date and time of departure and arrival.  From Starominskaya to Yeysk it is already possible to get by train, bus or taxi.  Note that regular buses run almost every hour, so there will be no problems.  A bus ticket will cost about 100 rubles, so this option is quite acceptable. </p>

    <h2>  The car </h2><p>  Why not take the Moscow-Yeysk route by car?  This is not very convenient, but you can always stop and stretch your legs.  A trip by car can come out even cheaper than by train. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you decide to go the Moscow-Yeysk route by car, then the distance is about 1250 km.  If you go without stopping, as the road website calculates, then it‚Äôs about 18 hours.  However, in reality, travel usually occurs with stops and takes 2-3 days. </p><p>  <span>Traveling by car</span> goes along the M4 motorway, if you wish, you can find out more information about it on the Internet.  If you look at the entire route on the map, it turns out that it passes through 55 settlements, but in reality there will be only one big city - Voronezh, which you can pass by if you wish.  Nevertheless, do not worry about cafes or hotels - there are always a lot of them near the tracks, and you can find places with a low price. </p><p>  When traveling by private car, it should be borne in mind that the closer you get to the sea, the more traffic police officers appear on the roads.  It should also be taken into account that during the season the roads are heavily loaded, and traffic is carried out at minimum speeds due to traffic jams.  The roads at the entrance to the sea are narrow, and overtaking is prohibited, so you will need to be patient. </p>

    <h2>  Bus </h2><p>  Another way to overcome the Moscow-Yeysk route.  The distance when traveling by bus can be overcome in 18-20 hours.  The bus leaves from the Kazan station.  Since the road is distant, it is mainly tourist buses, i.e.  with all amenities - air conditioning and TVs.  Do not be alarmed if you see a tourist class minibus instead of a bus - when there are not many people, maybe it is.  For convenience, a minibus is as convenient as a bus.  Also along the way, several stops are made where you can walk and have a bite to eat. </p>

    <h2>  Airplane </h2><p>  There is another option for <span>the Moscow-Yeysk route.</span>  The aircraft, however, unfortunately, does not land in Yeysk itself in connection with the repair of the runway, which began in 2013, and, we hope, will be completed soon.  If the plane is preferable for you, then you can fly to Rostov-on-Don or Krasnodar.  Note that flights in this direction are carried out by many airlines. </p><p>  <span>Yeysk</span> is located at a distance of 180 km from <span>Rostov-on-Don</span> , and 230 km from Krasnodar.  Even if you get from these cities by bus or car, the whole trip will take you 6-7 hours, and this is a significant time saver compared to other modes of transport. </p>

    <h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost of a ticket on a train on the Moscow-Yeisk route will cost a tourist from 2400 rubles for a place in the reserved seat and about 4500 for a berth in a compartment. </p><p>  If you take the standard cost of gasoline and the distance for traveling by car, it turns out a little more than 3000 rubles for gasoline.  It looks good, but additional costs may be required along the way, so you need to have a supply of money with you. </p><p>  The Moscow-Yeisk bus route will take you 2,350 rubles one way. </p><p>  Airfare will cost from about 5500 rubles, but depending on the company and the timing of departure, the cost may vary.  So, the best time to buy tickets is in 1-2 months.  When buying plane tickets, keep in mind that the cost may vary depending on the seat of the passenger, as well as for large baggage you will have to pay separately.  As a result, with such a trip, the trip will cost at least 6-7 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Traveler opinions </h2><p>  As for the train, the opinions of travelers on the Moscow-Yeysk route are unambiguous - they should not be taken at all.  Passengers were mostly very unhappy with the trip, and claim that mostly the cars are dirty, there are problems with the toilets, and the cars are terribly stuffy.  However, according to others, different cars are simply connected to this train, and some are quite decent. </p><p>  The only complaints of the tourists to the buses were only that it was not very convenient to go, and the stops were not as big as we would like.  But the rest of the passengers would probably like to get to the resort as quickly as possible.  So it‚Äôs quite possible to go by bus if health allows you, and you can drive the distance Moscow-Yeysk sitting. </p><p>  The plane of the cheapest airline that performs such flights leaves much to be desired.  As tourists say, they received neither service nor comfort and were only glad that the flight did not last long.  Fortunately, many companies fly this flight.  To avoid unpleasant moments along the way, we advise you to read reviews about the carrier, and only then purchase tickets.  As for regular buses that go to Yeysk, they say only good things.  They are of high quality and very comfortable. </p>
