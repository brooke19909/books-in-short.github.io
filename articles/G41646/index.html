A microcomputer on Windows</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A microcomputer is most often a portable computer or laptop, the only central processor of which is a microprocessor.  They are used for arithmetic operations, management of complex technological processes.  Such microcomputers are equipped with peripheral devices, such as displays, and analog-to-digital converters, printing devices, and others. </p><h2>  Basic features of a microcomputer </h2><ul><li>  Bus connection of system devices. </li><li>  Complete unification of hardware and software. </li><li>  A large number of potential customers. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microcomputer is" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29654/669845.jpg" width="524"></div></li></ul><h2>  Types of microcomputers </h2><ul><li>  Stationary  This species is the most popular and common.  It consists of a single <span>system unit,</span> which is located separately from external devices.  After all, what is a microcomputer without a mouse, keyboard and, of course, a monitor?  It is possible to connect other external devices to a separate system unit, for example: a printer, game joystick, <span>speaker system.</span> </li><li>  Portable.  Today, this species has also become very popular.  The most famous and widespread portable microcomputer is a laptop.  It differs from the previous one only in that the external and internal devices are combined in one housing.  But another appearance does not take away the ability to connect other external devices to the microcomputer. </li><li>  Network  After the worldwide network rapidly began to develop in the 1990s, it became necessary to invent network microcomputers.  This view is designed to work only on the network.  They are much cheaper than stationary or portable, because they do not need drives and their own memory.  And soon, telephone companies, schools and other educational institutions will be fully equipped with network microcomputers. </li><li>  Pocket.  Small PDAs weighing 200-400 grams that fit comfortably in the palm of your hand.  Not so long ago, namely in 1990, there were PDAs with operating systems.  This made it possible to exchange information with other computers and microcomputers, as well as connect to a worldwide network.  Pocket microcomputers do not have a drive or hard disk.  Most of these computers are touch-sensitive, but there are also models with a small keyboard. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is a microcomputer" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29654/669848.jpg" width="350"></div></li></ul><h2>  New Ainol </h2><p>  Many well-known Chinese company Ainol released a microcomputer on Windows 8.1.  A small device measuring 145 x 116 x 15 mm and weighing 330 grams is more like an external hard drive than a powerful microcomputer, but it is a real PC.  The device boasts its quad-core processor with a frequency of 1.33-1.83 GHz, 2 GB of RAM and a built-in 32 GB flash module, with the ability to expand to 128 GB using a memory card.  USB 3.0, Micro HDMI 1.4 is added to the standard USB 2.0 port.  In addition, the device is equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microcomputer on windows" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29654/669851.jpg" width="515"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  In order to power the Raspberry Pi microcomputer, you need a voltage of 5V and a <span>current of</span> 700 mA (the more, the better, most importantly, no less) and a microUSB cable.  Chargers from Apple Iphone or Nokia are perfect.  However, you should not try to charge the device using the computer‚Äôs USB port. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For convenient use of the Raspberry Pi, the board has an HDMI port.  This allows you to easily connect the device to a TV or monitor.  It happens that the monitor does not support HDMI, in which case you can use the HDMI-DVI adapter or the usual ‚Äútulips‚Äù. </p><p>  The Raspberry Pi board has 2 ports, which allows you to connect any keyboard or mouse.  And to connect the network devices, as usual, you need an ethernet cable.  It is enough to use it to connect the device to a router or any other equipment. </p><h2>  OS installation </h2><p>  What is a microcomputer without an operating system?  Waste fee.  Before starting the Raspberry Pi for the first time, you must first record the OS image on a microSD card.  This can be done from any computer by downloading an OS image from the RPi main page.  After preparing the memory card, you can start running the Raspberry Pi, thereby loading the system. </p><ol><li>  You must insert a memory card into the slot and connect the device to power. </li><li>  After the boot process has started on the display, the device may restart several times.  It depends on which operating system was chosen. </li><li>  You should go through the standard installation process. </li><li>  Then you need to fill in the credentials.  They should be found on the OS download page. </li></ol><p>  To work with the familiar interface for many, you must enter a specific command in the device. </p><p>  Such a microcomputer is, of course, a budget option, but it is able to show considerable performance to its user. </p><h2>  Microcomputer Cubieboard </h2><p>  After the enchanting success of Raspberry Pi, the Chinese engineer decided to repeat their triumph and released a new inexpensive version of the microcomputer - Cubieboard.  This device is equipped with a powerful 1 GHz ARM processor.  The Mali400 video accelerator allows you to admire the nice-looking HD quality.  1 GB of random access memory and 4 GB of internal memory, on which the bootloader and the operating system will already be installed.  As in the Raspberry Pi, the device has an HDMI output, which allows you to connect to any monitor or TV, it is possible to use the worldwide network using an ethernet cable, also two USB and an <span>infrared port</span> are located on the board <span>.</span> </p>

    <p>  Such a microcomputer costs only $ 49.  For such a device, this is not much at all, and you can work on it properly.  For those who like to have fun, in addition to everything, auxiliary 96 pins are displayed. </p><p>  The very first batch produced 200 samples, which dispersed very quickly.  Therefore, immediately manufacturers began selling the second batch of 1,000 copies.  Such a stir around this device arose due to the fact that there was an active attraction of money, and the support of the IT community played a significant role. </p><p>  It should be remembered that a microcomputer is the cheapest and most compact form among all similar devices.  It has almost all the devices that a stationary or laptop computer and is not inferior to them in performance, and the price is so symbolic only because the <span>appearance is</span> not quite presentable.  However, having bought such a device for 25-80 dollars, few will watch what it looks like.  Although its functional characteristics are fixed, such a device works quite productively. </p>
