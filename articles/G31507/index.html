  <section class="page js-page"><h1>All methods of connecting to the Internet. Advantages and disadvantages</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The World Wide <span>Web has</span> developed in quite a short time to its current scale.  Almost everyone can afford to connect to the "web".  Ways to connect to the Internet are varied.  Since you are reading this article, it means that at least one of them is already familiar to you.  A little more than ten years ago, people could afford only 2 types of connection.  Now you can count as many as eight (!).  What are their differences, it is not difficult to disassemble, but it is extremely useful. </p><p>  Let's start with the most ‚Äúancient‚Äù.  Legendary Dial-Up connection through a special modem.  Today, this type can be found in places where, in addition to telephone communications, there are simply no other options to go online.  The principle is simple.  You need a modem and a <span>telephone cable.</span>  The speed of this type of connection is incredibly low.  While you are on the Internet, it is impossible to reach you.  The telephone line is completely busy transmitting data.  As a result, you pay both for using the telephone line and for the Internet.  Cases of communication failures and Internet connection errors are quite common.  In addition to the low cost of the modem and ease of connection, obvious advantages are no longer observed.  Firstly, it takes a very long time to download something from the Web, and secondly, it is expensive. </p><p>  Ways to connect to the Internet are improving every day.  The next development step already stands out against the backdrop of Dial-Up.  Meet ADSL!  It seems all the same: a modem and a <span>landline phone.</span>  But the computer also needs a special network card.  The card costs a "penny", the modem is about $ 15.  High and stable speed, a free telephone line (even with a blocker) are the main advantages of this connection.  There is only one drawback - the high cost of the provider's services.  But there is the opportunity to use the Internet without any traffic restrictions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Connecting a computer to the Internet through a telephone is becoming increasingly popular.  You can connect them together through a straight cable (USB), and through Bluetooth and even an <span>infrared port.</span>  High mobility and excellent speed made this connection at least convenient and interesting.  But mobile operators in no way want to reduce the price of this type of connection.  The disadvantage is expensive. </p><p>  Today, you can often find an Internet connection through cable television.  We need a special modem and the availability of cable television itself.  It‚Äôs easy to find out if you use cable services.  Press on the remote control through the channels.  If there are more than twenty, then all that remains for you is to solve the problem with your Internet provider. <br>  The disadvantage is only in the price of the modem, but often an ransom in installments is offered.  <span>The subscription fee for</span> such a connection is low, the speed is excellent.  Internet connection errors due to the fact that something is connected to the wrong place simply cannot be.  Turn on and work! </p><p>  Have you met the word ‚Äúleased‚Äù?  Most Internet users prefer this kind of connection.  It is provided, thanks to a special <span>network cable</span> (twisted pair or ‚Äúoptics‚Äù, ie optical fiber).  This wire connects your computer to the equipment of the provider (source).  Maximum connection stability is guaranteed.  High speed also ceases to be an unfulfilled dream.  No tangible flaws were identified.  We inserted the cord into the computer and the Internet automatically connected. </p><p>  Often there is a situation where the provider does not have the opportunity to route the cable to your home.  But the ways to connect to the Internet are not limited to the above.  Wireless comes into play.  There are long range antennas on sale.  They are able to receive / transmit a signal at a distance of up to 5 km.  You just need to direct it to the access point.  Disadvantages: the high cost of equipment, the highest possible direct visibility between the antenna and the access point is required, the quality of communication depends on weather conditions, although the signal is not completely blocked due to this. </p><p>  It is easy to allow yourself to freely use the Internet by purchasing GSM or CDMA.  In appearance, this device looks like a small "flash drive".  Mobile network operators offer Internet connection services, and now even sell special modems separately.  Inexpensive and very convenient! </p><p>  There are also methods of accessing the network via satellites.  Let not the most affordable, but extremely promising ways to connect to the Internet.  Thus, you can access the Network absolutely from anywhere in the world, but equipment prices have not yet declined, and not everyone can provide such a service.  Automatic connection to the Internet, even from a wild desert, even from a <span>desert island.</span>  Isn't that a dream? </p>
