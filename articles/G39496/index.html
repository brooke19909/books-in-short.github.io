  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first Kiev princes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The first Kiev princes possessed a peculiar and indefinite power.  It can not be attributed to any of the <span>types of power that</span> are usually allocated.  They did not have a blood relationship with the peoples of Russia, the land was not in their ownership, the very definition of "Russian land" appears only during the reign of Svyatoslav.  The main tasks of the Kiev princes were to unite the tribes and create a single state.  The first Kiev princes sought to establish trade relations with their neighbors, as well as to secure the movement of merchant ships to foreign markets.  Of course, the defense of Russia from opponents was also included in the primary tasks of the Kiev princes. </p><p>  The first Kiev princes, having taken possession of the "from the Vikings to the Greeks", sent forces to conquer the tribes living far from this path.  In the conquered regions, princely order was established and a viceroy was appointed from the local princes, sons of the Grand Duke or warriors.  The main task that this government performed was collecting tribute. </p><p>  In spring, Kiev made up large caravans of large boats.  They went to the lower reaches of the Dnieper, and then went to the Black Sea, along which they reached Constantinople.  Trading affairs of the Russian princes in Constantinople lasted up to six months.  It was a kind of Russian fair under the supervision of the Greeks.  The rules that controlled the stay of the Russians in Constantinople determined the relationship between Russia and the Greeks.  The organization of such caravans also lay on the shoulders of the princes.  They pulled goods to Kiev, provided caravans with security and provided favorable trading conditions.  So, the foreign and <span>domestic policies of</span> Rurik largely depended on how trade develops. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Protecting the borders of Russia was a thing that constantly took a lot of effort.  Steppe raids practically did not stop.  They attacked not only the border areas, but also Kiev itself.  The first <span>Kiev princes</span> gradually surrounded Kiev with walls and fortresses, and the border with ramparts and other structures.  Other measures were required to ensure the safety of commercial caravans on land.  It was necessary either to come to mutually beneficial cooperation, or to defeat rivals by force.  So the policy of the first Kiev princes in relation to raids was built. </p><p>  The value of Kiev was great precisely because of trade.  It was the southernmost city on the Dnieper.  Merchants gathered here, a warehouse of goods was arranged here, and here was the main market.  Kiev was a center of trade in Russia. </p><p>  The policy of the first Kiev princes became the foundation of the history of the development of Russia.  This is the first power that united disparate tribes.  It was the Kiev princes who set the stage on which the tree of national unity and self-consciousness grew.  The Kiev princes rallied the state externally, and then it rallied also from the inside. </p><p>  Sufficiently detailed information about the princes of Kiev is available only from the time of <span>Prince Oleg.</span>  He united all the main cities on the way "from the Vikings and Greeks."  Oleg's unifying activity extended to the drevlyans, northerners and radimichi.  We can say that he created Russian-Slavic independence and power. </p><p>  After Oleg‚Äôs death, Igor ascended the throne.  Igor‚Äôs reign is not marked by great victories or lucrative contracts.  Igor died when he wanted to collect double tribute from the Drevlyans. </p><p>  The widow of Igor Olga left a son, who was destined for the throne of his father.  Since the position of women among the Slavs was not infringed, Olga took over the rule.  With a firm hand, she brought order to her land.  Her main action is the adoption of Christianity. </p><p>  Svyatoslav, although he already had a Slavic name, was still a Varangian in character.  The first successful <span>campaigns Svyatoslav</span> made during the reign of Olga.  He subjugated the Vyatichi, defeated the Khazars, defeated the Yasses and Kasogs, and later - took the city of Bolgar. </p>
