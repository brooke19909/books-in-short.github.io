Now this is a whole laboratory, and the objects located here are nothing but equipment.  It is these characteristics that distinguish Quarks, the Museum of Entertaining Sciences, from other institutions that perform similar functions.  Find out more about it. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  The Quarki Museum of Entertaining Sciences was opened in Nizhny Novgorod relatively recently - in November 2013, and was created by the forces of people passionate about physics, without attracting investors and budgetary funds.  For its formation, as well as the manufacture of all the samples, models and stands presented here, the creators took about a year. </p>

    <p>  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a presentation of exhibits to the public was formed under the influence of already existing similar museums in some European countries: Spain, Germany, Denmark, as well as in Moscow and St. Petersburg. </p><h2>  Institution mission </h2><p>  Quarks, the Museum of Entertaining Sciences, is a completely new example of a museum view.  What does it mean?  First of all, the fact that Quarks is no longer just a museum with exhibits, but something more reminiscent of a permanent laboratory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The territory here is organized in such a way that all visitors, young and old, have a great opportunity to get acquainted with such an entertaining science as physics, conduct experiments, and learn more about the properties of substances and objects.  Here you can take pictures and video. </p><h2>  Museum as a popularizer of science </h2><p>  Achievements of scientific knowledge, which are presented today at the museum, give their guests the opportunity not only to see everything with their own eyes, but also to feel the influence of some <span>physical phenomena.</span>  Unfortunately, the modern education system does not have the appropriate material base to present science so vividly and vividly, allowing, as they say, touch and feel it.  Sometimes a boring presentation of material in a textbook or in a lesson does not cause much enthusiasm among the student.  This leads to a lack of cognitive interest and poor memorization of the past. </p>

    <p>  A visit to an institution such as the Quarki Museum of Physics (the Museum of Entertaining Sciences, it is called differently) allows a completely different perspective to look at familiar phenomena and processes.  Here, any visitor (and especially active ones are specifically schoolchildren) has the opportunity to touch everything, turn it on and see for yourself how physical laws work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Physics available to everyone </h2><p>  Quarks, the Museum of Entertaining Sciences, introduces visitors to such <span>areas of physics</span> as acoustics and mechanics, thermodynamics and optics.  The settings presented here make it possible to demonstrate the phenomena of nature familiar to everyone and the laws of their development, to learn more about the properties of matter and the laws of its motion, and much more. </p><p>  Interestingly, the guides here are mostly young and passionate about science.  As a rule, these are students of technical universities of the city.  The administration of the museum ensures that excursions and shows are interesting and fascinating.  Every month, based on customer feedback, the best guide is selected. </p><h2>  Entertaining exhibits and Quark zones </h2><p>  The Museum of Entertaining Sciences contains many different objects that are located in a huge room.  Its area is 1.6 thousand square meters.  The museum presents to its guests more than a hundred different exhibits, which are located in separate areas.  Each of them contains exhibits according to the time of their arrival.  Today, three zones are open: blue, red and green. </p>
