First of all, it is entertainment and such a peculiar form of relaxation.  For many, such an activity has become a hobby.  In this case, you can make not just a shooting gun from paper, but <span>an old-</span> style <span>weapon</span> , which will be the pride of its owner.  There are various schemes and drawings that make it easy to figure out how this is constructed.  They even make machine guns, pistols of different times with a silencer and a real sight.  Such paper products come to the rescue in the case when the child is scheduled to have a New Year's carnival in a kindergarten or at school.  Of course, today you can buy almost any attribute to the costume, but it is much more interesting to do it yourself.  Each child will be proud of his father, who knows how to make a gun out of paper that shoots.  Given the complexity of such designs, the first time not everyone can succeed.  To begin with, it is better to try to make the simplest design for training and gaining skills in this matter.

It should be not just any clean sheet, but a denser material.  Good for these purposes is medium density cardboard.  It is from him that make shooting pistols.  Weapons made of paper that will wrinkle easily will not work.  It is inconvenient and impractical.  In addition to paper, you need to prepare PVA glue, with which all parts of the gun will be glued together.  You can‚Äôt do without this scissors, which should cut cardboard without any problems.  Adhesive tape is also useful, which can be glued in places where the PVA will not hold the paper.  It is better to work on a table, where all the details will neatly lie and will not be remembered. </p><h2>  Getting to work, making a gun barrel </h2>

    <p>  Before you make a gun out of paper that shoots, you need to carefully plan everything and decide what will be folded in the first place and what will complete the job.  So, first you need to make a gun barrel.  To do this, take a sheet of <span>paper of size</span> A4.  It must be neatly folded along a rectangle on the long side.  The sheet is bent to the end, and then folded in half.  All this must be done in small folds.  The result should be a gun barrel.  It should be removed to the side and proceed to other details. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Making a pistol grip </h2>

For these purposes, it is necessary to take a sheet of cardboard of the same size.  It should be folded in exactly the same way as in the case of the barrel.  Only now it is necessary to make it so that it is larger in width.  It also needs to be halved.  After this part is ready, it is connected to the previous one.  To do this, two blanks must be straightened.  Next, gently put a thin piece of paper on a thicker one and glue it.  The lower part, which is larger, is mentally divided into three parts.  They must be equal.  The next step is to bend the right side to the center.  Then you need to bend the left side in the same way.  After that, the part is bent again to the center.  We can assume that this work has been done.  It remains only to cut a small hole, which should be at the base.  To do this, use scissors.

The case is not easy, but amusing.  To make the trigger, you need a new sheet of A4.  You need to turn it to yourself from the short side and start folding in small steps.  You need to do this exactly until the middle.  The rest of the sheet will have to be cut with scissors and then folded in half.  After that, the future part should be inserted into the cut hole in the barrel.  The next step is to thread half the thin workpiece into the resulting pockets on a thick piece of paper.  All edges are carefully bent and all corners are aligned.  As a result, the outline of the gun should appear.  Unnecessary back part can be cut off.  Now you can slightly modify the handle.  To do this, take another sheet of paper and bend from the short side.  Its width should correspond to the handle.  When this is done, the last edge must be sealed with tape.  The resulting handle can be put on the gun.

    <p>  Finally, you need to make one more detail.  To do this, you need another sheet.  On the short side, it is necessary to begin to bend it in the same subtle way as before.  The resulting strip should be folded in half and gently bend its right edge to the left.  The corner should be exposed.  If so, then everything is done right.  It should be cut off.  This blank is threaded into the back of the resulting gun barrel.  Now the edges will calmly go into the pistol pockets.  The question remains, how to make a paper gun that shoots?  Now you can do this thing.  To implement this idea, it is necessary to pass an elastic band on the barrel of a gun, which will serve for firing.  Pulling it and pulling the trigger, you can make a real shot.  As cartridges, you can use small balls of paper.  The work of creating a gun can be considered finished.  To transform such a weapon, it can be painted with any colors.  Moreover, they also use a copy of this gun printed on colored paper.  So it will look realistic and look like a real one.  The main thing is to choose the right model. </p>
