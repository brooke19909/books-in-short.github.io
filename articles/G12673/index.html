    <h2>  Hotel Blue Sea Lagos de Cesar: service rating </h2><p>  To make a general impression of the resort, it is important to evaluate each of its features individually.  This also applies to the Hotel Blue Sea Lagos de Cesar.  Traveler reviews allowed us to make the following rating on a five-point system: </p><ul><li>  The hotel infrastructure has earned a rating of 4, which is mainly due to the fact that insufficient attention has been paid to the improvement of the territory.  Bars and restaurants also close too early, forcing travelers to travel to establishments outside the hotel. </li><li>  The quality of service was also rated not very high (3.5 points).  The best impression was made by the quality work of the staff, but the animation is rather sluggish.  Also, guests are not satisfied with the quality and speed of the reception. </li><li>  Guest apartments earned a rating of 3.7.  Air conditioners work perfectly, and therefore the room is cool even on the hottest day.  But the furniture and plumbing are very old and require replacement.  In addition, the rooms have terrible sound insulation, which is why it is simply impossible to relax in the room. </li><li>  Children's infrastructure is estimated at 2.6, as it is not thought out.  In addition to the playground, the hotel can no longer offer kids. </li><li>  The location of the hotel is rated 4. Very close to the beach, as well as cafes and retail outlets.  But the sights and entertainment clubs are located at a considerable distance. </li></ul>

    <p>  Reviews about this institution are mostly positive and contain a huge number of approving comments, among which the following should be noted: </p><ul><li>  the rooms are very large and bright; </li><li>  pleased with the presence of a huge balcony in which you can not only sit in an armchair, but also sunbathe; </li><li>  the staff is very friendly and polite with guests, in every possible way tries to please; </li><li>  the hotel is located very conveniently relative to the sea - it can be seen right from the window; </li><li>  this hotel is a very quiet and peaceful place, and therefore it is ideal for families with children; </li><li>  at the buffet, usually, a huge number of fish and meat dishes are presented; </li><li>  the absence of its own parking zone does not bother at all, as there are a lot of free parking around; </li><li>  the hotel is located so that within walking distance are shops, cafes, clubs, public transport stops, and taxi rank. </li></ul><h2>  Negative hotel reviews </h2><p>  Despite the fact that tourists are mostly satisfied with their stay in Blue Sea Lagos de Cesar 4 * (Tenerife), the reviews also contain some comments, the most significant of which can be considered the following: </p><ul><li>  the hotel is very outdated, and this is especially evident in worn-out furniture and leaking plumbing; </li><li>  problems with the mixer - it is impossible to get warm water, and it pours alternately cold and hot; </li><li>  despite the fact that guests from Russia and other CIS countries mainly come to the Blue Sea Lagos de Cesar 4 * hotel, the staff does not speak Russian even at a minimum level; </li><li>  the beach nearby is very small, and therefore it is always crowded and rather dirty there; </li><li>  the restaurant is not very tasty, and the prices are an order of magnitude higher than in the establishments located in the neighborhood; </li><li>  maids rarely look into Blue Sea Lagos de Cesar rooms (the hotel description promises daily cleaning, but in fact it is done a couple of times a week); </li><li>  At first glance, the interior of the rooms is very stylish and attractive, but upon closer inspection it is clear that very low-quality cheap materials were used in the decoration (not to mention antediluvian furniture); </li><li>  for a hotel of such a high level it is very strange that you have to pay extra for the opportunity to watch TV; </li><li>  a good view from the window can be obtained only if you settle on the upper floors; </li><li>  a very small volume boiler is installed in the bathroom, because of which warm water with a stretch is enough for only one person, and the rest have to wait until it is heated again; </li><li>  the hotel serves dishes on dirty plates (this is not only unpleasant, but also very unhealthy); </li><li>  the ventilation system is designed so that the smells from the restaurant‚Äôs kitchen for some reason fall into the rooms located next door; </li><li>  in the dining room, neither the cook nor the waiters consider it necessary to wear uniforms, but work in sportswear; </li><li>  Despite the fact that a lot of families with children have a rest at the hotel, smoking is not prohibited on its territory (if someone comes across a smoker neighbor, be prepared for all the smoke in your room); </li><li>  there is very cold water in the pool due to the hotel building blocking it from the sun (and no one turns on the heating). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The island of Tenerife is a rather expensive place to stay, and therefore the Blue Sea Lagos de Cesar 4 * hotel will be a real find for budget travelers.  Traveler reviews suggest that this is one of the most budget accommodation options.  At the same time, there is quite a decent resort infrastructure and a good level of service.  The low price for accommodation is due to the fact that the hotel has not been renovated for a long time.  If you do not pay attention to old furniture and scuffed interior, then this option is ideal for you. </p><p>  It is worth noting the location of the Blue Sea Lagos de Cesar hotel.  Reviews of tourists say that it is incredibly beneficial for those who do not want to spend all the time in the hotel.  This is the first coastline, and therefore literally a few steps from the beach.  By the way, it is not clean and comfortable, and therefore, if you want to fully enjoy a sea holiday, it is better to choose more distant options.  It will not be difficult, because there is a bus stop very close by, with which you can easily get to anywhere in the resort.  It is also a good starting point for those who want to explore as many attractions as possible. </p><p>  We can conclude that this hotel is good for those who do not like to sit still.  Here you can get a comfortable overnight stay and meals, but no more.  It would be better to go on an excursion or at sea for the whole day.  Otherwise, you will start to be struck by such hotel flaws as the outdated interior and the almost complete absence of animation.  In addition, if you want to have a romantic dinner or just have a cocktail in the bar, it is better to visit establishments outside the hotel.  Everything is much cheaper in them, it is much tastier, and they also have a more convenient work schedule. </p>
