They will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  What is a bank account? </h2><p>  A personal account is called a special registration number, under which all financial transactions conducted between the client and the bank are recorded.  Since such operations are of a different nature (deposit operations, <span>credit, bank</span> cards), several personal numbers can be assigned to one client. </p><h2>  Types of accounts </h2><p>  Banks provide different types of personal accounts.  They perform various functions. </p><ol><li>  Current account.  They are opened for storing money and performing various kinds of financial operations: crediting money (salaries, benefits, pensions, etc.) and making settlements (payment of utilities, repayment of loan obligations). </li><li>  Deposit account.  It is designed to save and <span>accumulate cash.</span>  The profitability of such deposits depends on the placement period.  The highest interest rate on long-term deposits (from a year or more).  Deposits on deposits are limited.  As a rule, the contract provides for the withdrawal of funds in the amount of accrued interest.  Early termination of a deposit agreement may include penalties in the form of a decrease in the amount of interest income.  Some <span>types of deposits</span> can be opened via the Internet - on the bank's website. </li><li>  Accounts linked to bank payment cards. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="blog.unibulmerchantservices.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank payment card" class="if uuid-2673482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2673482.jpg"></div><p>  All bank cards are tied to a personal account.  This provides the client with free access to funds.  They can be of two types: debit and credit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Debit cards are used for various accruals (salaries, scholarships, alimony, social payments).  The owner can deposit money into it independently through the information kiosk and at the bank‚Äôs office, and carry out expense transactions within the cash balance. </p><p>  Credit cards allow the holder to use cash in the amount of the limit set by the bank.  When applying for it, you should carefully familiarize yourself with the terms of the loan: the availability of a grace period, the terms of interest repayment, the size of the loan rate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fpthink.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Account opening transaction" class="if uuid-2673511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2673511.jpg"></div><h2>  How to open a personal account in Sberbank to an individual? </h2><p>  To open a personal account, an individual needs to contact the bank branch, present the original passport and choose the appropriate type of deposit.  Before concluding a transaction, you must carefully read the contract. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank logo" class="if uuid-2673551" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2673551.jpg"></div><p>  In order to open a credit line, it is necessary to submit an extended list of documents: income statement, family composition, and others.  The list will depend on the type and term of the loan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Minor citizens can also open personal accounts in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation.  If a minor (under eighteen years of age) is an emancipated citizen, has his own income (scholarship, allowance, salary), permission from parents is not required.  Personal accounts in the name of young children (up to sixteen years of age) are opened upon written permission of parents and guardians. </p><h2>  Design features for individual entrepreneurs </h2><p>  <span>Opening an IP account is optional.</span>  <span>But it can be convenient for financial transactions: payment of taxes, services, etc. To open a personal account with Sberbank, you need an extended package of documents:</span> </p><ol><li>  <span>Passport and its photocopy.</span> </li><li>  <span>Certificate of state registration.</span> </li><li>  Certificate of registration with the tax office. </li><li>  License (if necessary for this type of activity). </li><li>  Application in the prescribed form. </li><li>  Signature Card. </li><li>  Print Imprint. </li></ol><p>  Accounts for individual entrepreneurs are opened within a few days, after checking the accuracy of the data. </p><h2>  Registration for legal entities </h2><p>  For legal entities, an account is required.  In order to open a bank personal bank account of Sberbank, you need to submit the following documents: </p><ol><li>  Certificate of state registration. </li><li>  Certificate of tax registration. </li><li>  Papers that confirm the credentials of an official. </li><li>  Articles of association. </li><li>  Samples of signatures and impressions of seals. </li></ol><p>  The registration procedure takes from three days to a week. </p><h2>  How to find out the personal account number of Sberbank </h2><p>  It happens that it is necessary to submit a personal account number to one or another organization: to an insurance company, accounting department, pension fund, etc. This number along with bank details is indicated in the contract.

The operator will ask a number of questions to verify the identity of the account holder, after which you will be provided with all the information that interests you. <div class="photo" data-original="vstrg.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Call Center Work" class="if uuid-2673507" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2673507.jpg"></div></li><li>  Users of online banking and mobile applications can view account numbers in your account. <div class="photo" data-original="rg.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Get a personal account through an ATM" class="if uuid-2673518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2673518.jpg"></div></li><li>  You can view the personal <span>account of Sberbank</span> using an ATM if a payment card is attached to it.
