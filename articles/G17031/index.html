Occupying a geographically intermediate position between the civilizations of the East and the West, it became a zone of important historical and cultural contacts and was formed not only on a self-sufficient internal basis, but also under the weighty influence of neighboring peoples. </p><h2>  Formation of tribal alliances </h2><p>  The formation of the state of Kievan Rus and the origins of the formation of modern Slavic peoples lie in the times when the Great Migration of the Slavs began in the vast territories of Eastern and Southeast Europe, which lasted until the end of the 7th century.  The previously unified Slavic community gradually disintegrated into eastern, western, southern and northern Slavic tribal unions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kievan Rus education history" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/621339.jpg" width="600"></div>  In the middle of the 1st millennium, Antsky and Sklavinsky unions of Slavic tribes already existed in the territory of modern Ukraine.  After the defeat in the 5th century A.D.  the Hun tribe and the final disappearance of the Western Roman Empire, the Ante Union began to play a prominent role in Eastern Europe.  The invasion of the Avar tribes did not allow this alliance to form in the state, but the process of forming sovereignty was not stopped.  <span>Slavic tribes</span> colonized new lands and, uniting, created new alliances of tribes. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kievan Rus education" class="if" height="213" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/621342.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Initially, temporary, random associations of tribes arose - for military campaigns or for defense against unfriendly neighbors and nomads.  Gradually, associations of neighboring tribes close in culture and everyday life arose.  Finally, territorial associations of the proto-state type were formed - lands and principalities, which later became the cause of such a process as the formation of the state of Kievan Rus. </p><h2>  Briefly: the composition of the Slavic tribes </h2><p>  Most modern historical schools connect the beginnings of self-consciousness of the Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian peoples with the collapse of the great Slavic ethnically united society and the emergence of a new social formation - a tribal union.  The gradual rapprochement of the Slavic tribes gave rise to the state of Kievan Rus.  The formation of the state accelerated at the end of the VIII century.  Seven political unions were formed on the territory of the future power: Dulibs, Drevlyans, Croats, clearings, streets, tivertsy, Siveryan.  One of the first was the Dulib Union, uniting the tribes inhabiting the territory of the river.  Horyn in the east to Zap.  Bug.  The most favorable geographical position was the tribe of glades, which occupied the territory of the middle Dnieper from the river.  Grouse in the north to the river.  Irpin and Ros in the south.  The formation of the ancient state of Kievan Rus took place on the lands of these tribes. </p>

    <h2>  The emergence of the rudiments of government </h2><p>  With the formation of tribal unions, their military-political significance grew.  Most of the booty captured during military campaigns was appropriated by tribal leaders and combatants ‚Äî armed professional warriors who served as leaders for a reward.  A noticeable role was played by assemblies of free male warriors or popular gatherings (veche), at which the most important administrative and civil issues were decided.  There was a separation into the layer of the tribal elite, in whose hands power was concentrated.  Such a layer included the boyars - advisers and close princes, the princes themselves and their warriors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Allocation of the Polyana Union </h2><p>  The process of public education was especially intense on the lands of the Polyanskoy tribal principality.

    <p>  Between the VIII and IX centuries.  In the principality there were real political preconditions for the emergence on its basis of the first <span>Slavic state,</span> which later became known as Kievan Rus. </p><h2>  The formation of the name "Rus" </h2><p>  The question ‚Äúwhere did the Russian land come from‚Äù, asked by the <span>chronicler Nestor, has</span> not found a clear answer to this day.  Today, several scientific theories of the origin of the name Rus, Kievan Rus are common among historians.  The formation of this phrase is rooted in the deep past.  In a broad sense, these terms were used in the description of all East Slavic territories, in the narrow - only Kiev, Chernihiv and Pereyaslav lands were taken into account.  Among the Slavic tribes, these names became widespread and subsequently entrenched in various toponyms.  For example, the names of the rivers are Rosava.  Ros, etc. The Slavic tribes who occupied a privileged position on the lands of the Middle Dnieper began to be called the same.  According to scientists, the name of one of the tribes that was part of the Polyansky Union was dew or Russ, and later the social elite of the entire Polyansky Union began to call itself Rus.  In the IX century, the formation of Old Russian statehood was completed.  Kievan Rus began its existence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="formation of the East Slavic state Kievan Rus" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/621353.jpg" width="212"></div>

    <h2>  Territories of the Eastern Slavs </h2><p>  Geographically, all tribes lived in the forest or forest-steppe.  These natural zones were favorable for the development of the economy and safe for life.  It was in the middle latitudes, in the forests and forest-steppes that the formation of the state of Kievan Rus began. </p><p>  The general arrangement of the southern group of Slavic tribes significantly influenced the nature of their relations with neighboring peoples and countries.  The territory of the ancient Rus was on the border between East and West.  These lands are located at the crossroads of ancient roads and trade routes.  But unfortunately, these territories were open and unprotected natural barriers, which made them vulnerable to intrusions and raids. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="formation of the state of Kievan Rus briefly" class="if" height="205" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/621341.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Relations with neighbors </h2><p>  During the VII-VIII centuries.  The main threat to the local population was the alien peoples of the East and South.  Of particular importance to the glades was the formation of the Khazar Khaganate - a strong state located in the steppes of the Northern Black Sea Region and in Crimea.  In relation to the Slavs, the Khazars took an aggressive position.  At first they imposed tribute to the Vyatichi and Siverians, and later - to the glades.  The fight against the Khazars contributed to the unification of the tribes of the Polyanskoy tribal union, which both traded and fought with the Khazars.  Maybe it was from Khazaria to the Slavs that the title of ruler - the kagan - passed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the formation of Old Russian statehood Kievan Rus" class="if" height="247" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/622522.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <p>  The relations of the Slavic tribes with Byzantium were of great importance.  Repeatedly Slavic princes fought and traded with a powerful empire, and sometimes even entered into military alliances with it.  In the West, relations between East Slavic peoples were maintained with Slovaks, Poles, and Czechs. </p><h2>  Formation of the state of Kievan Rus </h2><p>  The political development of Polyansky reign led to the emergence of public education at the turn of the VIII-IX centuries, which later became known as "Rus."  Since the capital of the new power became Kiev, historians of the XIX-XX centuries.  they began to call it "Kievan Rus."  The formation of the country began in the Middle Dnieper, where the Drevlyans, Siveryans and glades lived. </p><p>  <span>The ruler of Russia</span> had the title Kagan (Khakan), equivalent to the Grand Duke of Russia.  It is clear that such a title could only be carried by a lord who, by his social position, stood above the prince of a tribal union.  The strengthening of the new state was evidenced by its active military activities.  At the end of the VIII century.  Rus, led by the Polyansky prince Bralin, attacked the Crimean coast and captured Korchev, Surozh and Korsun.  In 838, the Rus arrived in Byzantium.  So diplomatic relations with the eastern empire were formed.  The formation of the East Slavic state of Kievan Rus was a great event.  She was recognized as one of the most powerful powers of the time. </p><h2>  The first princes of Kievan Rus </h2><p>  Representatives of the Kievichi dynasty ruled in Russia, to which the brothers <span>Askold and Dir</span> belong <span>.</span>  According to some historians, they were co-rulers, although, perhaps, Dir reigned first, and then Askold.  In those days, the Norman squads appeared on the Dnieper - Swedes, Danes, Norwegians.  They were used to protect trade routes and as mercenaries during raids.  In 860, Askold, leading an army of 6-8 thousand people, carried out a sea voyage to Kostantinopol.  While in Byzantium, Askold got acquainted with the new religion - Christianity, was baptized and tried to bring a new faith, which Kievan Rus could accept.  Education, the history of a new country began to be influenced by Byzantine philosophers and thinkers.  Priests and architects were invited to the Russian land from the empire.  But these events of Askold did not bring much success - among the nobility and commoners there was still a strong influence of paganism.  Therefore, Christianity later came to Kievan Rus. </p><p>  The formation of a new state determined the beginning of a new era in the history of the Eastern Slavs - the era of full-fledged state and political life. </p>
