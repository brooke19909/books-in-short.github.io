Description of Syktyvkar</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is generally accepted that any major administrative city usually gives a name to an entire district or okrug.  The same large and industrial center is the city of Syktyvkar.  What region is adjacent to this locality, we will now consider.  Indeed, many people ask such a question, since they had never heard of the Syktyvkar district.  But in reality, this settlement is the main city and administrative center of the Komi Republic, located in the harsh northern region. </p><h2>  Name history </h2><p>  This quiet, but at the same time majestic and ancient city is located in the north-west of the Russian Federation.  It was founded more than 450 years ago and was called in a completely different way, not Syktyvkar.  What area was formed by him at that time, also could not be understood by its name.  Since he was called Ust-Sysol, and he was the center of the Veliky Ustyug region. </p>
