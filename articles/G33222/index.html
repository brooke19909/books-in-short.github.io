Surely this thought has visited you more than once, is not it? </p><h2>  Parents and children </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="determine location by phone number" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15109/375355.jpg" width="480"></div></h2><p>  Currently, almost all mobile operators provide not only favorable rates for children and their parents, but also additional services.  So, the operator "Megaphone" offers a special tariff "Smeshariki".  Agree, sometimes going from school, the child can simply delay, playing with friends on the street.  And at home at that moment his parents are waiting for him, calling in vain on the phone.  The child plays and does not hear the call. </p><p>  In this case, such a service will be very useful with which you can determine the location by phone number.  To do this, just send the necessary request to the operator.  Each service has its own cost, but it does not exceed 10 rubles.  The money is withdrawn automatically, after which an answer with the coordinates of the place where the subscriber is located comes to the phone. </p><h2>  Useful programs or regular scam tricks? </h2>

And they lure unsuspecting users with a wide variety of tricks, including a service that helps determine the location of a subscriber by number.

This is called privacy interference.  Based on this, we can safely assume that most of the number tracking programs offered by the network are just a ploy to profit from someone else's expense. </p><p>  By downloading a program that supposedly allows you to <span>determine the location by phone number,</span> you run the risk of buying some standard utility of the usual application for the ‚Äúbluetooth‚Äù. </p><h2><br>  Basic scam tricks </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to determine the location by number" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15109/375353.jpg?1397578424200" width="333"></div></h2><p>  Let's look at the most common tricks that cybercriminals use to attract customers.  First, you are described in detail the charms of this program, which can not only determine the location by phone number, but also create access to SMS and user calls. </p><p>  You, seduced by such a fantastic program (and even free), are trying to download the file.  As a result, they offer you only to confirm that you are a real person, and send a simple SMS to a short number.  Do not do this, you just lose your money.  After you send SMS, you will be asked to send another message to make sure that it is really you, and not a robot program. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After sending such SMS, you can generally be in the red.  The most interesting thing is that for some mobile operators this service is simply not available.  So, with a short number for sending a message, we figured it out. </p><p>  Another common option on how to download a program that helps determine the location by mobile number is as follows.  You are offered to download the file, and for free.  And you really do it without a problem.  But it is impossible to activate, because the program either requires a key, or the installation file is missing.  But in the Notepad file you may well find a message.  It describes in detail that the program is top-secret, provides screen shots showing how it works, and then you are offered to buy a key to it for 1000 rubles, for example.  Plus, given the address of the mailbox to which you can write and ask any questions about the program.  But to install it, first pay the money, and then get the key. </p><p>  Beautiful, but unpromising, since you will never get the key.  Very often, scammers offer to pay half or a small part of the cost of the program, with which you can so easily determine the location by the phone number of the subscriber you need. </p><p>  Do not be tempted by a small amount, those who wish to purchase such utilities on the Internet are dark, little by little, and a pretty decent amount is gained. </p><h2>  Smartphones with radar </h2><p>  Some specialized online stores offer to buy a bunch of all kinds of various equipment that allows you to follow a person, listen to his phone conversations, read SMS, and, of course, determine the coordinates of the place where he is. </p>

    <p>  There are both individual devices and phones with already installed programs, and such gadgets are no different from their originals.  This is understandable if you decide to give a person a smartphone from Samsung, which means that it should match the brand as much as possible.  Here is the option - you can buy such a gadget and just give it. </p><p>  The cost of such devices will be two times higher than that of the originals.  Even if you decide to buy such a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone model, be careful.  Require 100% prepayment?  Think and don't do it.  There are a lot of one-day sites on the network that offer a lot of specific equipment, and after a month the resources simply cease to exist. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="determine the location of the subscriber by number" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15109/375343.jpg?1397578510600" width="383"></div>  Services of mobile operators </h2><p>  In fact, in order to know how to determine the location of a person by number, it is enough just to call your operator‚Äôs cellular company.  Currently, there is a way to find the coordinates of a person legally and legally.  To do this, you will have to send a request to your operator with the number of the subscriber you are looking for. </p><p>  However, there is one big drawback in this method.  You can get the coordinates that interest you only after the subscriber you are looking for confirms the request and allows the operator to use this service. </p><h2>  Option "Radar" </h2><p>  Each mobile operator has this option called in its own way, but its essence is the same.  You send a request and get the coordinates.  It would seem that everything is simple, but not quite.  When you send the text with the number of the subscriber you need, SMS will come to that number, where it says something like this: ‚ÄúThe subscriber number has requested the operator to determine your location.  Confirm request? " </p><p>  Further, it all depends on the actions of the subscriber himself, but presumably few will allow you to use this option. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="location by phone number" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15109/375334.jpg?1397578545975" width="500"></div>  What are your goals? </h2><p>  This is actually very important.  After all, it is one thing to try to determine the location by the phone number of a person who has disappeared somewhere or is delayed, and it is impossible to reach him, although he promised to be home on time.  And quite another - trying to determine the coordinates, trying to catch a person red-handed when suspected of treason, for example. </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  Before you start playing Sherlock Holmes, ask yourself one question: are you ready for what you can discover?  For example, if you suspect a husband or wife of treason, and this is confirmed, what will you do?  If you know the answer, then you can be happy for you.  And if something just seemed to you, and there is no question of any betrayal?  It may just happen that a person simply has problems with which he does not want to load you yet.  Or is he really hiding something from you, but only in order to make you a pleasant surprise. </p><p>  In any case, before you start searching for programs that will help you find a person, be aware of the possible risks and consequences for yourself.  After all, as they say - whoever seeks will always find. </p>
