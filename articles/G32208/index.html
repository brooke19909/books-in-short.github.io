    <h2>  Irish missionaries </h2><p>  The monastery of St. Gall was founded by one of the 12 students of the Irish monk, enlightener and missionary of Columban.  The name of the follower Gall.  Coming from a prosperous noble family, he devoted himself completely to God.  Irish missionaries played a very prominent role in the spread of Christianity throughout medieval Europe.  On the way to Northern Italy, Gall fell ill.  Columban, considering it cowardice and unwillingness to continue a rather dangerous missionary activity, threw a sick student.  Being on Lake Constance, Gall built himself a cell here in 612 in order to remain in solitude and pray.  He was offered the bishopric of Constance (615), a city on the shores of Lake Constance, and the post of abbot in the monastery of Lyuksei.  He refused everything and died in 627 in Arbon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First abbot of the monastery </h2><p>  In 1719, on the site of the cell of the righteous, the monastery of St. Gall began to be erected, around which the city of St. Gallen later grew.  The first abbot of the monastery was appointed preacher Otmar.  He restored the dilapidated cells.  Thanks to his efforts, the monastery soon regained its glory as a religious center.  Large donations began to be made, and the monastery became a large land owner.  The first abbot founded the legendary library of the monastery and art workshops, whose works were famous throughout Europe.  There was its own singing school.  In the monastery worked major poets and musicians of the Middle Ages.  The monastery of St. Gall, through the efforts of the first abbot, also ranked <span>among the saints,</span> eventually turned into the largest <span>Benedictine abbey.</span> </p>

    <p>  Despite all the wars, the library of the monastery today has about 160,000 volumes.  The Song of the Nibelungs is stored here.  A unique two-story reading room deserves separate words.  It is built in the Rococo style, and above its entrance there is an inscription that is translated from the ancient Greek language as "pharmacist of the soul."  This repository is considered the most interesting in the world.  The monastery itself is one of the first lines on the list ‚ÄúSwitzerland.  Sights".

The abbey library is highlighted on this list as a separate line. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The city that grew around the monastery </h2><p>  It should be noted that the capital of Eastern Switzerland, located in the German part of the country, has its own coat of arms, closely associated with one of the many legends about the miracles of St. Gall.  It depicts a bear in a gold chain.  According to legend, St. Gallus fed a hungry bear and allowed him to bask near his fire.  And the beast helped him, as a token of gratitude, build a log cell on the banks of the Steinach River and thus lay the town of St. Gallen (Switzerland).  This plot is depicted on an ivory product that dates back to the 9th century.  The capital of the eponymous canton, the administrative-territorial unit of Switzerland, the city, is located at an altitude of 700 meters above sea level and is the highest mountain settlement in Switzerland. </p>

    <h2>  Language features of the country </h2><p>  The city is located between two small ridges.  Parallel highlands are called Rosenberg (in the north) and Freudenberg (in the south).  Because of the hilly terrain, St. Gallen is also called the ‚ÄúCity of a Thousand Stairs‚Äù. </p><p>  The official languages ‚Äã‚Äãin this country are Swiss versions of German and French, Italian and Romansh.  The majority of the country's population - 63.7% - speaks German.  Nevertheless, in the country there is absolute linguistic equality.  The rights of Swiss speaking Romansh dialects are the same as those of the majority of the population, they are present in parliament. </p><h2>  World famous St. Gallen textile </h2><p>  Speaking about the achievements of the city, it is necessary to note the successes associated with embroidery and famous lace, known throughout the world.  The industry in this city of Eastern Switzerland began with the development of the textile industry.  At the time of the emergence of capitalist relations, the textile guild was at the head.  From the 9th to the 18th centuries, it was this industry that literally made the city rich. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. gallen city" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/549598.jpg" width="484"></div>  St. Gallen embroideries and lace are now adornment of products of leading haute couture houses.  The highest quality, elite textiles are produced here.  A museum of this type of product also belongs to the sights of the city.

    <h2>  Country Business Cards </h2><p>  And, of course, one cannot fail to note the role of the banks of this country in the development of the world economy.  The oldest bank Wegelin, founded in 1741, is located in the city of St. Gallen.  Switzerland is the country with the oldest and largest banking system in the world.  The capital of East Switzerland, according to some travelers, has three wonders - the abbey, weaving and bay windows, the beauty, originality and quantity of which any European city can envy.  Banks, watches, alpine resorts, lace and cheese - this is what has long been the glory of the country and what is the standard and guarantee of the highest quality in the world. </p><h2>  The usual history of a European country </h2><p>  The history of Switzerland, of which there is documentary evidence, began with the campaigns of Julius Caesar, that is, from the middle of the first century BC.  It is known that before the conquest of these lands by Rome, the Helvetites (the most extensive Celtic tribe) lived here.  Therefore, Switzerland has a second name - Helvetia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Switzerland attractions photo" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/549599.jpg" width="531"></div>  After the conquest, Roman colonies were founded in these territories, and in the 4th century the new religion of Ancient Rome - Christianity - penetrated here.  Then these lands, like most of Europe, were conquered by both Charles the Great and Napoleon.  Switzerland maintained neutrality during the First and Second World Wars, which, for obvious reasons, was strongly pro-German.

    <h2>  The peculiarity of Switzerland </h2><p>  Officially, it is believed that on August 1, 2014, the country celebrated its 720th anniversary.  The history of Switzerland as a state began precisely on this day several centuries ago.  The most important holiday of the country, the Day of the founding of the state, is associated with an event that occurred in 1291, when the first three communities joined together.  Later, Schwitz, Uri and Unterwalden, who entered into an alliance, will be called the cantons, of which there are currently 20 and 6 other half-cantons in Switzerland.  These administrative-territorial units are arranged so that, as a rule, people who speak the same language live in them.  The borders in which modern Switzerland is located have mainly developed by the sixteenth century.  This country is a confederation in which each canton is a state with its own laws, authorities and has the right to hold referenda.  On the territory of the country freedom of religion prevails.  The democratic system of Switzerland is different from most countries in Europe.  An independent policy pursued by the state is also evidenced by the fact that the country has not yet joined the EU. </p><h2>  Fairy tale country </h2><p>  All who have visited this alpine country call it a small quiet paradise.  <span>Switzerland's</span> unique <span>sights are</span> unique <span>,</span> photos and descriptions of which are widely available.  Mountains of amazing beauty, occupying 60% of the territory, various unique museums, castles, which in most cases are a continuation of the mountains - all this makes the country with the highest standard of living not only in Europe, but also in the whole world, in the full sense of the word, fabulous. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Switzerland sights photo and description" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/549600.jpg" width="563"></div>  The beauty of the country is evidenced by the fact that if somewhere in the world there is an amazing corner, it is immediately called the local Switzerland.  The country is beautiful at all times of the year, but in winter, when snow falls in St. Gallen, the city is exquisitely decorated for Christmas.
