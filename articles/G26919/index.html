The main element in them is the controller.  On the Russian market, the manufacturer of such equipment, Iron Logic, has been firmly established for a long time and offers an inexpensive and reliable Z 5R controller. </p><h2>  The simplest ACS </h2><p>  These systems are created in order to restrict outsiders access to enterprises, offices, warehouse and garage areas, etc., as well as to establish a regime for moving employees across the territories of protected objects and control their working time.  The simplest ACS controlling one door to a room has an executive body in the form of an electromagnetic (or <span>electromechanical) lock</span> on it.  To open such a door, the incoming person must have a special key or card with a code written in them that reads the reader device (otherwise, a reader).  The read code is sent to the controller, which compares it with the codes in its memory.  If <span>the key code is</span> found in the memory, a command to open is issued to the lock. </p><p>  All ACS are divided into two types: autonomous (or local) and network. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doorphone controller z5r" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33051/816482.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Standalone ACS </h2><p>  Such a system is used in small offices and small enterprises that do not control their employees too tightly.  The simplest such system can look like a kind of thing in itself, being structurally enclosed in one ACS unit like a doorphone, for example, Matrix II K from the same Iron Logic.  It contains a doorphone controller Z 5R and a reader designed for keys and cards of the EM Marine standard.  This is the simplest and cheapest solution, since it involves a minimum of electrical work: you just need to connect the access control unit to the power supply and to the lock. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sometimes an autonomous access control system is assembled from structurally separate devices.  At the same time, for example, the standalone Z 5R controller can work with a reader of your choice of type - for keys or for cards.  The choice of constructive system depends on the degree of criminogenic hazard in the area.  If you are afraid for the safety of ACS, it is better to install not a complete unit on the door from the outside, but only a reader.  Its value in case of theft will not be so noticeable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="z5r lock controller" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33051/816460.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Network ACS </h2><p>  If the system should manage access not to one or two rooms, but to several dozen, then it is built according to the network principle.  In it, all door lock <span>controllers</span> have special contacts for connecting an external interface.  This is how, for example, a network access control system of the same Iron Logic works, using a Z 5R Net network controller connected to the RS-485 interface. </p><p>  It has a control PC that connects to the common interface of all controllers through a special hardware RS-485 / USB converter.  Specialized software developed by the manufacturer of the access control system is installed on the PC, which allows you to program the controllers, manage their work, and download events. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you put on each of the many doors a regular (not network) electromagnetic lock controller Z 5R, then you will have to program each separately, and even confuse nothing with the admission of different employees to a specific room.  And if you need to periodically make changes to the system of admission to the premises?  Obviously, this can only be done centrally from the host PC. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="z 5r controller" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33051/814457.jpg" width="283"></div>

    <h2>  Typical elements of the simplest ACS </h2><p>  So, the simplest system should include: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ controller; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ reader (reader) input; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ reader (reader) output (output button); </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ electronic keys or cards; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Castle. </p><p>  We will consider the specific lock controller Z 5R below, and start with the keys for access control systems. </p><p>  The most common are tablet-type contact keys, such as Touch Memory from Iron Logic based on the Dallas iButton standard.  This key contains inside a digital code that is written to it once at the factory.  When a person touches them on the reader's contact area on the doors, he creates a single-wire 1-Wire interface circuit to power him and exchange data with the reader. </p><p>  In addition to contact "tablets", many non-contact key fobs, bracelets and cards are produced based on the EM-Marine, Mifare, etc. standards. Moreover, devices of different standards are not compatible with each other and require a reader of the same standard.  This must be taken into account when selecting ACS elements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  All keys (trinkets, cards) that the controller works with are divided into admin keys (or master keys) used to program and maintain it, as well as simple and blocking keys to enter the room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electromagnetic lock controller z 5r" class="if" height="236" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/817752.jpg" width="404"></div>

    <h2>  How do locks work in access control systems? </h2><p>  Since the logic of the output power stage of the controller circuit depends on the type of lock used in the ACS, you should deal with these types, of which there are only two - electromagnetic and electromechanical.  With the first of them, everything is very clear: in fact, it is an ordinary electromagnet with a U-shaped core.  As soon as the door closing closer presses the door to the jamb, on which the reciprocal steel part of the lock is installed, current is supplied to the electromagnet coil.  The magnetic flux of the electromagnet closes through the counterpart of the lock.  In this case, between the electromagnet and the reciprocal part, attractive forces arise that firmly press the door to the jamb.  As soon as the current in the coil is interrupted, these forces disappear and the door opens. </p><p>  In an electromechanical lock, on the contrary, when closed, the electromagnet coil is de-energized.  In this case, the spring leading the bolt ("dog") of the lock into motion is cocked and held by the locking device.  When current is supplied to the electromagnet, the locking device moves under the action of magnetic force of attraction, releases the spring, and it pushes the deadbolt inside the lock. </p><p>  Thus, if in order to open an electromagnetic lock, it is necessary to interrupt the current in the coil of its electromagnet, then in order to open an electromechanical lock, it is necessary to supply current to the coil. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="z 5 r controller connection" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33051/814431.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Z 5R controller: wiring diagram </h2><p>  The above figure shows all devices that can be connected to the controller <span>terminal block</span> .  Number 1 indicates the ‚Äútrailer‚Äù for opening the door.  The controller will not turn on the lock until the door closing closer presses it against the jamb.  Number 2 shows a typical <span>power supply,</span> such as IBPS-12-1, with an input of 220 V and an output of 12 V in a sealed design.  Number 3 is a lock.  At number 4, an LED is drawn, which is mounted close to the reader and lights up at the time the lock is opened.  The Z 5R controller can be connected to two types of locks (see below).  Number 5 denotes a normally open output button that is installed inside, number 6 - a sound alarm device (buzzer), which is also turned on when the lock is opened.  And finally, at number 7, some reader is drawn. </p>

    <h2>  Locks and logic control locks </h2><p>  How does the Z 5R controller perform this function?  The manufacturer's instructions note that he can control both electromagnetic and electromechanical locks.  For this, one of its outputs is made in the form of an open collector of an MOS transistor.  The output of the coil of the electromagnet lock is connected to this output.  A voltage of +12 V is supplied to the second output of the coil. </p><p>  The logic of the power MOS transistor is set by installing a special jumper on the controller board.  How does this circuit work?  When the jumper is not installed, the Z 5R controller operates according to the logic corresponding to the electromagnetic lock: when the lock is closed, current flows through its coil.  In this case, the output MIS transistor is open, and the output of the lock coil connected to the controller is connected to a common "minus", i.e.  current flows through the coil: the lock is on.  When the key code is recognized, the output MOS transistor closes, the current in the lock coil is interrupted, and it opens. </p><p>  With the jumper installed in position 1, the connection of the Z 5R controller corresponds to an electromechanical lock.  This lock is closed, on the contrary, in the absence of current in the coil of its electromagnet, that is, when its circuit is broken by a closed output MOS transistor.  When the <span>key</span> code is recognized, <span>the transistor, on the</span> contrary, opens, the current in the coil of the lock goes, and it also opens. </p><p>  Well, if you need to let a person without a key into the room?  After all, the reader in the ACS is one, and it is located on the doors outside.  How does the Z 5R controller work in this case?  Its connection scheme provides for the connection to one of the inputs of the output button located inside.  When pressed, the lock also opens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="z 5r controller programming" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33051/816476.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Controller Programming Principles </h2><p>  For programming, you need to connect a standard reader to it (of the same type that will be installed in the ACS).  Next, apply power to the Z 5R controller.  Programming is further carried out by short (less than 1 second) and long (about 6 seconds) touches of the reader by the admin or blocking key in the manner prescribed by the instructions. </p><p>  When you turn it on for the first time (with empty memory), all recorded keys become admin keys.  They should be marked in order to use them later for programming. </p><h2>  Operating modes </h2><p>  The manufacturer has provided several such modes.  How to install them in the controller Z 5R?  The user manual provides the following operating modes: </p><p>  1. In normal mode, the operating status of the lock is ‚Äúclosed‚Äù.  Opening occurs when touching (approaching) to the reader a simple key (key fob) recorded in memory. </p><p>  2. In the "Lock" mode, the transition to which occurs with one long (up to 6 sec) touch of the reader with a blocking key, the lock is opened only with blocking keys. </p><p>  3. In Accept mode, the transition to which occurs with five short (less than 1 second) touches of the reader with a master key, the controller restores the database of keys, allowing access to the room for several days with any keys, simultaneously recording their codes in its memory. </p><p>  4. In Trigger mode, the transition to which occurs when the jumper on the board is set to position 5, you can close the lock with one touch of a key (for example, when all employees leave for a break), and open it with a second touch (for customers to pass during working hours). </p><h2>  <span>How to erase</span> controller <span>memory</span> ? </h2><p>  Does the Z 5R controller completely erase its memory?  The user manual from Iron Logic gives an affirmative answer to this question.  To do this, firstly, with the power off, set the jumper on the controller board to position 2, then apply power and wait for a series of short beeps from the internal buzzer.  In this case, the codes of all keys and the opening time of the lock, which will be replaced by its factory setting in 3 seconds, will be erased.  Erasing memory is also possible with the help of a master key. </p><h2>  How to add simple keys? </h2><p>  After recording the master key codes, you can also enter the codes of simple keys in the Z 5R controller.  The user manual provides the following procedure for this procedure: </p><p>  1. Perform one long touch of the reader with the master key.  The buzzer of the controller with an interval of 6 seconds twice briefly signals the readiness. </p><p>  2. Remove the master key. </p><p>  3. Touch the reader with a simple key.  The buzzer will briefly signal in response. </p><p>  4. Repeat step 3 at intervals of 16 seconds. </p><p>  5. To exit the mode, touch the reader with the master key.  The buzzer will beep four times briefly.  If you just pause, the Z 5R will exit the mode by signaling in the same way. </p><h2>  How to add blocking keys? </h2><p>  Along with master and simple keys, there is a mode for writing codes and blocking keys to the Z 5R controller.  The user manual offers the following algorithm for this procedure: </p><p>  1. Enter the mode for writing codes of simple keys. </p><p>  2. Use a blocking key to touch the reader and hold it for 9 seconds. </p><p>  3. Get a short first and then a long signal. </p><p>  4. Repeat step 3 at intervals of 16 seconds. </p><h2>  How to program the opening time? </h2><p>  The door opening time (more precisely, the time the lock is turned off) can be set within wide limits.  What order does the Z 5R controller provide for this?  The user guide offers the following: </p><p>  1. Four times briefly touch the reader with the master key.  After each of the first three touches, the buzzer will briefly signal. </p><p>  2. After the fourth touch, the buzzer will beep four times briefly. </p><p>  6. Within 6 seconds after that, jumper the terminals 3 and 4 of the controller block with the jumper for the desired opening time (you can connect a regular button to them). </p><p>  7. Remove the jumper.  Receive a series of short responses. </p><h2>  Service equipment from Iron Logic </h2><p>  The Z 5R controller has a special Z-2 connector for connecting to an adapter of type Z-2 Base type for a PC.  The adapter, also manufactured by Iron Logic, connects to the PC with a USB cable.  When connected to the controller connector, the latter perceives the adapter as a reader.  Therefore, it is possible to organize with the help of specialized software both the direct programming mode of the controller from the PC and the reading mode of its memory. </p><p>  It is possible to program both Z 5R and Matrix II K, containing Z 5R inside.  In general, through the Z-2 Base, you can program any autonomous third-party controllers if they support the Dallas Touch Memor and EM-Marine protocols. </p><p>  In addition, being connected to a reader that supports these protocols, the Z-2 Base presents itself as a controller to it and can transfer key numbers to the PC in transit.  In practice, this means that, having assembled the ‚Äúreader - Z-2 Base - PC‚Äù scheme, you can use the special software to create a key database in the PC, providing each with a comment about its purpose (which room should it go to).  After that, instead of the reader, you can connect the controller and fill in the entire created base in it at one time.  The usefulness of this option for practitioners is obvious.  After all, it allows you to easily restore the complete database of keys in the new controller when the previous one fails or when it is stolen. </p>
