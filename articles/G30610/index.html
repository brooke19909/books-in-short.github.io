A lot of good hotels have been built in the village, among which there are many institutions of four-star and five-star levels.  The main feature of the famous resort is its beautiful nature.  Lush, rich vegetation makes it easier to tolerate summer heat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="my home resort hotel 5 alanya" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2021241.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But in Avsallar, tourists are attracted not only by its beautiful nature, but also by its active nightlife.  The hotel also attracts people who want to use spa services for relaxation on vacation.  The resort has many establishments offering a wide range of thalasso and spa treatments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is worth noting that Avsallar is the warmest place on the coast of Antalya.  This is due to the fact that the local bay protects the coast from the winds, even the sweetest little royal bananas have time to ripen here. </p><p>  The village has a large number of shops and boutiques, so shopping lovers will find something to do here.  But the most colorful place, of course, is the bazaar, it is on it that you can buy real oriental souvenirs.  Alara River flows through Avsallar, on the banks of which there is a beautiful Alaran palace dating from the 13th century.  Once the building served as a haven for wanderers, but now against its background vacationers like to take photos.  Local guides offer tourists to go rafting on the river, but this is only possible from March to April, since it is during this period that the water flow is very powerful. </p><h2>  Reviews of My Home Resort Hotel 5 * </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, it is worth paying attention to the reviews of vacationers who visited it this season.  After all, it is the opinion of tourists that gives us the opportunity to navigate how good or bad this or that hotel is.  It is no secret that representatives of travel agencies do not always talk about the true state of things, not telling the truth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="my home resort hotel 5 entertainment" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2021246.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for My Home Resort Hotel 5 *, reviews about it are very contradictory and ambiguous, which gives reason to talk about them in more detail. </p><p>  The hotel, like the village of Avsallar itself, is at a fairly large distance from the airport, therefore, choosing it as a place to relax, be prepared for the transfer to your destination to take about two hours.  My Home Resort Hotel 5 * (Alanya) is in a very picturesque place.  The spacious area is very beautiful and well maintained.  It can be seen that gardeners regularly look after the vegetation and flowers, everywhere it is very clean.  In general, the territory is thought out, all objects are conveniently located, there are malls along which it is nice to walk in the evening.  And there are plenty of places for exotic photos as a keepsake. </p><p>  The number of rooms My Home Resort Hotel 5 * (Alanya) is not very diverse, there are only a few categories of apartments.  However, according to tourists who visited the hotel in 2017, the rooms in which they stayed are very good.  It is noticeable that the housing stock after a good repair.  The apartments have beautiful interiors done in pastel colors.  Good furniture and new plumbing in good condition, which is very pleasing, since there is the possibility of a comfortable stay away from everyday problems.  Air conditioning in the rooms is working properly. </p><p>  But with what there is a problem in all apartments, it is with the Internet.  The hotel is positioning free Wi-Fi as an integral part of room service.  But actually this item is missing.  The fact is that the quality of wireless Internet is such that it simply is not possible to use it.  The same situation is observed throughout the complex.  Many vacationers try to use the Internet in the lobby, but even there it practically does not work.  In general, such a situation with Wi-Fi for a modern five-star hotel is unacceptable.  Since all tourists want to contact relatives or get in touch on business matters, but this is not possible at the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="my home resort hotel 5 service" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2021245.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The disadvantages of the number of rooms can also be attributed to poor sound insulation between the apartments.  You won‚Äôt be able to sleep in the morning, because the cries of the kids running around the hotel are clearly audible. </p><p>  Otherwise, vacationers have no complaints about the numbers.  The room has a minibar.  It is replenished only with drinking water, one bottle of 1.5 liters is issued to the room.  But if you leave a tip to the maid, then you will replenish supplies already with two bottles.  In general, there is no problem with drinking water, since you can take it yourself at the reception.  The room has a safe, but you must pay three dollars a day for using it. </p><p>  In the bathrooms there are gels, soap, bathing caps and shampoos.  Detergent supplies are regularly updated by staff without reminders.  But there are no bathrobes and slippers.  Maids are cleaned regularly, vacationers have no complaints about their work.  Towels and bedding are changed every day.  It should be noted that all the linen in the hotel is new and clean, without spots and scuffs. </p><p>  The hotel rooms can overlook the sea coast, backyard and have side sea views.  It is difficult to say which of them is more relaxed to rest in, because behind the hotel there is a road along which transport moves even at night.  And in front of the hotel, night show programs are held, however, they all end by 12.00, so they don‚Äôt interfere, especially when the windows are closed. </p><p>  In general, tourists leave the best reviews regarding living conditions. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Regarding food in My Home Resort Hotel 5 *, hotel guests have a mixed opinion.  Reviews of tourists are quite different - from complete enthusiasm to discontent.  All guests note a large selection of dishes in the main restaurant, but at the same time, many believe that they are not diverse, and taste sometimes fail.  The chef of the restaurant prepares mainly traditional Turkish dishes, which not all tourists like.  Especially there are difficulties with feeding children who do not like spicy and salty dishes.  According to some tourists, the level of food does not match the stardom of the institution. </p><p>  Despite the mixed reviews, in general the food is scarce at the hotel, because the tables have meat dishes, salads, grilled vegetables, Turkish sweets and much more.  During the high season in the restaurant there is a large crowd of people.  Waiters do not always have time to clean the tables. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="my home resort hotel 5 food" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2021247.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The complex has many bars that prepare all kinds of snacks throughout the day.  Therefore, it is difficult to get hungry here.  Bartenders also offer good drinks and cocktails.  There is a bar on the beach.  It mainly offers fast food from food, and water and beer from drinks. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  The resort My Home Resort Hotel 5 * offers its guests not only relaxation, but also an animation program.  The hotel has an activism team that offers its services quite unobtrusively.  In terms of recreational activities, the opinions of tourists also differ.  Some believe that the level of animation is quite good and quite acceptable for lovers of measured and relaxing holiday.  But young people, on the contrary, believe that entertainment is not enough, so the complex is not suitable for active young people. </p><p>  In the evenings, the amphitheater hosts a mini-disco for kids, and after it an entertaining show for adults.  Programs consist of hotel animator group numbers.  Several times a week, invited artists participate in the evening show, sometimes there is even a fire show, which is always popular with holidaymakers. </p><p>  As for the opportunity to play sports, the situation here is slightly better.  The complex has a volleyball court and even a golf course.  And yet, all vacationers agree in the common opinion that supporters of a relaxing holiday can visit the complex. </p><p>  The hotel has a kids club.  It is very small and not very clean.  It can be seen that the toys do not wash.  In addition, children are not accepted in it by appointment, which means they can leave it themselves, which is unacceptable for parents who plan to leave the child to play themselves, and in the meantime attend wellness treatments and massage. </p><p>  Description of the hotel My Home Resort Hotel 5 * would be incomplete, if not to remember the beach.  The hotel is located on the first line, but not quite on the coast.  Therefore, you need to walk to the beach.  The road leading to the sea causes a lot of negative feedback, as it passes by a stream of unknown origin.  This stream flows into the sea just on the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="resort my home" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2021248.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The coast near the hotel is quite gentle and comfortable for swimming, despite the fact that in very many places in the village of Avsallar the coast has a steep slope, so the depth begins quickly.  In this regard, the hotel beach is convenient for children.  It has umbrellas and sunbeds.  As elsewhere, there are lovers from early morning to borrow sun loungers with towels.  Arriving at eleven o'clock in the morning on the shore, most likely, you can not find a good place.  Therefore, tourists recommend taking sun loungers early.  In this regard, almost all hotels in Turkey are the same.  Beach towels at the hotel are issued, but with a deposit of ten dollars. </p><p>  Most of the guests of the complex My Home Resort Hotel 5 * (Turkey) are Germans and representatives of the post-Soviet space, so most of the staff of the institution understands, or even speaks Russian.  You can always explain at the reception, there is no language barrier, even if you do not speak English.  In this regard, the hotel is good for Russian tourists.  In general, the staff of the complex is very attentive and courteous.  Reception workers try to check in early on the ‚Äúearly‚Äù guests, who due to circumstances arrive earlier than 14.00.  In general, the service staff is delivered at the proper level.  The maids do an excellent job.  As for tips, whether to reward employees with them is a purely personal matter.  In principle, no one extorts them.  Good staff at the hotel is the key to a wonderful stay. </p><h2>  Recommendations of tourists </h2><p>  The resort village of Avsallar is very small, so it does not have any special attractions.  Relaxing at the hotel, you can use the services of representatives of local travel agencies and go on an excursion.  But if you do not like group trips, then you can easily see the nearest attractions on your own.  Fortunately, the transport connection at the resort is well established, so at local dolmushi you can get to the right place. </p><p>  There are car rental locations nearby.  They can rent a car for travel.  On average, renting a decent car costs about $ 35 per day, older cars can cost less.  The presence of transport facilitates movement and provides an amazing opportunity to see something new. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="my home resort hotel 5 hotel description" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2021251.jpg" width="600"></div>
