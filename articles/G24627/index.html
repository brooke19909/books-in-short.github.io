But looking closer, you understand that it is made of the smallest grains of multi-colored beads.  And such painstaking work attracts your eyes and fascinates for a long time.  So why not try to create such a beauty with your own hands?  The belt from beads perfectly approaches under many wardrobes, under many styles.  And in the eyes of others you will be the owner of a truly chic accessory. </p><h2>  Basic techniques for creating an embroidered belt </h2><p>  There are several ways to create a unique wardrobe item.  They will differ both in the time spent, and in the resources, and in your imagination.  You can always combine several techniques into one, then you will get the original thing as a result.  Check out the basic options for making a bead belt: </p><ul><li>  woven fabric of beads and kapron thread or fishing line for weaving, </li><li>  openwork weaving from the same materials, </li><li>  beadwork on a satin ribbon, </li><li>  beadwork on a leather belt, </li><li>  belt in the technique of soutache. </li></ul><p>  Of course, in your wardrobe such accessories will not be superfluous.  Therefore, give your preferred method detailed attention. </p><h2>  Solid Beaded Fabric </h2><p>  In addition to beads and fishing lines, you will need accessories, scissors and needles.  The very essence of weaving is as follows.  You get as many beads on the first row as the width of the belt itself.  The second and all subsequent rows are created by adding two beads at a time.  Thus, a semblance of a woven scarf is entirely made of beads. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Geometric Bead Belt" class="if uuid-2740737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2740737.jpg"></div><p>  A separate nuance is the creation of holes in the bead belt.  As in a regular belt, gaps are required for fasteners.  And this is done by an elementary pass of two beads in a row.  The frequency and number of such holes you adjust to your needs. </p><p>  The result is a great accessory consisting of solid bead rows.  You can approach the creation of such a thing in another way.  Try to weave a similar belt on a special machine.  This method takes less time, but will not affect the quality at all. </p><h2>  Color and plot lines of the bead canvas </h2><p>  In this matter, each will be determined personally for himself.  Some choose monotonous one-color belts, while others prefer to combine several shades of the same color.  Still others make a belt of beads with any pattern or pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sarongi.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Green Bead Belt" class="if uuid-2740742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2740742.jpg"></div><p>  Among the variety of patterns for your accessory there are the most used ones, for example, floral motifs can be attributed to the classics of the genre.  No less popular are embroidered animals or birds, as well as imitation of the skin pattern.  Belt ornaments remain relevant and fashionable.  As a universal scheme, abstract geometric or openwork patterns are used. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.beadcrochetsnakes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ideas for belt patterns" class="if uuid-2740745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2740745.jpg"></div><p>  You can use ready-made schemes or come up with your own.  You can select and replace it with your favorite colors in the finished pattern or leave the original source.  Everything remains solely at your discretion. </p><h2>  Openwork belt </h2><p>  In other words, instead of a continuous web of beads, you decorate your waist with a figured belt of beads.  So now instead of choosing a pattern scheme, you focus on embroidering a repeating element from beads.  It can be interconnected flowers, geometric details or any other elements made of beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="simplyfabdress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Openwork belt from beads" class="if uuid-2740739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2740739.jpg"></div><p>  Such belts look great in monochrome, for example, a translucent white belt will be a great addition to the bride‚Äôs costume.  Use bright and rich colors such as yellow, orange, lime, blue.  And your accessory will become indispensable in summer dresses.  Black or black and white belts perfectly complement and diversify the official style, giving some zest to the business image. </p><h2>  Beaded satin belt </h2><p>  This option is perfect for those who want to use a colored substrate under a layer of beads.  Since there will be gaps between the beads, the background will be slightly visible.  Therefore, a satin ribbon will serve as an excellent material for embroidering pictures on it or a pattern of your future accessory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fashionempire.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Satin ribbon bead belt" class="if uuid-2740741" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2740741.jpg"></div><p>  Among other things, you can make a belt that will better keep its shape, as opposed to a canvas made of beads.  To do this, you will need two tapes of fabric and a tape of a more durable material, for example, foam rubber or thick cardboard. </p><h2>  Leather and bugles </h2><p>  An interesting combination is a belt of beads on a leather substrate.  You can use the finished belt as a base.  Or do all the necessary preparatory work on your own from a cut of the skin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.langstons.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Leather belt embroidered with beads" class="if uuid-2740738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2740738.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, consider that the skin is a material that is strong enough and thick.  Therefore, embroidering will be a little more difficult than on fabric. </p><h2>  Bead Elements </h2><p>  Some people like a solid canvas made of beads, while others prefer to embroider a belt with beads in fragments.  In other words, your openwork belt is superimposed on another basis - leather, fabric or another belt. </p><p>  This method of creating a belt is good in that the embroidered pattern will look more voluminous and more effective than in a continuous belt of beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Openwork belt" class="if uuid-2740743" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2740743.jpg"></div><p>  You can use any motives and patterns, ornaments.  Try to use the fragment of the picture you like and just repeat it throughout the belt. </p><h2>  In technology soutache </h2><p>  This technique is distinguished by its sophistication, elegance of lines.  Accessories made in the technique of soutache perfectly complement the wardrobe of both graceful girls and respectable ladies of age. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Satin Ribbon Belt" class="if uuid-2740740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80783/2740740.jpg"></div><p>  You can create a chic buckle for your belt, make a belt entirely from a soutache cord, beads, cabochons.  In order for the product to retain its shape in its original form, fasten your embroidery on a reliable material.  Again, it can be a durable leather belt, reinforced satin ribbons or felt lining. </p>
