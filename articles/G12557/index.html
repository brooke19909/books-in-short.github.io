The width of the unit is 60 cm, the depth is a little more - 63 cm. This model comes with rounded sidewalls on the doors, so it visually seems wider than its analogues.  The handles are hidden in the doors and do not protrude above the surface.  Mistresses note that this layout greatly facilitates the care of the refrigerator.  Furthermore, such recess handles cannot be broken.  At the factory assembly, the refrigerator door opens from left to right, but if desired, it can be outweighed.  There are 2 wheels at the back of the refrigerator, legs in front that can be adjusted in height.

This is also evidenced by the letter A, which is in its name.  For a while, class A was considered the maximum energy efficiency mode, but now you can find models A + or even A ++.  In the <span>freezer, the</span> temperature can drop to -18 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="refrigerator Indesit BIA 18 reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/1874486.jpg" width="279"></div>  In the refrigerator compartment, it reaches a maximum value of +5.  The power of freezing of this model is 2 kg per hour.  The declared noise level is 39 dB, for a device with No Frost it is slightly higher - 43 dB.  Buyers should also consider that the volume of the refrigerator compartment, depending on the defrosting system installed, is also slightly different.  This is due to the fact that No Frost "eats" part of the usable space.  The volume of the Indesit BIA 18 NF refrigeration compartment is 308 liters, and models with auto-defrosting are 5 liters larger.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Indesit BIA 18 NF refrigerator, like its counterpart to auto-defrost, comes with a freshness zone.  In fact, it is a plastic container for perishable foods such as chilled meat or fish.  Similar in appearance and having the same purpose, they are still somewhat different.  In the Indesit BIA 18 NF model, the freshness zone is located directly opposite the openings through which the cold enters.  And in refrigerators with auto-defrosting, it is just a container at the bottom of the chamber.  The compartment does not close tightly; if desired, it can be rearranged to any other place.  In fact, zero degrees, which should be maintained in the freshness zone, is achieved due to the natural difference.  There are two drawers in the chamber, both drawers and are made of transparent plastic, which facilitates visibility. </p><h2>  Door </h2><p>  <span>The</span> <span><span>Indesit</span></span> <span><span>BIA</span></span> <span>18</span> <span>refrigerator door</span> <span>has shelves for storing food.</span>  <span>The bottom is the widest.</span>  <span>A 2-liter package of juice can easily fit on such a shelf.</span>  <span>When buying, some customers pay attention to the ‚Äústrange‚Äù flexible plastic strip attached to it.</span>  <span>This is a bottle holder.</span>  <span>If the door is opened sharply, then containers that are unstable can fall out.</span>  <span>The holder presses the bottles of small diameter to the side, thereby reliably fixing them.</span>  <span>Shelves on the door can be rearranged in a small range, depending on the required height.</span>  <span>The uppermost one has a hinged lid.</span>  <span>It is intended for medicines that must be stored at a certain temperature.</span>  <span>The cover prevents the spread of a specific smell throughout the chamber.</span> </p><h2>  Control Panel </h2><p>  <span>These models do not have a display, so the control panel is very simple: the temperature control knob and the indicator light.</span>  <span>The latter lights up when the unit is plugged in.</span>  <span>In</span> <span><span>Indesit</span></span> <span><span>BIA</span></span> <span>18, the controller changes the temperature when turning in both the refrigerator and freezer compartments.</span>  <span>But in models with the</span> <span><span>No</span></span> <span><span>Frost</span></span> <span>system</span> <span>there is an additional control knob, which is connected with a plug on the back wall.</span>  <span>It is installed above the drawers in the refrigerator compartment and changes the temperature in it when turning up or down.</span>  <span>Also on the control panel you can see the "Super" mode.</span>  <span>When it is turned on, the compressor works without stopping, quickly gaining the temperature necessary to freeze a large volume of products.</span> </p><h2>  Compressor </h2><p>  <span>Danish DaNFoss compressors are installed in the refrigerators of this model.</span>  <span>They fully meet modern requirements for safety, reliability and efficiency.</span> </p><h2>  Color </h2><p>  Indesit BIA 18 refrigerators are available in several variations.  Most often on store stands this model can be seen in white.  This is a classic color that will suit any kitchen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Indesit BIA 18 NF refrigerator" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/1874907.jpg" width="500"></div>  Silver models are a little less common, for example, the Indesit BIA 18 S refrigerator. Or made ‚Äústainless steel‚Äù (the letter H is written at the end of the name).  The colored surface looks more original, although it requires a certain interior.  Silvery refrigerators are dull, they are almost invisible streaks and prints.  But on glossy models made under stainless steel, every touch will leave its mark.  Another option that is rarely seen in stores is black refrigerators, the so-called "anthracite."  They are ideal in care, but not suitable for every kitchen.

Reviews indicate that most of the owners are satisfied with their purchase.</span>  <span>Spacious freezer and refrigerator, fast cooling, reasonable price, convenient location of shelves and balconies - this is an incomplete list of the advantages of this model.</span>  <span>However, it can not do without complaints.</span> </p><p>  <span>In addition to significant defects that are detected on the first day after purchase, for example, a broken compressor or a broken temperature regulator, the owners note smaller ones.</span>  <span>These include a high noise level (a consequence of the</span> <span><span>No</span></span> <span><span>Frost</span></span> <span>system</span> <span><span>)</span></span> <span>, rapid ice formation, and low build quality.</span>  <span>Some buyers note that after several years of operation, the gums around the door perimeter begin to sag and do not hold well, however, this problem is typical for many manufacturers.</span> </p><p>  <span>Sometimes you can find complaints about poor-quality plastic, which over time becomes brittle (especially in the freezer compartment under the influence of freezing temperatures).</span>  <span>However, given that this refrigerator is not a premium and is inexpensive, relative to its multi-functional "brothers" from other manufacturers, the purchase can be considered a successful acquisition.</span>  <span>And if necessary, order damaged shelves or balconies through company service centers.</span> </p>
