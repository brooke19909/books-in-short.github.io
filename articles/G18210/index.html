Among the most popular are LED streetlights.  Why do they use them?  After all, they have not only positive, but also negative sides. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Street LED floodlights can function in any climatic conditions, that is, withstand large temperature differences and any precipitation.  In addition, they are not subject to mechanical damage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="10 watt LED spotlight" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1193183.jpg" width="468"></div>  Another significant indicator is low power consumption.  Thanks to this quality, the <span>LED spotlight has</span> gained popularity.  It began to be used not only for domestic purposes, but also for <span>lighting industrial</span> and security facilities.

    <h2>  The advantages of flashlights </h2><p>  Among the positive qualities of LED spotlights, the following are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Low power consumption.  Compared to conventional incandescent lamps, LED lights consume 10 times less.  This indicator was compared with energy-saving lamps.  The measurement result showed that power consumption is 3 times less. </li><li>  Long service life. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="led spotlights reviews" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1193194.jpg" width="240"></div>  The layout of the LED spotlight is quite simple, so it can function for 10 years. </li><li>  Made of environmentally friendly materials, that is, do not harm the environment. </li></ul><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Like any device, such lights have negative sides: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  high price; </li><li>  many manufacturers assign a life of 10 years.  However, this figure is not true.  The lamp works no more than 5 years.  It all depends on the conditions of use.  During continuous operation, the LEDs deteriorate.  First, they lose brightness, and then burn out completely. </li><li>  To increase the service life it is necessary to use an additional source of cooling and power.  Such devices serve to protect the flashlight from power surges.  However, the cost of such devices is quite high. </li></ul><h2>  Design </h2><p>  LED lights consist of such structural elements: </p><ul><li>  reflector; </li><li>  voltage transformer; </li><li>  in some cases, motion sensors are used. </li></ul><h2>  Classification of lighting equipment </h2><p>  LED spotlights are divided by the following characteristics: </p><ol><li>  By appointment: general-purpose and special devices (used to protect various objects). </li><li>  By color. </li><li>  Type of housing: can be rectangular, square, round. </li><li>  Voltage. </li><li>  Protection level: can be used both for ground use and underwater. </li></ol><h2>  Flashlight with sensor </h2><p>  Such lighting devices are used to illuminate a specific area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="led spotlights Price" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1193184.jpg" width="287"></div>  They are for short range use only.  The principle of operation is that the spotlight starts to shine when people, animals, cars appear in a given zone, and fades away after a while.  Thanks to this mode, energy is significantly saved and the service life of the device is increased.

Many people are interested in the question: how does a 10 W LED floodlight shine?  <span>The LED matrix</span> is in a metal housing.  A power supply is installed here, which, in addition to the basic functions, serves to remove heat from the matrix.  Thus, when operating the spotlight, the optimum temperature is ensured.  The device operates from a normal consumer electrical network, with a voltage of 220 V. Therefore, it is not required to use any other equipment. </p><h2>  10W LED floodlight - how does it shine? </h2><p>  It uses a special diffuser, thanks to which it can shine at an angle of 120 ¬∞.  This type of flashlight is designed for outdoor use, therefore special requirements are imposed on it: it must carry moisture, and also not be exposed to various changes in climate and precipitation.  It can function at temperatures from -30 ¬∞ C to + 45 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  additional information </h2><p>  10W LED floodlight - how does it shine? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED street lights" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1193185.jpg" width="305"></div>  The device illuminates small areas, such as a path or area near the door.  Thanks to its design, installation is easy.  In addition, you can connect additional devices, such as a motion sensor or sound sensor.  Extensive matrix floodlights are used to illuminate large areas.  To illuminate summer cottages, solar-powered devices are used, and for the adjacent territory - a wall-mounted view.  Today, the popular manufacturers of this device are Ledkos, Delux, Technolux.

    <h2>  Advantages of flashlights 10 W </h2><p>  Among the positive aspects note: </p><ul><li>  Low power consumption.  Despite this quality, LED floodlights, the price of which ranges from 400 to 2000 rubles, judging by the reviews, show good illumination. </li><li>  Long service life.  Reviews say that flashlights can work for 5 years.  This period may be longer if used correctly.  A big role is played by lamps.  To increase the service life, it is recommended to use expensive and high-quality lamps. </li><li>  Safe for humans.  LED lamps consist of substances that do not affect human health, that is, the luminous flux does not affect vision. </li><li>  LED spotlights are made up of small elements.  Users note a big plus - they do not heat up and that is why even the most complex tasks of lighting the territory are solved with the help of them. </li></ul><p>  Due to their technical characteristics and easy operation, LED spotlights have become popular among the population.  They are used not only for domestic needs, but also for industrial ones. </p><h2>  50W LED floodlight </h2><p>  This is another popular model.  It is worth noting that even the Chinese assembly of this device is at a high level. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="50w led floodlight" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1193186.jpg" width="375"></div>  It can function even in the most terrible weather conditions.  To prevent moisture from entering the housing, the internal circuit is securely sealed.  All elements are covered not only with paint, but also with varnish.  Thanks to this, the elements are not oxidized, and even after 10 years, the LED lamp will look like new.  The power of this device is 50 watts.  With it, you can illuminate a fairly large area.  They are installed for protection, for lighting large summer cottages and <span>adjoining territories.</span>  The light is white, similar to that emitted from a conventional incandescent lamp.
