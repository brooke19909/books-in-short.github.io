This is due to many factors and in different <span>parts of the world</span> is not the same.  Therefore, it is very difficult to monitor how many people live in the world.  However, rough data do exist. </p><h2>  Planet population </h2><p>  Today, about 7 billion people live in the world, it is difficult to give exact data, since someone is constantly born and someone is dying.  For the most part, the number of people in a given country depends on several factors, including the level of development of the state and, in particular, medicine, the standard of living, and even human temperament. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many people in the world" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/423162.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Many centuries ago, there were much fewer people on Earth, but over time this figure has grown rapidly.  Despite the global epidemics, diseases and terrible <span>ecology, people</span> continue to multiply and inhabit every piece of the planet.  Most of the population lives in the most developed cities, where the standard of living is higher than in small cities, the same applies to countries.  About half the people live in the most populated countries. </p><h2>  China </h2><p>  The first place is rightfully occupied by <span>China.</span>  <span>The population of</span> this country almost reaches the figure of 1.5 billion, that is, almost 1/5 of the number of people in the world today.  Despite the fact that the government is trying in every possible way to deal with the birth rate, the number of people in the country is still growing rapidly, increasing by about 8.7 million annually. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  India </h2><p>  If we talk about how many people are in the world now, then the second place among the most populated states belongs to India.  About 1.17 billion people live here, which makes up about 17% of the total world population.  The annual population growth in this country is about 18 million people, that is, Indians have every chance to get around the number of Chinese. </p><h2>  USA </h2><p>  Due to the constant influx of immigrants from less developed neighboring countries, the United States leads the world‚Äôs most populated countries.  About 307 million people of various nationalities live in this state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many people are there in the world" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/423161.jpg" width="530"></div>

    <h2>  Indonesia </h2><p>  The fourth position in the list is occupied by a state located in Southeast Asia.  About 240 million people live on its territory, which makes up about 3.5% of the total <span>population of the Earth.</span> </p><h2>  Brazil </h2><p>  The top five is concluded by this sunny country, which in combination is the most populated state in South America.  Exactly 3% of how many people in the world live in Brazil.  The number of inhabitants of this state reaches 198 million inhabitants. </p><h2>  Pakistan </h2><p>  The sixth place belongs to Pakistan, in which, according to the latest data, about 176 million people live, which make up 2.6% of the total population of our planet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many people live in the world" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/422237.jpg" width="466"></div>

That is, the number of Bangladeshis is about 2.3% of the inhabitants of planet Earth. </p><h2>  Nigeria </h2><p>  This African country is also among the top ten in terms of population.  The number of people living here reaches 149 million, that is 2.2% of all people on the planet.  In addition, Nigeria occupies a leading position in terms of fertility, which may soon help it overtake Bangladesh. </p><h2>  Russia </h2><p>  A significant part of how many people live on the planet falls on Russia.  Despite the fact that Russia <span>is the largest country in the world,</span> in terms of population it is only in 9th place.  This is due to the fact that mortality here significantly exceeds fertility.  The territory of this state accounts for about 2% of the population of the entire Earth, that is, about 140 million people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many people live on the planet" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/422240.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Japan </h2><p>  Closes the top ten Country of the rising sun, which, however, is the most developed of all presented above.  About 127 million people live here, that is, 1.9% of the world's population.  Which is important, since the country is in a somewhat mothballed condition, almost all of its population is native Japanese. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The World Health Organization regulates the population of states and controls how many people are in the world.  In order to somehow reduce the birth rate in very poor African countries, missionaries are regularly sent there to give lectures to the local population and provide them with the necessary contraception.  Other states are taking other measures.  For example, in China, the authorities are struggling with too high a birth rate by setting taxes for families who want to have more than one child.  But such measures are extremely necessary, because the resources of our planet are limited, and how many people in the world are very influential on them.  Therefore, it is simply necessary to avoid <span>overpopulation of the planet in</span> order to prevent future environmental catastrophe and serious depletion of all the natural resources of our planet Earth. </p>
