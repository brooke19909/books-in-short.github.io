    <p>  Thanks to the spread of the world wide web, a huge number of opportunities has appeared to form a constant and stable source of good income without leaving home.  The number of destinations is unlimited.  This is not only affiliate programs, their own sites, but also investing in successful stock market managers, much more.  Passive income on the Internet is noteworthy in that it is available to almost everyone, including young parents and students who are not able to work full time.  A big plus is that all the materials on organizing the source of profit can be found on the Internet, and clearly following the instructions, the result will not be long in coming.  No special education, let alone diplomas from the university, is required in this case. </p><h2>  Investments on exchanges </h2><p>  Investing on exchanges is the simplest and most cost-effective passive income.  Options for inexperienced players in the foreign exchange market are not very diverse and are more limited to deposits in PAMM accounts.  Simply put, the deposit is transferred to the management of a qualified trader who, for a certain percentage of the profit, increases the capital using trading tools.  Depending on the qualifications of the trader, the profit on invested money can vary from 150% or more per year.  Funds can be either reinvested or withdrawn.  The main thing here is to study the principles of choosing PAMM-account managers.  There are risks to lose your deposit or part of it, but it is quite possible to minimize them by differentiating risks and distributing capital. </p><p>  Advantages: the opportunity to earn income from the first month of investment. </p><p>  Disadvantages: an incorrect decision on the direction of investment can lead to a drain of the deposit. </p><h2>  Personal site </h2>

    <p>  Studying passive income on the Internet, you can not say about creating your own website.  A popular and interesting project can bring a good profit.  A resource on which there is traffic (a constant flow of visitors) is in demand for advertising, affiliate programs and network business.  If in the first stages of the project development you have to spend a certain percentage of the total income and a lot of time, then you practically do not need to spend energy on maintaining the site‚Äôs profitability. </p><p>  Many argue that to create a site you need to learn the programming language and the structure of SEO optimization.  In fact, the finished frame can be ordered at the agency or from a freelancer.  SEO optimization can be carried out independently.  As an alternative to the creation and promotion - this is the purchase of a ready-made working portal with a certain profitability.  All that remains is to maintain an existing <span>source of income</span> in working condition. </p><p>  Advantages: income is unlimited.  It all depends on the activity of the creator of the project. </p><p>  Disadvantages: it takes time to learn a new area. </p><h2>  Public Pages </h2><p>  Creating a public page on a social network is another promising passive income.  Options without attachments are not so common, but this is just one of them.  Specialized skills for public design are not required.  The constructor is at the disposal of the network user.  It is enough to fill the project with interesting information and attract as many members of the group as possible.  In the future, the prospects for earnings are as follows: paid placement of advertising, banners, informers, links.  The most popular topics are women, men, relationships, sports and cooking. </p><h2>  YouTube Video Blog </h2>

    <p>  The most popular options for passive income in the USA are the creation of various kinds of video blogs, including on the YouTube channel.  Profit will be driven by advertising, which will be distributed as part of the blog.  This perspective opens up opportunities not only for link trading and advertising sales, but also for direct cooperation with the advertiser.  Customers are willing to pay impressive fees for reviews of their own products, for their description in a positive way.  It is natural that the more subscribers on the channel, the higher its reward can be expected by its owner. </p><p>  Advantages: unlimited profit threshold. </p><p>  Disadvantages: the need to constantly maintain the popularity of the channel. </p><h2>  Why are people afraid of passive income? </h2><p>  When considering options for <span>passive income on the Internet,</span> users are discouraged by the fact that there is a certain time gap between the work done and wages.  People are used to constantly doing a certain amount of work and immediately get their reward.  Work for the future scares the majority.  An important role is played by fears related to the fact that the expended resources will not be rewarded.  No one was used to wasting time and investing without knowing what result it would bring. </p>

    <p>  In Western countries, passive income options are actively considered by millions of people.  They prefer a one-time investment and loss of time with the goal of not thinking about the level of their material well-being in the future.  Everyone strives to get away from daily, monthly and annual visits to one workplace.  Stable wages, which is the guarantee of stability, are gradually losing their attractiveness.  The search for alternative earnings options is in fashion, with large profits and minimal effort and time. </p>
