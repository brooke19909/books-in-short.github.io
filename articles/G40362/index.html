It is located in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSharm el-Sheikh, although somewhat far from its old center.  The hotel is part of the Concord El Salam complex, located by the sea.  This is a five-star zone.  Another hotel with a lower rank - Concorde El Salam Sport Hotel - is also part of this complex.  It was built across the road from El Salam, away from the coast.  Guests of Front Area can use all the services and services of Sport and walk around its territory, and vice versa.  In addition, between the two halves of the complex very often there is a mini-bus, so very lazy guests can use it.  This hotel has earned many praises from vacationers.  Most of those who left reviews on various travel sites and forums wrote only positive comments about him.  No wonder he entered the top ten most popular hotels in Sharm.  This fame is well deserved.  However, let's get to know the hotel in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Concorde el salam front area" class="if" height="217" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/761507.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The Concorde El Salam Front Area Hotel is not very far from Ras Nazran Airport - just four kilometers away.  Therefore, the transfer will be short-lived.  And this is important for those tired of the five-hour flight (and even if from Moscow) tourists.  At the same time, most of the rooms are turned with windows facing the sea, and take-off and landing aircraft are almost inaudible.  And the hotel is twenty kilometers from the old center of Sharm.  The area in which the hotel is located is called White Night Beach, or White Knights Beach.  It is very close to the shopping and entertainment center and the main attraction of Sharm el Sheikh - Soho, where guests can walk on foot in the evenings.  Opposite the Concorde El Salam Front, there are shops at reasonable prices.  Only, of course, you need to bargain.  So the location of the hotel, one might say, is just perfect. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sharm El Sheikh, White Knights Beach </h2><p>  It is intended for tourists from Western Europe to relax, therefore it is considered more ‚Äúpolished‚Äù, and prices here ‚Äúbite‚Äù more painfully than in Hurghada.  But the service is better.  Sharm el Sheikh, of course, is a relatively large resort area, but all of it can be reached by car in about forty minutes.  It is conditionally divided into areas whose names coincide with the names of the bays.  Each of them has its own charms and shortcomings, and here it all depends on how you imagine your holiday in Sharm.  For example, Montaza is suitable for divers and lovers of peace, but there are no parties and nightlife.  Nabq is not very good for children and winter holidays.  The center of tourist pastime - Naama Bay - can not boast of good corals.  But Sharks Bay is one of the most ideal areas of Sharm in every sense.  It is located in a closed bay, it is warm in winter, very cold winds do not blow.  Yes, and a lot of reefs.  In this paradise oasis are the most expensive Sharm hotels, such as Savoy or Four Seasons.  The location of Concorde El Salam Front Hotel - White Knight Bay, or White Knights Beach - is located in the Sharks area.  This resort area is quite new, so the reefs here are not trampled and fish are not frightened. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Concorde el salam hotel" class="if" height="217" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/761509.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Which travel companies cooperate with the hotel </h2><p>  Many travel and travel companies are in a hurry to reserve places here in advance.  Especially in high season.  Due to the frenzied popularity of Concorde El Salam holidaymakers, tours to this hotel are always sold out.  Low prices - an average of approximately seventy thousand rubles for two for ten days - to relax in such an upscale hotel in Sharm are very attractive for those who want to soak up the Egyptian sun and swim in the Red Sea.  Well-known companies (sharks in the tourism business) such as Coral Travel, Chiprip, Tui, Sanmar and others have long been working with the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Concorde et salam front" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/761511.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory and infrastructure of the complex </h2><p>  According to tourists, the hotel Concorde El Salam Front Area 5 * has where to turn around.  Given that these are actually two hotels, the territory is simply huge.  The main building, where the reception is located, offers stunning views of the sea.  The buildings are beautiful, comfortable, two-story.  They are located like islands in the middle of the park, which creates an additional impression of comfort.  Everywhere is spacious, many paths, flowers, green grass.  Plants are exotic, lush, many different arbors.  Lawns are looked after daily.  Pools are perfectly combined with the architecture of the hotel.  One of them has a very beautiful waterfall.  They follow the tracks, even wash the asphalt.  All trails and alleys lead to the sea, so you do not get lost.  True, the territory is quite hilly, a lot of stairs.  Therefore, you go down to the beach, but you will have to stomp up the hill back.  Concorde El Salam Front Area provides parking for your own or rental cars.  On the territory there are shopping malls with shops where you can buy souvenirs, perfumes, various beach trifles without having to go to Sharma shopping centers.  There are also two huge halls for holding various conferences and seminars, each of which can accommodate two hundred and fifty participants.  At night, the hotel grounds are illuminated by a perfectly selected illumination - you can walk and enjoy.  Concorde El Salam Sharm overlooks Tiran Island.  Accommodation in the buildings is as follows: ‚Äúthousandth‚Äù rooms are located farthest from the sea, and ‚Äúsix thousandth‚Äù is already ‚Äúsea view‚Äù.  "Five thousandth" - near the main pool and reception.  And all the rest are between them.  From the farthest rooms to the main building, where the main restaurant, lobby and spa are located, five minutes of quiet running, and to the sea - maximum seven to ten. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Concorde el salam front reviews" class="if" height="204" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/761517.jpg" width="299"></div>

    <h2>  Service at Concorde El Salam: reviews </h2><p>  Since this is a five-star hotel, the services for tourists in it are up to standard.  Among the standard services that are in the hotel, tourists call the opportunity to consult a doctor, wash and clean clothes.  Many of the categorical advantages of the hotel include free Wi-Fi working in the lobby (in Egypt, Internet access is usually for money).  In addition, there are a lot of opportunities to go in for sports, and not just spend a lazy "seal" on the sea, but keep yourself in shape.  Here you can play tennis, learn to ride a horse (this is on the territory of the Sport Hotel) or take <span>scuba diving</span> lessons.  Animators will lure you into aerobics and oriental dances.  The guys here are working pleasant, unobtrusive.  But everything is so well organized that people themselves go to them.  A great gym and an attentive instructor are the pride of Concorde El Salam Front.  Reviews are unanimous in this.  A sauna and hammam will help you relax and ‚Äúpolish‚Äù your tan.  All this can be visited without restrictions and completely free.  On the territory of "Sport" active vacationers play volleyball.  There is a special area.  Yes, and for fans of board games everything is provided for - billiards, table tennis ... For children from four to fourteen, a mini-club is open.  For kids there is an equipped playground.  And at the Sport Hotel they can even skate.  Evening animation for children is also there.  The reception is open 24 hours a day and quickly solves the problems that arise.  Those who want to go to Naama Bay by a free hotel bus should discuss this issue with the administration - on the day when they want to visit the center of Sharma.  At the lobby bar and dinner for four to five dollars, you can order a hookah. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Concorde el salam 5 reviews" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/761518.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cuisine and Gourmet </h2><p>  Concorde El Salam Hotel, like most sharmovskih "fives", feeds its guests on an all inclusive system.  If you come with a child, you can not only choose a children's menu among the huge variety of dishes from the local buffet, but also take your offspring to a special corner in the Laguna restaurant.  There is also a buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner for all-inclusive guests.  Clean napkins folded by "cranes", starched tablecloths - everything, as in high society.  The restaurant has a Russian cook.  Therefore, if you do not like the exotic cuisine, you will feel at home, despite the fact that you eat in the elegant interior of Concorde El Salam 5 *.  Reviews say that here you can create this or that dish yourself.  There are vending machines with different varieties of coffee.  A lot of chopped vegetables for salads, which you can mix as desired and pour any sauce.  There is also a <span>summer terrace,</span> where entertainers, singers, dancers and guest stars entertain guests at the evening meal.  The food at the hotel is designed for gourmets.  Insanely delicious fish, amazing mashed soups, oriental sweets ... There are seafood, beef, lamb, chicken, pasta with different toppings.  In the evenings there is a lamb on the grill, stuffed turkey.  Excellent drinks, especially coffee, a large selection of tea, juices, in the morning - milk.  On Wednesdays - evenings of oriental delicacies.  Drinks are brought by the waiters day and night.  Almost every day - themed dinners with a presentation of dishes from different countries.  In addition to the main restaurant, the hotel has two √† la carte establishments - with Italian cuisine and the Flame grill.  There are also many bars at your service: on the beach (the most popular of them is Vendom), a disco, by the pools.  One of them is especially appreciated by tourists for great cocktails.  This bar is located by the Infinity Pool.  There is even a diner with exclusively fish menu.  For one hundred and fifty dollars, the hotel offers a romantic candlelit dinner right on the beach - with flowers for the lady and alcohol.  Tourists write that the food here is very tasty and varied. </p><h2>  Sea vacations, water activities </h2><p>  Concorde El Salam Hotel has its own private beach with <span>coral reefs.</span>  Equipped shore - there is a shower, deck chairs, mattresses, umbrellas.  The beach is multi-level, which creates the impression of special comfort coupled with relaxing music.  Sun beds are very comfortable.  Beach towels are issued - large, covering the entire mattress, and they can be changed several times a day.  The reef near the hotel is very beautiful, and tourists leave an unforgettable experience.  The underwater world near it is difficult to describe in words.  And this is not just a reef, but entire labyrinths of corals - this is how tourists describe this place.  But precisely because of its presence in the sea, you can enter only from the pontoon.  However, young children can splash around in shallow water off the coast.  Moreover, for them there is a special cleared path for entering the water.  There is another pontoon, from which they ride on "bananas", pedal boats, parachutes.  Therefore, children love him most of all.  There are enough sun loungers on the beach, often even on the front page.  There are not only changing cabins, but also a shower and toilet.  Near the sea there is a bar in the form of a ship.  There you can take Nestle ice cream, drinks, cocktails and even dine without restrictions if you are reluctant to go to the main restaurant.  The sea is clean, warm, transparent.  Sun beds are new, the mattresses are comfortable, no cigarette butts in the sand.  Fish - extraordinary beauty - swim even in shallow water.  You can see moray eels, spotted stingrays, and ball fish, and Napoleon.  It is said that this reef can compete with Ras Muhammad himself.  And the views of the mountains and the surrounding landscape are very picturesque.  But if you want to fully enjoy the underwater world, come to the sea at six to seven in the morning.  Then you will see how the fish feed on corals. </p><p>  Hotel Concorde El Salam 5 * has many pools with thoughtful architecture and style.  The most beautiful is considered to be "Infinity", although, unlike other artificial reservoirs, it is without heating.  This pool is huge and has an amazing design.  Although the water in it is cool, it is flowing and goes into a waterfall.  The hotel has a variety of swimming pools with children's sections.  In "Sport" - three great slides, you can even say a mini-water park.  On one of them children are allowed only from the age of ten - age restrictions apply.  In addition, there is even a swimming pool with built-in fitness equipment - this is the highlight of the hotel.  On the beach, you can also order a special paid service - VIP arbors on the beach, with sofas and pillows.  There is also a panoramic pool overlooking the sea - with the influx of holidaymakers on the shore there you can enjoy the sound of waves and the endless blue with a cocktail or other drink in hand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Concorde el salam area 5" class="if" height="217" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/761512.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions and trips </h2><p>  As already mentioned, after dinner guests of the hotel can walk in Soho along the marble pavements - there in the evenings there is live music, a variety of show programs, luminous fountains, and fast Internet.  Tourists staying at the hotel love sea excursions, especially the bathyscaphe and catamaran, as well as a trip to Tiran island, where you can dive with scuba diving.  Among the most popular excursions from the Concorde El Salam Front Hotel are a sightseeing tour of the resort, which allows you to visit all the attractions of Sharm El Sheikh, and a trip to the famous Ras Mohammed Nature Reserve.  From here it is not so far to get to the mountain of Moses, although the climb itself is very difficult.  Three thousand four hundred steps from granite have to be overcome.  But if you stand it, you will not regret it.  You can still go to the mountain, where the monastery of St. Catherine is located - one of the oldest in the world.  Or admire Nuweiba and its Colored Canyon.  And if you managed to get a Sinai visa upon arrival, then you have a direct road to Israel and Jordan!  You can also go to Cairo, Alexandria and Luxor from Sharm, but it is both expensive and long.  Therefore, in order to wander through the pyramids and the capital of Egypt, it is better to go to Hurghada.  Experienced tourists themselves recommend excursions to buy not in a hotel, but in Naama Bay - it will cost much cheaper, sometimes even twice. </p><h2>  Concorde El Salam Hotel Reviews </h2><p> This, from the point of view of guests, is one of the best hotels in Egypt in this price category, and almost the most worthy of Sharma hotel.  Despite the fact that the resort complex is close to the airport, due to its architectural features, the rumble of aircraft is not heard at all.  Beautiful area with pools.  Vacationers especially praise the reservoir, which has the effect of merging with the sea.  The hotel is suitable for both romantic holidays and for families.  Young people will not be bored here either - the animators will not.  This is a wonderful hotel that meets the requirements of even the biggest travel choices.  He gives an excellent, comfortable stay.  The food is wonderful, and at least a week is needed to try all the dishes.  Therefore, it is better to come here for a longer time.  The hotel staff - especially as for Egypt - are unusually helpful, polite and absolutely honest.  Everyone greets, smiles, tries to be helpful.  Not only does nothing disappear from the rooms, but they also return forgotten bags with phones, money and all contents.  Many tourists write with genuine surprise that workers refuse to tip.  An excellent kids club, thanks to which you can leave your child in the care of specialists, and give yourself up to entertainment.  Animators turn every evening show into a small performance, and their costumes for creativity can surpass the Brazilian carnival.  This is a place where you just rest well, without bothering.  Every day you spend will bring you pleasure.  After all, the Concorde El Salam Front, as tourists assure, is just a real green oasis of happiness, where you forget about problems and plunge into the world of fairy tales and beauty.  No wonder its name in translation means "consent."  Hotel guests who come here not for the first time write that they are greeted with sincere joy, just like relatives. </p>
