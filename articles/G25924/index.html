There is no such phrase in dictionaries, but the term is usually applied to high-quality phones, the price of which challenges the status quo.  To some extent, LeEco Le Pro 3, OnePlus 3 and Oppo F1 Plus correspond to this definition.  All of them are sold much cheaper than the Galaxy S7, Google —ñ–Ü, iPhone 7 and LG V20, but they correspond - and in some cases surpass them - in terms of computing power and battery life. </p><p>  Few phones can be called ideal ‚Äúflagship killers,‚Äù and ZTE's Axon 7 is one of the best.  The model is a development of Axon Pro and an attempt by the company to go beyond the market of budget smartphones on which it dominates.  With her, the manufacturer strives to succeed at a higher level.  Do the reviews confirm the characteristics of the ZTE Axon 7 or are its claims unsubstantiated? </p><h2>  Original design </h2><p>  According to the owners, the ZTE Axon 7 is not like any smartphone on the market, and this is not bad.  Staying true to the design language of the previous model, ZTE guaranteed that the new smartphone will not lose its special style.  So the phone stands out from the crowd of unremarkable devices and copies of the iPhone. </p><p>  The rounded, shimmering aluminum housing of the Axon 7 is the mesmerizing performance of parabolic slopes.  The front panel, the same as that of the Honor 8 Huawei, bends to the edges.  It has a 5.5 ‚ÄùAMOLED display, dominated by a black frame that extends to the edges, and a triangular configuration of cutouts at the top and bottom, which outlines the stereo speakers of the smartphone.  Above the lower grill there are 3 touch buttons that serve as the main means of navigation: ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and calling the multitasking menu. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The minimalist aesthetics of the Axon 7 continue on the rear panel, where the camera, dual flash and fingerprint sensor are located.  Under them you can see the logos of the model and manufacturer.  Antenna lines cross the case from the top and bottom, and on the sides are a brilliant power switch, <span>volume control</span> and a combined tray for microSD and SIM cards. </p><p>  5.5 ‚ÄùQuadHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED display at maximum brightness just shines.  As for contrast, it has improved significantly compared to the LCD screen of the previous model.  He looks great.  And the 5.2 ‚Äù1080p display of the ZTE Axon 7 Mini smartphone, according to reviews, with a pixel density of 424 dpi is clearly inferior to the‚Äú flagship killer ‚Äù, in which it is 534 dpi. </p><p>  The model lies perfectly in the hand, which is a bit unexpected.  You might think that the sleek aluminum of the phone will slide between your fingers, but in reality the housing is easy to hold.  According to numerous reviews, the ZTE Axon 7 curved edges are not the same as the iPhone 7 - they stick into the hand. </p><p>  In general, the only major drawback of the phone is the lack of waterproofing.  <span>The smartphone is thinner,</span> sleeker and more sophisticated than the 2015 model, but retains the key elements that help the Axon brand stand out from the competition. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Audio quality </h2><p>  ZTE has really worked on the Axon 7 audio system, and it makes itself felt.  Most of the phone manufacturers hardly pay due attention to the sound, but the manufacturer spent a lot of time and effort to make sure that the sound quality of the model is amazing. </p><p>  The phone is equipped with two dedicated AKM AK4961 and AK4490 audio processors, providing Hi-Fi playback through speakers or headphones, front stereo speakers and Dolby Atmos sound enhancement system. </p>

    <p>  The stereo is implemented using a pair of 2.15-B speakers, which are among the most high-profile ones ever used on mobile phones.  Axon 7 outperforms the competition, even outshining the NTS 10, which has decent audio performance.  According to user reviews, the speakers are able to reproduce a higher volume than the one that is limited to the maximum level.  The sound is crisp and clear, so it is free from the distortion that smartphone speakers typically suffer from.  Clear bass, as well as high notes of wind and string sections. </p><p>  Headphones ZTE Axon 7, according to reviews, work no worse.  The phone supports 32-bit Hi-Fi audio with a sampling frequency of 192 kHz, enhanced by Dolby Atmos technology.  The software can play videos, music and movies through professionally configured equalizer profiles and simulate 7.1 surround sound system.  The illusion is pretty convincing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Axon 7 can record audio during playback.  The smartphone is equipped with 2 noise-canceling internal microphones that pick up sound from a distance of up to 7 m and in any direction.  The phone ‚Äúlistens‚Äù for the source while minimizing ambient noise, enhancing the recording if necessary.  According to reviews, everything happens in full accordance with the advertisement - the microphone sound is crystal clear. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  On the rear panel is a 20-megapixel camera with a relative aperture of f / 1.8, which uses phase-detection AF to quickly sharpen the subject.  Optical stabilization mitigates the effects of trembling hands and bumpy roads when driving a car.  Finally, the wide dynamic range increases the brightness and contrast of images. </p><p>  In the afternoon, the Axon 7 image sensor is performing well.  City landscapes are excellent.  Colors gravitate toward the colder end of the color spectrum, and sky tones look especially intense.  When HDR mode is on, the brightness of photos borders on oversaturation.  Not everyone will like such courage, but the effect created is beautiful. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, excellent daytime work does not apply to shooting in low light conditions.  The Axon 7 image sensor struggled to display objects in dim light, showing a significant amount of grain.  Autofocus is becoming sluggish, and the colors are disappointingly faded and soft compared to photos taken on the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7. The 16-megapixel camera of the ZTE Axon 7 Mini also does not cope with the lack of light. </p><p>  An 8MP front-facing image sensor delivers great shots and videos.  Unfortunately, he does not have enough flash, but photographs taken in well-lit rooms and in daylight come out bright, clear and without noticeable grain or softness. </p><p>  Fortunately, the main camera of the ZTE Axon 7 phone, according to reviews, shoots video much better.  The recording is smooth and impressively stable.  Users also appreciate the options available, including 4K (4096 x 2160) at 30 fps, FullHD (1920 x 1080) at 30 and 60 fps and slow motion in 720p with a frame rate of 240 fps.  The capabilities of the smartphone camera ZTE Axon 7 Mini 32GB, according to owners, are much more modest and limited to 1080p video at 30 fps. </p><p>  For comparison: ZTE Axon 7 Max reviews are praised for having a 13 MP dual camera, one of which serves to provide depth of field, and a laser autofocus system.  The model is also equipped with a high-end audio chip and a display layer that allows you to view 3D content without special glasses. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with the same Snapdragon 820 chipset, which is installed in the NTS 10, OnePlus One 3 and Galaxy S7.  It is paired with a generous amount of RAM and ROM, the exact amount of which depends on the selected configuration.  The user can choose between 128/6 or 64/4 GB options for the amount of ROM and RAM. </p><p>  According to reviews, the ZTE Axon 7 smartphone is extremely fast.  Delays are very rare, and applications with a large number of images, such as Instagram and Snapchat, do not slow down at all. </p>

    <p>  The 4 GB version does not experience inconvenience with switching between programs and browser tabs.  Even very long MS Word graphic documents that can "knock down" high-performance devices on this model load without problems. </p><p>  The performance of the device is not inferior to competitors.  The phone is gaining 142,672 points in AnTuTu, ahead of OnePlus 3, but behind the iPhone 7. In the Compute GeekBench 4 test, the results are about the same.  In a single-core test, the device shows 1694 points, immediately following the LG G5 and lagging behind the Galaxy S7.  ZTE Axon 7 Mini 32GB, according to reviews, in GeekBench scores 2106 points, while the ‚Äúflagship killer‚Äù - 5393. </p><h2>  Battery life </h2><p>  The smartphone powers the 3250 mAh battery.  Its capacity is more than 3000 mAh on the Galaxy S7 and 3200 mAh on the LG V20.  The battery allows quick charging of QuickCharge 3.0, which reduces the charge time to about 1 hour 40 minutes.  The phone needs about half an hour to restore half the battery capacity. </p><p>  Compared to the <span>Mini</span> model, the <span>specifications of the ZTE Axon 7</span> are called impressive.  With the automatic brightness set and Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and cellular data transfer turned on, the battery runs out to 40% by the end of a moderately busy working day, and a cheaper model with a battery capacity of 2705 mAh has to be connected to the charger at 5 a.m. </p><p>  Short sessions of fairly easy use (mainly checking email, installing applications and sending messages) consume a minimum of energy.  Demanding programs, such as tests and games, drain the battery a little faster, which is predictable, but you never have to worry about recharging before returning to the charger. </p><p>  The ZTE Axon 7 smartphone, according to reviews, easily withstands a whole day of work, and those who use it less experienced users are likely to last a day and a half. </p>

    <h2>  User interface </h2><p>  The smartphone runs on the Android platform with several changes and additions.  The smartphone has a proprietary user interface manufacturer MiFavor.  Recent updates have supplemented it with a number of features, including Night Mode, which adjusts the color profile of the screen to reduce eye strain at night, and support for 256-GB microSD cards. </p><p>  By default, MiFavor has a theme that makes the interface almost flawless.  The start page offers the same options as the Pixel phone downloader: tapping and holding anywhere on the display allows you to scroll through available wallpapers, insert widgets, change themes, and change animated transition effects between the main screens.  The application box has a search function that allows you to quickly filter programs. </p><p>  The lock screen has a nice feature.  It changes the background every time you unlock the Axon 7. </p><p>  MiFlavor leaves the other interface elements pretty much untouched.  The notification panel includes quick Marshmallow switches: moving your finger upward gives you access to options for quickly turning Wi-Fi on and off, sending and receiving cellular data, GPS, Bluetooth, etc. Each button can be moved, edited, or deleted. </p><p>  One of ZTE‚Äôs most useful add-ons is the My Voice app, which connects custom voice commands to software actions.  You can unlock the phone, shoot and much more, using only your voice.  You can also activate Axon 7 using a code word, add contacts, listen to incoming messages, assign applications to user commands, turn off GPS, adjust screen brightness and turn on airplane mode. </p>

    <p>  If voice commands are not needed, then you can use a set of gestures.  Double-clicking activates the display, and a pinch with three fingers takes a screenshot.  Double shaking the phone turns on the flashlight, and flipping over cancels the current call. </p><p>  However, the ZTE Axon 7 64GB software, according to reviews, requires a little break-in.  Some translations are grammatically incorrect, and the ZTE Rewards app generates annoying promotional offers, announcements, and polls. </p><p>  However, the MiFlavor interface is far from bloated Android skins.  Most settings can be turned off, and they are polite enough not to disturb the owner of the smartphone. </p><p>  In terms of software updates, ZTE is best known for its regular software releases.  Despite the fact that the smartphone runs on the Android Marshmallow platform, from January 2017, an update to Nougat is available, which supports DayDream VR virtual reality. </p><h2>  Warranty </h2><p>  The manufacturer provides a standard one-year warranty that provides repair and replacement of devices with "manufacturing or material defects."  The smartphone also comes with Passport 2.0, a 24-month premium protection plan with no monthly insurance premiums.  It covers accidental damage such as falls, moisture and cracks.  There is also a free advanced exchange option.  It is enough to provide a credit card number, and ZTE will send a replacement for the defective phone.  The company even pays for shipping. </p><p>  In addition, the manufacturer replaces or refunds for any defective devices within the first 30 days of ownership.  If the smartphone is stolen or lost, the company will reimburse the owner up to 6,000 rubles.  And when the time comes to switch to the new flagship Axon, ZTE will provide a discount of about 6,000 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Customer Service and Availability </h2><p>  For new owners, the manufacturer offers a free support program.  By calling the ZTE customer support hotline, you can find out about the device‚Äôs functionality and get help with the setup process. </p><p>  Unfortunately, Axon 7 is not available in stores of mobile operators.  It can be purchased online from ZTE or another retailer.  Fortunately, the manufacturer offers installments, so you can pay off the debt for the phone with monthly payments for 2 years. </p><p>  In addition to flagship models such as the iPhone 7 and Pixel, the Axon 7 is one of the best cell phones that can be purchased.  It costs significantly less than competitors, but provides outstanding sound, insanely fast chipset, good display and a decent camera.  Every box released is checked.  In general, Axon 7 is really worthy of the honorary title of ‚Äúflagship killer‚Äù. </p><h2>  Is there a better alternative? </h2><p>  ZTE Axon 7 reviews are called one of the best smartphones in its price range.  OnePlus 3 was also a great offer, but the manufacturer stopped its release in favor of the slightly modernized and more expensive OnePlus 3T.  LePro 3 is another alternative, but users didn‚Äôt like the model‚Äôs software, and they had doubts about the phone‚Äôs compliance with international markets and the availability of vital security updates.  Finally, the Honor 8 smartphone is also a decent option, but it is not as productive.  A Google —ñ–Ü and —ñ–Ü XL will cost 15,000 rubles.  more expensive with about the same specifications. </p><h2>  How long will phone support last? </h2><p>  ZTE upgraded the operating system to Android 7.0 in January 2017. New security versions and performance improvements are distributed regularly.  The phone must last at least 2 years before updating is warranted. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  At a cost of 24,000 rubles, ZTE Axon 7 reviews are called a worthy acquisition.  It has a fast processor, the best sound that is only possible on a 2016 mobile phone, an excellent display and camera, as well as unobtrusive software.  Although there is no dual camera, the best processor or a huge amount of memory, you should not underestimate the smartphone, because today it is one of the best offers on the market. </p>
