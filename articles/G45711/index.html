A photoshoot for two lovers becomes a good start to a life together, and the album is a witness to this period. </p><h2>  Recreating the first meeting </h2><p>  While the impressions of the first glance and the word are alive, and in the future one life for two is seen, the lovers try to recreate the best moments of their meetings anew and capture them in photographs.  The idea is wonderful, and the brightness of first impressions that can be saved for a long time depends on how it comes to life. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Photoshoot for two" class="if" height="442" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19290/373731.jpg" width="581"></div></h2><p>  Professional photographers come to the aid of a <span>couple in love</span> , and for more accurate transmission of memorable moments - make-up artists and directors.  But if such services are not affordable for young people, a personally prescribed script is enough, especially since all this has already happened to them.  It is only necessary to convey the very atmosphere that is memorable to both. </p><p>  A romantic photo shoot for two will return them to those touching days of the first meetings, revive the relationship and strengthen in thought the right choice of life partner.  If the acquaintance happened not so long ago, lovers can put on the very outfits in which they first saw each other, go to "their" places, only all this is under the watchful eye of the photo lens.  It is likely that the pictures may become for them a kind of revelation, a deeper knowledge of both himself and his companion. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Field photography in a picturesque corner </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Romantic photo shoot for two" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19290/373730.jpg?1397566887723" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The fantasy of a heart in love knows no obstacles, and quite often a photo shoot for two is held in some <span>romantic place.</span>  It can be anything: an old castle, a unique park with fountains and sculptural ensembles or a picturesque meadow with a stack of fragrant hay.  Any landscape environment is capable of creating a mood that will then be reflected in photographs in the eyes and poses of the couple, if there are true feelings. </p><p>  Quite often, lovers prefer to conduct a photo shoot on the shore of a reservoir or in the forest.  There is no shortage of photographers anywhere.  The result of the idea depends on how well thought out all the gestures, facial expressions, postures.  If the photographer is given a ready-made script for work, it will be easier for him to decide on the composition.  This will save both time and effort. </p><h2>  Studio shots </h2><p>  Of course, a studio photo shoot gives you great shots.  The photographer is able to perfectly select the lighting in such conditions, in almost real time, you can make a test printout of the footage. </p><p>  A studio photo session for two is an opportunity to create a romantic story on a specific topic.  Large workshops have a sufficient number of premises and props for this.  If a couple has special ideas on this subject, they can be discussed with the photographer in advance, and all the necessary costumes will be found by the day of shooting. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Lovers can depict, for example, the characters of the gangster era of Bonnie and Clyde, the heroes of the ancient Greek myths Orpheus and Eurydice, iconic persons of the period of the glorious knights - Lancelot and Guinevere.  If the couple does not want to attach the plot of their love to any particular personalities, she can choose a detached scenario for a certain period of foreign or domestic history.

    <h2>  The season as a reason for storytelling </h2><p>  Sometimes the plot for a photo shoot tells nature itself.  Everything that sets a couple in love for a romantic mood can be the best decoration for work.  Each season has its own. </p><p>  The summer of plot opportunities, of course, has more.  Here, the imagination of young people can throw them with a photographer to any corner of the surrounding area.  Spring and autumn have less picturesque thematic landscapes, but you can choose the time and place in order to take unique pictures.  Winter photo shoot for two <strong> </strong>  slightly inferior to the bright summer, but this unique true winter plot compensates for this.  This may be, for example, <span>an abandoned house</span> in a forest littered with snow;  a hot fireplace, a low moon looking out of windows;  a candle by the window against the background of dark blue snowdrifts from the starry sky.  Silence, night, solitude, fire - isn‚Äôt it a fairy-tale story?  And there are two in this magic - he and she! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Studio photo shoot for two" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10499/376397.jpg?1397717329337" width="528"></div>
