  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Varieties of poker</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Poker card games have many different variations, most of which were created in the United States in the mid-1900s. <br>  Many players have repeatedly asked themselves which version of the game is the most interesting and offers the best prospects for self-development.  Below are the most popular and famous types of poker and their features. </p><p>  The three most popular options are distributed in casinos around the world and can be divided into the following groups: </p><ul><li>  Draw Poker: A game in which a player is dealt a full set of cards face down, which can then be improved by replacing cards.  The most common is a five-card.  This is one of the simplest <span>types of games</span> that are most often played at home. </li><li>  Stud poker: a game in which each player receives a combination of open and closed cards over several rounds.  The most common are seven-card and five-card stud. </li><li>  Hold'em: a game in which the open and closed cards are optimally combined.  The most popular: Omaha Hold'em and Texas Hold'em (better known as Texas Hold'em Poker - the most common casino game worldwide). </li></ul><p>  Here are some other less popular and less well-known variations of poker: </p><ul><li>  Lowball: the pot wins the worst combination.  There are differences in the rules about whether aces are considered worse cards.  The most common options are Razz and 2-7 Triple Draw. </li><li>  Hi-low split: the pot is split between the worst and the best bets.  For example, the worst bet should have 5 cards with ranks of 8 or less. </li><li>  Killing a game is a game with a fixed limit, and if a player wins two banks in a row, then the bets will be doubled. </li><li>  A twist round in which players can buy another card from the deck.  If a player does not like his cards, he can buy another one by adding money to the bank. </li><li>  A double flip (also known as doomsday and jaw victory) has been introduced to club games throughout Europe in recent years.  It was designed to keep inactive players in the game, and therefore in a pub or club.  If the remaining players have some cards that match and one of those that have been dealt is the same, then they are supposed to have a certain percentage of winning from the bank (negotiated before the start of each game). </li><li>  The Mexican stud has the same rules as the five-card stud, but the cards are constantly shuffled and dealt face down.  Each player decides which of the two face down cards he draws. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Mixed Poker</strong> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In this game, you can try the mixed format, for example, half an hour Texas poker, then half an hour Seven-Card Stud, etc.  There are many types of mixed games.  The most famous is poker HORSE (HORSE).  This is a mix of Hold'em, Omaha, Razz, Hi-Lo and 7 Card Stud.  Each game usually lasts a fixed amount of time, and then the players move on to the next game. </p><p>  Other mixed variations of poker include: </p><ul><li>  HOSE - same as HORSE, but without razz. </li><li>  HOE is the same as HORSE, with the exception of Razz or Seven-Card Stud. </li><li>  HO - Texas poker and high-low. </li><li>  OE - seven card stud and Omaha. </li><li>  HA - Texas Pot-Limit mixed with Omaha Pot-Limit. </li><li>  Omaha Hi-Lo mixed - Omaha and Pot-Limit Hi-Lo. </li><li>  Mixed Hold'em - Texas Hold'em with a fixed limit and without. </li><li>  Eight Mix games - with a fixed limit: 2-7 Triple Draw, Texas Hold'em, Razz, Pot-Limit Omaha, Hi-Lo Split, 7 Card Stud and Unlimited Omaha and Texas Hold'em. </li></ul><p>  Some poker games simply do not fit into the above categories, they have their own special rules and, of course, their fans.  These options are most often used in home games.  Here is some of them: </p><ul><li>  High or low Chicago. </li><li>  Watch the queen. </li><li>  Hairpins. </li><li>  Countdown. </li><li>  Shanghai. </li><li>  Stud Poker HORSE. </li></ul><p>  This is not a complete list of all <span>types of poker,</span> there are so many different games to choose from.  In general, creating a complete list is a very difficult task, but you can easily try each variation and choose the one that suits you the most. </p>
