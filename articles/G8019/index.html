No other country has that many lotteries.  In Belarus there are about fifty of them, and from the point of view of the names presented, there is a choice for every taste - professional, sports, ideological and patriotic.  And the number of people wishing to try the taste of victory at random is becoming more and more.  And the lotteries themselves in Belarus have long been not exclusively national, since many players from the post-Soviet space take part in them.  Figuratively speaking, lotteries have become an independent sector of the economy with stable positive dynamics of revenue growth. </p><p>  Features of the Belarusian lotteries. </p><ul><li>  All lotteries in Belarus are state-owned and are under the control of various government agencies.  In this segment, competition is very limited, as evidenced by the presence of only a few operators.  The most famous are the Belarusian Lotteries and the National Sports Lotteries, which are unitary enterprises. </li><li>  Each lottery must necessarily receive expert permission to use software and hardware from the analytical center under the president. </li><li>  According to the law, the prize fund of each <noindex>  <span>lotteries of Belarus</span> </noindex>  must be strictly within 45-50% of the collected funds.  The second half of the funds goes to the state budget. </li><li>  The most popular nationwide lotteries (compared to regional ones), which is explained by more substantial winnings. </li><li>  Social portrait of the average player.  A middle-aged man with a low income without a solid material foundation, but with great ambitions.  Lives in the countryside. </li></ul><p>  Overview of the most popular lotteries. </p><p>  1. "Your Lotto" - founded in 2001, offers solid, in comparison with others, rewards.  In addition to money, apartments, cars and even precious stones are played out.  The probability of a victorious outcome of one ticket is 25%.  The principle of the game is borrowed from the classic lotto with the traditional variations of luring players for lotteries - Jeep Pot, Instant Fortune and others. </p><p>  2. "Superlotto" - was created as a means of financial support for youth sports development programs.  Only cash prizes are awarded to the winner.  The playing field consists of 30 different numbers from 1 to 90, and the ticket itself is divided into rows and columns.  The draw is held using numbered barrels. </p><p>  3. "Sportloto" - was founded in 2008 and is a direct analogue of the popular Soviet lottery "5 of 36".  The prize drawing takes place live on the air 2 times a week.  The largest gain was 2.8 million Russian rubles. </p></div></article>
