Turkey was already a favorite tourist destination for our compatriots.  It seems that they began to explore the coast far from Antalya and Alanya.  What is the resort of Beldibi?  Is it suitable for family vacations or is it worth it to show up as a noisy youth company?  And where does a person with average income live?  We will explain all this in this article.  We will touch on the history of a small village, tell about its infrastructure, beaches and attractions.  Here are the reviews of tourists from which you can make up your mind about where and when to go to this coast of Turkey.  We will pay special attention to local four-star hotels, since hotels of this category are the “golden mean” between luxurious (and terribly expensive) “fives” and budget (but sometimes of dubious quality) “three rubles”. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beldibi Turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/755147.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Turkey, Kemer, Beldibi </h2><p>  This resort is located west of Antalya, about halfway to the city of Kemer.  Administratively Beldibi belongs to Lycia.  The village is a narrow strip of human housing, sandwiched between the Mediterranean Sea and the Taurus Mountains, which are very close to the coast in this place.  Due to the small area for development, the settlement consists of several parallel streets and lanes connecting them.  But do not think that here is mortal longing.  Beldibi (Turkey), whose photos are very spectacular, is buried in beautiful citrus orchards.  Here, all life revolves around the "gold mine" of tourism.  However, the contingent of vacationers has not yet decided.  Enough for everyone a little bit: well-to-do pensioners from Western Europe, and families with children, and youth companies, and romantic couples.  The first line, of course, is occupied by luxurious fives.  On the main street (as always in Turkey, named after K. Ataturk) there are shops, restaurants and cafes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beldibi Turkey Photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/755155.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  All tourists who want to relax on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey arrive at <span>Antalya Airport.</span>  Usually a ticket includes a transfer to the hotel.  Those who travel independently need to take a bus from the airport to the Antalya bus station.  There is already a need to make a transplant.  Between cities shuttle buses and buses "Havash" (Havaş).  Beldibi (Turkey) is located twenty-five kilometers from Antalya.  On the minibus number 28 (final stop - Kemer) a trip to the resort will cost two and a half lira.  On a more comfortable hawash - about three euros.  In a rented car you need to get off (breaking traffic jams at the exit from Antalya) onto the D400 motorway.  At the road sign you should turn off the main highway.  The road will lead to the main avenue - Ataturk street. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey hotels Beldibi 4 stars" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/755161.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <h2>  Beldibi History </h2><p>  In the middle of the last century, archaeological research was carried out in the village, during which it was discovered that people lived here in the first century <span>BC.</span>  What the locals were doing and what was the name of their village was completely unclear.  The village took its present name from the small river Beldibi.  Its history until the 1980s is unremarkable.  The only thing that kept the inhabitants of Beldibi (Turkey) afloat was the cultivation and sale of citrus fruits.  You can still see the remains of rich lemon and orange groves, which are preserved in some places on the territory of the hotels.  Since the eighties, hotels have been built here - first for the wealthy residents of the capital.  Ten years later, when Turkey secured the image of a country of beach holidays, top hotels for foreign tourists appeared in the village.  Archaeological canned pits have remained and bear the romantic name "Caves", but the inexperienced eye can see little in them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Beldibi village <span>(Turkey) reviews</span> are called a place for pebble lovers.  If you do not want to warm the bones, but lie on a soft sand, check on the page of your chosen hotel what their beach is.  Some hotels have taken care to create the most comfortable conditions for their guests, including on the seashore.  They brought white fine sand and uprooted large boulders from the water (at least to a depth of one and a half meters).  But reviews claim that the sea is clean.  The water warms up quickly, and therefore a comfortable rest will be provided to you from the beginning of May to the end of September.  The purity of the sea is confirmed by the Blue Flag, which was awarded to the city beach of Beldibi.  He is free.  Reviews recommend visiting the <span>wild beach</span> on the left behind the caves.  Walk to him for about half an hour.  They say beauty is indescribable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beldibi turkey reviews" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/755180.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Turkey.  4-star Beldibi hotels </h2><p>  Hotels of this category position themselves as places for families.  Corporate events, weddings, and other noisy meetings and gatherings are rarely held here.  The main priority in such hotels is the comfort of young guests and their parents.  There are quite a few four-star hotels in Beldibi.  Turkey is famous for its all-inclusive system, and this resort is no exception.  There are in the Beldibi hotels and children's animation, or at least a free nanny, whom you can entrust the child, while the parents leave for their business.  Which hotels in this category recommend reviews?  They mention “Karelta Beach”, located at the very foot of the mountains, “Larissa”, located 150 meters from the sea, “Club Sunbel”, “Sea Gull” and “Matiate”.  But this is an incomplete list.  The cost of living in the Quartet Beldibi starts at one thousand three hundred rubles per night per room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Kemer Beldibi" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/755183.jpg" width="400"></div>
