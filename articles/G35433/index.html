In Europe, they participated in hostilities in France (mainly in Normandy), Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium.  Also, the US military was represented in Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Southeast Asia and the Pacific.  In this article we will talk about the reasons for the US participation in the war, what events led to this. </p><h2>  Previous events </h2><p>  US entry into World War II did not happen right away.  America did not initially participate in the conflict in Europe.  Only in 1941 did US entry into World War II become a reality.  More than two years have passed by then since Hitler attacked Poland. </p><p>  Despite the fact that, until a certain point, American troops did not take any part in the war, there was a tense atmosphere in society.  There was a feeling that it would not be possible to stay away.  Disturbing events in the world contributed to this. </p><p>  The Japanese, who acted as allies of Germany, took advantage of the defeat of France, demanding in September 1940 the right to create their own air bases on the territory of North Vietnam.  Because of this, there is a danger of losing Indonesia, where the oil fields were located, and Singapore. </p><p>  In July 1941, Japan officially announced its aggressive plans.  At a specially convened conference, a decision was announced to continue moving south.  It was then that a protectorate was established over Indochina. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Stimson Doctrine </h2><p>  After these events, the Stimson doctrine used by the Americans, also known as the ‚Äúnon-recognition doctrine,‚Äù could no longer be applied. </p><p>  Recall, Henry Stimson was the US Secretary of State, who preferred to avoid complications with the Japanese government.  He formulated America‚Äôs position regarding the aggression of the empire in China 10 years before. </p><p>  Aggression began in 1931, after which China counted on the support of the United States and the League of Nations.  However, the Americans said that the actions of the Japanese are in accordance with the Briand-Kellogg Pact, which implied the renunciation of war in resolving national policy issues, adopted in 1928.  When Japanese troops began to advance deep into China, Stimson chose to take the position of rejecting the recognition of the Japanese conquests. </p><p>  In 1933, Stimson resigned.  The new Secretary of State was appointed Cordell Hull, whom the situation forced to act more decisively. </p><h2>  Economic sanctions </h2><p>  The day after the establishment of a protectorate over Indochina, US authorities impose an embargo on the supply of oil and petroleum products to Japan.  The Navy receives an order to prevent tankers of any third countries from entering the Japanese islands.  All assets of this country in the United States are frozen. </p><p>  American troops stationed in Hawaii are on alert.  A detachment of US officers is sent to China.  For the Japanese ships close the Panama Canal. </p><p>  In October, Asian Prime Minister Konoe resigned along with the entire government.  His place is occupied by General <span>Hideki Tojo,</span> known for his aggressive politics. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Conversation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.biography.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Franklin Roosevelt" class="if uuid-3120827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3120827.jpg"></div><p>  Negotiations are ongoing between countries, but they do not end there. </p><p>  Historians assure that all parties involved in them initially understood that they would not be able to come to a compromise, the real collision did not have to wait long. </p><p>  On November 24, the Department of State sends a note to the Japanese government, rejecting the proposed agreement and criticizing their position.  Americans demand the withdrawal of troops from Indochina and China, as well as the conclusion of a non-aggression pact with the Netherlands, China, Great Britain, the USA, Thailand and the USSR.  Only under these conditions were America ready to resume trade. </p><p>  In Tokyo, Secretary of State Hall's note was considered an ultimatum, coming to the conclusion that only war would help resolve the contradictions that arose. </p><h2>  Attack on Pearl Harbor </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Attack on Pearl Harbor" class="if uuid-3120825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3120825.jpg"></div><p>  On December 7, at 7:55 local time, the Japanese air force strikes at the American military base at Pearl Harbor.  In Japanese terminology, this attack is known as the Hawaiian operation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The US Pacific Fleet lost five battleships, three more were damaged.  Three destroyers and three light cruisers were put out of action.  At the airfields that were located in the immediate vicinity of Pearl Harbor, the Americans lost about 300 aircraft.  The Americans lost about 2.4 thousand people killed. </p><p>  The Japanese also suffered losses.  They lost 29 aircraft and several submarines with the entire crew. </p><p>  December 7, 1941 - the date of entry into the Second World War of the United States. </p><h2>  First fighting </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.nationalww2museum.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The date of the entry of the USA into the Second World War" class="if uuid-3120828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3120828.jpg"></div><p>  Already after 6 hours after this attack, American submarines and warships were ordered to start military operations against Japan in the Pacific Ocean.  The reasons for the US entry into World War II were not only the impossibility to ignore the aggressor located in the neighborhood, but also because the aggressor was the first to deliver a crushing blow, which simply could not be ignored. </p><p>  In Congress, the American head of state, Roosevelt, makes a speech declaring war on Japan.  Thus, the US entry into World War II followed the defeat at the Battle of Pearl Harbor.  The reaction was virtually immediate. </p><p>  The Pacific Command was ordered to launch an underwater and air operation against Japan.  All submarines were officially allowed to sink any ship flying the Japanese flag without warning. </p><p>  For Japan, the attack on Pearl Harbor was, in fact, a response to Hall's note.  The fact that the US entry into World War II followed only after a direct attack on its own military base in the future served as the subject of accusations from the Allies.  They reproached them for the fact that the Americans took a wait and see attitude, trying to escape from the conflict. </p><h2>  Declaration of war by European powers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="encyclopedia.ushmm.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reasons for US entry into World War II" class="if uuid-3120824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3120824.jpg"></div><p>  After the United States entered World War II, its European allies expressed support for Japan.  On December 11, Italy and Germany declared war on America.  Two days later, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria did exactly the same. </p><p>  The Tripartite Pact was signed between Japan, Germany and Italy.  This document officially announced that all three countries were ready to fight against the United States and England to a victorious end, and also under no circumstances would they agree to a separate peace. </p><p>  Hitler made his speech about declaring war on America in the Reichstag in the days when the German army began to experience the first serious problems on the territory of the USSR.  Moreover, in fact, the United States and Germany were in a state of undeclared war in the Atlantic Ocean.  However, in this situation, Roosevelt waited, wanting to see what the Nazi dictator would do. </p><h2>  Japanese success </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.theatlantic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Briefly about the entry of the USA into the Second World War" class="if uuid-3120829" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3120829.jpg"></div><p>  After a successful operation in Pearl Harbor, the Japanese forced the United States to enter World War II.  At the same time, the initiative in the Pacific was on their side. </p><p>  Asians confidently moved forward.  For several months of the confrontation they unleashed in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, they managed to capture Singapore, Malaysia, Burma, most of the islands of Indonesia, the Philippines, part of New Guinea, Hong Kong, Wake, Guam, Solomon Islands and New Britain. </p><p>  About 150 million people were in the territories occupied by the Japanese. </p><h2>  Effects </h2><p>  Speaking briefly about the US entry into World War II, as well as the consequences of this event, it is worth recognizing that the participation of Americans contributed to an early victory over fascism.  Although still not as fast as many expected.  In addition, there were no American troops in Europe for a long time. </p><p>  The Americans launched active military campaigns in the Pacific Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea, directly in North Africa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rarehistoricalphotos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tehran Conference" class="if uuid-3120823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3120823.jpg"></div><p>  In Western Europe, the Americans began direct hostilities only after the Tehran Conference, held in late 1943.  It met the leader of the Soviet Union Joseph Stalin, US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the head of the British government Churchill. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.americanyawp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Opening of the second front" class="if uuid-3120826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3120826.jpg"></div><p>  The main outcome of the conference was an agreement on the opening of the Allied front.  As a result of Operation Overlord, northwestern France was rapidly liberated.  Germany has since been doomed to defeat, which has become only a matter of time. </p><p>  In total, Americans lost 418 thousand people in the war.  More than 670 thousand were injured, more than 130 thousand were captured.  Until now, 74,000 American troops have been reported missing. </p>
