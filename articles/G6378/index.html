    <p>  Thanks to the attraction, thrills can be obtained by flying down the hill, spraying water jets in all directions, even when snow is blowing on the street.  Who said that only summer time is suitable for water activities? </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Attention deserves the attraction "Water slide".  It is twisted into a spiral.  Rising to a height, people slide down it, gaining speed and eventually flying into the pool.  Typically, such a descent causes an adrenaline rush and thrills. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is also a children's pool, where you can give your child to go swimming.  If your child is not yet five years old, classes for him can be completely free.  There are separate rates for adults and athletes who also practice in local halls.  Benefits are provided for pensioners, students, orphans and anti-terrorist operation participants. </p><p>  It is worth noting that, visiting the water park, you can improve your own health, improve sports skills, and simply nourish your soul with such powerful and joyful emotions that will long illuminate a person‚Äôs mood like a sparkling light.  All this for many years now invariably gives its guests "Aquarius" (Nikolaev).  The rest here is magnificent, and the services are very diverse.  You can come with the whole family, and in the end everyone will be happy. </p>
