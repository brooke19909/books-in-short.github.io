    <p>  With the development of the banking sector, many deception schemes have appeared.  Moreover, not only citizens by their inexperience fall into the bait of scammers, but also financial institutions staffed by lawyers.  Credit fraudsters, who have proliferated in abundance in the fatherland, are especially dangerous in this regard. </p><p>  Let's review the most typical frauds that can lead to loss of money. </p><p>  How credit scammers cheat banks </p><p>  High competition among bankers created such a situation that in the pursuit of an extra borrower, credit institutions weakened their vigilance.  This immediately took advantage of dishonest businessmen.  True, they do not shine with a special variety in the choice of methods of deception, using the following schemes: </p><p>  1. Receiving money or goods using <span>fake documents.</span>  It is considered the most criminal way, since you have to fake a passport by sticking your photo in place of the former.  Sometimes the photo is not glued, and the appearance is adjusted to the existing image. </p><p>  2. Making a lot of loans in various institutions.  At the same time, credit fraudsters take money in small batches, and in the questionnaires they always indicate non-existent coordinates.  As a rule, the place of registration is also conditional. </p><p>  3. Use to obtain a loan <span>to a bank employee.</span>  Here, unlike the previous method, large amounts are taken.  Most often, scammers manage to hide or get off with <span>suspended sentences,</span> and employees of credit institutions caught in a scam are responsible to the fullest extent of the law. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How credit scammers cheat citizens </p><p>  Here the scammers arsenal of funds is somewhat wider.  We will arrange the methods as the danger increases: </p><p>  1. Credit fraud through fictitious consultation is the least expensive way.  A citizen with a <span>damaged credit history is</span> promised to sell cheap information about banks that issue loans to penalized borrowers without any problems.  He redeems it, and then finds out that he could get them for free on the Internet. </p><p>  2. Fake guarantors.  Scammers offer the borrower guarantors from the side, which, of course, need to pay a fee.  After registration, it is revealed that they are listed in some database of dysfunctional persons.  <span>The loan agreement is</span> canceled, the money is returned to the bank, the commission remains in the hands of scammers. </p><p>  3. Use of goods to receive funds.  In this case, the store draws up a <span>trade credit</span> for the borrower.  After that, half the cost of the product is given to him.  It is argued that this is necessary, and the bank will not claim the second half.  It is clear that after some time you have to give everything, and even with considerable interest. </p><p>  4. And finally, the most common credit fraud - obtaining a loan by unauthorized persons according to the documents of the borrower.  There are two possible scenarios. </p><p>  The first - the passport is lost.  In this case, a simple appeal to the police with a statement about his loss will save you from troubles.  The main thing is to do it as quickly as possible.  Then for the carelessness of the staff will have to financially answer the bank itself. </p><p>  The second - credit scammers take a borrower‚Äôs passport allegedly to draw up a contract.  During the time that the document will be in the hands of scammers, a loan can be drawn up and money taken.  The client will be announced that he does not pass on some indicators.  A month later, when the first notifications begin to arrive, the attackers will already be hiding. </p><p>  On the last two points there is one proven tool - a lawsuit.  As soon as bank claims exceed a certain degree, you should prepare documents and write a statement to the court.  Negotiating with a credit institution is a waste of time and nerves. </p>
