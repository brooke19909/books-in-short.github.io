At the very beginning of his career, he was engaged in the production of light bulbs.  In 1895, his brother Anton Phillips joined Gerrard. </p><p>  In 1917, the company was forced to curtail its production due to the difficult situation in the country.  However, starting in 1918, Gerrard and Anton continued to produce light bulbs.  In parallel, the production of medical tubes for radiography was in progress.  Beginning in 1930, television broadcasting was actively advertised.  Given the new trends, the Philips company abruptly switched to the production of radios, and then electric gramophones.  Since 1932, absolutely all electric lamp devices have been manufactured under this brand. </p>
