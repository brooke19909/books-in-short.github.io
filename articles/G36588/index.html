Why Peter 1 started the war with the Swedes and how it ended - more on this later. </p><h2>  Russian state under Peter 1 </h2><p>  To understand the causes of the Northern War, you need to know what Russia was like at the beginning of the conflict.  The 18th century is a time of tremendous changes in the economy, culture, politics and social relations.  Peter the Great is known as the Tsar Reformer.  He inherited a huge country with an underdeveloped economy and an outdated army.  The Russian state lagged far behind European countries in development.  In addition, she was weakened by the long wars with the Ottoman Empire, which were waged for supremacy on the Black Sea. </p>

    <p>  Considering the question of why Peter the Great started the war with the Swedes, it must be understood that there were the most compelling reasons for this.  The Northern War was fought for access to the Baltic coast, which was vital for Russia.  Without trade relations with Western countries, she could not develop her economy.  Arkhangelsk was the only port at that time through which Russian goods were delivered to the West.  The sea route through the <span>White Sea</span> was difficult, dangerous and irregular.  In addition, Peter 1 understood the need for urgent development of his fleet in the Baltic and the Black Sea.  Without this, it was impossible to create a strong state. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  That is why a war with the Swedes under Peter 1 was inevitable.  The previous rulers of Russia saw the main enemy in the Ottoman Empire, which constantly carried out attacks on the Russian border territories.  Only such a far-sighted politician as Peter the Great understood that it was more important for the country to have the opportunity to trade with Europe through the <span>Baltic Sea,</span> and the struggle for the Black Sea coast could wait. </p><h2>  <span>King of Sweden</span> Charles XII </h2><p>  A northern and extraordinary monarch ruled the northern country during this period as Peter 1. Charles XII was considered a military genius, and his army was invincible.  Under him, the country was considered the strongest in the Baltic region.  By the way, his name is Karl in Russia, and in Sweden the king was known as Charles XII. </p>

    <p>  He began to rule, like Peter, at a young age.  He was 15 years old when his father died, and Karl succeeded the throne.  Possessing a quick-tempered character, the king did not tolerate any advice and decided everything himself.  At the age of 18, he made his first military expedition.  Having announced at the court that he was leaving for fun in one of his castles, in fact, the young ruler with a small army went by sea to Denmark.  Finding himself under the walls of Copenhagen in a quick march, Karl forced Denmark to withdraw from the alliance with Russia, Poland and Saxony.  Almost 18 years after this, the king spent outside his native country, participating in various military campaigns.  Their goal was to make Sweden the strongest state in Northern Europe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Peter 1 and the Swedes: Causes of Military Conflict </h2><p>  Russia and Sweden were opponents long before the birth of the Tsar Reformer.  The Baltic coast, which had an important geopolitical significance, has always been of great interest to many countries.  Poland, Sweden and Russia have been trying for centuries to strengthen their influence in the Baltic region.  Starting from the XII century, the Swedes repeatedly attacked the north of Russia, trying to capture Ladoga, the coast of the Gulf of Finland and Karelia.  By the beginning of the 18th century, the Baltic countries were completely subordinate to Sweden.  August II, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, Frederick IV, ruler of Denmark and Peter the Great formed a coalition against Sweden.  Their hopes for victory were based on the youth of Charles XII.  In case of victory, Russia received the long-awaited access to the Baltic coast and the opportunity to have a fleet.  This was the main reason why Peter 1 started a war with the Swedes.  As for the rest of the alliance against Sweden, they sought to weaken the northern enemy and strengthen their presence in the Baltic region. </p><h2>  <span>Peter 1 the</span> Great: The Northern War with Sweden proved the military talent of the Russian Tsar </h2><p>  The alliance between the three countries (Russia, Denmark and Poland) was concluded in 1699.  The first to oppose Sweden was August II.  In 1700 the siege of Riga began.  In the same year, the Danish army launched an invasion of the territory of Holstein, which was an ally of Sweden.  Then Charles XII made a bold march to Denmark and forced her to leave the war.  Then he sent troops to Riga, and the <span>Polish king,</span> not daring to enter the battle, withdrew his troops. </p><p>  Later, Russia entered the war with Sweden.  Why did Peter 1 start the war with the Swedes at the same time as the allies?  The fact is that the Russian state at that time fought with the Ottoman Empire, and the country could not participate in two military conflicts at once. </p><p>  The very day after the conclusion of a peace treaty with Turkey, Russia entered the war with Sweden.  Peter 1 began a campaign to Narva, the nearest Swedish fortress.  The battle was lost, despite the fact that the troops of Charles XII were much inferior in number of poorly trained and insufficiently armed Russian army. </p>

    <p>  The defeat near Narva led to the rapid transformation of the Russian armed forces.  In just a year, Peter the Great was able to completely transform the army, equipped with new weapons and artillery.  In 1701, Russia began to triumph over the Swedes: the <span>Battle of</span> Poltava <span>, the Gangut battle</span> at sea.  In 1721, Sweden signed a peace treaty with Russia. </p>
