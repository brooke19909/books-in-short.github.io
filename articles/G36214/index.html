Crochet for beginners</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The creations of needlewomen give rise to a desire to master crochet work.  Then a lot of questions arise - from how to hold the hook and thread, to the difficulties with reading the diagrams.  As in any other needlework, you will need to master the basics.  Crochet starts with the simplest thing - you must first select the hook successfully. </p><h2>  Choosing a hook, yarn and rules for how to hold them </h2><p>  It can be difficult for a beginner to determine the hook number.  In this case, it is worth paying attention to the recommendations that the yarn manufacturer gives.  Typically, the label indicates not only the composition with the weight of the skein, but also the length of the thread and the most suitable size of knitting needles and hooks. </p><p>  Do not immediately take up thin yarn.  Let it be as thick as possible.  Then the work will go quickly and not seem complicated and tedious.  Over time, mastery will come, and it will be possible to tackle models more airy and thinner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet basics" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30158/1041456.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  As for how to hold the hook, there is no consensus.  Any instructions that contain the basics of crocheting say that it should be convenient, which is individually for each.  It can lie in the brush like a pen or be pressed to the palm with the little finger and ring finger.  Each needlewoman herself determines how she will be comfortable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But the thread should be evenly stretched, otherwise it will not work correctly to grab and stretch through the loops.  It needs to be clamped between the thumb and forefinger, then tossed over the second of them.  It should be skipped under the next two and displayed over the little finger.  All fingers need to be squeezed slightly so that the yarn glides easily between them, but does not fall out.  Without these nuances, it will not be possible to master the basics.  Crochet will be comfortable if these simple conditions are met. </p><h2>  Getting started: node and chain </h2><p>  There are several ways to fix the thread at the beginning of the work.  One of them is to place it in a special way on the fingers of the left hand. </p><p>  First you need to put the thread from the ball on three (from the little finger to the middle) finger.  Then send her for the index and put under the big one.  Make a loop around it and attach to the one that already lies on the three fingers mentioned at the beginning. </p><p>  Now you need to enter the hook into the loop formed on the thumb, grab the thread from the index finger and pull it out.  It remains only to tighten the knot.  So crochet begins.  The basics for beginners continue in the typesetting chain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the basics of crocheting" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30158/1041457.jpg" width="493"></div>

    <p>  It consists of <span>air loops.</span>  <span>Air</span> - because they do not fasten with other rows.  Such a chain can be knitted immediately from the position of the thread that has been described for the node.  After tightening it, the working thread remains on the index finger, and its end is sandwiched between the large and medium (it is so convenient to start work without removing the yarn from the hand). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is necessary to hook the working thread with a hook from the index finger and pull it through the loop located on it.  At the same time, hold the knot with your thumb and middle finger.  They should pull the finished work a little.  This is required in order to successfully master the basics of crocheting. </p><p>  This chain continues until the right amount is reached according to the scheme.  Please note that the thread on it is not considered a loop.  Such a mistake is sometimes encountered by novice needlewomen. </p><h2>  How is a connecting column made and when is it used? </h2><p>  It is also called a connecting loop.  Sometimes you can also find such names: hook, blind or blind loop.  It is all about him. </p><p>  Its designation is also ambiguous.  In circular patterns, it most often looks like an arc.  And in other cases, it can be a point or a little dash. </p><p>  But he always gets knitted the same way.  It is worth starting to learn the basics from it.  Crocheting begins with the fact that you need to enter it into the first loop of the chain.  Then pick up the thread on the index finger and pull it through all that is on the <span>hook.</span>  <span>The connecting column is</span> ready.  During practice, you can knit a whole row or even a small square. </p><p>  Such a loop is used very often in a round pattern.  Because there the beginning of the series coincides with its end.  If there is a desire to make napkins using crochet, the basics (photos) in the practice of such loops will be simply necessary. </p>

    <h2>  The main types of columns </h2><p>  It is not easy for a beginner to solve the question of where the first, second, or fourth loop from the hook is located.  To correctly calculate them, you just need not to take into account the one that is on the hook. </p><p>  For each of the columns at the beginning of the row, a lift is required.  The higher the bar, the more you need to knit air loops. </p><ol><li><p>  Single crochet.  Knits like a connecting loop, with one change.  The hook does not need to be stretched immediately through everything that is on it, but only through the canvas.  As a result, there will be 2 loops.  The thread needs to be picked up again and this time pulled through everything.  For lifting, it usually uses two air loops. </p></li><li><p>  With a crochet.  In the knitting technique, an additional step appears.  Before threading the hook through the fabric, you need to wrap the thread around it - this is a crochet.  Then the thread is supposed to be pulled through the loop of work and left on the hook.  Then, in turn, knit the loops on the hook in pairs.  Rise form 3 loops. </p></li><li><p>  With 2, 3 crochets.  Work is complicated by the required number of revolutions of the thread.  And pairwise knitting becomes a little more.  It takes 4, 5 air loops respectively to rise. </p></li></ol>

    <h2>  A few more elements to master </h2><p>  If some skill has already appeared, then you can expand the set of elements that goes into the basics.  Crocheting must certainly bring joy.  And for this, the number of columns must be increased. </p><ul><li><p>  The step is used to tie the product.  It fits like a <span>double crochet,</span> but the movement is not from right to left, but from left to right. </p></li><li><p>  A magnificent column is an indispensable element of patterns.  Usually it consists of several double crochet posts.  There is only one condition in it: you need to knit all these columns from one loop. </p></li></ul>
