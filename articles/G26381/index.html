Over the centuries, it was built on 122 islands that are located in the Gulf of the <span>Adriatic.</span>  Gradually, buildings, bridges connecting them, temples and chic palaces began to appear on these tiny lands.  Venice grew in the literal sense of the word, and today it has become the focus of the most beautiful architectural monuments in Europe.  Its uniqueness is also that it is a city on the water, in which there is no place for highways and tram tracks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãon the water" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/271453.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To get to Venice is best by train, in extreme cases, with a transfer.  Buses also come here, but they are considered less comfortable.  Many people get to the city on the water by car, however, it should be remembered that from the windows of the car you definitely can not explore this city - there are no roads.  You will have to park on the islet of Tronchetto, which is a large tourist parking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which city is on the water" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/271454.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city on the water is primarily famous for its non-standard mode of transport - boats.  Among them there are public ones that go along a specific route, and so-called recreational ones, the path of which is determined by the client.  Valoretto - "water" buses of the city, which have their numbers and the exact route.  The cost of a ticket on such a boat is 6.5 euros (you can ride on it for an hour) or 16 euros (the ticket will be valid for 12 hours).  Gondolas are a pure manifestation of the bourgeoisie, and over the centuries there has been a tradition that it is gondoliers who collect the most money from tourists.  A trip on such a boat can last at least a whole day, but for every forty minutes you will have to pay at least 60 euros. </p><p>  Numerous canals of Venice are surrounded by ancient monuments of architecture that have become symbols of the city.  Among them, St. Mark's Square, located on the coast of the Grand Canal, deserves special attention.  On it is the Basilica of the same name, in which a giant bell is located, and around this chapel live flocks of snow-white and blue doves, warmly welcoming every tourist of this unique city.  In the same place in the Middle Ages, the most beautiful <span>Doge's Palace</span> was built <span>,</span> which combines features and Gothic austerity, and a certain lightness and airiness, characteristic only of Italy. </p>
