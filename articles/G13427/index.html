If the borrower does not confirm income and employment, then the size of its down payment must be at least 50%. </p><p>  It is important to note that the size of the mortgage cannot exceed 85% of the estimated or contractual value of the property.  This housing is then pledged. </p><p>  When purchasing housing under construction, the client can rely on the same conditions, but the final percentage on the mortgage will be an order of magnitude lower.  If a loan is issued under a preferential program with the participation of the developer, the loan cannot be issued for more than 12 years. </p><h2>  Interest rates </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.oceanbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Credit at sberbank" class="if uuid-3184802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3184802.jpg"></div><p>  Sberbank currently has various base rates.  When making a transaction for the purchase of finished housing, the client can count on 11% per annum. </p><p>  With a down payment of 50%, it increases to 11.6%.  The base rate for the purchase of housing under construction is considered to be a rate of 10.5%.  When participating in a subsidy program for a period of 7 to 12 years, it decreases to 9%, and for a period of up to 7 years - to 8.5%. </p><p>  Moreover, there is a system of lowering and raising interest rates.  For example, when purchasing an apartment using the DomKlik portal, the rate is reduced by 0.3%.  This is a special service designed for the sale, purchase and search of real estate. </p><p>  If you have a salary card in Sberbank, then with life insurance you can reduce the rate by 1%, and if you purchase housing from certain developers for up to 12 years, reduce it by another 2%.  Also, with electronic registration of property rights without visiting the multifunctional center and Rosreestr, the rate is reduced by 0.1%. </p><p>  If there is no salary card, then you can confirm your income using a certificate issued by the bank or 2-NDFL, which will allow you to reduce the final percentage by another 0.3%. </p><p>  For example, when buying a property for 5 million rubles, the minimum contribution will be equal to 750 thousand rubles.  If you take the maximum loan for 30 years, confirming income, insuring life and using electronic registration, you can count on a rate of 11%. </p><p>  To approve the loan you need a monthly income of 57,820 rubles.  The monthly payment will be 40,474 rubles. </p><h2>  Package of documents </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.independent.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Certificate of maternity capital" class="if uuid-3184803" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3184803.jpg"></div><p>  To register a mortgage for maternity capital in Sberbank, the documents you need to provide depend on many factors.  The main package includes: </p><ul><li>  application form; </li><li>  passport of the borrower and all co-borrowers with a registration mark; </li><li>  certificate for you to receive the mat.  capital; </li><li>  certificate from the branch of the Pension Fund on the generated balance of funds mat.  capital; </li><li>  confirmation of employment and income. </li></ul><p>  To confirm your income, you can use one of several methods: </p><ul><li>  working citizens submit an income statement for the last six months from their place of work; </li><li>  retirees - a certificate of their pension for the previous month; </li><li>  Entrepreneurs - tax return for the last reporting tax period. </li></ul><p>  Even more options exist to confirm employment.  You can do this in the following ways: </p><ul><li>  if this is the main place of work, then an extract from the work book, a copy of it or a certificate from the employer with information about the length of service and the position of the borrower should be provided; </li><li>  if this is a part-time job, then a copy of the employment contract or contract, stitched and paginated (on the last page it is signed by the employer indicating the total number of sheets); </li><li>  for an entrepreneur - a certificate of registration of an individual entrepreneur (if the original is not available, it can be replaced by a copy certified by a notary), as an alternative, you can use a record sheet from the Unified Register of an individual entrepreneur or a certificate of entry of an individual entrepreneur in the Unified Register. </li></ul><h2>  Additional documents </h2><p>  In some cases, you may need additional documents.  For example, if you leave another property as collateral, then you will need documents on the collateral provided to you. </p><p>  If the borrower has temporary registration, then you can‚Äôt do without a certificate of receipt of registration at the place of his actual residence. </p><p>  If it is not possible to submit papers on official employment and income, additional papers will be needed to verify your identity.  This can be a military ID, a passport, a driver‚Äôs license, a certificate of an employee of federal government agencies, a pension insurance certificate, that is, SNILS. </p><p>  When registering a preferential mortgage at a rate of 6%, birth certificates are needed for all the children of the client.  If they do not indicate citizenship, then documentary evidence that it is Russian. </p><p>  If we plan to get a loan under the Young Family program, then provide a birth certificate, marriage certificate, as well as a confirmation of kinship, if you use the income of the applicant's parents in the calculations. </p><p>  After approval of the application, it is recommended to submit documents for the property that you took in a mortgage.  For example, an equity or sale contract.  You will also need documents that confirm the payment of the down payment, if the maternity capital is used to cover the main amount of the debt. </p><p>  Please note that in Sberbank you can conduct electronic registration of a transaction.  In this case, the employees of the financial institution independently send the entire package of documents to the Federal Registration Service, and the client receives them already registered. </p><h2>  Preferential mortgage </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.commonfloor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get a mortgage" class="if uuid-3184809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3184809.jpg"></div><p>  Many families can attract a profitable offer: get a loan for real estate when the second child in the family was born in 2019 at a rate of 6%. </p><p>  This state-sponsored mortgage subsidy program is valid for those parents whose second or subsequent child is born between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2022.  They can get a loan for real estate at a minimum rate.  This opportunity is provided to them in the relevant government decree. </p><p>  In this case, the maximum loan amount is 6 million rubles.  When acquiring housing in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Moscow or Leningrad regions, it doubles. </p><p>  When a second child is born, a state subsidy is granted for three years, and when a third or subsequent child is born, for five years.  It is important that the total term of the preferential mortgage cannot exceed 8 years.  This means that if during the existence of the program a third child appears in the family, and after a fourth child, then the subsidy will be provided not for 10, but for 8 years.  This is the maximum possible time. </p><p>  When the subsidy expires, Sberbank raises the interest rate. </p><p>  When registering a preferential mortgage, the down payment must be at least 20%.  Moreover, the acquisition of real estate is allowed only in the primary housing market.  It must be unfinished if purchased under an agreement on participation in shared construction, or already ready for operation. </p><p>  Another prerequisite is that the life of the borrower in this case is insured in one of the companies accredited by Sberbank for the entire duration of the loan. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of the mortgage under the maternity capital in Sberbank, many customers successfully use this opportunity.  They positively assess that more favorable conditions apply to ready-made housing.  This encourages borrowers not to engage in risky equity contracts, when the client runs the risk of being left homeless due to an unscrupulous developer. </p><p>  Those who have already asked for help at one of the branches of Sberbank, say that the application is approved quickly enough, in just three days. </p><p>  At the same time, it is worth recognizing that there are a lot of negative reviews from customers when trying to get a mortgage in Sberbank, even when they use the funds of the parent capital.  For example, the bank often does not approve the requested amount in full, even if the client has a good credit history and a salary card for the financial institution itself. </p><p>  The saddest thing is that often a failure comes without explanation, which simply confuses the borrower. </p>
