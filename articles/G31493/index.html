Since the end of the thirteenth century, he has been ruled by the Grimaldi dynasty, represented by Prince Albert II, who took the throne after his father Rainier III.  This monarch, who died in 2005, during his youth became the hero of one of the most high-profile royal novels of the last two centuries. </p><h2>  Parents </h2><p>  The future monarch, whose full name sounded like Louis-Henri-Bertrand Grimaldi, was born in 1923 in the family of the illegitimate daughter of Louis II Charlotte, who four years earlier was officially recognized as the successor to the throne.  The fact is that otherwise the throne could pass to his second cousin, Wilhelm von Urach, who fought in the First World War on the side of Germany.  The prospect of seeing the Germans as Prince of Monaco did not suit France, which threatened in this case to occupy the principality.  Therefore, Prince Louis II went into violation of all laws by assigning the girl the title of Duchess of Valentinua, and also marrying her to the Frenchman - Count Pierre de Polignac.  The marriage of Rainier's parents did not last long and was dissolved when the boy was ten years old, due to the homosexual relations of his father, information about which became public. </p>

    <h2>  Rainier III, Prince of Monaco: biography before accession to the throne </h2><p>  The future monarch took a course at the best private schools in Switzerland and the UK, and then received a certificate of completion of general humanitarian education in Montpellier and graduated from the Paris Higher School of Political Science.  Upon reaching adulthood, Louis-Henri Grimaldi volunteered to serve in the French army as an officer and took part in hostilities against Nazi Germany in Alsace. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  In the role of the crown prince </h2><p>  In the same 1944, his mother, with the consent of Prince Louis II, transferred her succession rights to her son.  At the same time, the young man did not leave his military career, for the military merits of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, he was awarded the Bronze Star and the Military Cross.  After the end of World War II, he was sent on a French military mission to Berlin, where he took part in resolving economic issues.  In this field, the young man also achieved success, and at the beginning of 1947 the president of the French <span>interim government</span> awarded the heir to the crown of Monaco the Order of the Legion of Honor and the Knight's Cross. </p><h2>  Reign </h2><p>  Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, ascended the throne in 1949, after the death of his grandfather.  Since that time, a real golden era has come in the history of this tiny state.  It is enough to say that it was under him that the country acquired its modern appearance, and great economic and political transformations were made.  In particular, in 1962, Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, initiated the adoption of a new, progressive constitution of the country, and in 1993 this state became a member of the UN with all the ensuing rights.  In addition, thanks to his wise policy aimed at increasing the tourist attractiveness of the principality, the Monte Carlo coast has become one of the most prestigious resort areas in Europe. </p><h2>  Grace Kelly Before Marriage </h2><p>  This style icon and one of the most charming Hollywood divas was born in the USA in 1928 in the family of a wealthy entrepreneur and former Olympic champion Jack Kelly.  He always dreamed that his children would enter high society, and so Grace and her three sisters were raised as little princesses, which helped them a lot in the future.  At the age of six, the girl was sent to a strict Catholic college, where she excelled in exemplary behavior and exceptional diligence.  Later in an expensive private school, she became interested in theater and performed in student performances, and at nineteen she went to New York with the firm intention to acquire the specialty of an actress.  The extraordinary beauty of a young girl from Philadelphia helped her become a model first, and then a sought-after movie star.  And long before Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and Grace Kelly met, she had many admirers and lovers, including famous Hollywood actors, directors, fashion designers and even the Iranian check, who, according to rumors, suggested that she become her next wife.  At the same time, Grace's parents jealously watched their daughter's personal life and hoped very much for a profitable marriage.  Fate smiled at the Kelly family when, during one of the film festivals, their already famous daughter at that time met Rainier III.  The Prince of Monaco, whose photo at that time showed him as a representative young sleek man, immediately recorded the girl among the potential brides, since he was going to get married for a long time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  At the time of the meeting, which took place in the spring of 1955, Grace was at the zenith of fame.  She recently received an Academy Award, but, oddly enough, she was completely alone.  The young people liked each other almost at first glance, and their engagement was soon announced. </p><h2>  Marriage </h2><p>  Grace arrived in Monaco in April 1956 on an ocean liner, accompanied by five friends.  She was greeted like a queen and showered with flowers from the side of a helicopter ordered by the groom's friend - Onassis.  Most of the inhabitants of Monte Carlo sought at all costs to see the bride Rainier III.  Prince of Monaco, whose sister, mother and father were present at the meeting ceremony, simply shone with happiness, which could not be said about his relatives.  The ‚ÄúWedding of the Century‚Äù, as journalists dubbed the ceremony, took place on April 19, after which the couple went on a honeymoon.  Further <span>family life</span> was quite prosperous, at least reporters have never been able to convict the prince of treason.  Grace gave birth to her husband three children, and the last child was born when she was thirty-six. </p>

    <h2>  The death of his wife </h2><p>  Grace Kelly and Prince of Monaco Rainier III, whose children themselves have long become parents, lived together for only 26 years.  In 1982, the princess, along with Princess Stephanie, was in a terrible car accident and died as a result of her injuries.  The daughter of the spouses received serious injuries, but she still managed to save her life.  According to investigators, the princess, who on this day refused the services of a driver and drove a car herself, lost control due to a stroke.  As a result, the car fell off a cliff.  Although the accident happened early in the morning, the necessary <span>medical equipment</span> was delivered to the hospital, where Grace Kelly was brought, only in the evening.  The precious time was lost, and the next doctors told the family that even if the princess remained alive, she would be paralyzed forever and could never return to normal life.  Then Prince Rainier, after consulting with his older children, decided to turn off the life-support equipment. </p><p>  So one of the most desirable and charming women of the planet died, the memory of which is still alive today, after more than 35 years from the date of her death. </p>

    <h2>  Grandchildren and great grandchildren </h2><p>  The Grimaldi family tree after the marriage of Prince Rainier and Grace Kelly gave many branches.  After all, in total at the moment, this couple, long gone into the other world, has nine grandchildren.  Great-grandchildren have appeared relatively recently.  In particular, a couple of years ago the eldest grandson of Prince Rainier, Andrea Casiraghi, the son of Princess Carolina, married.  In this marriage, he had a son, Alexander and a daughter, India.  In 2013, Rafael Elmacher, the son of <span>Charlotte Casiraghi</span> , was born <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Rainier III, Prince of Monaco.  Sister Antoinette </h2><p>  In the marriage of Charlotte, the Duchess of Valentinua, and Pierre de Polignac, in addition to the son of Louis-Henri, a daughter was also born.  The girl was born in 1920 and was named Antoinette.  Since Rainier III, prince of Monaco, was not married and had no children until the age of 33, the princess, born first, hoped to someday take her brother‚Äôs place on the throne or at least put her young son born of a marriage with tennis player Alexander But eh.  They say that she tried in every possible way to prevent the young monarch from getting married.  In particular, Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and his sister were seriously quarreled when a woman put an end to her brother‚Äôs romance with <span>Gisele Pascal,</span> rumors that this young <span>French actress was</span> barren.  However, all attempts to do the same with respect to the American Grace Kelly were unsuccessful.  Most likely, this is why after the movie star married Rainier III and gave birth to an heir, the monarch‚Äôs sister and her lover retired from the yard.  She settled in solitude on the coast with a huge number of cats and dogs and rarely appeared in the world.  However, until her death in 2011, Antoinette of Monaco remained an ardent defender of animal rights. </p>
