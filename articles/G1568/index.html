To verify the validity of your policy, you can use the following publicly available methods.  How to check the insurance policy for authenticity will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  What is CTP for? </h2><p>  The name of the policy shows that it is needed for <span>motor third party liability insurance.</span>  Moreover, this type of insurance is mandatory for all drivers. </p><p>  Thanks to the MTPL policy, the car owner receives a guaranteed compensation for material damage caused by the accident, naturally, when the owner of the insurance is the culprit of the accident.  However, it should be understood that not in all situations it is possible to compensate for the damage caused only at the expense of the amount of money that is due to the driver under insurance.  This policy is very convenient in that the driver does not need to spend his own time, nerves, and also money in the event that he was the culprit in the accident.  The fact is that the insurance company will deal with compensation for the damage caused.  And, of course, we should not forget that the monthly amount of the insurance payment, as a rule, is much less than compensation for the damage caused.  Thus, for any citizen who may get into an accident, compulsory motor third-party liability insurance will be a rather useful acquisition.  That is why it is imperative to verify the authenticity of the MTPL insurance policy. </p>

In a situation where law enforcement agencies find an unscrupulous seller, we can hope for a refund of the cost of a previously purchased policy.  In the event that the driver himself decided to save and purchase a <span>fake document,</span> it is important to remember the possible consequences.  Firstly, if the car owner becomes the culprit of a traffic accident, then he will pay the injured party from his own pocket.  Secondly, he will be deprived of a driver‚Äôs license, and will also be prosecuted or administrative, in addition, they will write a heavy fine.  In order not to fall into such an unpleasant situation in the future, you must know in advance how to check the insurance policy for authenticity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="verify the authenticity of the CTP insurance policy" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/956307.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  How to avoid becoming a victim of scammers </h2><p>  If an unfamiliar <span>insurance agent</span> offers to purchase or extend the CTP policy in the same company or in the office where the contract was previously drawn up, you should definitely ask him to submit a power of attorney for the right to this activity.  In addition, you need to call the central office of the insurance company and ask if such an employee works for them.  You should also not save on the purchase of a binding document, you can not get it from hand in clandestine places.  It is better to overpay a little and be sure of its validity, so that later you do not wonder how to check the insurance policy for authenticity. </p>

    <h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  When concluding an insurance contract, you should contact a time-tested company.  When choosing it, it is better to inquire the opinions of people experienced in this matter.  As practice shows, driver reviews are the most faithful.  In addition, the verification of the MTPL policy should be carried out at the time of signing the contract, that is, on the spot.  It‚Äôs better to be safe again than to solve unexpected problems later. </p>
