    <p>  Unfortunately, the housing stock in our country is represented not so much by spacious new buildings as by Brezhnevka and Khrushchev with small kitchens built in the USSR.  Installing a full-fledged headset with household appliances on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã6 squares becomes a real problem.  Therefore, buyers are primarily interested in the sizes of built-in dishwashers, ovens, refrigerators, and only then their functions and capabilities. </p><h2>  What are dishwashers? </h2><p>  All <span>built-in dishwashers,</span> as well as free-standing, can be divided into 2 categories: table and floor.  Floor in turn are divided into narrow and full-sized.  There is also a category such as partially built-in, but we will talk about them a little later. </p><h2>  Desktop Dishwashers </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Already from the name it becomes clear that such models are installed on the countertop, or on a special stand, at a certain height above the floor.  Desktop dishwashers, the small sizes of which attract a number of customers, are not so common.  As a rule, they are purchased by families of 1-2 people.  For example, a dishwasher Electrolux ESL 2450 is designed for 6 sets.  Its dimensions: height 44.7, width 54.5, depth 49.4 cm. </p><h2>  Narrow floor dishwashers </h2><p>  Perhaps this is the most sought after dishwasher.  Sizes of 45 cm or less in width allow you to place it in almost any kitchen.  Such models are built under the countertop.  They already go for 9-11 sets and are designed for a family of 3-4 people.  An example of a narrow dishwasher is the Candy CDI P96 machine. </p><p>  It should be clarified that the width of the dishwasher during installation differs from that indicated on the price tag.  The fact is that in stores they are rounded up, and a model with parameters 43.7 will turn into a machine 45 cm deep. Naturally, in order not to spoil the headsets and not to make mistakes in dimensions, you should focus on the installation diagram that comes with the instructions. </p><h2>  Wide dishwashers </h2><p>  They are designed for a large family.  The width of such models is 60 cm, they include 14-17 sets of dishes.  Sometimes budget models of this plan are purchased for small cafes and eateries.  By design, by characteristics, they are similar to narrow, differ only in large dimensions. </p><h2>  Partially integrated dishwashers </h2><p>  They can be both desktop and floor.  They differ from fully built-in ones in that the decorative panel of the cabinet partially hides them - the control panel remains visible.  Such models are purchased </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="top dishwashers" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/576765.jpg" width="375"></div>  or, which is not important, that the headset looks like a whole.  In addition, this design somewhat simplifies turning on / off the machine and the choice of programs.

What does it give?  The dimensions of the built-in dishwashers in height are 82 cm, of the freestanding - 85 cm. If you remove the lid, then the freestanding ones will become just 3 cm lower, i.e. they will be equal in height to the built-in ones and will just enter under the countertop.  Of course, a decorative facade cannot be hung on such a dishwasher, but nevertheless it will be hidden from 3 sides and can become part of the headset. </p><p>  And if the buyer needs a non-standard dishwasher?  Sizes of 40 cm in width, 82 in height and 55 in depth, of course, some will find it very attractive.  However, from a practical point of view it is not practical to produce such a narrow model.  After all, 40 cm - these will only be external dimensions.  From them you need to subtract the thickness of the insulation, the inner coating of stainless steel.  As a result, there will be a very small working space. </p><h2>  Design features and number of sets </h2><p>  The dimensions of built-in dishwashers often determine their design.  Table options come with one pull-out basket, floor - with two.  As a rule, heavily soiled, burnt utensils are laid on the lower tier, less so on the upper tier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dishwasher dimensions 40 cm" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/576756.jpg" width="296"></div>  lurid.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Describing the characteristics and dimensions of built-in dishwashers, manufacturers often indicate: 6 sets, 8, 10. One set includes 11 items, including mugs, cutlery, soup plates.  It turns out that even the desktop model will include 66 items, and even the wide outdoor one - more than 150. At first glance it seems that this is a lot, even a large family does not pick up so many dishes per day.  However, everything is not so simple, the number of sets does not take into account the size and shape of objects.  Take, for example, a 5-liter pan or a large frying pan, put them in a basket and that‚Äôs it - most of the free space will be occupied.  In addition, if you have dinner and lunch at home from deep plates, then you can‚Äôt put the dishes tight to each other, otherwise it will not wash well.  We'll have to put it through one, and such an arrangement, in turn, will also take part of the space. </p><p>  What is the difference between dishwashers?  The small size of desktop options on the one hand is a plus, on the other - a significant minus.  It is difficult to put a high pan, a baking sheet from a stove, or some other large-sized things in a compact model.  In desktop versions, manufacturers came up with a solution to this problem.  In some models, the upper basket can be rearranged by raising its centimeters by 10. In some models, it can be removed altogether - with the help of this simple manipulation, sufficient space is freed up to fit a 10-liter bucket inside. </p><h2>  Washing, drying and energy class </h2><p>  Nowadays, when almost every apartment has electricity meters, the amount of energy consumed becomes one of the most important characteristics of technology.  Classes of washing, drying and energy consumption are indicated by the letters A, B, C, D. And - the most economical.  The best dishwashers are indicated by the letters AAA.  This means that the model consumes </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bosch dishwasher sizes" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/576757.jpg" width="600"></div>  minimum energy, dries as efficiently as possible and washes dishes without residues.  Far from always a dishwasher with high energy efficiency classes is expensive.  In stores quite often there are budget models, for example, Zanussi ZDT 12002 FA.  The drying class directly depends on what type of drying is installed in the machine: condensation or turbo-drying.

    <p>  During condensation, the back wall is cooled, the dishes are rinsed with hot water and held for some time.  In contact with a cold surface, the vapor condenses - moisture is removed.  The disadvantages of this method are that the washing cycle time increases, the dishes often remain wet.  Dishwashers with condensation drying are almost always class B. </p><h2>  Water consumption </h2><p>  This indicator must be paid attention before buying.  Manufacturers are striving to reduce the <span>water consumption</span> that the machine spends for washing.  Some modern floor models consume 9-10 liters per cycle.  It turns out that she washes 11 items in one liter of water - very profitable! </p><h2>  Programs </h2><p>  As a rule, budget models come with 4-5 programs.  It includes: </p><ol><li><p>  Rinse.  Within 5-7 minutes, the machine removes food debris. </p></li><li><p>  Wash heavily soiled dishes.  It is suitable for burnt pans or plates with wasps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electrolux dishwasher" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/575898.jpg" width="475"></div>  tatoo food.  This is one of the longest cycles, which takes place at a maximum temperature of 65-70 degrees.

    </li><li><p>  Short wash.  It is necessary for lightly soiled plates and spoons, when the owners only had breakfast and immediately put the dishes in the car. </p></li><li><p>  Normal washing.  This is an intermediate option between short and heavily soiled.  The temperature in this mode is 60 degrees. </p></li></ol><p>  <span>The best dishwashers</span> have 8-10 or more programs.  These are programs such as: </p><ol><li><p>  Half load.  It is used when the machine is not fully loaded with dishes.  Reduces washing time, powder consumption and the required amount of water. </p></li><li><p>  Power saving  In this case, the cycle time increases and the temperature decreases. </p></li><li><p>  Crystal.  The program is designed for washing crystal glasses or dishes made of thin glass. </p></li><li><p>  3 in 1. This mode is specially selected <span>for washing dishes with detergents</span> in tablets.  The temperature and the rotation intensity of the rocker arms are selected so that both the detergent and the rinse aid dissolve at the right time. </p></li><li><p>  Bio program.  Reduces the temperature during washing, thereby allowing bio-enzymes contained in detergents to more effectively break down dirt and grease. </p></li></ol><p>  Only the most common modes are described here, there are many others (automatic, fast and clean, Eat-Load-Run and others).  At the same time, do not forget that rarely anyone uses all the programs, but they will certainly increase the cost of the model. </p><h2>  Beam on the floor </h2><p>  This feature should be discussed separately.  On freestanding and partially built-in models, the end time of the program can be easily determined by indicators or numbers on the display.  But how to determine it if the car is completely hidden behind the facade?  The ‚Äúbeam on the floor‚Äù function helps, which is often found in models of brands such as Bosch, Electrolux, Ariston.  The dishwasher is equipped with an LED that projects a light indicator on the floor.  As soon as the machine finishes washing, the indicator goes out. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The display is different.  In some models, this is a tiny window on which you can see only a few numbers, on the other - a full-fledged information screen.  However, a large display is found only in partially built-in models.  In fully integrated </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dishwasher width" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/573741.jpg" width="324"></div>  There is simply nowhere to put it.  What is it for?  The display helps to orient in time: how much the machine will wash in this mode, how much is left until the end of the cycle.  It is also important that in the process of self-diagnostics information is given on it about errors: a door that has not been slammed shut, lack of water in the system, a clogged filter, and others.

    <h2>  Delayed start </h2><p>  Actual function in the presence of a <span>two-tariff counter.</span>  If the family goes to bed early, it is enough to load the machine, press the button, and it will start washing in the middle of the night - at a time when the cost of electricity is minimal.  There are 2 types of delayed start: hourly and fixed.  The first is found in models with a display: by pressing the button, you can delay the launch of the program by 1.2 3 or more hours.  Fixed set on typewriters without display.  In this case, the start of the wash is delayed by 3, 6 or 9 hours. </p><h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  Before buying a dishwasher, one way or another the question arises, which manufacturer is better?  Of course, a definite answer to it does not exist.  Some are surely attracted by the Electrolux dishwasher, with its stylish European design and rich feature set.  Others will opt for the simple Beco, which, despite the budget price, satisfies most needs.  Still others will love the sleek, discreet, reliable <span>Bosch dishwasher.</span>  Sizes can also be chosen according to your taste and design of the kitchen set.  Desktop options can be hidden under the countertop, floor - put in a closet. </p>
