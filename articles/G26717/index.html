Yekaterinburg: the history of the city</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Yekaterinburg is one of the largest cities in our country.  It is relatively young and is one of the settlements that were founded during the emergence of Russian industry and the development of the Urals.  That is why when they talk about Yekaterinburg, the history of the city is full of events related to ironworks and metallurgy.  Let's start the acquaintance. </p><h2>  Yekaterinburg: the history of the region before the advent of Russian settlers </h2><p>  To date, scientists have facts that allow us to argue that the territory of modern Yekaterinburg was inhabited already in the 8-7th millennia <span>BC.</span>  Between the 6000th and 5000th years BC.  e.  the population of these places was actively engaged in the development of natural resources of the region, as evidenced by artifacts found during excavations of ancient workshops.  As for the processing of metals, it began to be dealt with on the shores of Iset since about the 1st century AD. </p>

    <h2>  First factories </h2><p>  At the time the Russian settlers appeared on the territory of modern Yekaterinburg, there was no permanent population there, and nomads and hunters who were representatives of Turkic and Finno-Ugric ethnic groups sometimes stopped there.  The first Russian settlement in these places is considered to be the village of Old Believers on the shores of Lake Shartash, which was founded around 1672.  A little later, the settlements of Lower and Upper Uktus also appeared.  After <span>it became known</span> about the natural riches of these places, in 1702 a decision was made to found Uktusky, and in 1704 - Shuvakishsky ironworks.  However, these state-owned enterprises did not operate as efficiently as they belonged to the Demidov family, so in 1720 <span>Vasily Tatishchev</span> and Johann Blier were sent to the Urals with an inspection.  Arriving at the Uktus plant, they founded there the Siberian ober-bergamite - the highest body for managing state plants in the region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As the results of Tatishchev's research showed, an extremely unsuccessful place was chosen for the construction of the Shuvakish and Uktus plants.  Therefore, the new Ober-bergamite collegium sent to St. Petersburg a request for <span>permission to build a</span> new enterprise 7 km from the old one.  It was not satisfied, and Tatishchev was removed from business, ordering him to return to the capital. </p>

    <h2>  Foundation of the city </h2><p>  After 2 years, Georg de Gennin arrived on the Urals by order of Peter the Great, who, having familiarized himself with the rejected project of his predecessor, fully supported him.  The construction was started on March 12, 1723, and by order of the government for its organization the Demidovs were forced to send their best specialists to the shores of Iset. </p><p>  In November 1723, the launch of the hammers was carried out in the plant‚Äôs workshop, and this event is considered today to be the foundation day of Yekaterinburg. </p><h2>  Yekaterinburg: the history of the city in the first half of the 18th century </h2><p>  At the time of its foundation, the new metallurgical enterprise was the largest and most powerful in the world.  Major General Gennin, who led the project, personally turned to Catherine the First with a request to award the name of Katerinburg to the fortress factory.  The empress graciously agreed, but ordered to name the city of Ekaterinburg.  This name did not take root, and soon the toponym Yekaterinburg appeared on the map of Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The history of the development of metallurgy in the Urals from that moment began to resemble an exciting novel full of intrigue and dramatic events.  Suffice it to say that Old Believers from all over Russia and fugitive Moscow rebel archers began to settle in the city.  There, they practically turned into slaves, and those who tried to escape were sent to a prison, which today would be called a concentration camp. </p><h2>  Pugachev rebellion </h2><p>  So the city was built literally on the bones of workers, there was ripening discontent.  So, during the Pugachevsky uprising, many residents were not averse to surrendering Yekaterinburg to the rebels.  History has preserved evidence, including that the riot was brewing even among officers who were dissatisfied with the commander of the fortress, General Bibikov. </p><h2>  Mountain town </h2><p>  After the Great <span>Siberian Highway</span> passed through Yekaterinburg <span>,</span> its rapid development as a transit hub between Europe and Asia began.  During these years, his appearance radically changed.  In particular, many historical monuments of Yekaterinburg were created, which today are considered its main attractions. </p><p>  In 1807, the city was awarded the status of a mountain, which gave some privileges.  Since that time, the heyday of the gold mining industry began to be observed, associated with the discovery in the vicinity of the city of 85 deposits of this precious metal.  Thanks to the development of mines, the city began to rapidly grow rich and turn into one of the most important economic and cultural centers of the Russian Empire.  A mountain museum, a professional theater, a meteorological observatory, etc. were opened there. </p>

    <h2>  The history of the city from the second half of the 19th century until the revolution of 1917 </h2><p>  After the abolition of serfdom in 1861, mining began to decline.  The crisis affected Yekaterinburg.  The history of its development since that time went a slightly different way.  In other words, in modern terms, there was a <span>diversification of the economy,</span> which ultimately had a positive impact on the lives of citizens.  The construction of the railroad connecting the city with Perm contributed a lot to the development of Yekaterinburg. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, the city became the center of the revolutionary movement, headed by Jacob Sverdlov.  In 1905, the mass anti-government rally organized by him was dispersed by the Cossacks and Black Hundreds, who also staged a bloody pogrom. </p><p>  Before the outbreak of World War I, A. Kerensky, who managed to hold a revolutionary gathering, was a frequent guest in Yekaterinburg.  In parallel with this, ordinary life was going on in the city, and almost on the eve of the revolution of the 17th year, the first university in the Urals was founded.  In general, the history of schools in Yekaterinburg is very interesting, if only as an example of the correct organization of public education in the province. </p><h2>  Civil War </h2><p>  Even the history of the streets of Yekaterinburg and its individual houses is of great interest.  So, everyone knows the Ipatiev House, where in 1918 the whole family and some close associates of Nicholas II were shot.  This was preceded by a bloodless seizure of power in the city in October 1917 and the arrest of the emperor, followed by his transfer to the Urals.  Then the city for some time was first under the control of the Czech corps, and later - the troops of Kolchak.  However, in 1919, units of the 2nd and 3rd armies of the Red Army entered Yekaterinburg. </p>

    <h2>  Sverdlovsk </h2><p>  In 1924, Yekaterinburg was renamed.  The Soviet name of the city sounded like Sverdlovsk and lasted until 1991.  Before <span>the Second World War, the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãdeveloped rapidly, and new educational and cultural institutions, as well as large industrial enterprises, opened there.  In subsequent years, all this potential has done a good job of defeating fascism and restoring the destroyed economy of the Soviet Union.  In the postwar decades, the development of Yekaterinburg continued at a rapid pace, and by the beginning of the collapse of the USSR it was a prosperous city with developed industry. </p>

    <h2>  21st century </h2><p>  The perestroika years and the ‚Äúdashing 90s‚Äù did not have the best effect on the economy of Yekaterinburg.  In particular, many industrial enterprises were closed.  However, with the beginning of the 2000s, the situation has changed, and today the city continues to experience an economic upsurge.  At the moment, a variety of political, cultural and recreational events are held in Yekaterinburg.  For example, the Love Story project was recently launched.  Yekaterinburg also often becomes a venue for sporting events, and its attractions attract tourists, including from abroad. </p>
