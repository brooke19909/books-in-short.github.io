This model is very new, so little is known about it.  In most cases, the quality of a device can be judged only by numerous user reviews, as well as by watching a video describing the characteristics of a smartphone.  To be honest, it is always important to understand how good or bad this or that model of device for talking is.  After all, if we face a really good product, we can buy it and then use it without any problems.  Let's take a closer look at the Micromax Canvas Knight A350. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="micromax canvas knight a350" class="if" height="468" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/954245.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  What should I look for when choosing any smartphone?  Of course, on its size.  Of course, all sorts of characteristics play a very important role.  But the convenience of using it depends on the size of the device.  To be honest, now it is customary to produce large phones.  Allegedly, this is more convenient for users.  Indeed, sometimes this is so.  Only there are exceptions.  For example, when it comes to how to store and carry a gadget. </p><p>  In truth, the dimensions of the Micromax Canvas Knight A350 can be called quite cumbersome.  But this smartphone also belongs to the category of ultra-thin phones.  What are its sizes?  In length - 14.4 centimeters, in width - 7. But the thickness here is very small.  Only 7.3 millimeters.  In principle, if more performance than dimensionality is important to you, then the Micromax Canvas Knight A350 is the perfect solution for any customer who keeps up with the times.  But let's try to figure out what other evaluation criteria can help us make our decision. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Another pretty important indicator is the device‚Äôs screen.  Any presentation of the <span>Micromax A350</span> Canvas Knight (video review in other words) begins with a demonstration from that moment.  So what is special about the display of our today's smartphone? </p><p>  The thing is that it is worth paying attention primarily to its diagonal.  5 inches is the perfect size for a modern phone.  And the Micromax Canvas Knight A350 has just such dimensions.  On such a device it is very convenient to play games, read books, and also watch videos and web pages. </p><p>  Resolution also turns out to be at a height of 1080 x 1920 pixels.  Not every new phone has such indicators.  Regarding the transmitted colors, we can only say that you will get a wonderful device that can demonstrate 16 million colors and shades.  Plus, everything that is displayed on the display will be extremely bright, rich and beautiful in general.  But with all this, there will be no pressure on the eyes.  And if you need a good smartphone that will convey the full brightness of the colors of the world, you have come to the address.  The Micromax A350 Canvas Knight is the perfect solution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="micromax a350 canvas knight reviews" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/954244.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is worth noting that the screen of this model is capacitive, touch.  It supports up to 10 touches simultaneously.  Also a very good indicator, which pleases buyers.  In addition, the device has a protective glass Coming <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 3. Perhaps this is what can protect the screen from damage and scratches when dropped.  Also, the display, thanks to a good glass, is well protected from moisture.  What every modern user needs. </p><h2>  New word in smartphones </h2><p>  There is another, main feature of our today's model.  The thing is that in the Micromax A350 Canvas Knight the review always emphasizes what is not found in any modern smartphone - processor power.  In general, this detail, along with the operating system of the device, is very important.  It affects the rate of performance and the quality of functioning in general. </p><p>  What do we have regarding our phone?  The thing is that the Micromax A350 Canvas Knight Gold is equipped with an 8-core processor with a clock frequency of 1.2 GHz.  If we consider this feature without taking into account the cores, then the processor can be called weak.  But in combination with 8-fold repetition, this is not just a smartphone, but a real beast.  Powerful, fast and high quality. </p><p>  Regarding the operating system, everything is pretty commonplace.  The point here is limited to the familiar ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  Only the version installed is quite new - Jollybean 4.2.2.  If necessary, you can conduct a quick update.  But in practice such a need did not arise.  After all, our smartphone is already quite powerful.  He is able to launch the latest games and applications in several pieces at a time without any damage to the operating system.  So this fact is extremely pleasing to buyers.  After all, the Micromax Canvas Knight A350 Black smartphone is just what the gamer, the music lover, and the most ordinary user need now. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Next on the list is such an item as memory.  On the phone, it can be operational and ordinary.  Both indicators are extremely important.  After all, it is not enough for a gadget to have a good and powerful processor.  It still has to have "secondary" characteristics that can take from all components to the maximum.  This will contribute to a good, long and quick operation of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="micromax a350 canvas knight review" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/954243.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the Micromax Canvas Knight A350 Black, the RAM is not very large - only 2 GB.  In principle, this is a normal indicator.  Medium for modern smartphones.  A powerful 8-core processor quickly covers this shortcoming.  And this, in turn, contributes to the speed of the telephone system.  Just what modern buyers need.  RAM of this size allows you to simultaneously run up to 20 powerful games, an Internet browser, an e-book and an organizer.  Pretty much everything, isn't it? </p><p>  But any presentation about the Micromax A350 Canvas Knight (video review) also emphasizes the features of ordinary memory.  In other words, the one that can be given for personal data: SMS, MMS, photos, videos, music and so on.  This indicator is considered extremely important for the modern buyer.  Especially if he is used to following the latest in the mobile gaming industry, as well as listening to music tracks and watching movies in high quality.  All of this needs space.  And the Micromax Canvas Knight A350 White provides 16 GB of space.  Of these, about 1.5-2 is occupied by the telephone operating system.  It turns out that the buyer will receive about 14 GB of space for personal use.  This is a very good indicator.  In any case, not every modern smartphone is equipped with so much space. </p><p>  And that's not all.  In truth, the Micromax A350 Canvas Knight, whose review we will learn more and more, has one significant minus for many users.  This is nothing more than the lack of support for additional memory cards.  That is, if you run out of space, you will have to clean your system space of unnecessary (and sometimes necessary) documents to ensure the phone‚Äôs performance.  This flaw scares customers away very much.  Indeed, in most smartphones there is the ability to connect a memory card.  Even a little one.  This technique makes the data installed on the card mobile.  When changing the phone, you won‚Äôt need to think very much about transferring information.  So the lack of a slot for a memory card is a good reason to think about canceling a purchase. </p><h2>  Connectors </h2><p>  What else is important for a smartphone?  Of course, the connectors offered to it.  They are responsible for many functions - connecting and synchronizing the device with a computer, the ability to connect a SIM card, and so on.  Therefore, many people pay attention to this moment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="case for micromax a350 canvas knight" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/954242.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Perhaps, about 10 years ago there were no problems here - all mobiles were made on the same principle, with the same "nests".  But progress does not stand still.  And now, when changing your cell phone, you run the risk of being left without a memory card or, for example, without your phone number.  It is these facts that must be taken into account. </p><p>  Micromax A350 Canvas Knight reviews get very good because this model was created specifically for 2 SIM cards.  That is, the model has the ability to use two numbers simultaneously.  True, the format here is a bit outdated - "micro-sim."  If you now have a ten-year-old number, then just go to your mobile operator - it will replace the ‚Äúbulky" version with a suitable one for this mobile phone.  By the way, Micromax Canvas Knight works great even with different mobile operators.  As a rule, in most models there are various kinds of failures and malfunctions with this approach.  But not at Miromax.  The network will work stably and without interruptions even with simultaneous attempts to talk on two numbers. </p><p>  It is also worth paying attention to the fact that this model of a cell phone has a connector for synchronizing equipment with a computer (USB, version 2.0), as well as a standard headset jack.  If necessary, even speakers can be connected to the smartphone.  Sometimes it is very useful.  And USB 2.0 is a great helper in the field of computer and smartphone synchronization.  All data will be transmitted with great speed and without any damage or malfunction. </p><h2>  World communications </h2><p>  The main purpose of the phone is to maintain communication with the outside world.  So this moment is extremely important for buyers.  Now there are a lot of different kinds of networks, all of them provide a diverse connection of various quality.  Therefore, it is important to know what exactly this or that model of smartphone supports. </p><p>  The thing is that the Micromax A350 Canvas Knight gets very good reviews in this regard.  After all, this model supports standard GPS and GPRS signals, as well as 3G.  This helps you quickly and reliably connect to the World Wide Web, as well as stay in touch.  Plus, there is another rather important point - this is nothing more than support for a 4G network.  It is considered the fastest, best and most reliable.  Recently, smartphones come out with this feature.  Without it, models are considered obsolete. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the Micromax A350 Canvas Knight supports Wi-Fi, as well as Bluetooth 4.0.  This approach best provides wireless connectivity to a variety of devices.  To be honest, the "Bluetooth" is now used quite rarely.  But without it, the phone is considered obsolete.  And he has no chance to become popular, as well as to be considered high-quality and good.  Regarding communication, as you can see, everything is top-notch in our smartphone today. </p><h2>  Working hours </h2><p>  Absolutely any phone, according to modern consumers, should work for a long time.  In principle, these are the right reasons.  After all, initially smartphones were supposed to be used for making calls.  So, you always have to stay in touch.  And in this regard, the battery plays an important role. </p><p>  To be honest, the Micromax Canvas Knight A350, the price of which is embarrassing for some, has a mediocre power and durability indicator.  This is not to say that this model will turn off extremely quickly.  But it does not work as long as we would like. </p><p>  A bit of specificity.  Many buyers claim that in standby mode, the smartphone is able to work about 2 months.  The Micromax Canvas Knight A350 Black gets quite good reviews, as you see.  After all, offline performance is good.  This is subject to the fact that you will not receive and make calls, as well as refuse from any use of phone resources.  Sometimes this is useful, but often there is no such need.  Therefore, consumers pay more attention to operating time with active and moderate contact with the device. </p><p>  In the second case (the situation when the user works with the phone just to talk), the model will function for about 2 weeks.  Not very much, but this indicator will not change over time.  But in the first, with the active use of the device, you can count on only 3 days of work without recharging.  Not so much.  Some smartphone models can now work for about a week in active mode. </p><p>  Another small minus of the phone is the presence of a non-removable battery.  That is, if it suddenly breaks or gets damaged, you will have to suffer a lot with the replacement.  True, so far there have been no complaints about the performance and quality of the battery.  It charges quickly.  And this fact quite pleases buyers.  To recharge the battery by 100%, you need only about 2 hours.  This is not so much as it might seem at first glance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="micromax canvas knight a350 black reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/954240.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Price category </h2><p>  Well, we figured out a little about the characteristics.  Now it's time to pay attention to such a factor as price.  <span>The price tag on the product,</span> as a rule, should correspond to the quality of the device and its capabilities.  But often it is overpriced unjustifiably. </p><p>  On the Micromax A350 Canvas Knight, the review of which we have almost completed, the price, according to many buyers, does not quite match its performance.  This model has significant drawbacks.  And they are extremely important for many.  For example, the lack of a slot for a memory card, the relatively small amount of free space in the system, as well as a non-removable battery.  For all this, you could slightly reduce the cost.  But that will not happen.  After all, the Micromax Canvas Knight is the first eight-core smartphone with a powerful processor.  And you have to pay for it. </p><p>  The average price of a phone of this model is approximately 14,000 rubles.  Sometimes you can find it for 12,000. However, many buyers say that it is too high a price.  If there were some shortcomings, then the price tag would be considered normal.  But in our case this is not so. </p><h2>  Durability </h2><p>  Phone performance is an important criterion when writing reviews.  After all, he is responsible for the life of the smartphone.  In our case, so far there have been no discontent in this regard.  Buyers say that the Micromax Canvas Knight is a pretty high-quality and durable product.  True, with its small flaws. </p><p>  It should be noted that when the smartphone falls down on the display, scratches may appear on the display.  In general, this model is equipped with good protection.  Only in order to further protect your smartphone from damage, you will need a case for Micromax A350 Canvas Knight.  It is included as standard.  So you don‚Äôt have to look for him. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  So the moment has come when we all will decide for ourselves whether it is worth paying attention to this model or not.  In general, all this is decided individually.  Only a little advice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="micromax a350 canvas knight phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/954239.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If space and price are not important for you, then you can pay attention to Micromax.  For music lovers or active players, this is not the best option.  You can always find yourself a cheaper analogue with support for an additional memory card connection. </p>
