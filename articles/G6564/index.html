  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of the development of computer science as a science</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Computer science is one of the youngest sciences.  She studies the properties and patterns of information, methods of its use in human life. </p><p>  The history of the development of computer science begins with the advent of the first <span>electronic computers</span> in the late 40s - early 50s of the twentieth century.  These were the first computers operating on electronic tubes.  Closer to the 60s, discrete semiconductor computers were invented.  And in the mid-60s, machines equipped with integrated circuits appeared. </p><p>  The history of the development of information systems is closely connected with the fact that it was always difficult for a person to make complex mathematical calculations in the mind or on paper.  The inquiring mind of people sought to automate computing processes by using simple accounts, a slide rule.  And finally, in 1642, Pascal created an eight-digit summing mechanism.  After 2 centuries, Charles de Colmar improved it to an arithmometer, which performed more complex mathematical operations in the form of multiplication and division.  Accountants were delighted with this invention. </p><p>  But the actual history of the development of information technology begins with the presentation of the ideas underlying the modern computers in 1833 by the Englishman <span>Charles Babbage.</span>  He first used punch cards, the holes of which served to <span>transmit information.</span>  These were the first steps of programming. </p><p>  The history of the development of information systems was continued in 1888 by an engineer from America <span>German Hollerith,</span> who owns the authorship of the first calculating machine of the electromechanical type.  It was tested during the census in 1890 and was impressed by its results and the speed of calculation.  Whereas previously, to carry out this amount of work, 500 employees were required who pored over the numbers for seven consecutive years, then Hollerith, who handed out to each of the 43 computer assistants, managed this amount of work for one month. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The history of the development of information technology is also grateful to Hollerith for the fact that he founded the company, which later became known as IBM and today is a giant in global computerization.  Its employees, together with scientists at Harvard University, built the first electronic computer in 1940, which they called the Mark-1.  This whopper weighed 35 tons, and the US military department acted as the customer for the computer.  Machine calculated in <span>binary system.</span>  For 300 operations of multiplication and 5000 operations of addition, she spent only one second.  But the lamps quickly failed and this problem was solved by Bardin, Brattain and Shockley - the inventors of semiconductor transistors. </p><p>  Thus, the history of the development of computer science has come to the point of a radical reduction in the size of computers, and their next generation was significantly smaller.  And the speed of computing abilities increased 10 times. </p><p>  Further, the entire history of the development of computer science in the world will be associated with the miniaturization of computers.  And the American company DIGITAL EQUIPMENT succeeds in this respect, then INTEL.  And in the mid-70s of the XX century, personal computers of the now famous company APPLE also appeared. </p><p>  The history of the development of computer science in our country begins with a small electronic computer (MSEM), which performed 50 operations per second.  Its designer was Sergey Alexandrovich Lebedev.  Her path was rather thorny in our country.  And today we no longer imagine a full life without the use of computers.  And if you look back, then quite a bit of time has passed.  So technical thought is even ahead of time.  PCs, laptops and netbooks are a special sign of the modern era. </p>
