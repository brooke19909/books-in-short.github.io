    <h2>  Materials for the manufacture of folk toys </h2><p>  Traditionally, handicrafts are molded from clay.  But other options are also possible - plasticine and salt dough.  In this case, the difference is only in the material, the <span>toy</span> itself <span>(Dymkovo</span> lady) with its own hands is performed similarly to traditional samples. </p><p>  In classes with children, when organizing joint creativity, you can choose any of three materials.  Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.  Modeling the Dymkovo ladies in stages - a repetition of the same operations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Clay, the most common material, requires great effort and special equipment, but the products are durable and the most reliable, close to the original. </p><p>  Children do not like to work with cold, wet and capricious clay, which must be constantly moistened in the process of work, they enjoy warm and soft plasticine or supple dough. </p><h2>  Dymkovo young lady from plasticine step by step </h2><p>  The process begins with the preparation of the workplace.  First you need to take the material for modeling.  You can use several options: </p><ul><li>  ordinary color plasticine; </li><li>  plain sculptural clay; </li><li>  polymer clay; </li><li>  hardening plastic. </li></ul><p>  A few items to prepare in advance: </p><ul><li>  plank or dense oilcloth; </li><li>  stacks (shovels for work); </li><li>  stand for the product; </li><li>  acrylic paints (when working with one-color material). </li></ul>

    <h2>  Manufacturing steps </h2><ol><li>  The basis of the toy.  The Dymkovo young lady begins with a large skirt.  First you need to stretch a piece of plasticine and roll a ball out of it.  Then make a recess in the lower part and, gradually expanding it, form a semblance of a cup with thick walls.  Continuing to enlarge the hole, at the same time pull the clay up so that the bowl looks like an elongated inverted vase.  Set on a stand and level the surface of the future skirt.  On this, the first stage of modeling is over. </li><li>  The body is made of a piece of plasticine formed in the form of a cone.  A head in the shape of a ball and pens made in the form of two friends are attached on top.  The base of the doll is finished.  All parts stick together to make the toy look solid. </li><li>  Decorative elements.  The characteristic wave-like frills are the most recognizable feature; they are abundantly decorated with a Dymkovo young lady.  To make them you need to stock up on long strips of plasticine.  To make them, you need to roll a thin layer, like a flat cake, and cut it with a ruler and a special plastic knife into even beautiful long stripes. </li><li>  Collect each strip in your hands, forming frills, fix their edges on one side.  These elements can be placed on the skirt, in the form of cuffs on the sleeves, in the shape of a crown laid around the head, and another apron is formed on top of the plane of the skirt. </li><li>  Additional decorations are various items.  For example, a handbag, a rocker with buckets, a basket, a large kalach, small children or a small pet that stuck to the hem of the mistress in the literal sense of the word. </li><li>  Often a high hat is used as an accessory.  It is necessary to mold it from a small cylinder, which is attached to the head of the craft.  Then, fields in the form of folded wavy frills are formed from plasticine strips.  Now the Dymkovo young lady from plasticine is dressed up, as expected. </li><li>  The finishing touch is the design of the face, which consists of small elements, circles made of balls.  It is necessary to stick eyes, nose, rosy cheeks and mouth. </li><li>  If the product is made of colored plasticine, polymer clay or baked plastic, at this stage it is considered complete.  In the case of working with monophonic <span>sculptural clay, the</span> doll is covered with acrylic paint. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dymkovo young lady from plasticine step by step" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42740/1280049.jpg" width="508"></div></h2><h2>  Dymkovo lady from salt dough </h2><p>  The second most popular material for crafts, which is often used when working with children.  It has its own characteristics and advantages.  Unlike plasticine, the dough does not deform due to temperature changes, is not covered with a greasy sheen and can maintain its shape for much longer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are two main ways to make dough crafts.  In the first case, the product is baked in the oven and covered with varnish or egg yolk, in the second - salt is added as a preservative.  This ingredient prevents decomposition and deterioration from moisture.  The craft retains its shape and solid texture. </p><p>  For the manufacture of toys "Dymkovo young lady" will need two types of material.  The fact is that different components affect the density and plasticity.  The base is made of steeper dough, which is suitable for large and voluminous fragments, keeps its shape and does not lose shape.  Small finishing elements, decorative frills are fashioned from a more plastic material, which is supple and suitable for delicate work. </p><h2>  Modeling dough </h2><p>  Recipe and list of ingredients for the base: </p><ul><li>  sifted wheat flour, 1 cup; </li><li>  small common salt (not iodized), 1 cup; </li><li>  water, 125 ml. </li></ul><p>  It is necessary to mix salt and flour in a dry state and only then gradually add water, thoroughly mixing, until the water supply runs out.  As a result, the mass should be elastic. </p>

    <h2>  Cooking flour mass for additional items </h2><p>  The recipe for making dough for small parts: </p><ul><li>  flour, well sifted - 1, 5 cups; </li><li>  small salt - 1 cup; </li><li>  glycerin - 4 tablespoons (tablespoons); </li><li>  glue for wallpaper or starch - 2 tablespoons (tablespoons); </li><li>  water - 150-125 ml. </li></ul><p>  When preparing the mixture, you can use kitchen appliances, for example, a mixer, to facilitate the task.  Food dyes can be added to the dough, and then the manufacturing process will be similar to working with colored plasticine. </p>

    <p>  All stages of the formation of elements and sculpting are similar to the classical rules.  The dough behaves in hands like clay and plasticine.  For best results, you should knead a mass of dense texture and moderately elastic.  In this case, all the frills will not lose their shape, and the body will retain the desired shape. </p><h2>  Final stage </h2><p>  After the dough is molded, it must be dried and covered with paint.  First, with a primer, acrylic white, and then paint with conceived elements, geometric patterns and ornaments. </p>
