It is especially hard experienced if the deceased passed away not for natural reasons, such as old age, or because of a serious illness, from which, alas, no one is safe.  Even an accident, no matter how ridiculous it may be, is not perceived by others as painfully as suicide.  Most of our fellow citizens consider this departure from life to be sinful, sharing the church‚Äôs point of view on this issue.  And the resonance becomes much wider when this happens to a famous person holding a prominent and responsible post.  In August 2011, General Morev, head of the FSB Main Directorate for the Tver Region, shot himself with a personal weapon in his own office.  Sinister rumors immediately spread ... </p>

    <h2>  early years </h2><p>  What kind of person was a senior counterintelligence officer can be judged by his track record.  General Morev worked in the KGB of the USSR from the beginning of the eighties.  The personnel management of this very serious organization was engaged in verification of future employees.  You can have a different attitude to the communist ideology and the Soviet-collective farm system;  Today, pointing out the mistakes and crimes of the party apparatus is not only not forbidden, but even considered good form.  But even the most active dissidents could not deny the high professional and moral qualities of the Chekists.  They really did not take bribes, served honestly and were mainly engaged in (at least in the late Soviet period) non-spying on narrators of political jokes.  The ‚Äúcommittee members‚Äù opposed foreign intelligence, did the same in the years of his youth (he was then 24 years old) and General Morev his biography contains information on the personal participation in the detention of several foreign spies, red-handed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Chekist‚Äôs education testifies to his high intellectual level; he successfully graduated from Krasnoyarsk University with a degree in aerospace. </p>

    <h2>  Service in the FSB </h2><p>  After the <span>collapse of the USSR,</span> General Morev Konstantin Anatolyevich did not go into business, like many of his colleagues, but continued in the difficult first years of Russia's independence to do the same work that he had done before.  His efforts were noticed, summoned to Moscow, and then sent to the Republic of Sakha, where local criminal groups organized drug sales, speculated in diamond-containing ore and traded weapons.  Apparently, General Morev coped with the task successfully.  Then he was transferred from a cold and remote province to the ‚Äúwarm lands‚Äù.  Having headed the FSB Directorate for the Tver Region in 2007, counterintelligence officers, under the direction of an old-school security officer, opened the Nevsky Express case a year before his tragic death.  Then the terrorists blew up the train (28 people were killed).  16 participants in the crime were arrested and convicted, eight more were destroyed on the spot while trying to resist.  This impressive victory of the FSB was reflected in the award lists, including in the name of K. A. Morev.  During his service, he became a holder of the orders "For Merit to the Fatherland" of two degrees and the badge of Honorary Officer of Counterintelligence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  The news that General Morev shot himself, plunged into the woeful amazement of everyone who knew him.  The deceased was known as a brave, cheerful, sociable and bright person.  Still not an old man (a little over fifty), strong and healthy, holding a considerable post, he was a success among women.  In the Soviet years, his personal life could be the subject of consideration by the party bureau - he got divorced three times and got married four times.  For such a desire for diversity, the Chekists could, if not ‚Äútrample‚Äù on the post, then certainly would limit his career.  The gossip was fueled by the fact that the last wife was an employee of the apparatus of the regional governor D. Zelenin.  This wedding somehow seemed to affect the success of Maya (now Moreva): she became the deputy head of the administration.  And then Zelenin was removed. </p><p>  History, in fact, at first glance, discredits the head of the FSB regional administration, but it is unlikely that General Morev would have sent the gun barrel to the temple because of it (the cause of death is a gunshot wound incompatible with life).  Even if it was a questionable career of his wife, such a person would probably leave a note in which he would explain his terrible act, but he did not. </p>

    <h2>  The hypothesis of Nikolaev </h2><p>  A possible version of the events preceding the fatal shot was the result of a journalistic investigation conducted by blogger Saveliy Nikolaev.  True or false name is unknown, as well as how reliable the materials presented by him.  Some of them are verifiable due to the openness of sources, others are likely by indirect signs, while others are not supported by anything.  However, due to the stubborn silence of the official media, it remains to consider the Nikolaev hypothesis as the only one, at least as plausibly explaining why General Morev committed suicide. </p>

    <h2>  Mysterious Mr. Darsania </h2><p>  Almost two years before the tragic event, the office of the head of the regional Federal Security Service was visited by one of the leaders of the company with an empty name, Price Inform.  In fact, such a meeting would be unlikely because of the "difference in weight categories" - as they say, not that level.  But General Morev received the firm, apparently, someone, as they say in Odessa, "asked for him."  Moreover, the recommendation turned out to be so impressive that the guest‚Äôs request was fulfilled without unnecessary formalities, and it consisted of issuing a license for work related to the state secret.  The usual passage of documentation takes a quarter in time, and a piece of paper was required as soon as possible (business considerations).  The name of the intercessor was Solomon Aleksandrovich, his last name was Georgian - Darsania.  There would be an experienced security officer to be wary, not to rush, to check everything, as in the past KGB years, but the call from the Federal Agency for State Property Management demanded friendly assistance, but it was somehow inconvenient to refuse, and it would take too much time.  In short, S. A. Darsania received a license. </p>

    <h2>  Ukrainian trace </h2><p>  Here, in the best detective traditions, a no less mysterious character by the name of Piskurev appears.  He did not need a license, he was completely content with the fact that it was present in Darsania, or rather, in the company Price Inform, with which his company Spetsotsenka had commercial relations.  Nikolaev insists that two businessmen, in addition to business, had some other relations, called previously unnatural, and today are considered quite normal.  However, this has nothing to do with the matter, as well as the question of why General Morev took such a terrible act (why he shot himself), but the Ukrainian citizenship of Piskurev and Georgian Darsania raises questions.  Countries whose passports are carried in their pockets have been unfriendly to Russia in recent years.  But that is not all.  Actually, even with the blueprints of secret Russian developments on hand (we are talking about modern Ka-52 combat helicopters, Igla, Kornet and other equipment), Ukrainian, and even more so Georgian, industry would hardly have mastered their production.  Such materials are of value to American "friends", for example, to the Lockheed company, with which Piskurev‚Äôs Special Assessment collaborates ... </p>

    <h2>  In conclusion </h2><p>  Whatever it was, but the fact is that in 2011, General Morev committed suicide.  Photos in a mourning frame and obituaries published newspapers, the deceased was buried with honors in Abakan (Krasnoyarsk Territory), friends and relatives mourned him.  The circumstances of the tragedy are still kept secret, which indicates that it is too early to remove the mystery from this story.  The fate of dual citizens who did their business in collaboration with the Russian defense industry is also unclear.  Does everybody need to know about this, or is it enough that the FSB dealt with this issue?  Probably, the employees of this service should be trusted - they know their work and for the most part do it honestly. </p>
