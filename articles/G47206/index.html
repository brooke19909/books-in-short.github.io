    <p>  You can lose calories at restaurants in the hotel's fitness room, which is equipped with the most modern fitness equipment.  True, this pleasure costs money.  During the low season (November to March), an indoor pool with climate control is open. </p><p>  Families who come to Tunisia on holiday with their children need not worry about their little ones.  Each child, if he is from 4 to 12 years old, is expected in a children's club organized here called Miniclub.  He works from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.  During this period, parents can breathe calmly and relax properly while their children are in the hands of experienced staff.  The guys will not only be looked after, but they will also be given them all kinds of contests and entertainment.  So it is likely that they will not even want to leave there. </p><p>  Well, what a hotel in Tunisia without its own spa center.  Vacationers are waiting for massage sessions, all kinds of beauty procedures, saunas and a hammam.  And if a guest needs thalassotherapy sessions, then a whole center is located very close to the hotel, where he can get the services he is interested in. </p><h2>  Impressions of tourists from holidays in Iberostar Averroes </h2><p>  An amazing picture develops about the Iberostar Averroes Hammamet 4 * hotel.  Reviews posted on numerous travel sites contain mostly only the highest ratings.  Negative opinions can be counted on the fingers, and even then they are all four or five years ago. </p>

    <p>  Hotel guests unconditionally recommend it for visiting all other tourists and are happy to come here again.  Varied and tasty food, clean rooms, the presence of your own close beach - all this leads tourists to an indescribable delight.  A small minus is getting wireless Internet, which is available mainly only in public places, and the cost of rest, which, of course, is rather high. </p>
