  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Estonia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When you want romance, tranquility and at the same time not spend large sums of money, tourists go to Estonia.  This is a beautiful sea country, which includes about 1,500 islands.  The largest of them are Saaremaa, Muhu, Naissaar, Prangli and others. <span>Beach holidays</span> in Estonia are possible from June to August.  The sea climate reigns here with moderately hot summers and rainy winters.  Estonia is a great combination of cultural sites, resorts and beaches, flavored with nightclubs and restaurants.  Despite its <span>Nordic nature, the</span> country also attracts large youth companies that are not averse to having fun all night. </p><p>  Romantic holidays in Estonia <strong> </strong>  held in pairs mainly in Tallinn.  There are a large number of monuments, museums, churches.  It is worth noting that the whole city is divided into upper and lower parts.  The settlements are separated by a fortress wall, which no longer closes.  Climbing to Vyshgorod on foot is quite difficult, for this you need to be in good physical shape.  This is where most of the monuments and <span>architectural structures are located.</span>  Be sure to visit the Town Hall Square.  In the summer you can meet a large number of traders in various goods of their own production.  Here is an old pharmacy that sells tinctures and herbs.  The Town Hall itself is today a museum.  Not far from it, on P√ºhavaimu Street there is a building of a large guild, inside which there is a large collection of coins.  Acquaintance with exhibits helps to get to know the country better. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many tourists choose hiking in Estonia, because it is so full of attractions that without ordering a single excursion, you will still visit several museums.  Not far from the Guild is the Church of the Holy Spirit, whose clock has not ceased to go from the 17th century.  If you think about it: the hands on the dial have already completed several million circles.  Entrance to the church is free.  A little to the right is the Niguliste church entrance, which costs 4 euros for one adult.  There are chants, as well as excursions to the museum on the territory.  The church fascinates with some kind of chilling beauty.  This is especially noticeable late in the evening when the lower backlight turns on.  Interestingly, under the floor tiles there is a burial place.  Inside the building there is a picture called "Dance of Death."  In general, this is a building for fans to tickle their nerves. </p><p>  Every tourist planning a vacation in Estonia is faced with the problem of choosing a hotel.  As in any European country, they are classified by star.  You can spend the night in an ascetic guesthouse for 10 euros, or you can in a premium class hotel.  The choice depends only on the financial capabilities of the tourist.  It is surprising that Estonia is so far away from Soviet influence that you will not find rudeness or neglect from the staff of institutions at any level. </p><p>  As a rule, last-minute tours to Estonia are especially popular during international holidays.  The country is transforming at this time.  It becomes like a picture from Christmas cards of the early 20th century.  Estonia is beautiful at any time of the year.  It is a very clean and welcoming place.  Many tourists note low prices in Estonian cafes and shops.  Here you can dine very densely, without spending more than 20 euros.  In addition to neat little houses, numerous museums and churches in this country, there are a large number of high-level nightclubs, restaurants, cinemas that will appeal to young people. </p><p>  By purchasing last-minute trips to Estonia at a very competitive price, every tourist gets the opportunity to get acquainted with the most beautiful country in Europe, enjoy good beaches and the sea, and also improve their health. </p>
