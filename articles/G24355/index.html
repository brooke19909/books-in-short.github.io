At any time of the year, this country can give a lot of impressions.  But before you go here, you need to familiarize yourself with some points, so as not to be disappointed later.  It is also worthwhile to decide on accommodation in the resort in advance.  All necessary information on this issue will be presented in this article. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  In the Turkish city of Side in November, the off-season period begins when there is no longer such a sharp heat, but the sun still pampers with its light and warmth.  In the first half of the month, vacationers still bathe and take sun baths, but by the end of October the situation is reversed, and warm clothes have to be worn.  At the beginning of the month, a 24 degree mark may be displayed on the thermometer, but after a few days this value will drop to 19 degrees.  As for night time, this figure is even lower, sometimes you can even freeze.  This applies not only to air, but also to water, which cools down to 20 degrees Celsius.  It is worth saying that the weather in Side in autumn is represented by heavy rainfall in the form of rain.  There is no snow in this area.  If we talk about August, the month is rich in rainy weather, because at this time the entire summer rainfall falls on the territory of the resort.  Together with the rains, Turkey feels the dankness and dullness of the surrounding nature.  However, increased air humidity will be felt only in the last days of the month.  The end of November in Turkey can be called the end of the velvet season.  The weather in Side is starting to deteriorate and a good rest is no longer to be expected. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of rest in Turkey in the fall </h2><p>  You need to understand that taking ultraviolet baths or swimming in the open sea at this time is not the best way of leisure.  And the guides are already ceasing to offer their services so hard, and vacationers use the services of SPA-salons and fitness centers, as well as saunas.  Fans of shopping at this time are actively storming shopping centers, where the discount season for many of the offered goods is just beginning. </p><p>  Souvenir shops sharply reduce the price of goods and sell trinkets almost for nothing, so as soon as possible to close the trade outlets until the next influx of customers.  Accordingly, people even without much reason get good discounts and bonuses when buying goods.  The decrease in air temperature creates a motivation for tourists to buy excursions to such famous cities of Turkish land as Pamukkale and Cappadocia. </p><p>  If you still decide to visit Side, you should take care in advance about where to live in the resort.  A good option would be <span>Side</span> Royal Paradise (ex Desiree) <span>Resort Hotel 4</span> (Kumkoy). </p><h2>  Description </h2>

    <p>  Reviews about the rest in the hotel in most cases are positive.  Delivery to the beach is carried out in a convenient minibus, but it is quite possible to reach it on foot.  The water is very clean and even transparent, at least 30-40 meters must be walked to the depths, which is convenient for families with children. </p><p>  The best time for tanning is from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., then the midst begins and the sun becomes more scorching and aggressive.  In the evening, the weather favors those who do not tolerate heat, then the thermometer rises to a maximum of 17 degrees. <br>  Speaking of shops at the hotel, vacationers notice overpriced goods, so that many purchases there will fail.  In "Manavgat" will need to bargain to achieve the desired price for the purchase.  Waikiki is a great store with good, very low prices.  It is better to choose goods in Turkey so that all acquisitions cost 1.5 times cheaper or closer to Russian prices.  If the cost could not be lowered, there is no need to rush and buy a thing, you need to walk through the rows of trade and simply ask the price. </p><p>  Shops at the hotel accept payments in euros, as the public is mostly German.  Nevertheless, it is better to bring money in dollars.  The fact is that the dollar and the euro in Turkey are approximately the same rate, respectively, in stores they are calculated with the same amounts of cash. </p><p>  A lot of money for lira in Turkey does not need to be changed, since most stores accept combined payment (part in lira, and part in dollars).  Near the hotel, vacationers recommend changing a maximum of $ 10-20. </p><p>  The price for the rest is very reasonable, the quality pleases.  A very high level of service, room cleaning is always on time, towels are changing on schedule.  The rooms are spacious, there is everything you need.  The Internet is not interrupted, everything works perfectly.  Ideal facilities for people with disabilities.  Problems in communicating with other guests practically do not arise, since all vacationers know English.  The transfer works according to all the rules and traffic, which is very pleasing. </p><p>  Wonderful views from the rooms, especially the mountains, are simply an amazing sight.  It is not entirely pleasant to observe in the hammam the company of young Turks looking at women with an eager look.  It is better to visit a separate sauna with a hamam, which although it costs more, but the service there is several orders of magnitude higher. </p><p>  It can be a little annoying that evening events are held late in the evening, which can interfere with a comfortable night's rest. </p><h2>  Food and Services </h2>

    <p>  Side Royal Paradise's main asset is its restaurant.  The food here is just wonderful.  Everything is always fresh and tasty, prepared right before our eyes.  The fruits, though the same, are always very fresh.  The children's menu is also pleasing, all dishes are correctly selected.  The service is excellent, all the desires of customers are taken into account, and this not only relates to the kitchen, but also to cleaning the rooms.  The staff always waits for everyone to wake up, and only then cleans the rooms.  By the way, the apartments are not very spacious, but cozy and comfortable.  In the rooms the Internet is paid, and at the reception it is free, the password for access is indicated directly at the reception.  Although the public does not know Russian, since everyone speaks only German and English, there are no problems with overcoming the language barrier.  The hotel has karaoke, where anyone can have fun by singing their favorite songs and drinking some alcohol, which helps to relax.  Animators are very kind and funny people, so neither adults nor children will be bored. </p><p>  A hamam is not too expensive, just $ 50 per person.  This procedure helps to clear your head of unpleasant thoughts, as well as mentally and physically prepare for new experiences. </p><p>  The rooms are small but cozy, and the atmosphere is close to minimalism: there is only one bed, a bedside table and a table with a chair.  If you leave a tip, then they clean the rooms even better, although there are no special complaints. </p><h2>  Hotel Orientation </h2>
