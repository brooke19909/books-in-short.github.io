    <h2>  Otto von Bismarck: a brief biography.  Childhood </h2><p>  Otto was born on April 1, 1815 in Pomerania.  Representatives of his family were junkers.  These are the descendants of medieval knights who received land for serving the king.  The Bismarcks had a small estate and held various military and civilian posts in the nomenclature of Prussia.  By the standards of the German nobility of the 19th century, the family had rather modest resources. </p><p>  Young Otto was sent to Plaman School, where students were tempered by hard physical exercises.  Mother was an ardent Catholic and wanted her son to be brought up in strict standards of conservatism.  To adolescence, Otto transferred to a gymnasium.  There he did not establish himself as a diligent student.  I could not boast of academic success.  But he read a lot and was interested in politics and history.  He studied the features of the political structure of Russia and France.  Even studied French.  At the age of 15, Bismarck decides to associate himself with politics.  But the mother, who was the head of the family, insists on studying in G√∂ttingen.  As a direction, law and jurisprudence were chosen.  Young Otto was to become a diplomat of Prussia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are legends about the behavior of Bismarck in Hanover, where the training took place.  He did not want to engage in law, so he preferred a wild life to learning.  Like all elite youth, he often visited entertainment venues and made many friends among the nobles.  It was at this time that the fiery character of the future chancellor manifested.  He often engages in skirmishes and disputes, which he prefers to solve in a duel.  According to the recollections of university friends, only for a few years in Gottingen, Otto participated in 27 duels.  As a memory of stormy youth for life, he left a scar on his cheek after one of such competitions. </p><h2>  Leaving university </h2><p>  The luxurious life side by side with the children of aristocrats and politicians was not affordable for the relatively modest Bismarck family.  A constant participation in the trouble caused problems with the law and the leadership of the university.  So, without receiving a diploma, Otto went to Berlin, where he entered another university.  Which graduated in a year.  After that, I decided to follow my mother‚Äôs advice and become a diplomat.  Each figure at that time was personally approved by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  After studying the Bismarck case and learning about his problems with the law in Hanover, he refused the young graduate work. </p><p>  After the collapse of hopes of becoming a diplomat, Otto works in Anheng, where he deals with small organizational issues.  According to the memoirs of Bismarck himself, the work did not require significant efforts from him, and he could devote himself to self-development and rest.  But in the new place, the future chancellor has problems with the law, so that after a few years he enlisted in the army.  The military career did not last long.  A year later, Bismarck's mother dies, and he is forced to return to Pomerania, where their family estate is located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Otto Von Bismarck Biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1041562.jpg" width="365"></div>

This is a real test for him.  Managing a large estate requires a lot of effort.  So Bismarck has to give up his student habits.  Thanks to successful work, he significantly raises the status of estates and increases his income.  From a serene youth he turns into a respected cadet.  Nevertheless, the hot-tempered character continues to remind of itself.  The neighbors called Otto "rabid." </p><p>  A few years later, Bismarck Malvin's sister arrives from Berlin.  He is very close to her in view of their common interests and outlook on life.  Around the same time, he became an ardent Lutheran and reads the Bible every day.  There is an engagement of the future chancellor with Johanna Puttkamer. </p><h2>  The beginning of the political path </h2><p>  In the 40s of the 19th century, a tough power struggle between liberals and conservatives began in Prussia.  To relieve tension, Kaiser Friedrich Wilhelm convenes a Landtag.  Elections are being held in local administrations.  Otto decides to go into politics and without much effort becomes a deputy.  From the first days in the Landtag, Bismarck gains fame.  Newspapers write about him as a "rabid junker from Pomerania."  He speaks rather sharply about the liberals.  Composes entire articles of devastating criticism of Georg Finke. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="otto von bismarck quotes" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1041566.jpg" width="460"></div>  His speeches are quite expressive and inspiring, so Bismarck quickly becomes a significant figure in the camp of conservatives.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Opposition to the Liberals </h2><p>  At this time, a serious crisis is brewing in the country.  In neighboring states, a series of revolutions is taking place.  The liberals inspired by it are actively propagating among the working and poor German population.  Strikes and strikes repeatedly take place.  Against this background, food prices are constantly rising, unemployment is rising.  As a result, a social crisis leads to a revolution.  It was organized by patriots together with liberals, demanding that the king adopt the new Constitution and unite all German lands into one national state.  Bismarck was very scared of this revolution; he sends a letter to the king asking him to entrust him with the army‚Äôs campaign in Berlin.  But Frederick makes concessions and partially agrees with the demand of the rebels.  As a result, bloodshed was avoided, and the reforms were not as radical as in France or Austria. </p><p>  In response to the victory of the liberals, a camarilla is created - an organization of conservative reactionaries.  Bismarck immediately enters into it and conducts active propaganda through <span>the media.</span>  By agreement with the king, a military coup takes place in 1848, and the right-wingers regain their lost ground.  But Frederick is in no hurry to empower his new allies, and Bismarck is actually removed from power. </p><h2>  Conflict with Austria </h2><p>  At this time, the German lands were greatly fragmented into large and small principalities, which in one way or another depended on Austria and Prussia.  These two states fought constantly for the right to be considered the unifying center of the German nation.  By the end of the 40s there was a serious conflict over the principality of Erfurt.  Relations sharply worsened, rumors spread about a possible mobilization.  Bismarck is actively involved in resolving the conflict, and he manages to insist on signing agreements with Austria in Olmutsk, because, in his opinion, Prussia was not able to resolve the conflict by military means. </p><p>  Bismarck believes that it is necessary to begin lengthy preparations for the destruction of Austrian dominance in the so-called German space. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Otto Von Bismarck Short Biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1041569.jpg" width="348"></div>  For this, according to Otto, it is necessary to conclude an alliance with France and Russia.  Therefore, with the beginning of the Crimean War, he actively campaigned not to enter into conflict on the side of Austria.  His efforts are bearing fruit: mobilization is not carried out, and the German lands are neutral.  The king sees the future in the plans of the "mad junker" and sends him an ambassador to France.  After negotiations with Napoleon III, Bismarck is suddenly withdrawn from Paris and sent to Russia.

    <h2>  Otto in Russia </h2><p>  Contemporaries say that the presence in Russia was greatly influenced by the presence in the iron chancellor, a stay in Russia, Otto Bismarck himself wrote about this.  The biography of any diplomat includes a period of training <span>in negotiation</span> skills <span>.</span>  That is what Otto devoted himself to in St. Petersburg.  In the capital, he spends a lot of time with Gorchakov, who was considered one of the most prominent diplomats of his time.  Bismarck was impressed by the Russian state and traditions.  He liked the policy pursued by the emperor, so he carefully studied Russian history.  He even began to learn Russian.  After a few years, I was already able to speak it fluently.  ‚ÄúLanguage gives me the opportunity to understand the very way of thinking and logic of Russians,‚Äù wrote Otto von Bismarck.  The biography of the "mad" student and cadet brought notoriety to the diplomat and hindered successful activities in many countries, but not in Russia.  This is another reason Otto liked our country. </p><p>  In it, he saw an example for the development of the German state, since the Russians managed to combine the land with an ethnically identical population, which was a long-held dream of the Germans.  In addition to diplomatic contacts, Bismarck has many personal contacts. </p><p>  But Bismarck‚Äôs quotes about Russia cannot be called flattering: ‚ÄúNever believe the Russians, for Russians do not even believe in themselves‚Äù;  "Russia is dangerous by the meagerness of its needs." </p><h2>  Prime Minister </h2><p>  Gorchakov taught Otto the basics of aggressive foreign policy, which was very necessary for Prussia.  After the death of the king, the "mad junker" is sent to Paris as a diplomat.  He faces a serious task to prevent the restoration of the long-standing alliance of France and England.  The new government in Paris, created after the next revolution, reacted negatively to the ardent conservative from Prussia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="otto von bismarck interesting facts" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1041570.jpg" width="334"></div>  But Bismarck was able to convince the French of the need for mutual cooperation with the Russian Empire and German lands.  The ambassador selected only trusted people to his team.  Assistants selected candidates, then they were examined by Otto Bismarck himself.  A brief biography of the applicants was compiled by the King‚Äôs secret police.

    <p>  Successful work in establishing international relations allowed Bismarck to become Prussian Prime Minister.  In this position, he won the true love of the people.  Otto von Bismarck decorated the front pages of German newspapers weekly.  Politician quotes became popular far abroad.  Such fame in the press is due to the Prime Minister‚Äôs love for populist statements.  For example, the words: "The great issues of the time are decided not by speeches and resolutions of the majority, but by iron and blood!"  still used along with similar statements by the rulers of ancient Rome.  One of Otto von Bismarck's most famous sayings: "Stupidity is a gift from God, but you should not abuse it." </p><h2>  Territorial expansion of Prussia </h2><p>  Prussia has long set itself the goal of uniting all German lands into one state.  For this, training was carried out not only in the foreign policy aspect, but also in the field of propaganda.  The main rival in leadership and patronage over the German world was Austria.  In 1866, relations with Denmark sharply worsened.  Part of the kingdom was occupied by ethnic Germans.  Under pressure from the nationalist section of the public, they began to demand the right to self-determination.  At this time, Chancellor Otto Bismarck secured the full support of the king and received expanded rights.  The war with Denmark began.  The troops of Prussia without any problems occupied the territory of Holstein and shared it with Austria. </p><p>  Because of these lands, a new conflict arose with a neighbor.  The Habsburgs, who were seated in Austria, lost their positions in Europe after a series of revolutions and coups that overthrew the representatives of the dynasty in other countries.  In the 2 years after the Danish war, the feud between Austria and Prussia grew <span>exponentially.</span>  First, trade blockades and political pressure began.  But very soon it became clear that a direct military clash could not be avoided.  Both countries began to mobilize the population.  A key role in the conflict was played by Otto von Bismarck.  Briefly setting out his goals for the king, he immediately went to Italy to enlist her support.  The Italians themselves also had claims to Austria, seeking to seize Venice.  In 1866, the war began.  The Prussian forces managed to quickly seize part of the territories and force the Habsburgs to sign a peace treaty on favorable terms. </p><h2>  Land consolidation </h2><p>  Now all the ways to unite the German lands were open.  Prussia headed for the creation of the <span>North German Union, the</span> constitution for which Otto von Bismarck himself wrote.  Chancellor's quotes on the unity of the German people gained popularity in the north of France.  The increasing influence of Prussia greatly worried the French.  The Russian Empire also began to cautiously wait for what Otto von Bismarck would do, a brief biography of which is described in the article.  The history of Russian-Prussian relations during the reign of the Iron Chancellor is very revealing.  The politician was able to assure Alexander II of his intentions to cooperate with the Empire further. </p><p>  But the French could not be convinced of this.  As a result, another war began.  A few years earlier, army reform was carried out in Prussia, as a result of which a regular army was created. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="otto von bismarck briefly" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1041572.jpg" width="424"></div>  Also increased military spending.  Thanks to this and the successful actions of German generals, France suffered a number of major defeats.  Napoleon III was captured.  Paris was forced to agree, having lost a number of territories.

    <p>  In the wake of triumph, the Second Reich is proclaimed, Wilhelm becomes emperor, and Otto Bismarck becomes his confidant.  Quotations of Roman commanders at the coronation gave the Chancellor another nickname - "triumphant", since then he was often depicted on a Roman chariot and with a wreath on his head. </p><h2>  Heritage </h2><p>  The constant wars and internal political clashes seriously undermined the health of the politician.  He went on vacation several times, but was forced to return due to a new crisis.  Even after 65 years, he continued to take an active part in all the political processes of the country.  Not a single meeting of the Landtag took place if Otto von Bismarck was not present at it.  Interesting facts about the life of the chancellor are described below. </p><p>  For 40 years in politics, he has achieved tremendous success.  Prussia expanded its territories and was able to seize supremacy in German space.  Contacts were established with the Russian Empire and France.  All these achievements would not have been possible without such a figure as Otto Bismarck.  The photo of the Chancellor in profile and in a military helmet has become a kind of symbol of his unshakable tough foreign and domestic policy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Otto bismarck photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1041571.jpg" width="366"></div>  Disputes around this person are still ongoing.  But in Germany, everyone knows who Otto von Bismarck was, the iron chancellor.  Why he was so nicknamed, there is no consensus.  Either because of a hot temper, or because of ruthlessness to enemies.  One way or another, he had a huge impact on world politics.
