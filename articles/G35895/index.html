And many use it on all of their gadgets, and not just on computers.  For example, mobile Internet is in huge demand among subscribers.  But in this matter, you should choose the right tariff so as not to overpay in the future.  For example, some subscribers recommend "Internet Portfolio" ("Tele2").  Is this service really good?  How to connect to it if necessary and disconnect?  All this will be discussed in the article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tele2 internet portfolio" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1124783.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Rate description </h2><p>  “Internet Portfolio” (“Tele2”) is, as you might guess, a special service package that provides access to the mobile World Wide Web.  But is he just that good?  And under what conditions does it work? </p><p>  At "Tele2" this package is the second largest offer for profitable mobile Internet.  It offers its subscribers 15 GB of high-speed traffic.  As the operator himself writes, without any restrictions.  Only after reaching this threshold will the connection drop to 64 Kbps. </p><p>  In general, many note that this proposal can be attributed to unlimited Internet.  And this fact pleases many.  Yes, 15 GB of traffic is not so much, but if you use a mobile phone for work and social networks, as well as Internet surfing, then this is quite enough.  When downloading movies, the Internet Portfolio service (Tele2) is not entirely suitable.  All this, according to subscribers, due to low traffic without speed limits. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  The price tag for connecting a particular service, as well as the monthly fee, play a role for modern customers.  No one wants to overpay for low-quality features.  In this sense, the reviews from Internet Portfolio (Tele2) are pretty good. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable tele2 internet portfolio" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1124786.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Firstly, connecting the option for free, by any of the possible methods.  But about them a little later.  Secondly, the <span>subscription fee</span> for unlimited Internet will be only 350 rubles per month.  Not too expensive, but not quite cheap either.  Many subscribers assure that this is the normal price for the opportunities that you receive with the service.  It's hard to argue with that.  Indeed, for 350 rubles a month you can use the Internet on your mobile device as much as you like.  And 15 GB of traffic will be, as already mentioned, without speed limits. </p><p>  The only condition that will have to be met is the availability of a sufficient amount on the balance of the number when connecting.  Otherwise, you will be able to include the “Internet Portfolio” (“Tele2”) tariff, but you will not be able to use it.  The same goes for negative balance.  In the case when it is, even with paid access to mobile Internet, you will not be able to use the services. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Connection via operator </h2><p>  How to connect the "Internet Portfolio"?  "Tele2" offers several options that are likely to interest everyone.  The first thing you can do is call your mobile operator.  It should be noted right away that some subscribers do not particularly respect this decision.  After all, it’s very difficult to get through to the operator now. </p><p>  Nevertheless, such a situation takes place.  From your mobile phone, dial 611 and wait for a response.  Next, you will have to inform about your intentions to use the Internet Portfolio service.  Confirm your actions, if necessary, provide your passport details.  They are needed for identification.  And that’s it, you can wait for the result of the request. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect an internet portfolio on tel2" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1124784.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  My "Tele2" </h2><p>  It is worth paying attention to such a solution as the use of the official website of a mobile operator to start using certain services.  Perhaps this offer is relevant for subscribers who are going to connect via computer.  How to do this? </p><p>  To get started, go to the official website of "Tele2".  There you will have to go through authorization through “My“ Tele2. ”This is a kind of account on the site that allows subscribers to manage all services. Now find the“ Internet Portfolio ”tariff in the“ Internet ”section. Click on it, and then a page with details and features of the service: To enable this option, click the “Connect” button at the end of the description once. </p><p>  You will receive an SMS notification on your phone.  A code will be sent in it to confirm the actions.  In your account, enter it in the appropriate field, after which the connection will be considered completed. </p><h2>  We send requests </h2><p>  How to connect "Internet Portfolio" to "Tele2" in another way?  The last thing that can be offered is the use of the so-called USSD request.  And, to be honest, this is the approach that pleases subscribers the most. </p><p>  All that is required from a person is to dial a special team responsible for connecting the option.  In our case, this is * 155 * 201 #.  Now, as soon as everything is ready, you can click on the "Call" button on your mobile device.  Command processing will begin.  After some time, you will receive a message with the result.  Subject to all conditions, “Internet Portfolio” (“Tele2”) will be connected to your mobile. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="service portfolio internet tele2" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1124785.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Cancellation of Services </h2><p>  True, it’s not enough to know about connecting this or that package.  Sometimes you have to figure out how to disable Internet Portfolio.  "Tele2" offers, in principle, the same options as with the connection.  It: </p><ul><li>  call to the operator; </li><li>  use of "My" Tele2 "; </li><li>  USSD request. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, it is enough to get through to a living employee, and not talk with a robot voice.  Dial 611 and wait for an answer.  You inform that you would like to stop using the “Internet Portfolio” tariff - and all problems have been resolved. </p><p>  The "personal account" on the Tele2 website also helps to implement the idea.  Log in, find the appropriate package and click on the "Disconnect" button.  Confirm actions with a secret code.  It is done. </p><p>  The USSD request in this case is in great demand.  You just need to dial * 155 * 200 # and wait a bit. </p><h2>  Opinion of subscribers </h2><p>  What do subscribers think about the Tele2 Internet Portfolio service?  Is it worth it to connect?  In truth, it’s hard to decide.  Those who actively use mobile Internet, note that this package is not entirely suitable.  It offers too little traffic without speed limits.  The average buyer, on the contrary, insists that the "Internet Portfolio" is the best and best offer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff portfolio internet tele2" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1124787.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Please note: the coverage area at "Tele2" does not work everywhere.  And it is likely that your region may not yet have 3G Internet.  In this case, the “Internet Portfolio” is not available to you.  This moment disappoints some subscribers. </p><p>  In general, it is noted that the package of services is not bad.  It is profitable, and it also works stably, not always, but in most cases.  If you do not plan to watch movies on your phone, you can use the “Internet Portfolio” service from “Tele2”. </p>
