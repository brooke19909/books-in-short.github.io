This is clean air, forests and, of course, water pools.  Not all people prefer to relax on the seashore.  There are those who prefer wildlife.  Exactly this is in the Republic of Mari El.  Lake Tahir has everything that a tired person needs.  Here you can relax both body and soul.  If there is no desire to abandon comfortable conditions, then a vacation is spent on equipped recreation centers.  But these edges are good for the "savages." </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing on tahir mariy el lake" class="if uuid-2626202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2626202.jpg"></div><p>  Near the camp there is an excellent clearing, where in the summer season many people with tents relax.  An asphalt road leads to the beach.  And what else is needed in order to gain strength and restore the supply of vital energy? </p><h2>  Briefly about the lake </h2><p>  <span>Lake Tahir</span> (Mari El) is located near the village of Kokshays.  The distance is 14 km.  And if you go from the capital, you will have to overcome the path of 42 km.  By origin refers to karst reservoirs.  The lake is recognized as a natural monument of republican significance.  A considerable territory is hidden under its waters; its area is 50 hectares.  The greatest depth reaches ten meters.  Offshore there is an island.  It is easy to notice it, since tall pines grow on it, as well as birch and other deciduous trees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Despite the fact that recreation centers and a camp were built on the shore of Lake Tahir (Mari El), nature still remains picturesque.  Many vacationers like the autumn landscape.  In September, the days are still warm, so you can safely go to these parts.  There is a large uninhabited area right behind the camp.  It is surrounded by a pine forest, in which deciduous trees are sometimes found.  It is very beautiful in here.  You can endlessly enjoy the birdsong and the fresh lake breeze.  Approximately two kilometers to the west, deciduous forests and pine forests stretch, there are flood meadows and elders. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Tahir Mariy El Holiday Village" class="if uuid-2626199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2626199.jpg"></div><h2>  What does your name say ... </h2><p>  It is unlikely that the name of Lake Tahir in Mari El will seem ordinary to anyone, not noticeable.  There are several versions of its origin.  The first indicates that the hydronym came from the name of Tahir, whose roots extend from the Turkic language.  If we consider the second version, then, according to it, two words are used in the name: Mari "er" meaning lake, and Perm "ta" with the same meaning.  And the last: ‚Äúfrom‚Äù - a grove (we are talking about an island on which trees grow) and the Mari word ‚Äúer‚Äù - a lake. </p><h2>  Legend </h2><p>  A lot of different stories and legends can tell locals.  One of these was recorded by N. A. Smelov. It describes why Lake Tahir in Mari El is so called.  In short, the old man traveled with a boy.  After a long journey, they stopped to rest on the sandy beach of the reservoir.  Having washed and got drunk, we decided to thank the lake, shouting: ‚ÄúTau, er!‚Äù, Which is translated from the Mari language as ‚ÄúThank you, lake!‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tahir lake" class="if uuid-2626194" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2626194.jpg"></div><h2>  Fishing on Lake Tahir in Mari El </h2><p>  Those who love fishing can come to these picturesque places.  There are both small fish and large predators in the pond.  However, in order not to be disappointed, you need to find the right approach.  Experienced fishermen calculate their catch with dozens of individuals.  The most popular places for fishing are sections of the coastline, where the outlet to the water is overgrown with reeds.  Here the perch is perfectly caught, you can even extend the pike.  But at a depth, the bream and scammers will fall for the bait. </p>
