  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Associative series as a tool of a psychologist</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the most generalized sense, an associative series is a set of elements connected with each other on some common basis.  Moreover, if element A is connected with element B by any associated attribute, and element B is connected with element C, it is not necessary that C be connected in associative row A. For example, when the word ‚Äúsummer‚Äù is mentioned, the following associative row may appear: sea , beach, sand, etc.  Each subsequent word is associated with the previous one, but not necessarily with the one before the previous one.  This is a consistent associative series.  There are also rows in which all elements are united by one common attribute.  This issue is discussed in more detail in <span>set theory.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="associative experiment" class="if" height="251" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10630/13703.jpg" width="540"></div><br>  Associative ranks are now widely used in various fields of humanitarian knowledge.  With the help of testing for associations, one can understand the psychological state of the respondent, his life views, and even his thinking.  To do this, a so-called associative experiment is conducted, during which it is proposed to choose objects or name words associated with some reference ones.  Associative experiments include the well-known Luscher color test, since the craving for a particular color palette is associated with the projection of the person‚Äôs internal states onto it. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="associative series" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10630/13705.jpg" width="364"></div><br>  Nevertheless, it is worth emphasizing that the assessment of personality by associative schemes is not always adequate.  Each person can name their own associative series to any word, because <span>associative relations</span> are formed in the process of gaining experience.  Each one has his own.  But normal from a psychological point of view, people will have similar associative ranks.  But one of the main <span>signs of schizophrenia</span> is the presence of dissociative thinking. <br>  It is more justified to use an associative experiment in assessing the development of preschool children and <span>primary school children.</span>  To educate children, so-called associative games are often used now, when it is necessary to sort several objects by a certain attribute or find pairs by a common attribute. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="associative series is" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10630/13704.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  The associative series is also used in assessing the level of erudition of an individual and in tests for IQ.  Despite the wide distribution of this particular type of assessment of intellectual abilities, it still has some disadvantages.  The fact is that in one case the individual can build the correct associative series or combine objects on a common basis in the process of reflection, and in the other - as a consequence of previous experience.  Accordingly, in the first case we will deal with a more capable person in terms of thought and logic, and in the second case with a more erudite and trained person.

    <p>  However, some researchers believe that the ability to quickly structure information and find logical connections in it is always the result of a trained mental-logical apparatus.  Training should begin as early as possible in childhood, and be conducted on a wide range of tasks. </p>
