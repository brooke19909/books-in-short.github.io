    <p>  The only minus of this five-star hotel, many vacationers call the entrance to the sea, which without rubber shoes is very uncomfortable.  But many people solve this problem by bathing from a wooden pier, from which one can calmly go down the stairs into the water.  In addition, the sea can always be replaced by a transparent pool with slides. </p><p>  Vacationers are satisfied with the convenient location of Imperial Sanland.  In a few minutes you can walk to the beach with a calm step.  You can get to the city from a nearby stop, where convenient shuttles depart every half hour.  The cost of the trip is one dollar. </p><p>  The hotel is positioned both as a family and as a youth.  In addition, in Kemer, unlike other areas of Turkey, a relatively mild climate.  In general, over the past years, everything has been done in the region so that Beldibi, the former fishing village, will turn into a prestigious resort for tourists, including Russians. </p><p>  Our compatriots here are satisfied with the contingent of residents.  Many of them express a desire to spend at least one of their next vacations here. </p><h2>  Holidays in Turkey </h2><p>  Kemer with its pebbly and sandy beaches and developed infrastructure (restaurants, cafes, cinemas) has become very popular.  The main advantages of relaxing in hotels of this town with children are the short duration of the flight, the absence of visa delays, the mild Mediterranean climate and the necessary conditions for living even with babies.  In addition, in Kemer, as elsewhere in Turkey, there are no language problems.  In each hotel, including the Imperial Sunland 5 *, Russian-speaking staff members work at the registration desk. </p><p>  Most hotels for a small fee - from fifteen dollars - provide <span>babysitting services.</span>  In addition, there are price privileges for families with children, perhaps even free placement of one baby.  For example, in Imperial Sunland 5 * when placing one child under twelve years of age in the beds installed in the rooms, the latter is free. </p><p>  You can book hotels not only with the help of travel agencies, but also through the Internet, asking experts all your questions online.  Typically, such a reservation is much cheaper, in addition, does not take much time. </p>
