It arose on the lands of the Golden Horde, which Aksak-Timur destroyed in the first half of the 15th century.  The Nogai Horde, whose history is closely connected with the development of such states as the Great Horde, the Kalmyk Horde, the states of Siberia, Astrakhan, Kazan, the Principality of Moscow, is a vivid example of a medieval power that survived the rise and fall. </p><p>  The prerequisites for the formation of the Nogai Horde was the transfer of the nomad Tatars of the Nogai ulus tohtamysh khan to the territory between the Urals and the Volga.  Kara-Bek led the Horde, which emerged from the Turks, crossed to <span>the Sakmar River,</span> then to Belaya and Kama.  After that, the Nogai Horde conquered the Bulgar, and then migrated to Kazanka, where the city of Kazan was founded.  After the Horde occupied the land along <span>the Vyatka River.</span> </p><p>  <strong>Leaders.</strong>  The leadership of the peoples who formed the Nogai Horde was taken by the Mangyt tribes located in Khorezm.  During the campaign to the Golden Horde, Aksak-Timur collaborated with them.  Mangyts were a large and strong Tatar tribe.  Basically, they were under the rule of Idegeus.  When Aksak-Timur retreated from Eastern Europe, Idegei brought his subjects to Khorezm.  In 1420, Idegei died, and his peoples fell under the power of nomadic Uzbek khans.  The Mangyt tribes were headed by Vakkas-Bey, who had earned the post of Becklerback from the <span>Uzbek khans</span> and participated in the military operations of Khan Abuhair. </p><p>  After the death of Vakkas-Bey, his successor unleashed a struggle against the power of the Kazakh and Uzbek khans.  Musa Bey, who led the Mangyt tribe, fought for independence and was able to achieve relief.  Under him, the Nogai Horde had a capital in the city of Saraichik. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>The advent of the Nogai Horde.</strong>  The first mention of the state of the Nogai was found in Russian sources dating back to the end of the 15th century.  Musa Bey was able to strengthen his position so much that he began to attempt to influence the Great Horde, Kazan, Astrakhan, <span>Siberian Khanates.</span>  In alliance with Ibak Khan, he undertook a campaign against the Astrakhan Khanate, and at the end of the 15th century, united with the Siberian Khan, went to the <span>Kazan Khanate.</span>  At that time, the power of the Nogai state was so palpable that Alexander Kazimirovich - the Lithuanian prince - persuaded them to the anti-Moscow coalition. </p><p>  Later, the Nogai Horde acted as a united front against Moscow and the Crimea against the Great Horde.  In 1502, in the lower Volga, the Big Horde was defeated by the joint forces of Moscow, Kazan and the Crimea.  As a result of this, the Astrakhan Khanate fell into complete dependence on the Nogai Horde. </p><p>  <strong>Nogai Horde: the development of statehood.</strong>  The defeat of the Great Horde was the impetus for the development of the Nogai Horde.  The population of the young state has increased, its borders have expanded, a state system has developed.  The head of the Horde was admitted to bei.  After him, nuradin stood in importance.  His duties included guarding uluses from attacks.  Kekovat was also appointed.  His interests included the eastern borders of the state.  The sons of Bey wore the title of Murza.  When the bee died, his eldest son took his place.  In wartime, batyrs were appointed - leaders of detachments.  They became recognized brave men, craftsmen and daredevils.  There were in the Nogai Horde and ministers - Karachs - responsible for their area. </p><p>  The state religion in the Nogai Horde was Islam.  Ministers - Abyz, Sufis, Shaekhs, Seites - performed Islamic rituals.  They spoke the Tatar language in the Nogai Horde, and Arabic script was used for correspondence. </p><p>  <strong>Relations with the Moscow Principality.</strong>  Under Ivan the Terrible, with the help of bribery and cunning, the Nogai Horde was closed to other Tatar states.  As a result, hostility and mistrust flared up between the Nogai Horde and the Crimea, Kazan and Siberia.  In 1556, the Nogai Horde was overtaken by famine, and the <span>Moscow principality</span> refused to help her.  This greatly undermined the forces of the Nogai Horde, but the Tatars still remained on their lands.  As the Nogai Horde weakened, Moscow developed the Tatar lands, building fortresses.  The destruction of the Nogai Horde continued by the Cossacks in the 16th century and the Kalmyk Horde in the 17th century.  By the beginning of the XVIII century, the last of its inhabitants were exterminated. </p><p>  The history of the Nogai Horde is closely intertwined with the history of modern Kazakhstan.  Nogays and Kazakhs are people of one nation. <strong></strong></p>
