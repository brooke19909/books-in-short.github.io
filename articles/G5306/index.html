The first trip around the world under the leadership of Fernand Magellan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Before leaving the planet for the first time and reaching the moon, people needed to find out as precisely as possible what would be needed for such a distant expedition.  Thanks to the latest technology, they could also keep in touch with the stations that controlled the flight.  However, the journey of Fernand Magellan, who took over the command of five ships, looked completely different.  Unlike the first situation, the sailors did not go according to a pre-designed route, but into the unknown, into the abyss of water, to where they had never been before.  If a book had been written about this expedition and this man, it would undoubtedly have a title like: "Fernand Magellan - the story of a trip around the world."  On the other hand, the name could be invented and more interesting.  Such a novel could be called: "Fernand Magellan - a conquistador in the Indian Ocean."  Whatever the name of this book, it would be a story of faith and valor.  So let's find out what <span>this journey</span> has given us, modern people.  We can also see what Fernand Magellan discovered. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What Fernand Magellan discovered" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23824/539494.jpg" width="246"></div></h2><h2>  What gave swimming Magellan </h2><p>  This bold journey is attributed to the unusually courageous feats of all time.  It influenced people's ideas about our planet and went down in history as the first <span>trip around the world</span> under the leadership of Fernand Magellan.  Thanks to this person, it became known that America and Asia are separated by a huge amount of water, that there is a common oceans on our planet.  At the end of this journey, no one doubted or argued about the <span>shape of the Earth.</span>  This expanded the capabilities of scientists of that time, allowing them to accurately calculate the size of our planet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fernand Magellan's acquaintance with sea voyages </h2><p>  This man was born not among the poor, but among the noble.  Therefore, of course, he did what all the young noble youth did in those days ‚Äî he needed to become a page at the royal court.  From this moment in his life, this man began to learn more about <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãvoyages</span> and outstanding wanderings.  Here he learned about the recent voyage of <span>Christopher Columbus,</span> who returned from the shores of America.  There, he participated in an active search for the western route by sea to the "spice islands" (Indonesia implied).  Communicating more with these people, the young Fernand, most likely, already imagines a life full of adventure. </p>

    <h2>  Abrupt change of events </h2><p>  However, in 1495 a great tragedy occurred - Juan II passed away, and yet he treated his youth so well.  As a result of this misfortune, power falls into the hands of Manuel I, who is not thinking about scientific discoveries, but about his wealth and respect.  For a young dreamer, everything changes.  Despite the numerous requests of Magellan to organize a naval expedition, the ruler remains adamant.  More than 10 years after the death of the previous king, Fernando is allowed to sail.  This young but initiative young man is sent to a military race to intercept spice vessels from Arab merchants.  After some time, he again goes to sea and reaches Malacca.  True, despite all the efforts of the young man, on his courage and courage, the king sends him to "retire", having allocated a small allowance, and dismisses him from service. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The first trip around the world under the leadership of Fernand Magellan" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23824/539530.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><h2>  Magellan does not give up </h2><p>  Despite all the difficulties, our hero did not despair.  The former sailor Juan from Lisbon helps him to lift his spirit.  Together they discuss how to get to the coveted ‚Äúspice islands."  Both conclude that this can be accomplished by heading southwest and sailing across the ocean to the recently discovered Balboa.  Both one and the other, it seems that on the other side of this ocean are "islands of spices."  So, our traveler is inspired by a seemingly absolutely incredible idea - to explore the western route to the East.  However, without money, in those days, ships were not built, and expeditions were not organized.  Therefore, Magellan began to seek financial support.  Realizing that he can‚Äôt get the necessary help from Manuel, Fernand decides to turn to the Spanish king. </p><h2>  Fernand Magellan and the Spanish King </h2><p>  The king of Spain is much smarter than Manuel, with whom Magellan was at odds.  This young monarch not only does not impede the mariner, but is also personally interested in discovering and using the western path to the ‚Äúspice islands‚Äù.  For him, this seems quite reasonable, since the discovery of this route would once and for all put an end to his enmity with the Portuguese navigators on the sea routes.  The monarch likes the opportunity over time to appropriate the "island of spices."  They decided on that.  The king decides that the journey of Magellan can be carried out using five old wooden ships (apparently, the monarch decided to save money here too).  So, Fernand is appointed commander in chief of this small Spanish flotilla. </p>

    <h2>  Expedition is ready </h2><p>  Finally, after long preparations for a whole year, travelers set sail on September 20, 1519.  So they continue their voyage until March 31 of next year.  During this time, they were able to reach the territory that is known today as Argentina.  However, the whole team is in despair due to the fact that they can‚Äôt find the necessary isthmus to sail to another ocean.  Because of what, a rebellion breaks out in the flotilla.  At this moment, it is worth paying tribute to Magellan, it was possible to quickly crush this rebellion.  Two of the rebels lost their lives. </p><h2>  What Fernand Magellan discovered on his journey </h2>

    <p>  Throughout the journey, the team underwent many difficulties, but also reached its ultimate goal.  What did Fernand Magellan discover?  During the journey, they gave names to some territories.  For example, modern Patagonia owes its name to this expedition.  Seeing people with a strong physique, the team felt like dwarves against the background of these "strong men" ("Patagonia" - Spanish. "Big-legged").  One year after the start of the journey, the three remaining ships cross <span>the Strait of Magellan,</span> as it is called today (one ship wrecked a few months earlier, and the other left the travelers and sailed back to Spain).  The Pacific Ocean also owes its name to Magellan.  The seafarer named it because of the fact that, in comparison with the previous ones, the storm never caught them there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Fernan Magellan Conquistador in the Indian Ocean" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23824/539502.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Was it worth the journey that Fernand Magellan discovered?  Judge for yourself.  However, for the seafarer himself this trip was very expensive. </p><h2>  The death of a famous traveler </h2><p>  Due to the fact that he intervened in the conflict between the tribes, the navigator paid with his life.  Only the ship "Victoria" - one in five - returned to its home harbor.  Thus ended the story of how Fernand Magellan made the first circumnavigation of the world famous.  Mentally traveling with him, we were better able to realize what feelings people experienced, who decided on this desperate feat.  Now we are well aware of Fernand Magellan.  What discovered and where - we also now know. </p>
