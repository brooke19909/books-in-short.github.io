This story caused delight and admiration for many.  Now, in order to see these ancient giants live, you don‚Äôt need to watch a movie or a TV show, but you just need to go to Yurkin Park (Kirov).  Reviews of it have already spread all over Russia as a magnificent and interesting place for a family vacation. </p><h2>  History of the name of this institution </h2><p>  The creative team that created this amazing world thought for a long time about how to better name it.  As a result, they decided that the cute little boy Yurka would become the symbol of the park.  He is dressed in a sweatshirt and jeans, and holds a dinosaur under his arm.  His image turned out to be mischievous, crafty and inquisitive, personifying most of the current schoolchildren and teenagers. </p>

    <h2>  The inhabitants </h2><p>  Visitors to this complex, immediately entering its territory, find themselves in a stunning world called "Yurkin Park" (Kirov), where there are many fascinating and interesting things.  For example, there are forty-three giants who lived in the distant times of the Jurassic period.  All dinosaurs are huge, some of them can reach twenty meters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  They have a realistic look, as they can turn their heads in different directions, move their tails and flap their wings.  After all, it is simply unbelievable that you can see a giant mamenchisaurus with a long neck, which can also move.  A quetzalcoatl, with a wingspan of 7 m, awaits guests of this place on a tree, and in the middle of a pond on a small island there is a pterodactyl.  Not far from it on the lake is a real thunderstorm of inhabitants of prehistoric reservoirs - plesiosaurus. </p><p>  From all that is seen, visitors are breathtaking, and only excursions to Yurkin Park (Kirov) can give such a feeling.  The ticket price is quite reasonable. </p><p>  In addition, for such a relatively low cost you can still see the "real" eggs of the ancient dinosaurs.  A cub appears from one, and in another, visitors take interesting pictures in memory of such an exciting walk. </p>

    <p>  It will not be difficult for locals and guests of the city to get to this place, as route bus No. 21 passes by it. This type of transport will be convenient for any Kirov citizen, since its movement covers the whole city.  Visitors can also drive their cars to Yurkin Park (Kirov), where a convenient and spacious parking lot is located.  For excursion groups who come from far away, a special place for a bus is allocated in the parking lot. </p><p>  For all questions of interest, you can also pre-call "Yurkin Park".  The telephone for information has the following form: + 7 (8332) 468-292.  A pleasant administrator will answer this number, who will be able to conduct a competent consultation by telephone. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, the "Yurkin Park" (Kirov) became the most popular place for recreation.  Perhaps his address is known to any child in the city.  Since, probably, there is not a single Kirov resident who has not visited this amazing and exciting world of giant ancient dinosaurs at least once since the opening of the park. </p><p>  It has become exactly the place where local residents and guests of the region will be able to spend their leisure time all year round.  But to appreciate all the charms of this entertainment complex, one visit will certainly not be enough.  After all, there are so many interesting and unknown. </p>
