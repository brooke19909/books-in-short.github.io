  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to block a MTS SIM card?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The need to lock a SIM card of a mobile <span>phone usually</span> arises from its theft or loss.  It‚Äôs easy to find out <span>how to block the MTS SIM card</span> , since quite a lot of people performed this operation.  However, this desire may arise in the subscriber of the mobile operator for other reasons.  For example, you have not used the services of a cellular company for a long time and do not consider it necessary to restore use.  It is for this that you need to know how to block the MTS SIM card so that no inactive number hangs behind you.  A similar situation arises when you want to change the number or go to the number of subscribers of another mobile operator. </p><p>  So, you can block the MTS number in several ways.  The first option is to use the services of an online assistant.  To implement this procedure, you must visit the official website of MTS.  In your personal account you can easily find the corresponding section.  Mobile operators have stepped forward by creating user interfaces on their sites.  All this is done for convenience when searching for this or that information.  Next, you have to fill out all the necessary fields and enter the relevant information.  There shouldn‚Äôt be any difficulties with this, although if you don‚Äôt know how to block the MTS SIM card, some questions may still arise. </p><p>  The assistant will tell you the number of the team that you will need to complete using your mobile phone.  Be careful, because an incorrect command can lead to bad consequences and you can‚Äôt prove to anyone that you simply don‚Äôt know how to block the MTS SIM card.  In this case, this command is * 111 * 25 #.  After completing these actions, you just have to follow the special instructions of the system.  In principle, everything is clear and described there, but if you have questions, you can safely ask them to the assistant consultant. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This method, of course, is impossible with the loss of a cell phone or when it is stolen.  This is due to the obligatory execution of commands only from the SIM card that you want to block, but which you do not have at hand.  The second option for those who want to block the MTS SIM card is to contact the specialists of the corresponding contact center of the company for help.  This operation can be performed from any number.  The center number is well known to everyone - 0890. The operator will only need your passport data and an explanation of the reason for blocking the SIM card.  After you provide all the necessary information, your SIM card will be blocked as soon as possible. </p><p>  The third method is a direct visit to the office of MTS.  In this case, it does not matter if you go to the central branch or to an additional office.  You must have your passport with you.  The company's specialists will also help you instantly block the MTS SIM card.  It is also worth noting several very important points that should not be forgotten.  If your phone is stolen, hurry to block the SIM card as soon as possible.  Attackers can use your number for personal gain.  The same applies to the situation with the loss of a mobile phone. </p><p>  Another useful point: if you block a SIM card of your own free will, do not forget to first save the contacts listed in the notebook.  MTS SIM card recovery is completely free, however, the numbers recorded on this media will be permanently lost.  Agree, this is not very pleasant, especially if hundreds of numbers of friends, acquaintances, relatives, colleagues, etc. were recorded on the card.  So, now you know how to block the MTS number, which means you can quickly respond to the theft of your phone or switch to another mobile operator. </p>
