    <p>  Many of those who have visited the Antinoos Hotel 2 * leave very positive reviews.  Tourists often note that the hotel is undeservedly rated only two stars.  In many ways, he deserves a full three. </p><p>  Stand out service.  All rooms are cleaned daily, floors are required to be washed, and all towels are changed approximately every three days.  In the standard room for a couple of tourists there are two beds, near each bedside table.  A table with a small mirror, a cabinet in which there is a beam under the hangers, as well as two drawers. </p><p>  There is a separate refrigerator, and on the balcony there is another table and two chairs.  For each guest there are two towels and two pieces of soap.  The shower is very comfortable - with a tray and a curtain, which is not found in all hotels. </p><p>  By the way, be prepared that air conditioning is paid.  One day will have to pay about six euros. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel itself has a BB food system, that is, breakfast is included in the price.  Here they are called continental. </p><p>  According to the principle of the buffet, a loaf is served, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãinto a cupcake, cheese and sausage, various vegetables - tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers. </p><p>  For tea relies butter and portioned jam.  Often there are fruits for breakfast, such as watermelon.  Non-alcoholic drinks only - coffee, tea and lemonade.
