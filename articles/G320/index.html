For those who have sewing skills, such situations are not a problem.  Moreover, such craftsmen do not need to spend additional money and time on a trip in the studio.  It can be noted that it is useful to know how to hem pants correctly, because this item of clothing is the most common type of clothing. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  Having learned how to properly <span>hem pants,</span> it will be useful to learn how to perform preliminary work.  These include the following points: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to hem pants" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14124/329726.jpg" width="271"></div>

    <ol><li>  Make a fitting.  Pants should be worn so that the belt fits exactly at the waist level (exception: model on the hips).  Tuck the product in contact with the floor and stab it with pins.  At the same time, the back of the pants should not have creases, folds, and the front, when lifting the foot, the pants should be slightly bent. </li><li>  Mark the fold line (the place that was stabbed with pins).  Fold the product on the table, fold the legs exactly so that the side seams coincide (if necessary, fix the position with needles).  Check if the two halves are equal in length and mark the fold line using a ruler and crayon (or soap).  From this level down, you need to postpone the allowance.  In order to know how to properly hem the trousers, the following information will be useful: the size of the allowance depends on the model and is accepted for flared trousers no more than 2.5 cm, and for classic products 4 cm will be the best option. </li><li>  Cut off excess length.  Make fastenings in the side seams and process the bottom on the overlock or machine with a special line. </li></ol><h2>  How to hem classic men's trousers? </h2><p>  Consider how the hem of the product is performed using a special braid.  The following actions are carried out after preparatory work.  The main points of filing the bottom of the classic trousers can be represented in the following list: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to hem pants manually" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14124/329724.jpg" width="367"></div>  Stitch the tape to the bottom of the product.  To do this, the tape must be positioned along the edge of the fold line from the allowance side so that it extends only 1 mm above the fold level.  Lay a line without going beyond the fold of the product.  Also grind the other end of the tape into the stock. </li><li>  To notice the bottom of the trousers.  To do this, unscrew the pants allowances and lay out the stitch stitches manually. </li><li>  Fasten the bottom of the product.  This can be done in two ways: stick or grind on a typewriter.  In order to perform bending by the first method, you need to purchase a special ribbon "spider line".  Lay the adhesive strip in the crease (between the allowance and the main part of the product) and iron it with a hot iron (it is better to do this through a clean cloth so as not to damage the material of the trousers).  In order to apply the second method, it is necessary to install on the sewing machine a special foot designed for a <span>blind seam</span> and to lay a line (details on this operation can be found in the instructions for the device). </li><li>  Remove marking lines and iron the product. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  For those who are interested in information on how to properly hem <span>women's trousers,</span> we can say that these works are similar to the above information on the hemming of the bottom of the product for men.  The exception is that in this case, you do not need to sew the braid.  Other actions are also applicable to female products. </p><p>  For those who do not have such an operation as a blind stitch in the sewing machine, it will be useful to learn how to properly hem the pants manually.  To do this, you may need a thin and long needle, threads matching the color of the base material, and pins.  At the stage when the product is already trimmed to the desired length and the bottom of the legs is processed on the overlock, you need to bend the allowances and fix them with pins.  Thread the needle with a single thread (trousers are better to turn out).  Sew an allowance to the main body by slightly unscrewing it.  A line is laid just below the finished edge.  The needle should pass between the allowance and the leg, grabbing little by little on each side so that no stitches are visible from the front.  The thread should not be tightened too much.  If the fabric of the trousers is very thin, it is better to use a bead needle. </p>
