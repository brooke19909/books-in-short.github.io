  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Best auto insurance companies: rating</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Car insurance is a prerequisite for the maintenance of the car.  Get insurance at the present time is not difficult.  You can do it through online services or with a personal appeal to the office.  It should be noted that for all companies, the conditions for registration for the same car vary significantly.  Therefore, before concluding an agreement, it is necessary to choose the most profitable company. </p><h2>  What is car insurance? </h2><p>  Each owner must take out insurance for a vehicle for their own peace of mind.  The point is that in the event of property damage to the vehicle, the costs are not borne by the owner, but by the insurance company.  Thus, even the most unforeseen situations on the road will not hit the wallet of a motorist. </p><div class="photo" data-original="1avtoyurist.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="OSAGO auto insurance companies rating" class="if uuid-3151983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/3151983.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of car insurance </h2><p>  Today, insurance companies offer a variety of contract options.  Each of them is limited to a certain amount of risk.  The main types include: </p><ol><li>  CTP - this type in the Russian Federation is mandatory.  Under the MTPL agreement, the car owner is entitled to compensation for damage caused to passengers or to the vehicle.  It is worth noting that the payment is made only if the injured party is not to blame for the accident.  MTPL is issued once a year. </li><li>  Casco - this agreement is signed on a voluntary basis.  Within its framework, full compensation for damage to the car is assumed.  But you should know that this agreement does not insure passengers or transported property in any way. </li><li>  DSAGO - voluntary car insurance.  It is drawn up as an addition to the main contract and ensures the reduction of the most unforeseen risks. </li></ol><p>  Thus, OSAGO must be issued to all car owners.  Casco does not interchange OSAGO. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rating of the best auto insurance companies </h2><p>  You can conclude a contract in a dozen different companies.  The rating of the best auto insurance companies is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Ingosstrakh - in this company the highest percentage of payments without a court. </li><li>  RESO-Garantia - the company offers a huge number of additional service packages. </li><li>  Alfa Insurance - customers give the company the highest rating. </li><li>  Rosgosstrakh is the largest organization of all the auto insurance companies represented in the rating. </li><li>  "Renaissance Insurance" - creates the most convenient conditions for paperwork for its customers. </li><li>  "Consent" - has a very streamlined online service. </li><li>  "Zetta Insurance" - the service in this company is at a European level. </li><li>  "Insurance House" - pays insurance faster than other representatives of the list. </li><li>  SOGAZ - almost never refuses payments. </li><li>  Liberty Insurance - makes out insurance at any time of the day or night. </li></ol><p>  Each of the representatives of the list has its own advantages and disadvantages.  A more detailed overview of auto insurance companies from the rating is presented below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tamozhennoe-oformleniye.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="auto insurance companies rating list of the best" class="if uuid-3152004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/3152004.jpg"></div><h2>  Ingosstrakh </h2><p>  The represented company receives leadership positions due to the high level of reliability.  Today ruAAA is the highest value possible.  A wide range of services is another reason to include Ingosstrakh in the rating of car insurance companies.  MTPL, comprehensive insurance and any other types of insurance here are provided in a matter of minutes.  Another advantage of the company is a hassle-free refund.  This indicator matters - 56%.  2.97% - the failure rate of this insurer.  Ingosstrakh also submits cases to court only in 0.13% of cases.  If the customer decides to purchase additional services from the company, then all of them will be clearly stated in the contract.  For owners of new cars (service life less than five years), the company offers a special offer "Auto Protection".  This option makes it possible not to take into account the period of use of parts during repair.  In this case, the owner of the insurance policy receives reduced payments for wear and tear.  For vehicles under ten years of age, Ingosstrakh offers the ‚ÄúMaintenance Guarantee‚Äù service. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.region62.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="auto insurance companies rating review" class="if uuid-3151999" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/3151999.jpg"></div><h2>  "RESO-Guarantee" </h2><p>  Of all the representatives of the list of car insurance companies, this is the most convenient.  Users note a high level of responsibility of the organization.  This is confirmed by the reliability rating of the car insurance company Reso-Garantia - ruAA +.  This value shows that the insurer will have enough funds to compensate for the damage for many years to come.  The obvious advantage of RESO-Garantia is the availability of an additional option when composing a mandatory car insurance.  They are of two types: </p><ul><li>  "Economy" - provides a quick departure of a special person in case of an emergency and a reduction in the price of transporting a broken car on the highway or in an urban environment. </li><li>  "Comfort" - suggests all the options "Economy".  Additionally, this package includes a free call of a real paid ambulance. </li></ul><p>  If the owner of the car wants to get an even wider range of services, then he should consider the option of registering a DGO, and to him also hull.  The rating of car insurance companies is primarily based on the quality of work of the insurer.  RESO-Garantia always fulfills its promises in full.  She also has no delays in payments.  The payout percentage of the represented insurer is at 51%.  Insured persons receive rejection refunds only in 1.68% of cases. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="gosavtopolis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="auto insurance companies rating and reviews" class="if uuid-3151987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/3151987.jpg"></div><h2>  "Al insurance" </h2><p>  This representative completes the TOP-3 rating of auto insurance companies.  Reviews of his customers are mostly positive.  Most car owners consider Alfastrakhovanie to be the best representative of the service sector in question.  For 20 years, the company has been among the top ten insurance companies.  And this is not surprising, because its reliability rating is ruAA +.  And this means that up to the highest Alfastrakhovanie indicator, it remains to accumulate very little money.  As for the advantages of the company, they look as follows: </p><ul><li>  low failure rate - 1.06%, </li><li>  convenient design of DSAGO, </li><li>  multifunctional "My Account", </li><li>  operational technical support. </li></ul><p>  For those who do not have free time, the company offers convenient online insurance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="develop.bus.dev.perx.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ranking of the best auto insurance companies" class="if uuid-3151977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/3151977.jpg"></div><h2>  Rosgosstrakh </h2><p>  According to analytical firms, Rosgosstrakh is the largest representative of the rating of auto insurance companies.  He also made the list of the best because of good creditworthiness.  Its reliability rating is ruBBB +.  This is slightly lower than the previous representatives of the rating of car insurance companies.  But a review of all aspects of the work of Rosgosstrakh shows that this does not affect the quality of its work.  The only drawback of the insurer presented is its dependence on the economic situation in the country. </p><p>  As for the benefits of Rosgosstrakh, these include: </p><ol><li>  Extensive experience - almost fifteen years. </li><li>  Over a hundred offices across the country. </li><li>  Possibility of online application. </li></ol><p>  In the past, the company had problems with payouts.  Therefore, some customers are distrustful of the insurer.  Currently, nearly three percent of customers are denied payments. </p><h2>  "Renaissance" </h2><p>  Fifth place in the ranking of car insurance companies goes to the Renaissance.  According to customer reviews, the organization provides a very high level of service.  Also, the company's advantage is a stable market position and a good image.  Its level of reliability is still slightly lower than its main competitors and it matters ruAA-.  The position of Renaissance in the market is quite stable, but the company is not going to stop there.  So, support service operators in this car insurance company work around the clock.  Therefore, customers can fill out an application or clarify any question at any time of the day or night.  The Renaissance failure index is constantly decreasing and today it is only 3.33%. </p><p>  The company's online services also work at a high level.  So, customers can always make changes or correct errors under the contract directly in your account.  You can also apply for an insurance contract through the company's official website.  The only thing worth paying attention to in such a situation is that the original document will be delivered to the client the next day by courier.  You can also pay for insurance through an employee at the time of receipt of the documents. </p><h2>  "Consent" </h2><p>  The sixth place in the rating of car insurance companies went to a promising and very dynamically developing office.  Now its level of reliability is classified by ruBBB +.  That is, the creditworthiness of the "Concord" is not bad, but not perfect.  Which is primarily due to the serious dependence of the company on economic changes.  But despite this, the company always indemnifies.  Payments are not even affected by the fact how many times the insured car has crashed.  And if the company's customers do not have experience in accidents, then they are waiting for very decent discounts.  The failure rate of the "Consent" is minimal and amounts to 1.66%.  In addition, the advantages of the company are: </p><ul><li>  great tech support </li><li>  convenient personal account </li><li>  application for smartphones. </li></ul><p>  Having insured the car with Concorde, the client will never expire his contract.  The company without fail reminds car owners of the end of insurance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="doctorvera-kaluga.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="auto insurance companies reliability rating" class="if uuid-3151979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/3151979.jpg"></div><h2>  Zetta </h2><p>  Previously, the company was called Zurich.  According to the rating, the auto insurance company ranks seventh.  Its entry into the top ten is due to the excellent service of the European level and good solvency.  According to the national scale, its reliability level is determined by ruA +.  In this regard, customers have no reason to worry.  Payments for road accidents "Zetta" makes less than twenty days.  Also, the company does not oblige customers to present an excessively large number of documents.  It is enough to provide a passport, title and driver's license.  As for refusals on payments, only a little more than two percent of clients fall under them.  Every year, the level of work of the company becomes much higher.  Car owners praise Zetta for a very high level of customer focus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.svyazy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="auto insurance companies list" class="if uuid-3151981" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44442/3151981.jpg"></div><h2>  "Insurance House" </h2><p>  This insurer is distinguished by iron discipline and a high level of responsibility.  According to the reliability rating, "Insurance House" has a ruAA indicator.  This indicator suggests that the insurance company in the next five years will definitely not show negative dynamics.  As for the percentage of refusals to indemnify for damage, this indicator at the Insurance House is at the level of 1.81%. </p><p>  As for the advantages of the company, they look as follows: </p><ol><li>  Customers who do not have an emergency are provided with preferential insurance conditions. </li><li>  Compensation for damage is carried out five days after filling out the application. </li><li>  For great holidays, the insurer makes good discounts. </li></ol><p>  Despite a good list of advantages, reviews about this company are very controversial.  So, in different regions, the company's customers are dissatisfied with the service and give the company average or poor ratings. </p><h2>  SOGAZ </h2><p>  The main and most important advantage of the company is a high level of creditworthiness.  The fact is that its reliability rating is at the level of the leader of the list and is designated - ruAAA.  It was no coincidence that SOGAZ got to the very bottom of the rating.  The fact is that the company's customers often complain about the speed of service and the level of service.  But there are also positive reviews.  Some clients note that the company very quickly solve problem situations.  As for the performance of the company, they look as follows: </p><ol><li>  Refusals of payments - 0.66%. </li><li>  Decision of transactions through the court - 1.37%. </li><li>  Payout level - 53%. </li></ol><p>  This data is a guarantee of accurate damages. </p><h2>  Liberty </h2><p>  The most unpopular representative of the rating of car insurance companies is Liberty.  As for the reliability rating, the company has a very high rating - ruAAA.  Customer reviews also characterize the organization on the positive side.  They say that Liberty is a very loyal and generous insurer.  There are times when a company transfers more money to its client than the evaluator estimates. </p><p>  But the company also has disadvantages.  Thus, the percentage of failure to pay here is higher than that of other representatives of the rating of car insurance companies (5.08%).  In addition to providing a standard set of services, the company always offers to take an additional package, which not all customers like. </p>
