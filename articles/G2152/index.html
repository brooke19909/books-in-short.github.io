In the north of the country is the region of Halkidiki, popular with tourists.  It is ideal for a relaxing family vacation.  Even in hot summers, coastal resorts are surrounded by greenery, and tourists can always diversify their vacation by going on an excursion to the sights of ancient Greek history.  There are plenty of accommodation options available for travelers.  Expensive hotels are often located along the coast, but you can choose a budget place to stay if you wish.  One of them is the budget complex Porfi Beach Hotel 3 *.  You can see the photo, reviews and its description in this article. </p><h2>  More about hotel location </h2><p>  Often, budget hotels are located on the second and third lines of the sea, which means that the road to the beach every day for tourists will take at least 10-15 minutes.  Sometimes the savings are worth it, but for some people this way can be difficult.  For example, elderly tourists or families with small children.  However, the Porfi Beach Hotel 3 * in Sithonia is located right on the seafront, which is considered a rarity for budget hotels.  You can reach the private beach in just 2-3 minutes.  The hotel is always quiet and peaceful, as there are no restaurants and bars nearby.  Residential buildings are surrounded by a dense park.  In the immediate vicinity of the complex are other hotels.  A bus stop is 50 meters away.  From here, tourists can get to the nearest villages - Metamorfosi and Nikiti.  Both of them are about 3 km from the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="40.22726460000001" data-lng="23.632785799999965" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/0/8/1/17081.png"></div><p>  The nearest airport is in the vicinity of Thessaloniki.  It is there that flights from Moscow and St. Petersburg most often land.  The easiest way to get from the airport is if you paid the transfer to the hotel in advance.

All rooms are serviced daily.  Towels and bed linen at the hotel are changed at least 3 times a week. </p><h2>  Infrastructure and service </h2><p>  Since the resort complex Porfi Beach Hotel 3 * is a budget place to relax, you can not count on a first-class level of service.  But the most necessary infrastructure facilities on its territory are still open.  A 24-hour reception desk is open for guests, where an administrator is always present.

The entrance to the sea is gentle and even, which is very pleasant for guests with small children.  The bottom here is also sandy, but sometimes there is sharp pebble.  Therefore, before bathing, it is better to wear shoes.  The beach itself is fully equipped for a comfortable stay.  For a fee, tourists are provided with sun loungers and sun umbrellas.  But you can always sit for free directly in the sand on a towel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Open pool" class="if uuid-3205390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/3205390.jpg"></div><p>  If you do not want to swim in the sea, then you can always relax near the outdoor pool.
