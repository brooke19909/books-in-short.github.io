The classics of golden Russian literature wrote a lot about this.  But they had the opportunity not less than ours to visit overseas resorts.  All of them, each in their own way, came to one single thought: ‚ÄúIndeed, you can relax with your body in the distance, but in order to be healed with your body and soul, this is only due to the characteristic and unique nature of a small homeland.  That‚Äôs how a person works. ‚Äù </p><div class="photo" data-original="golden-ring.drugiegoroda.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikita Compound" class="if uuid-2972708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/2972708.jpg"></div><p>  This story is about one of such tranquil and pacifying corners, located just a 2-hour drive from Moscow along the Yaroslavl highway.  This is the guest complex "Nikitsky Compound" in Pereslavl-Zalessky. </p><p>  According to the level of hotel services, it is classified as a three-star.  However, do not forget that this, we will repeat, is a guest complex.  Therefore, we recommend that guests expecting a hotel service in their pure form, in advance, on the eve of the actual settlement, to specify this nuance. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Visitors to the Nikitsky Compound reviews are usually left on the corresponding page of the company website.  They, in their bulk, are positive.  Most often mentioned: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Healthy climate: clean air, silence. </li><li>  The comfort and cleanliness of the cottage. </li><li>  The sauna is super. </li><li>  Linen is brought on demand and immediately. </li><li>  Wonderful stay for kids. </li><li>  The house is warm in winter. </li><li>  The kitchen is well equipped. </li><li>  Created all the possibilities for a great weekend. </li><li>  The price of accommodation during off-season is reduced and very attractive. </li></ul><p>  Short and concise reviews of former guests are sometimes interspersed with detailed and detailed responses purposefully living for a week or more in the Nikitsky Compound guesthouse (Pereslavl).

After the post, you need to continue driving along the right bypass, where at the 19th kilometer change the direction of movement at the T-shaped intersection ‚ÄúPereslavl - Yaroslavl with a traffic light.  Then - turn left onto Pereslavl, while not passing through 5 km turn right onto Maurino.  Upon reaching the village, we recommend that you look at the signs directed to the cottage village "Pereslavl open spaces". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.komandirovka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikita Compound" class="if uuid-2972648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/2972648.jpg"></div><p>  The guest complex itself is located at the entrance to this village.

The latter option is more convenient for travelers who do not like queues. </p><p>  The comfortable guest complex "Nikitsky Compound" in Pereslavl-Zalessky is located in a picturesque forest glade.  To Pleshcheyev Lake, the distance to which is 2 kilometers, vacationers get on their own vehicles. </p><p>  Its highlight is its proximity to the Pleshcheyevo Lake National Park.  The statistics of this conservation area, which is slightly remote from Moscow, are impressive: 5.9 thousand ha of a water mirror and 15 thousand ha of the forest fund surrounding it.  The park also has historical, architectural, archaeological sites. </p><h2>  The layout of the hotel complex </h2><p>  The territory of the guest yard, entrances and approaches to its cottages are carefully planned in terms of access by road.  Each cottage is as accessible as possible.  All modern communications are laid to the wooden huts.  The equipment is in good condition, the housing stock is maintained in order. </p><p>  The traditional Russian "wooden" style of architecture creates a fabulous atmosphere for vacationers, improves mood.  Yards near the cottages adapted to rest allow you to organize fun-filled picnics with barbecue or barbecue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ostrovok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikita Compound in Pereslavl Zalessky" class="if uuid-2972653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/2972653.jpg"></div><p>  It is obvious that the architects of the guest complex took into account the possibilities of a variety of vacations.  A group of friends and colleagues will be able to spend their memorable picnic here.  There are all the possibilities for a family vacation.  Those who wish to implement a personal excursion program will not be disappointed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After reviewing the photos, you are convinced: the Nikitsky Compound looks attractive and stylish in the surroundings of the Russian forest.  The description of this hotel complex can be found on different sites, however, it is most relevant on the corporate website.  After all, it is on it that, at the choice of customers, one of 13 cottages is booked.  Stylish and comfortable log cabins vary in architecture and spaciousness; they can accommodate from one to sixteen people. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Guest reviews convince us that the Nikitsky Compound complex was really built with mind and soul.  The photos of the guest yard illustrate the optimal layout and the obvious comfort of its residential buildings. </p><p>  Each of them has a self-contained sauna.  Can you imagine how spectacular this is?  Especially in winter: take a sauna after an exciting ski trip.  By the way, skis, like sledges, vacationers rent here. </p><p>  A feature of each cottage is the presence of a fully-equipped kitchen equipped with modern technology, we will inform about this in more detail when describing the cottages.  A leisure courtyard and equipped parking for vehicles allow people to move freely and liberate themselves internally. </p><h2>  Cottages </h2><p>  The guest complex "Nikitsky Compound" is equipped with housing with heated floors, built-in baths, playgrounds, a barbecue courtyard, a parking lot for vehicles.  We list the main types of cottages related to it. </p><p>  The most spacious is a two-story cottage "Ilya Muromets" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã160 m <sup>2</sup> .  The spacious building has five bedrooms, with a total capacity of 14 people and a living room furnished with two sofas.  The living room has the ability to watch cable TV and use the Internet via Wi-Fi.  There is a washing machine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turbaza.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikitsky Compound Pereslavl reviews" class="if uuid-2972672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/2972672.jpg"></div><p>  The cottage has a mini-kitchen, equipped with a refrigerator, stove, microwave and dishwasher, equipped with a set of necessary utensils. </p><p>  The second largest is considered a two-story cottage "Dobrynya Nikitich" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã120 m <sup>2</sup> , which is designed to accommodate ten people.  It has 4 bedrooms and a living room.  The equipment, furniture and equipment of Dobryny are similar to those described above. </p><p>  Two-storey cottage "Nevsky" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã100 m <sup>2 is</sup> designed for up to 8 people.  It has two bedrooms.  It has the same level of comfort, with the exception of the individual car park.  However, those living in it can use the hotel-wide parking lot. </p><p>  The chalet with a sauna of 45 m2 is one-story and can accommodate up to 4 people.  The house has one bedroom with a double bed.  You can also use the sofa bed in the living room to relax.  The chalet has its own territory with barbecue and terrace.  Parking and a playground are hotel-wide. </p><p>  Cottage "Russian" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã100 m <sup>2 is</sup> one-story and can accommodate up to 8 people.  In addition to two bedrooms, there are two more niches with beds.  The gated courtyard features a barbecue and a terrace with outdoor furniture.  Parking and a playground are hotel-wide. </p><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the guest yard "Nikitsky Compound" (Pereslavl) is built up with cottages, most of which (except for cottages such as "Russian" and "chalet") are equipped with playgrounds.  Each of the houses is equipped with cots and highchairs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="katalogturbaz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="guest complex Nikitsky Compound" class="if uuid-2972673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/2972673.jpg"></div><p>  The program of cable television includes children's multichannels.  In addition, the child can take his dog or cat to rest from home (pets are allowed in the hotel complex). </p><p>  There is a rental service at the hotel complex, where in summer you can use a bicycle, and in winter - skiing and inflatable sledding.  Thanks to the fast Wi-Fi, teenagers, in addition to walking and playing in nature, can communicate with their peers on social networks or play their favorite computer games. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  From the guest yard "Nikitsky Compound" to the beaches are quite far.  Although the company‚Äôs website positions the hotel complex ‚Äúlocated near Lake Pleshcheevo‚Äù, guests often get to the beach with their cars.  The walking route to the bathing place will take only 25-30 minutes. </p><p>  However, for non-motorists there is a sure way to reduce the travel time.  You just need to contact the administrators and rent bicycles. </p><p>  Lovers of comfortable beach holidays prefer the city beach.  Connoisseurs of relaxation more relaxed and aesthetic choose the beaches of the legendary twelve-ton boulder of the Blue Stone, which is a fragment of an ancient pagan sanctuary to the sun god Yarile. </p><h2>  Fishing on Lake Pleshcheevo </h2><p>  The Nikitsky Compound, in its booklet, offers guests such a now particularly popular holiday as fishing.  About this passion of many people, which inevitably instills love of the Motherland through unity with nature, the character of Aleksey Buldakov, General Ivolgin, miraculously said: </p><blockquote><p>  ‚ÄúIs it our fault that we were born in Russia?  And sometimes we need just a little bit, so as not to lose the ground under our feet, the feeling of homeland, peace: a quiet river, a small forest lake and simple tackle. ‚Äù </p></blockquote><p>  Substantial and interesting fishing on Lake Pleshcheevo!  The water in the lake is salty, transparent, fed by springs.  With a calm surface, the depth is visible at 10 meters.  It is unique in its own way: formed during the ice age, has a relatively shallow funnel shape.  It is here, on this lake in the distant XVIII century, with the construction of Peter I of his amusing flotilla, the history of the Russian fleet takes its count.  There are legends among the people that this reservoir has a double bottom, on the second level of which relict fish live.  This mysticism attracts tourists to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vodabereg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikita Compound reviews" class="if uuid-2972662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/2972662.jpg"></div><p>  Having paid 250 rubles.  for a day of fishing, you can put up a tent on the shore or take advantage of the infrastructure of one of the many recreation centers created specifically for fishermen.  Those who wish are allowed fishing strictly on a spinning rod or on a fishing rod from a boat (without a motor) or from the shore. </p><p>  The pleasure for fishermen is brought by catching both predatory fish: burbot, pike, perch, as well as carp, silver bream, crucian carp, roach, rudd.  However, fishing lovers consider a small northern fish a vendace, which once was part of the coronation dinner of Russian tsars, to be a special trophy. </p><h2>  Water sports </h2><p>  Active recreation is also in honor for those who visit the Nikitsky Compound (Pereslavl).  The reviews of such tourists indicate successful attempts to master extreme water sports. </p><p>  Windsurfing is very popular on Lake Pleshcheyevo.  Those who want to cope with the simplest self-propelled boat - a sailing board can learn this art at a local surf school. </p><p>  Some vacationers are interested in wakeboarding (gliding along the lake with fixing special figures on a board, driven by cable car or boat traction).  Skills are quickly mastered thanks to a French-certified training course. </p><p>  Kitesurfing is cultivated in this pond: the practitioner glides on the board along the waves behind a parachute.  This sport is the most difficult in terms of mastering the technique.  The coordination necessary for such an exciting sport is achieved as a result of the assimilation of a number of lessons given by the coaches located on the coast of kaitstani.  The latter are located near the village of Veskovo. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Guests staying at the Nikitsky Compound Guesthouse celebrate excellent cuisine; women especially like the delicious local desserts here.  However, unfortunately, the institution's corporate website missed the illustration of a significant moment of rest - the organization of food intake.  Moreover, it‚Äôs obvious: this important process is not left to chance and is properly regulated.  Proof of this is the laconic eulogies of the most demanding guests - mothers of young children. </p><p>  Mentioning vacationers in terms of healthy eating is a local specialized farmer's shop selling milk from the manufacturer and bread baked according to home recipes. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The Nikitsky Compound is not only attractive for its special comfort, the complex is simply surrounded by sightseeing sites. </p><p>  Vacationers must visit the unique small private museums - the visiting card of Pereslavl-Zalessky.  It is no secret that all unusual is liked by children.  Therefore, families of vacationers are eager to visit, a museum of tricks and ingenuity, an iron museum, a teapot museum and others. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.esosedi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikita Compound Description" class="if uuid-2972693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/2972693.jpg"></div><p>  The museum of Alexander Nevsky, by the way, a native of Pereslavl-Zalessky, also enjoys attention.  It is a small but spectacular exposition: even a child is interested in seeing the model of Pereslavl-Zalessky of the 12th century, hearing about the battles won by the pious prince, examining a copy of the figure of the legendary prince, equipping a Russian warrior, conquerors - the Horde and the Teutonic knight. </p><p>  The Orthodox tradition of this city is strong: here in the XI century the noble Prince Alexander Nevsky was born, and here priest Sergius of Radonezh took.  Of course, the temples of Pereyaslav-Zalessky deserve the attention of tourists: </p><ul><li>  The only temple of North-Eastern Russia that has survived to our time is the Transfiguration Cathedral, built in the XII century by Yuri Dolgoruky. </li><li>  Theodore Convent with the main cathedral of St. Theodore, erected at the behest of Ivan the Terrible. </li><li>  Trinity Danilov Monastery, built in the XIV century under Prince Vasily III. </li></ul><p>  For lovers of classical museums, ‚Äúadults‚Äù, we recommend visiting the cultural and historical museum-reserve ‚ÄúPereslavl-Zalessky‚Äù.  Visitors' reviews characterize it as a ‚Äúsolid local history museum‚Äù. </p><h2>  Souvenirs </h2><p>  It's no secret that tourists tend to buy souvenirs in the places where they rested.  The guests of the guest house strongly recommend that their followers not deprive the souvenir shops from the Berendey House.  There are only three of them in Pereyaslav-Zalessky: two - along Rostovskaya Street and one - on Uritsky Street.  Judging by the reviews, souvenirs reminiscent of a stay in the conservation area and in the historic Pereyaslav-Zalessky are really nice and popular with vacationers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.superpohod.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikita Compound Address" class="if uuid-2972690" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/2972690.jpg"></div><p> Some motorists also mention handmade souvenirs, which are sold in the shop at the museum "Forest Heritage", located in the village of Yam. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Which of us does not dream of spending a vacation or a weekend vividly, gaining impressions from communicating with close friends and colleagues?  Or maybe you just need, as the song says, to rush ‚Äúon the iron dogs - away from the sick cities‚Äù, i.e.  to heal the soul, just contemplating nature in pristine silence?  Perhaps you are a fisherman, and strive to devote to your beloved hobby "a day that does not count in life?" </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pereslavl-rent.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikitsky Compound reviews booking" class="if uuid-2972689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/2972689.jpg"></div><p>  All these aspirations can be realized by staying at a stand in the guest yard ‚ÄúNikitsky Compound‚Äù.  Responses to "Booking" indicate the high quality of the services provided, the established service, courtesy and friendliness of the staff.  A high average score on a ten-point system is evidence of this. </p><p>  As follows from the reviews of vacationers in this hospitable corner, the rest is more harmonious in terms of excursions and water recreation, for motorists.  Thanks to the ‚Äúiron horses‚Äù the distance to the center of Pereslavl-Zalessky to the beach and to the sights is leveled. </p>
