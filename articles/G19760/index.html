Festival Le Jardin Resort is a hotel located in this resort and always welcoming all its guests.  A few years ago, without exaggeration, he was the best.  But, as is often practiced in Egypt, the hotel owners changed, and everything became a little different.  We bring to your attention a review of Festival Le Jardin Resort, based on reviews from tourists who visited here in 2015. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hurghada resort is located about 500 km southeast of the capital of Egypt, Cairo and 7 km (according to official sources) from the international airport.  About 20 km north of Hurghada is a new unique area of ‚Äã‚ÄãEl Gouna, in beauty and the number of channels resembling Venice.  About halfway between the airport (12 km) and the beautiful El Gouna (14 km), a new district of Hurghada was recently formed, called El Aheya (Ahiya).  Currently, it is at the stage of development and development.  New hotels, infrastructure are being built here, beaches are being equipped.  This is where the Festival Le Jardin Resort hotel is located.  Precisely because the area is new, the landscapes around ‚Äúdelight‚Äù with desert and uninhabited.  There are several others near this hotel, the closest of which is Festival Riviera Resort.  Guests at Festival Le Jardin can use its infrastructure for free.  There is a highway next to the hotel and buses run, so it‚Äôs easy to get to both Hurghada and El Gouna.  The journey takes no more than 10 minutes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The pride <span>of the Festival Le Jardin Resort (Hurghada) hotel</span> and the great plus that has always been noted in all reviews is its territory.  It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã25,000 square meters.  For a hotel of this level this is not very much, but tourists see in compact sizes more likely than plus, minus, because from the buildings to all infrastructure and the beach is close enough, but there is enough space for walking.  The hotel area is similar to a botanical garden, so many different trees, beautiful flowers, exotic evergreen bushes, which are masterpieces of the topiary, grow on it.  All plantings are carefully planned and very well maintained, alleys are clean and neat.  For greater beauty, designers placed figures on the territory that mimic Egyptian sights, and for the convenience of their guests, they equipped cute little gazebos.  In addition, there are swimming pools, parking, sports grounds, bars, restaurants, a playground with slides and swings for children to play. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Festival Le Jardin Resort 5 Hurghada" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1077653.jpg" width="586"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Festival Le Jardin Resort is a single building of five floors and several facilities located on the territory.  In the building on the ground floor there is a reception where tourists can leave their bags and suitcases in a storage room, take a safe, call a doctor, taxi, take things to the laundry or dry cleaning, buy sightseeing tours, use the fax, exchange currency, solve all current issues. </p><p>  In the lobby, near the reception, there is a lobby bar, comfortable armchairs, tables are installed, shops with cosmetics, clothes, souvenirs, beach accessories are working, there is an ATM.  For business people combining leisure with work, the hotel offers to use a well-equipped conference room, which, if necessary, can easily be transformed into a banquet room. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Regarding the condition of the number of rooms in Festival Le Jardin Resort, the reviews are different, but more than those in which there is a lack of novelty of the situation and plumbing.  The hotel has been operating since 2008, in 2015, innovations began to be carried out here.  The general impression of tourists is that the rooms are not up to level 5 *, but they are quite suitable for "just sleeping".  However, in those rooms where the reconstruction has already taken place, the decor and condition of the plumbing are wonderful.  The design of the rooms is quite simple - nothing more.  The view from the windows can be on the sea and the territory or on the outbuildings.  Many tourists report that for the best room at the reception require a surcharge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Festival Le Jardin Resort Hurghada" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1077645.jpg" width="585"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Literally a minute is required for guests to walk to the beach from the Festival Le Jardin Resort 5 * hotel.  Hurghada is famous for its coastline and wonderful sea, but in this case, a beach holiday can upset.  The coating here looks like a sand, but in fact it is a small crumb.  Stony steps without railings lead into the water.  Depth, where there is the opportunity to swim, begins about 700 meters from the coast.  Another unpleasant feature of this section of the coast is the ebbs and flows.  During the latter, swimming in the sea is possible only after lunch. </p><p>  The bottom of the coast is covered with uncleared corals, which can be injured, there is also a risk of stepping on a sea urchin, so it is advisable to have special shoes.  There is no pier or pontoon at this beach; entry into the sea is only from the coast.  Exotic fish and other inhabitants of the underwater kingdom are present, but there are not so many of them as in other areas of the Red Sea. </p>

    <h2>  Leisure outside </h2><p>  Unfortunately, guests of Festival Le Jardin Resort will not be able to take exciting walks.  Egypt is an interesting country with many attractions and unusual color, but there are plenty of desert sites here.  Just such landscapes so far can be contemplated near the hotel.  To diversify your vacation, as well as for shopping you need to go to Hurghada.  To do this, you can use buses or taxis, which the hotel kindly provides.  The second option is to rent a car.  But the hotel guests have a wonderful opportunity to visit the El Gouna area, which can be reached in 5 minutes.  This is real Venice in the desert - with blue canals, like toy houses and bridges, funny cars that move around the area, and boats cruising along the canals.  Someone may be interested in a brewery, someone in the Kafr district, styled in antiquity, and someone in supermarkets, discos, a huge aquarium or the best golf club in the country. </p><p>  In addition to this fabulous place, tourists are offered a number of classic excursions - in Hurghada, Cairo, Luxor, Jerusalem, Paradise Island (a yacht with a glass bottom), karting in the desert. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Festival Le Jardin Resort 5 * is focused on year-round vacations of unassuming tourists.  Only Anex Tour sells vouchers to this hotel, advertising it as a five-star, although in Egypt it is declared as a four-star with an appropriate set of services.  The hotel staff is trying to make the rest of all the guests wonderful, quickly solve the problems that arise, and meet the need to replace the rooms.  As an improvement to the service, there are compliments: </p><ul><li>  birthday people; </li><li>  regular guests; </li><li>  anniversaries; </li><li>  newlyweds. </li></ul><p>  To receive them, you must fill in the appropriate columns in the voucher. </p><p>  Children under 6 years old are not paid, and for children from 6 to 12 years old inclusive payment is 50% of the room rate per day. </p>
