However, few know that the development of such TV sets has been going on since the 70s of the last century.  Due to the high cost of the created samples and the impossibility of their commercial use, the project was stopped. </p><p>  Currently, there are already televisions that use unusual laser technology.  Such models in technical parameters can be attributed to projection.  A laser acts as a light source in them. </p><p>  In this article, we will talk about laser technologies in television, as well as a short overview of laser televisions that are commercially available, and their main characteristics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.avcesar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Laser tv" class="if uuid-2465340" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2465340.jpg"></div><h2>  Attractiveness and benefits </h2><p>  To understand the full potential of such television models, we compare the most popular plasma and liquid crystal panels with laser TVs today and highlight the principal characteristics of the latter. </p><ul><li>  High energy efficiency - the technology of using a laser itself can reduce the power consumption of a TV by almost five times compared to LCD counterparts. </li><li>  High brightness indicators - for laser screens they exceed the capabilities of traditional panels by several times. </li><li>  The widest <span>color gamut.</span>  Owing to its unique purity, laser beams of primary colors create an amazing amount of color shades that are approximately 1.8 times higher than the capabilities of traditional technologies. </li><li>  Natural black color is created simply by turning off the laser.  The resulting saturated black color does not have an afterglow, any side flashes and shades of gray. </li><li>  Longevity of the screen - the pixels on the screen of a laser TV do not degrade and do not fade, as can happen with flat-panel analogs. </li><li>  High resolution - screens of television receivers, which are created by laser technology, are designed initially for Full HD format. </li><li>  Critical viewing angles - this is a concept for laser models, according to the developers, is not relevant, since the image quality on the screen practically does not change even at the sharpest viewing angles.  This is not true for traditional panels. </li></ul><h2>  Laser in TV </h2><p>  As mentioned above, laser televisions are very similar to projection televisions, of which there are two types: frontal and rear projection.  The laser model refers to televisions with rear projection. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/04/hisenses-laser-projector-promises-a-100-inch-4k-screen-for-13k/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Laser television" class="if uuid-2465306" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2465306.jpg"></div><p>  Using technology has greatly simplified the design of the device and get rid of many parts that increase its weight and size.  These are color filters, a color wheel, various polarizers, special radiation filters, moving mirrors, and additional optical devices.  There is no longer any need for filtering and dividing the lamp beam into different colors.  The desired color of the laser beams can be easily projected onto the panel. </p><p>  After eliminating unnecessary components, the TV turned out to be more compact and light.  Power consumption has decreased, while image brightness and color reproduction have improved. </p><h2>  Mitsubishi Laser TV </h2><p>  The L75-A96 model from a leading manufacturer has improved parameters compared to its predecessor.  This three-dimensional TV is characterized by motion processing, unique color rendition and immersion depth in a 3D image, which are not achievable by any liquid crystal model that exists today. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gizmodo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mitsubishi Laser TV" class="if uuid-2465330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2465330.jpg"></div><p>  By connecting an external 3D emitter, the presence zone for a large number of viewers has expanded.  The new generation power supply system makes the device as economical as possible in energy consumption.  And the combination of new screen material, SUPER GREEN technology and the exclusive six-color Mitsubishi processor made the picture even more realistic and saturated. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thus, this model has become an excellent basis for the highest-end <span>3D home theater</span> . </p><h2>  Mystery MTV-2430LTA2 </h2><p>  This laser TV will give you an exceptionally high-quality and vivid image, which allows you to get maximum viewing pleasure. </p><p>  This device works on the Android operating system, which has turned it into a real multimedia giant, without the need to purchase additional devices and players. </p><p>  An analog tuner and a digital one with DVB-T, T2 support are designed for watching television. </p><p>  You can connect various devices to the TV using component, composite, HDMI, AUX, VGA, USB and headphone output.  The device fits perfectly into any interior. </p><h2>  Laser Projector Mi Laser Projector </h2><p>  This Xiaomi laser TV is announced by the manufacturer as a device for use in home environments with ultra-short focal lengths.  The projector displays an image with Full HD resolution and a diagonal of up to 150 inches at a distance of up to 50 cm from the wall or screen.  Thanks to the built-in settings function, manual focusing is not required.  The manufacturer declared a resource at the level of 25 thousand hours, which is equivalent to 34 years of work with a daily two-hour operation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kustruki.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi Laser TV" class="if uuid-2465318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2465318.jpg"></div><p>  Two broadband and two high-definition tweeters represent the integrated speaker system.  Three types of external audio connections are supported. </p><p>  The package of this news includes its own remote control with a built-in laser pointer for the TV, which supports the universal application for remote control from Xiaomi. </p><h2>  100 inch 4K Laser TV </h2><p>  Introduced in 2017 by Hisense, the laser TV is technically a projector that projects an image onto a huge 2.5-meter screen.  A <span>laser source</span> with a validity of 20 thousand hours and a luminous flux of 3,000 lumens is used.  A wide range of color reproduction and a high level of brightness are provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/25/hisense-10000-laser-tv-home-cinema-in-box/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hisense Laser TV" class="if uuid-2465291" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2465291.jpg"></div><p>  A 110-watt Harman Kardon audio system is responsible for the sound.  It includes two satellites and a subwoofer.  At the same time, the transmission is over the air.  Of course, there is a smart interface with applications Netflix, YouTube, Pandora and Amazon Video, as well as a built-in TV tuner. </p><h2>  New LG HECTO </h2><p>  100-inch LG HECTO Laser TV - a novelty from a well-known company, presented as a laser projection TV. </p><p>  The model is a rather complex hybrid device, namely, a unique type of short-focus laser projector today.  The buyer is offered a kit consisting of a 100-inch anti-glare screen effect in a thin frame and a compact projection unit, which is located at a distance of 56 cm from the display in any convenient place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hd-report.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://hd-report.com/2013/06/24/lg-displays-100-inch-laser-display-in-dubai/"><img itemprop="image" alt="New LG HECTO" class="if uuid-2465346" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2465346.jpg"></div><p>  The projection unit includes 42 sets of laser diodes and provides a saturated, bright, full-size image in Full HD resolution, eliminating the possibility of blurring the picture. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  After listing a sufficient number of advantages of laser TVs, it is necessary to dwell on their disadvantages.  And the main of them is still a relatively high cost.  Also, many buyers call such disadvantages as large dimensions and increased eye fatigue during prolonged viewing. </p><p>  Ophthalmologists say that eye fatigue is directly related to the projected image of such a television at the levels that are maximum for human perception. </p>
