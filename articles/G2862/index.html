    <h2>  From the history of the island </h2><p>  The heyday and development of Ischia falls on the period of the Roman Empire.  In these distant times, the city of Aenaria appeared.  Today, at the place of its foundation, researchers and scientists find various objects of historical value.  In the Middle Ages, the island of Ischia was a tidbit for the invaders, so the local population had to build observation towers around the perimeter. </p><p>  Until the moment when the island became a full member of the united Italy, it was the property of the Napoleon family.  According to historians, J. Garibaldi came here to improve his health. </p><h2>  Geographical position </h2>
