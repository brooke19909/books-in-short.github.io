  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ideas for home using the Afghan Square technique</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the simplest, but effective patterns in crocheting is the "Afghan square", the principle of which can be used in knitting in a circle, a triangle, as well as combine different types in one fabric.  A few simple ideas for using this pattern in the manufacture of various decor items and clothes will tell this article. </p><h2>  Mat made of colored threads </h2><p>  Almost every needlewoman has a box with small balls of thread left over from knitting sweaters, vests, scarves and other warm things: it‚Äôs a pity to throw away, and it is impossible to knit something full out due to the variety of colors, thickness and size of the balls.  In this case, the ‚ÄúAfghan square‚Äù will come to the rescue: from the remnants of the threads you can knit a nice rug on the floor in front of the bed or less - on a stool in the kitchen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet afghan squares" class="if uuid-3116807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/3116807.jpg"></div><p>  The more colorful, the better!  This is the basic rule when creating this decor item.  The rug can be kept in the classic style of knitting - square or rectangular, or you can simply knit in a circle using the basic principle of the pattern.  It is desirable to tie the last row of the product with single crochet columns to give a more elastic shape to the edge and make the border contrast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Shawl or Shawl </h2><p>  If you use a beautiful shade and a new skein of acrylic threads, you can knit a magnificent shawl for cool autumn evenings, decorating its edges with tassels or a fringe.  Afghan crocheting is also well suited for this, especially if this piece of clothing is conceived by a novice needlewoman who wants to try her hand with a large canvas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.reddit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="afghan crochet" class="if uuid-3115934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/3115934.jpg"></div><p>  The pattern is not complicated, and if before that it was worked out on small details, then there will be no problems at all: the main thing is not to be mistaken in counting crochet columns.  The classic sizes of a women‚Äôs square-shaped shawl rarely exceed a meter (the length of one side, not the diagonal), although this is important to focus on your height and preferences, knitting an ordinary square with an Afghan pattern. </p><h2>  Is it possible to tie bactus in such a technique? </h2><p>  Yes, a bactus or a scarf can also be connected with such a pattern, knowing the step-by-step technique of constructing a triangle: </p><ul><li>  Tie four loops, connect into a ring.  Make two more airways to climb the next row. </li><li>  Next, make three double crochet columns from the first row, then three simple and the same number of single crochet columns. </li><li>  Three simple loops follow again.  Expand knitting 180 degrees and knit two double crochet in the first chain from the second row, then 3 simple and 3 more crochet columns, knitted from the arch formed by the air loops of the last row.  Next come 3 more simple loops, 3 double crochet columns and a climb of three simple loops. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="mamas2hands.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="afghan crochet" class="if uuid-3115794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/3115794.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Next, the knitting again unfolds (this must be done when switching to each new row) and continues in the same technique until a triangle of the desired size is obtained. </li></ul><p>  It is better to use threads that are soft and not too thick so that the finished product takes any desired shape on the body. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sofa blanket </h2><p>  Using a crochet ‚ÄúAfghan square‚Äù, you can knit a whole blanket from threads thicker, not with a single fabric (as in the options above), but from small squares connected together.  You can make them colorful, or use two or three colors, combining them into a simple geometric pattern.  The main thing is to give free rein to fantasy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet afghan square" class="if uuid-3115779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/3115779.jpg"></div><p>  There can be three basic options: </p><ol><li>  Knit all the details of the future plaid with the same size, after connecting them together.  This option is most suitable for those who do not have much experience in knitting and are not sure that they can make a more complex version. </li><li>  Squares from the Afghan knit can be of different sizes.  After manufacturing, they are assembled into one large rectangle.  It is important to calculate the size of each part in advance in order to subsequently obtain a canvas of the required width.  Do not forget about a small seam allowance - 0.5 cm will be enough for each side of the square, which will connect to the other. </li><li>  You can knit one large square (for example, with a side of 40 cm), and around it - smaller squares (10 cm per side), which will be collected in strips, forming a single canvas plaid. </li></ol><h2>  How to connect the squares together? </h2><p>  To crochet the Afghan squares into one blanket, crochet posts that connect the two sides of different squares are usually used.  In the process of joining the two parts, it is important to ensure that the loops exactly match on both sides, so that the product does not warp during use or washing. </p><p>  A plaid of squares connected by a contrasting color will look very nice, especially if all the details have a different color (when the product is knitted from the remains of yarn).  Thus, the plaid will have a more finished look due to the overall shade of the connecting thread. </p><h2>  For those who are not familiar with ‚Äúgrandmother‚Äôs knitting‚Äù </h2><p>  This is what the Afghan method of crocheting in Russia is often called - "grandmother's knitting."  If this technique is not yet familiar, then this hook scheme will help to master it with ease, since there is nothing complicated.  Particular attention should be paid to tying corners, if necessary, periodically pinning the square with pins to a flat plane and checking the straight line of the corner, as well as folding the square diagonally to see if the length of the sides matches or not. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet patterns" class="if uuid-3116823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/3116823.jpg"></div><p>  Using an Afghan square or ‚Äúgrandmother‚Äôs knitting‚Äù, you can create a lot of interesting and useful things: a pillowcase, pillow cover, tablet cover, a crib for a crib made of thin white cotton threads, a hat made of thick yarn and much more.  When the skill of using this pattern is well worked out, then new ideas will manifest themselves. </p>
