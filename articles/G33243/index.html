    <h2>  Specificity of receptions </h2><p>  Empirical <span>sociological methods</span> provide obtaining fact-fixing knowledge.  They contribute to the establishment and generalization of circumstances due to indirect or direct registration of events characteristic of the studied relationships, objects, phenomena.  Empirical techniques differ from theoretical ones in that the subject of analysis is: </p><ol><li>  The behavior of individuals and their groups. </li><li>  Products of human activity. </li><li>  Verbal actions of individuals, their judgments, views, opinions. </li></ol><h2>  Selective research </h2><p>  Empirical study is always focused on obtaining objective and accurate information, quantitative data.  In this regard, in its implementation it is necessary to ensure the representativeness of the information.  Accordingly, the correct <span>sample is of</span> particular importance <span>.</span>  <span>This</span> means that the selection must be carried out so that the data obtained by a narrow group reflect the trends that occur in the total mass of respondents.  For example, when interviewing 200-300 people, the obtained data can be extrapolated to the entire urban population.  Sample indicators allow a different approach to the study of socio-economic processes in the region, in the country as a whole. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sociological methods" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1544693.jpg" width="600"></div>

The unit of observation is the direct source of information.  It can be a single individual, group, document, organization, and so on.  <span>A population is a</span> set of units of observation.  They should all be relevant to the problem being studied.  A <span>part of the general population</span> is subject to direct analysis.  The study is carried out in accordance with the developed methods of collecting information.  To determine this share of the entire array of respondents, the <span>concept of "sample set" is used.</span>  <span>Its ability to reflect the key parameters of the total mass of people is called representativeness.</span>  <span>In some cases, there are no matches.</span>  <span>Then talk about the error of representativeness.</span> <span><br></span> </p><h2>  Representativeness </h2><p>  In detail, issues related to it are considered in the framework of statistics.  The problems are complex, since, on the one hand, we are talking about ensuring the quantitative representation that the <span>general population</span> provides <span>.</span>  <span>This</span> means, in particular, that the groups of respondents should be represented in the optimal number.  The quantity should be sufficient for normal representation.  On the other hand, we mean high-quality representation.  It involves a certain subjective composition, which forms the <span>sample.</span>  <span>This</span> means that, for example, representativeness cannot be discussed if only men are interviewed, or only women, elderly people or young people.  The study should be carried out within all the groups represented. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the population is" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1544694.jpg" width="571"></div>

First of all, it is defined as a complex of elements from the general array of people whose opinion is being studied - this is a <span>sample of aggregates.</span>  <span>It is</span> also the process of creating a certain category of respondents with the required representation.  In practice, several types and types of selection are distinguished.  Consider them. </p><h2>  Types </h2><p>  There are three of them: </p><ol><li>  Elemental <span>sampling frame.</span>  <span>This is a</span> set of respondents selected on a voluntary basis.  Along with this, the accessibility of units from the total mass of people to a specific study group is ensured.  Spontaneous selection in practice is used quite often.  For example, in surveys in the press, in the mail.  However, this technique has a significant drawback.  It is impossible to qualitatively represent the entire volume of the general sample.  This technique is applied taking into account profitability.  In some polls, this option is the only one possible. </li><li>  Elemental <span>sampling frame.</span>  <span>This is</span> one of the main techniques used in the study.  The key principle of such selection is the provision of the opportunity for each unit of observation to get from the total mass of individuals into a narrow group.  For this, different tricks are used.  For example, it can be a lottery, mechanical selection, a table of random numbers. </li><li>  Stratified (quota) sampling.  It is based on the formation of a qualitative model of the total mass of respondents.  After that, the selection of units in the sample is carried out.  For example, it is performed by age or gender, by population, and so on. </li></ol><h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  The following selections exist: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Single stage.  It is a simple selection.  In this case, the corresponding principle of transition from the general population to the selective one is used. </li><li>  Serial.  In this case, the units of selection are families, teams, classes, etc. </li><li>  Multi-stage.  In this case, the selection is carried out in several stages.  For example, at the first stage, a sample of enterprises in the city is formed, then workshops, then directly respondents among workers. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sample indicators" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1544695.jpg" width="513"></div></li></ol><h2>  Additionally </h2><p>  Samples can also be dependent and independent.  In the first case, the experimental procedure and the results that will be obtained during it for one group of respondents have a certain effect on the other.  Accordingly, independent samples do not suggest the presence of such an effect.  Here, however, one important point should be noted.  One group of subjects, in relation to which a psychological examination was carried out twice (even if it was aimed at studying various qualities, characteristics, signs), will by default be considered dependent. </p><h2>  Probabilistic Screening </h2><p>  Consider some types of samples: </p><ol><li>  Random.  It assumes uniformity of the total population, one probability of the availability of all components, as well as the presence of a complete list of elements.  As a rule, in the selection process a table with random numbers is used. </li><li>  Mechanical  This kind of random sampling involves ordering by a certain attribute.  For example, by phone number, in alphabetical order, by date of birth, and so on.  The first component is randomly selected.  Next, each k element is selected in increments of n.  The magnitude of the total population will be N = k * n. </li><li>  Stratified.  This sample is used for heterogeneity of the total population.  The latter is divided into strata (groups).  In each of them, the selection is carried out mechanically or randomly. </li><li>  Serial.  Groups are selected randomly.  Inside them, objects are studied continuously. </li></ol><h2>  Incredible selections </h2><p>  They suggest sampling not by the principle of randomness, but by subjective attributes: typicality, accessibility, equal representation, and so on.  This category includes selections: </p><ol><li>  Quota.  It involves the initial selection of several groups.  For example, it can be men of 20-30 and 31-45 liters., Citizens whose income is from 30 thousand, 30-60 thousand, above 60 thousand rubles.  For each group, the number of objects to be examined is set.  The number is determined, as a rule, in proportion to the previously known proportion of the sample population in the total mass of people, or the same for all.  Within groups, the selection of objects is arbitrary. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="part of the population" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1544696.jpg" width="357"></div></li><li>  By the principle of "snowball".  In this case, each respondent is asked for contacts of colleagues, friends, acquaintances who could participate in the survey.  Sampling is thus carried out by the subjects themselves.  This method is often used in cases when it is necessary to find and interview respondents who are in hard-to-reach groups.  These may be persons with high income, belonging to a certain <span>professional environment,</span> having similar hobbies and so on. </li><li>  Spontaneous.  In this case, the survey is conducted with the most accessible respondents.  As typical examples, you can conduct research in the press, transmitting questionnaires to people for self-completion, online surveys.  The size and composition of the samples is not known in advance.  It is determined only by the activity of the respondents. </li><li>  By the principle of typical cases.  In this case, units endowed with an average attribute are selected from the <span>general population</span> .  This raises the problem of determining the criterion and its typical parameter. </li></ol><h2>  Nuance </h2><p>  To ensure representativeness, an accurate and complete list of population units is needed.  The objects of observation, as a rule, is one person.  Selection from the list is best done by numbering units and applying a table with random numbers.  But quite often the quasi-random method is also used.  It involves selection from the list of each n element. </p><h2>  Influencing factors </h2><p>  The volume of the aggregate is called the number of its units.  According to experts, it does not have to be big.  Undoubtedly, the larger the number of respondents, the more accurate the result.  However, at the same time, a large volume does not always guarantee success.  For example, this happens when the overall array of respondents is heterogeneous.  Such a combination will be considered homogeneous, where the controlled parameter, for example, the literacy level, is distributed evenly, that is, there are no voids or condensations.  In this case, it will be enough to interview a few people.  Based on the results of the survey, it will be possible to conclude that most people have a normal level of literacy.  It follows from this that the representativeness of information is influenced not by quantitative attributes, but by qualitative characteristics of the aggregate ‚Äî the level of its homogeneity, in particular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="general sample size" class="if" height="196" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1544699.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mistakes </h2><p>  They represent the deviation of the average parameters of the sample from the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the total mass of respondents.  In practice, errors are determined by comparison.  When examining adults, census information, statistics, and the results of past surveys are usually used.  The control parameters are usually <span>socio-demographic characteristics.</span>  Comparison of the mean values ‚Äã‚Äãof populations (total and sample), determination of errors in accordance with this, and reduction of this deviation is called control of representativeness. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  A sample study is a way of collecting data on attitudes and behavior of people through a survey of specially selected groups of respondents.  This technique is considered reliable and economical, although it requires a certain technique.  The basis is the sampling frame.  It acts as a certain fraction of the total mass of people.  The selection is made using special techniques and is aimed at obtaining information about the entire population.  The latter, in turn, is represented by all possible social objects or by their group that will be studied.  Often the general population is so large that conducting a survey of each of its representatives will be quite an expensive and burdensome process.  Therefore, its reduced model is used.  The sample includes all those who receive questionnaires, who are called respondents, who, in fact, act as the object of study.  Simply put, it is composed of many people who are questioned. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the concept of sample" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1544700.jpg" width="275"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Survey objectives are determined by specific categories included in the population.  As for the specific share of the total mass of people, it is made up of subjects included in groups using mathematical calculations.  For the selection of units, a description of the object of the original population is necessary.  After determining the number of subjects, a method or method of forming groups is determined.  The results of the survey will allow to describe the studied trait in relation to all representatives of the total mass of people.  As practice shows, mainly conducted selective, rather than continuous studies. </p>
