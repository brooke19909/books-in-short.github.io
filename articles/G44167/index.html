  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Accounting in trade: on the problem of recognition of the ‚Äúdate of shipment‚Äù</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In 2010, accounting in trade was carried out in such a way that the date of shipment of goods for the calculation of income tax, excise taxes and VAT was the same - the date of their shipment from the warehouse or warehouse, made in a certain order, was accepted.  In 2011, certain amendments were made to the legislative acts in determining the date of shipment of goods for calculating income tax and VAT. </p><p>  For example, <span>accounting</span> in the <span>retail trade</span> stipulates from January 1 of this year that for the calculation of <span>income tax the</span> day of shipment of products is recognized: </p><p>  - the date of their vacation to the buyer (organization, its representative or organization engaged in the transportation of products), if the seller does not transport goods; </p><p>  - in other cases, the earlier of the following dates is applied: the date of transfer to the buyer or the date of transfer to the organization (IP) that transport the products, but whose payment is made by the buyer. </p><p>  From January 1, 2012, for the calculation of VAT, accounting in <span>trading on the day of</span> shipment recognizes: </p><p>  - the date of their vacation to the buyer (organization or enterprise that transport products) if the seller does not transport goods; </p><p>  - the date of commencement of transportation of products in other cases. </p><p>  For the calculation of excise taxes, the day of shipment is still considered the date of their shipment from the warehouse or warehouse, completed in the proper manner. </p><p>  Accounting in trade as a result of the changes brought the payers another difficulty in organizing tax accounting.  In 2010, and then, as was said above, the day of shipment of goods was recognized as their leave from the warehouse, VAT tax data coincided with the turnover reflected on the loan.  The credit of <span>account 90,</span> in turn, was formed on the basis of the information contained in the invoices for the shipment of goods from the warehouse (taking into account the date of release of goods from the warehouse).  Based on these data, Accounting in trade and established the rules for determining the tax base for the calculation of income tax.  Now, in the accounting of the organization‚Äôs income, a clarification has been introduced that in other cases, the date of shipment should be recognized as the date of shipment.  Such a system is extremely inconvenient and in some cases obliges the organization to conduct additional tax accounting of the base for calculating VAT. </p><p>  Determining the date of shipment is very important in relation to exported goods.  For goods.  specific deadlines have been set for obtaining documentary evidence on the export of products outside the country (180 days from the start of shipment - for goods exported to the Member States of the Customs Union; 60 days - for goods exported to non-member states, during which, as establishes accounting in trade, payers have the right not to reflect sales turnover in the VAT declaration in the absence of such confirmation.To solve this problem, accounting in trade by the ‚Äúdate of shipment‚Äù must recognize  the date of transportation of the goods directly to the buyer, since shipping implies the movement of transport along a certain route.This definition applies to three taxes: VAT, income tax and excise taxes.As for the calculation of VAT, the organization has the right to prescribe one of two methods of calculation in the accounting policy : Based on the TTN-1 form (gr. 16) or CMR waybill (gr. 22) This presentation will help organizations simplify and clean up tax accounting.  In addition, the use of these innovations allows to significantly optimize the accounting of business entities, especially those engaged in export activities. </p>
