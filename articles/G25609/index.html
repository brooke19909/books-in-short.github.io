This radioactive cloud is named in this way because of the scientists noted external resemblance to the fruiting bodies of ordinary mushrooms, which can be found and collected in the forest.  But mushrooms in the folk art of various countries are symbols of fertility and vitality.  A nuclear mushroom, on the contrary, is a symbol of destruction and war. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nuclear mushroom" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/801545.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  However, the mushroom cloud is not only the distinguishing feature of nuclear and thermonuclear explosions that have occurred on earth.  It is also formed during other non-nuclear explosions of sufficient power, as well as during eruptions of large volcanoes, during severe fires or when meteorites fall on the soil.  Its height directly depends on the power of the explosion or impact that has occurred or produced, and on the quality of filling: substances used in the process. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  How is it formed and what is characterized by this phenomenon?  A nuclear mushroom is formed when a dust cloud is raised from the surface of the earth.  At the same time, the air heated by the explosion to certain <span>high temperatures</span> tends upward and swirls in a ring-like vortex.  The vortex pulls up behind itself and the ‚Äúleg‚Äù of the mushroom, which consists of dust and smoky masses and looks like a pillar.  And on the sides of the formed vortex, the air is already cooling and resembles the most ordinary cloud (there is condensation of steam in water droplets) or the ‚Äúcap‚Äù of the fungus.  Accompanying a ground-based <span>nuclear explosion, the</span> mushroom is thus one of the consequences of its production.  It is characteristic that during an explosion in water or in air, such a phenomenon does not occur. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nuclear explosion mushroom" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/801547.jpg" width="600"></div>

The nuclear mushroom is already a cumulus rain cloud that has developed strongly in height.  It, of course, has a mushroom shape (hat and leg).  It is known that with a powerful explosion (up to a megaton) it can be up to 20 kilometers in height!  From this cloud, if the explosion was of sufficient power, it usually rains that can extinguish the fires resulting from the explosion. </p><h2>  Radioactive cloud </h2><p>  It poses the greatest danger immediately after the explosion, nuclear and thermonuclear, carried out on the ground.  Particles of radioactive dust containing <span>harmful substances</span> act as condensates.  And water vapor settles on them, concentrating around in drops.  The cloud rises and cools.  Inside, droplets of water form, which fall on the soil down as radioactive rains (snow, hail are possible).  Such precipitation, fallen from a radioactive cloud-fungus, can cause significant harm to the national economy and pose a threat to all living things. </p><h2>  When is formed </h2><p>  A nuclear mushroom, as already mentioned, does not occur with all types of nuclear or thermonuclear explosions.  If they were carried out, for example, in outer space, deep underground or under water, as well as in the earth's atmosphere, then neither a mushroom nor a cloud will form. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nuclear explosion mushroom" class="if" height="476" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17472/801546.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ominous symbol </h2><p>  In modern literature and art, the nuclear mushroom is identified with the ominous symbol of war, and its image is included in some paintings of world painting as the embodiment of evil and threat to all living on planet Earth.  In fantastic literary works and films describing the future of the Earth after nuclear wars, this symbol is used by the authors quite often, and always in a negative and sinister way.  Indeed, nuclear evil has no future, but only ruins and the past, which people who survived as a result of disasters recall. </p>
