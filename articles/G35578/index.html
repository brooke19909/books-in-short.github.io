    <h2>  Hotel TT Hotels Hydros Club 4 *: reviews, disadvantages </h2><p>  <span><span>Experienced tourists know that there are no hotels without flaws.</span></span>  <span><span>Even in the most fashionable establishments you can find some flaws.</span></span>  <span><span>The TT Hotels Hydros Club 4 * hotel was no exception.</span></span>  <span><span>Reviews about him contain such negative comments:</span></span> </p><ul><li>  animators are rather indifferent towards the guests (they seem to do their job, but do not try to interact with the guests in any way); </li><li>  the reception is an open area, and, accordingly, no air conditioners or fans are provided here (while waiting for check-in and check-in, tourists have to languish from the heat); </li><li>  during thematic dinners, the menu is practically no different from the usual one (the only thing that distinguishes one dinner from another is the flags of different countries in the restaurant hall); </li><li>  in the bathroom you will not find either soap or shower gel (of all cosmetic accessories there is only liquid soap and toilet paper); </li><li>  the quality of cleaning in the rooms is far from ideal (sometimes it is limited only to making a bed and removing garbage); </li><li>  the restaurant menu presents too narrow an assortment of seafood, as for a seaside hotel; </li><li>  there is no free ice cream, which was especially a big chagrin for children; </li><li>  at night the noise of music coming from neighboring hotels or nightclubs interferes (the situation begins to subside only at four in the morning); </li><li>  sun loungers on the beach are so densely located that it is almost impossible to pass between them; </li><li>  Before checking in new guests, employees do not check the serviceability of equipment in the room (guests often find problems and have to wait for repairs); </li><li>  in most rooms it doesn‚Äôt catch wireless Internet (mainly this problem concerns the bungalow); </li><li>  the premises have long been in need of redecoration (the paint on the walls is stained and cracked in places); </li><li>  low-quality alcohol of local production (and the prices of imported drinks are unreasonably high); </li><li>  there are many small fish in the sea that painfully bite swimmers by the feet; </li><li>  there are practically no places for walking near the hotel, except for a narrow path by the sea, which for some reason is called the "promenade" (it is not illuminated); </li><li>  in stores in the hotel prices are two times higher than in urban outlets (it is better not to be too lazy and walk a few minutes to the center for shopping); </li><li>  there are no irons in the rooms and floors (apparently this is to ensure that guests go to the laundry room for a paid ironing service); </li><li>  few fruits on the buffet menu (and those that are not always tasty and fresh); </li><li>  even if you leave a tip to the maid, cleaning will still be superficial (the maximum you can count on is swans from towels on the bed); </li><li>  in rooms located in the bungalow, guests often notice ants; </li><li>  children's pools are located in an open area under the scorching sun (there are no green spaces or shades for shade); </li><li>  queues are always lined up for meat and fish dishes in the restaurant (however, if you do not want to waste time, you can still find many delicious dishes in the public domain). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Wide popularity among travelers earned the resort complex <span>TT Hotels Hydros Club 4 *</span> (Turkey).  This place is suitable for a secluded, romantic, family vacation and even for an incendiary pastime in the company of friends.  It is clean, comfortable, fun and tasty.  What else do you need to relax?  If you believe the tourists, the living conditions in this resort complex are not inferior (or maybe even superior) to similar parameters in five-star establishments. </p>
