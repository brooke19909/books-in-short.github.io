The name is quite loud and significant, but is it supported by some practical grounds and facts?  This will become our today's goal - to find out if there is something like that in the device, for which you can really love and appreciate it. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  In fact, the Highscreen Power Five Black Gray smartphone received the corresponding name for a reason.  If you translate the name into Russian verbatim, then we get a ‚Äúpowerful five‚Äù.  What is meant by it?  What kind of team is this and what elements does it consist of? </p>

    <p>  Most likely, the company's engineers had in mind the following list of the most powerful components: a display (to be more precise, its diagonal), a camera, speakers, design, performance.  For sure, this, of course, is not known to us, but, probably, it was.  On the other hand, experts who have truly impressive experience working with a wide variety of smartphones are referred to when referring to the name of the battery in our review.  You can quite logically become interested in what's extraordinary.  The answer will be very simple. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The capacity of the autonomous power supply in Highscreen Power Five 16 GB is five thousand mAh.  At this point, many users of devices running the Android operating system simply silently open their mouths and stand in this position until they come to their senses.  And they can easily be understood, because usually the corresponding devices have batteries, the capacity of which does not exceed 2,000 - 2,200 mAh.  It is possible that the name Power Five is precisely connected with this very parameter. </p><p>  Rate the performance of <span>Highscreen Power Five, an overview of</span> which is presented in the article, <strong> </strong>  can be different.  But we simply cannot recognize the authority of the company's engineers and do not pat them.  The fact is that the workers managed to accommodate such a capacious battery in a case whose thickness is only 10 millimeters.  This is truly worthy of respect.  That's what Highscreen fans like the brand for, most likely. </p><h2>  Brief description of the device </h2>

    <p>  One of the advantages of the phone is its screen matrix.  Many other models were manufactured using IPS technology.  But this time, the company's engineers decided to install instead of such an AMOLED matrix.  The decision is certainly controversial.  There are a huge number of nuances, advantages and disadvantages.  But now is not about that. </p><h2>  Hardware stuffing </h2>

    <p>  Inside the device you can find a processor with 4 cores.  This is a chip from Media Tek.  One should not rely especially on the processor.  Yes, it provides good performance, but still for the most demanding games, its power will not be enough.  Just recall that even the manufacturer himself talked about the main purpose of the presence of this chip.  If someone forgot or simply did not know, such a processor was installed so that the owner of the phone could work with fourth-generation cellular communications.  It is also often called LTE. </p><h2>  Memory </h2>

    <p>  The Highscreen Power Five phone, an overview of which can be found in this article, has a built-in only one and a half gigabytes of RAM.  This will not be enough.  And the camera has a resolution of not 13 megapixels, but some miserable 8. Although, perhaps for some it will be just right.  Well, our task is not to stop and not focus on what is little and what is much, but just to go forward. </p><p>  The device has already arrived on the Russian smartphone market.  Currently, its price is about sixteen thousand rubles.  A little earlier she was a thousand less.  And if the price rises further, then, most likely, sales of the device will fall.  Nevertheless, we have no choice but to follow the schedule and hope for the nobility of the company's managers. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  So, what is included in the package of delivery of our object of review?  Opening the packaging from the phone, we can find there a wired stereo headset that connects to a 3.5 mm jack.  This, of course, is not Beats headphones, but it will do.  Next is the network adapter.  A transformer that will lower the voltage to the required value. </p><p>  USB cable on one end and MicroUSB on the other.  Classics of the genre, and nothing more.  According to the standard, it is used as a means of charging (paired with a network adapter), but if desired (or directly necessary) it can also be used as a device for synchronization with a personal computer or laptop.  But the following two accessories a little surprised (in good terms) and pleased.  This is an OTG cable and a special case equipped with a window.  Unexpectedly, but nice. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The device has a rectangular shape, which is typical of all devices of the company.  One gets the impression that this is not just a feature of the line, but a real tradition, through which the company is unlikely to ever cross.  The edges of the smartphone are slightly beveled.  At the same time, the side faces are even.  The back surface turned out to be a bit sloping. </p><p>  The huge area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe front side of Highscreen Power Five, the review of which is available in this article, is occupied precisely by the display of our phone.  The developers of the device are constantly tricky, which is not abandoned this time.  More specifically, they reduced the glass frames.  And they did it in such a way that they began to seem very, very narrow if the screen is not highlighted.  In general, many experts agreed that such a feature looks practical and effective. </p><h2>  Front Panel </h2><p>  The front of the device is covered with glass made by Asahi Glass Dragontrail.  There is one very remarkable fact.  In fact, this company is a leader in the production of relevant elements.  She is even a member of the Mitsubishi group.  Therefore, you do not have to worry about the reliability and protection of the display, as well as the entire front panel.  Tests have repeatedly shown that even with the most active use in a few weeks, no chips or scratches appeared on the screen. </p><p>  There is <span>an oleophobic coating</span> on top of the glass <span>.</span>  It acts extremely effectively.  Even with good lighting, fingerprints will be very, very difficult to notice.  Not formed on the display and greasy plaque.  A finger on the touch screen in this regard moves quietly, easily and naturally.  In general, it's just a dream, not a reality. </p><h2>  Perimeter </h2><p>  A thin frame made of semi-gloss plastic is laid on it.  There is, of course, a matte metal edging.  Grinding is done along the edges.  Because of this, in bright sunlight, the phone will reflect ‚Äúbunnies‚Äù if you turn it at a certain angle.  To the end, the specialists were not able to clarify this issue, but there is an assumption that the metal component was equipped in order to enhance the antenna properties. </p><h2>  <span>Highscreen Power Five: review, reviews</span> and conclusion </h2><p>  Phone owners have repeatedly noted the high quality of communication.  The speaker does not wheeze, does not make noise, and the user himself on the other end of the wire will be heard clearly.  Pleased with a <span>neat appearance.</span>  It is pleasant, colorful, bright.  Good workmanship.  The screen shows excellent display quality. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings is the speaker volume.  In addition, the most demanding games will freeze, and there's nothing to be done about it.  Vibrating alert is not one of the most powerful.  You can still feel it in the autumn jacket, but not in the winter one. </p>
