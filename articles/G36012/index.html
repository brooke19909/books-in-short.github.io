    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  In Soloniki (more precisely, in the Sochi National Reserve) is located one of the famous natural attractions of Greater Sochi - the ‚ÄúMiracle-Beauty‚Äù gorge, which is a combination of unusual waterfalls and mountain landscapes.  The cleft in the mountains is so called by the name of the river, teeming with amazing waterfalls and pools.  In some places, rocks are bizarrely pierced and cut off by its waters.  Crowds of tourists and locals who want to enjoy the beauty of the gorge regularly gather here. </p><p>  Fans of thrills can go on a trip to the mountains in jeeps.  T. n.  Jeeping, which vacationers call very exciting and safe, is offered here everywhere.  Many travel, including with children. </p><p>  Not far from the resort village is located one of the mysteries of ancient history - <span>Volkonsky dolmen monolith.</span>  In the vicinity between Soloniki and Volkonka, you can also admire the ruins of the legendary Bagu fortress - an architectural monument of the fourth and fifth centuries.  In Soloniki there is a private stable, so those who wish can take a horse ride through the historical and picturesque places of Greater Sochi. </p><h2>  Treatment </h2><p>  Rest in Soloniki is considered healing.  In addition to plants that produce essential oils that are beneficial for the body, these places are also famous for healing water.  Not far from the resort are famous sources of mineral water distributed in the Russian Federation under the Lazarevskaya brand. </p><h2>  Where to eat? </h2><p>  One of the characteristic features of the resort, which many attribute to its advantages, is the availability of fairly low prices for accommodation and food.  Soloniki vacationers are among the most inexpensive Black Sea resorts. </p><p>  Catering establishments in the village are represented in small numbers, but for vacationers who come here annually, they are quite enough.  In one of the inexpensive cafes or dining rooms available on site, you can have a pretty tight meal.  According to reviews, the food here is very tasty, the cost of breakfast, lunch and dinner is quite affordable.  You can have breakfast for 150 rubles, lunch (4 dishes) - for 359-400 rubles. </p><h2>  Accommodation </h2><p>  The most popular accommodation option in Soloniki (Lazarevskoye) is the private sector.  It is represented by mini-hotels, guest houses, turnkey houses, vacationers also rent rooms in private houses.  The authors of the reviews claim that in Soloniki, without any problems, everyone can find housing to their taste, corresponding to their financial capabilities. </p><p>  The private sector in Soloniki is chosen not only to save money.  Such objects have a number of advantages over other accommodation options: a limited number of residents, the presence of a patio drowning in greenery.  According to vacationers, you can spend pleasant evening gatherings in a cozy gazebo or at the barbecue.  Children are provided with a playground, which greatly enriches their leisure time. </p><h2>  How to save on housing? </h2><p>  For those who plan to save on living, experienced vacationers are advised to pay attention to economy class rooms in private hotels and guest houses.  Here, for visitors, the minimum comfort is ensured (a common bathroom and a small living area), but the owners will not require a large fee from the guest.  Economy rooms are mainly used for overnight stays, and not for a comfortable stay.  The cost of living in economy class rooms in the private sector of Solonikov in Lazarevsky is called by many ridiculous. </p><h2>  To relax in comfort </h2><p>  For those who want to relax in a quality manner and not overpay, it is better to opt for a more profitable accommodation option, for example, standard rooms that have all the necessary amenities.  If you want to get maximum comfort at a reasonable price, you should choose a suite or junior suite.  This option of accommodation in private guest houses in Solonikov is the most expensive, but it assumes the presence of rather pleasant and attractive living conditions. </p><h2>  "Hotel by the sea" </h2><p>  This guest house is one of the most popular accommodation options in Thessaloniki.  It is located on the street of the same name with the village, at 18/4.  Distance to the sea is 600 m, a 5-minute drive - the popular resort of Lazarevskoye. </p>
