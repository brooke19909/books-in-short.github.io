Troubleshooting is the first thing to do.  There are many reasons for the unhealthy vibration of the machine.  Diagnostics should be started by eliminating simple problems that can be identified by a careful examination of the device. </p><h2>  Imbalance </h2><p>  What do experts recommend starting with finding out the reason for the mobility of the device?  To answer the question why the washing machine jumps during the spin cycle, you first need to check if the drum balance is disturbed.  This may be indicated by: </p><ul><li>  Stray linen after spinning into a single lump (for example, a duvet cover). </li><li>  For the selected mode, the maximum allowable weight of the laundry was not observed (the permitted load is indicated in the instruction manual of the device).  Not always the maximum calculated load of the washing machine corresponds to a single program. </li><li>  Things fill the drum by more than two-thirds. </li></ul><h2>  Shipping bolts not removed </h2><p>  This is a fairly common reason explaining why the washing machine jumps during the spin cycle.  It occurs when the device is installed independently, without contacting qualified craftsmen.  If the machine erases for the first time and ‚Äúwent dancing‚Äù, then with absolute probability we can say that during installation the transportation bolts were not removed. </p>

    <p>  They are installed at the factory and are designed to ensure reliable fixation of the tank during transportation.  Their mounting locations are described in the attached instructions.  Usually there are four. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Not level setting </h2><p>  There is another common reason why the washing machine jumps during the spin cycle.  Revealing it is simple.  You need to swing the car in idle mode.  If it succumbed easily, it means that errors were made during installation.  This needs to be fixed, preferably using a building level. </p><h2>  Stuck objects between the drum and the laundry tub </h2><p>  Why does the washing machine jump during the spin cycle if it was installed exactly according to the instructions?  There is another reason that is not difficult to fix.  A simple flashlight can help.  They need to light the drum well, gradually scrolling it.  Specialists easily remove foreign objects that are stuck deep in the machine. </p><h2>  Damage to shock absorbers or springs </h2><p>  A less desirable option for why the washing machine jumps during spin cycle is for technical reasons.  It will not work to fix them without a specialist.  In this case, the vibration will be accompanied by a characteristic knock in the drum body of the machine, even a possible rattle.  The same sounds can indicate the wear of the counterweight mounts or itself. </p>

    <p>  This malfunction can be diagnosed independently.  To do this, remove the cover of the machine and check the described elements.  If they are suitable, then there are two reasons for the jumps of the unit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Damage to the motor or marriage </h2><p>  So, you have already looked through everything, but still have not figured out why the washing machine jumps during the spin cycle?  Technical malfunctions of the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the device or an error in its release may be the main cause of the breakdown.  Here it is necessary to recall that household appliances that have not reached the warranty period cannot be opened independently.  To fix all the problems you need to contact the warranty workshop or the store where the equipment was bought. </p><h2>  Home Troubleshooting </h2><p>  In most cases, the cause of the problem is easily fixed.  First of all, you need to decide where to put the device and how to fix it.  If the washing machine jumps during the spin cycle, you should strictly adhere to the algorithm of actions to eliminate this trouble.  When the device vibrates due to a simple imbalance, the actions may be as follows: </p><ul><li>  turn off the washing mode and disconnect the machine from the network; </li><li>  it is necessary to open the door of the machine, and if this cannot be done, emergency water must be drained; </li><li>  after the door is unlocked, the drum should be freed from laundry; </li><li>  it is recommended to lay half of the extracted laundry (straightened and no more than 2/3); </li><li>  close the machine door and start the appropriate mode. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fix if the washing machine jumps during the spin cycle" class="if" height="248" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1295423.jpg" width="350"></div></li></ul><p>  If the cause of vibration is improper installation, then you need to: </p><ul><li>  dismantle the automatic machine, having previously disconnected it from electricity, water supply and sewage; </li><li>  carefully level the surface occupied by the machine, preferably with a building level; </li><li>  put the device in place and now, by scrolling the legs, adjust the horizontal level; </li><li>  in case of slippery flooring, put anti-slip or anti-vibration mats under the machine. </li></ul><p>  If the cause of an unhealthy vibration is a stuck object, you can try to pull it out yourself, picking it up with something.  In case of failure, it is worth calling a specialist, since the machine will have to be disassembled almost to the ground. </p><p>  Worn out springs or shock absorbers must be replaced.  They are not repairable.  It is only necessary to take into account that even if one of the <span>shock absorbers is</span> serviceable <span>,</span> both must be <span>replaced</span> , since the load must be distributed evenly.  If you have the skills to work with a different tool and the experience of its use, you can find a diagram of the upcoming work in professional magazines and act independently.  Otherwise, you need to contact the home appliance repair company and entrust this work to the master.  In the same scenario, it is necessary to act if the bearings are broken.  By the way, they have a service life of no more than 5-6 years. </p>

    <p>  If the car makes jumps due to a malfunction of the counterweight, the following steps must be performed. </p><p>  Depending on the brand and model of the machine, using a screwdriver, pliers or wrenches, you need to remove the top cover and inspect the counterweight.  This is a special weighting agent, which is usually made of concrete or cast iron.  The second half is almost above the floor.  If the weightings are loose, tighten them.  In case of failure, they must be replaced.  If the concrete weighting agent is deformed, it can also be changed to a similar one. </p><p>  Well, of course, if the vibration is caused by a breakdown of the electric motor, then there is no way to do without a specialist.  Consultation with him will help resolve the issue of whether a machine is maintainable or if a new one needs to be purchased. </p><h2>  Interesting nuances </h2><p>  Of course, you need to take into account that all the machines vibrate slightly.  These are the eternal laws of physics.  But such a technique has its own laws.  For example, it is noticed that narrow machines are more prone to vibration than devices of standard width.  This is easily explained: the support area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe narrowed machine is less, therefore, it will have poor stability, which causes excessive vibration.  Plus, in these devices there are special narrowed drums, in them the laundry is easier to knock in a lump, which will imbalance the work and also lead to vibration.  Anti-slip or anti-vibration litter must be placed under these machines.  They dampen excessive vibration. </p>

    <p>  Before buying a machine, you need to consult a specialist outlet and find out what material the linen tank is made of.  For example, metal containers are very loud in operation, especially during the spin cycle.  While plastic drums are considered more stable and quiet.  And modern units with linen tanks that do not touch the body work completely silently. </p>
