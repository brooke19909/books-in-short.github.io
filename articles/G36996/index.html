Reviews indicate the following disadvantages of the hotel: </p><ul><li>  Internet does not work well (normal signal only in the lobby area); </li><li>  the hotel has long been in need of repair (at least cosmetic); </li><li>  the rooms have an unpleasant smell of dampness; </li><li>  the shower cabin is very cramped; </li><li>  many of the rooms face the wall of the neighboring building (for relocation require a surcharge of 20 euros); </li><li>  cleaning leaves much to be desired (floors do not wash); </li><li>  cramped rooms; </li><li>  entrance to the territory is free, and therefore there are always many outsiders; </li><li>  the hotel is home to many local tourists who are accommodated in the best rooms (the rest - according to the residual principle); </li><li>  in the immediate vicinity of the hotel there is a mosque, and therefore at 5 o‚Äôclock in the morning you will be awakened by the sounds of prayer; </li><li>  there is practically no animation (neither adult nor child); </li><li>  the hotel is far from urban and tourist infrastructure; </li><li>  in this hotel you can not count on disinterested help from the staff (money is required for any service or consultation); </li><li>  the staff is poorly fluent in English and Russian; </li><li>  even if the hotel is empty, guests are not settled before 14:00; </li><li>  waiting for registration, you will not be able to hand over things to the left luggage office, and therefore you will have to throw them in the lobby or constantly guard; </li><li>  there are a limited number of umbrellas on the beach, and those that are are old, torn and very small; </li><li>  with girls relaxing in a hotel without male accompaniment, employees can afford familiarity; </li><li>  the mini club is very dirty; </li><li>  from about mid-October, when the high season ends, the range of dishes is significantly reduced, as well as the list of services. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The first thing to say about this hotel is its stardom.  Despite the fact that nominally it is considered the ‚Äúfive‚Äù, in fact it is no more than the ‚Äúfour‚Äù.  You can also do some discount hotel, given the low prices for accommodation and services.  Despite the fact that the staff is generally friendly, do not count on participation and help.  For the slightest service you will require an impressive surcharge.  Huge questions for cleanliness.  Room cleaning is purely symbolic.  You don‚Äôt even have to leave a tip - a waste of money that will not force the maid to wipe the floors or brush off the dust. </p><p>  It is worth noting that this hotel is aimed at German and Turkish vacationers, and therefore employees speak only these languages ‚Äã‚Äã(although they also gradually learn Russian).  Accordingly, more attention is paid to tourists from these countries.  What the hotel cannot be blamed for is the quality of food.  Here is just a five-star status.  Various fish and meat dishes, side dishes, vegetables, fruits, desserts - all this and much more can be found in the buffet menu. </p><p>  Given the specifics of this hotel, we can say that it is aimed at lovers of a calm and quiet holiday.  That is why pensioners mainly live here, as well as families with small children.  Entertainment here is at a low level, animation is practically absent. </p>
