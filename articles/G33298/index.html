Beautiful nature, cheap shopping and European service are the ‚Äúthree pillars‚Äù on which the tourism business in this country stands.  Villa Lazovic 3 * (Montenegro, Budva) is an example of how you can inexpensively relax in a good resort. </p><h2>  Hotel or villa </h2><p>  The modern tourist world has become much more diverse than it was 20-30 years ago.  During this period, new corners of the Mediterranean and Adriatic were "discovered", which for a long time remained in the shadow of large and popular resorts.  This happened with Budva.  After Montenegro became an independent country, the improvement of the coast and its development began.  New hotels appeared, and many villa owners converted their property to receive tourists. </p><p>  As some travelers say, you can‚Äôt demand the same service and amenities from the apartments in the villa as from the hotel.  Villa Lazovic cat a 3 * (Montenegro, Budva), although it has the category of three stars, is actually a three-story house in which rooms are rented. </p>

    <p>  As a rule, bed linen is changed in such mini-hotels once a week, towels are changed every other day, and cleaning is done every three days.  Expect more from the villa, where the staff "one-two and miscalculated" should not be. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tourists, expressing their dissatisfaction with the quality of service in Villa Lazovic 3 * (Montenegro, Budva), forget that: </p><ul><li>  This is not a hotel, but just an apartment house. </li><li>  The cost of living here is much less, and you do not need to demand much from the staff. </li><li>  The rooms here are small, so you should not expect a separate bath and toilet. </li></ul><p>  For a budget type of vacation in Montenegro, as noted by the reviews about the Lazovich 4 * hotel in Budva, it is quite suitable, since it has a lot of other advantages that overlap shortcomings in everyday life. </p><h2>  Villa Benefits </h2><p>  Choosing a resort, travelers primarily look at options for hotels located as close to the beach as possible or having their own plot on the coast.  In Budva, the coastal zone stretches for almost 11 km, and most of it belongs to the city, and the rest to its surroundings.  In terms of location and other pleasant things, the Hotel Villa Lazovic 3 * (Montenegro, Budva) has the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  Only 500 meters to the sea, and by coincidence, this is one of the best and budget beaches in the city. </li><li>  The villa is located in a quiet area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBudva, and although there is a highway nearby, traffic noise is not heard.  According to tourists' reviews of the <span>hotel Villa</span> Lazovic 3 *, only bird singing breaks the silence here. </li><li>  The nearest restaurants and minimarkets are only 20-25 meters away, and you can walk slowly to the Old Town with its sights for about 30 minutes. </li><li>  Having gone beyond the gate of the small garden of the villa and having walked only 10 m, you can catch a bus going either to the center of Budva or to the nearest towns. </li></ul>

Accommodation prices attract those who cannot afford expensive apartments, but want to see the country.  In the end, as most guests of the villa write, they only come to their room for the night. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Small hotels are good in that peace and quiet are guaranteed to every tenant, because they have only a few rooms.  Here and in Villa Lazovic 3 * in Montenegro (Budva) there are 12 of them: </p><ul><li>  Double standards - 4. </li><li>  Triple rooms - 7 rooms. </li><li>  One apartment for four. </li></ul><p>  Each room has a balcony, except for the first floor, where there is a common terrace for all guests.

    <p>  Shower and toilet in each room.  Some guests in their reviews of the Hotel Villa Lazovic 3 * in Montenegro (Budva) note some minimalism in the design of the premises, but at the same time specify that everything necessary for living there is provided. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  There are cities that people go to for their sights, for example, Paris, Rome or Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãand there are resorts that accept those who prefer a beach holiday and nightly entertainment.  Budva surprisingly combines both. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The beaches of the city are fully equipped for a comfortable pastime on them.  There are: </p><ul><li>  chaise lounges and umbrellas (paid); </li><li>  toilets and showers; </li><li>  bars and cafes; </li><li>  equipment for sports or water sports; </li><li>  children's corners for games. </li></ul><p>  There are 6 beaches in Budva, so you can choose any, especially since the distance from one to the other is small.  Directly not far from the villa "Lazovich" is the main beach of the city of Slavyansk, at which the prices for services are the most affordable. </p>

    <p>  You should immediately be prepared that the pebble and sand cover, but the pebbles are so small that many tourists don‚Äôt even take sun loungers, but lay down on towels.  The entrance to the sea is quite gentle, but for couples with young children it is better to drive a couple of stops to Guvanza, another free beach.  It is small, but the sand prevails there, with which the kids like to play, and entering the water is the safest. </p><p>  If you believe the reviews of vacationers, the only drawback of the Slavic beach is its crowdedness from July to the end of August, and the most beautiful and well-maintained is Mogren, divided into two parts by a cliff protruding into the sea.  No matter how many people think, but all the guests of the Lazovic villa acknowledge that the Adriatic coast in Budva is the most beautiful and romantic. </p><h2>  The shops </h2><p>  Perhaps 30 years ago it was considered sufficient to bring a souvenir to commemorate a trip abroad, but <span>modern travelers,</span> when they enter a new country, compare the prices of consumer goods and products with those that are accepted at home. </p><p>  When tourists write reviews about the Hotel Villa Lazovic 3 * (Montenegro, Budva), they cannot but mention the new Slavic ‚Äútradition‚Äù called ‚Äúdo shopping‚Äù.  Moreover, their advice comes down to the following: </p><ul><li>  Budva has the largest assortment of souvenirs and pleasant things that are usually bought as a keepsake, although their prices are an order of magnitude higher than in neighboring towns. </li><li>  Clothing stores offer a large selection of local or Serbian knitwear, which is of high quality at an affordable price.  To attract tourists, they often arrange sales, and then the cost of fashionable things is purely symbolic. </li><li>  Oddly enough, Turkish leather products are often cheaper here than in the country of origin. </li><li>  Very popular with couples with children are shops with children's clothes and shoes.  The latter are especially in demand.  Children's shoes in Montenegro are of very high quality, all models come with an orthopedic insole and foot support, and taking into account the frequent sales, they can cost as low as 20 ‚Ç¨. </li><li>  In the Old Town there are boutiques with branded clothing, many pavilions with products of local companies.  Prices are different, but the quality is noticeably different from what domestic shopping centers offer. </li></ul>

    <p>  Drawing a conclusion from other people's reviews, we can say that shopping in Budva is a very profitable part of the rest, which Russian tourists use to their full potential. </p><h2>  Things to do in Budva </h2><p>  How to spend time, each of the guests of the villa "Lazovic" decides for himself, especially since Budva gives a choice: </p><ul><li>  Architectural attractions, such as the ancient citadel or the Kosmach fortress.  Entrance to the Citadel is paid, only 2-3 euros, but a trip to it is worth it.  A stunning view of the city, a panoramic restaurant, a museum, frequent performances by artists and musicians - all this awaits tourists here. </li><li>  A true pilgrimage can be made to the churches and monasteries of Budva.  There are a lot of them, but the most famous are the monasteries Podmayne and Stanievichi, the church of St.  John and others. </li><li>  Gambling people are waiting for casinos, and lovers of nightlife - bars and discos. </li><li>  Both children and their parents will love the local water park and themed Dino Park. </li><li>  You can‚Äôt ignore the flea market, where you can find Bohemian glass and handmade dolls, ancient coins and watches, jewelry and much more.  Located near the archaeological museum. </li></ul>
