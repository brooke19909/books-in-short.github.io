Work on most products begins with the implementation of vertical patterns with knitting needles.  Collars, cuffs, fringes and other details are most often knitted using a vertical pattern.  Such patterns can also be the general background of the entire canvas.  Vertical ornaments look great on napkins, bedspreads, rugs, cloaks and other works of skilled craftsmen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.allfreeknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting vertical knitting patterns" class="if uuid-3046548" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3046548.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of Yarn </h2><p>  For knitting products, it is necessary to apply certain types of yarn.  To knit vertical patterns with knitting needles, for each model, depending on its purpose, you need to select the appropriate threads.  For light blouses, dresses, napkins, openwork shawls, it is recommended to give preference to thin threads, for sweaters, hats, scarves and other warm things, thicker yarn is used.  The following classification of threads: </p><ul><li>  Woolen </li><li>  half-woolen; </li><li>  synthetic; </li><li>  cotton; </li><li>  home-made wool; </li><li>  mohair. </li></ul><h2>  The necessary preparation of threads for knitting </h2><p>  On the eve of the purchased yarn must be prepared for work.  In no case can it be immediately rewound into balls and start knitting, since the finished product will be threatened with deformation.  Knitted vertical patterns after washing can stretch out a lot, and the product will become several sizes larger than expected.  To prevent this from happening, you must do the following procedure: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Pour water thirty-forty degrees into the container. </li><li>  Put soap in it and use liquid soap. </li><li>  Beat the foam as much as possible. </li><li>  Dip the threads in water and wash them gently. </li><li>  Washing should consist in gentle push-ups. </li><li>  Rinse the yarn thoroughly in warm water. </li><li>  Dry completely. </li><li>  Sew thread into balls. <div class="photo" data-original="cckittenknits.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful vertical knitting patterns" class="if uuid-3046538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3046538.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Knitting from old things </h2><p>  You can make vertical patterns with knitting needles from old knitwear.  To do this, it is necessary to separate the pockets, buttons, zippers, collars, all elements of the decor.  Then spread the product at the seams to make separate parts.  In each detail, find the end of the thread (it is usually located on top near the neck) and completely dissolve the knitting by winding the released threads in skeins.  It is necessary to pay attention to the fact that knitwear according to the raglan type open from the bottom up, since knitting started from the collar.  Wash the skeins of yarn in the same way with new threads and wind them into balls.  A newly knitted model will not yield to beauty an item that was made from new yarn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.knittingstitchpatterns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Openwork vertical knitting pattern description" class="if uuid-3046521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3046521.jpg"></div><h2>  Elastic </h2><p>  Simple vertical knitting patterns include elastic.  It is used for cuffs of sleeves and socks, the lower edge of the product and knitting the neck.  Elastic band can also serve as the main pattern.  It is performed by various techniques.  It is proposed to consider some of the most common gum. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Plain gum.  It knits according to the principle: two front and two wrong loops (you can knit 1 x 1, 3 x 3, etc.). The more loops alternate, the wider the stripes.  Follow the next rows as the loops look. </li><li>  English gum.  First row knit alternately with the front and wrong loops.  Start the second row with the front loop, then double crochet, remove one loop without knitting.  The third and all subsequent ones should be crocheted as follows: the double crochet should be crocheted with the right crochet, then crochet again and remove one loop. </li><li>  <span>French gum.</span>  This vertical knitting pattern in the description looks like this.  First, knit two wrong loops, then two crossed front ones (the second loop is knitted first, and then the first).  The second row begins with two crossed purl, then two facial loops are knitted.  Further, the knitting pattern continues according to a similar principle. </li><li>  Polish gum.  The first row and all subsequent odd rows alternate two front and two wrong loops.  Knit even rows with two faces and one wrong side. <div class="photo" data-original="www.dreamstime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rubber band pattern" class="if uuid-3046516" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3046516.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Embossed Rubber </h2><p>  This is a beautiful pattern that can decorate a hat, scarf, sweater, sweater, pullover, cardigan and other warm things that will warm you in the cold winter.  It can be used for clothing items or for the main fabric.  A step-by-step instruction is as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  The rapport consists of twenty-seven loops (a multiple of 6 + 1) plus two hem. </li><li>  The first row - one front, two wrong, four front. </li><li>  Knit the second row according to the pattern as the loops look. </li><li>  The third row - four persons., Two out., One persons. </li><li>  Starting from the fifth row, repeat the pattern from the first row. </li></ol><h2>  Track </h2><p>  This openwork pattern with knitting needles allows even a beginner to knit a vertical track.  The pattern is used for such products as a blouse, pullover, cardigan, skirt, etc. Like all vertical stripes, the pattern can be used as a decorative addition to the main knitting.  A step-by-step instruction is as follows: </p><ol><li>  In the first row, one wrong side is sewn, then the front, then the wrong side loop is again crocheted, the three crochet stitches are knitted together and the crochet is again crocheted. </li><li>  The second and all subsequent even rows are knitted according to the pattern as the loops look. </li><li>  The pattern is repeated from the first row. </li></ol><h2>  Delicate lace </h2><p>  It is preferable to knit a vertical openwork pattern with knitting needles from thin cotton or synthetic yarns.  It is perfect for blouses, tunics, dresses.  It is worth noting that the pattern shines through, so it‚Äôs worth sewing a cover under it or using it as decorative inserts in the product.  It should be knitted according to the proposed pattern: </p><ol><li>  The rapport consists of ten loops plus two hem. </li><li>  The first row - ten facial loops (knit all the loops of the row with facial). </li><li>  The second row - ten purl stitches (knit all the stitches of the row purl). </li><li>  Third row - three front loops alternate with two crochets (front crochet), then remove two loops on the right knitting needle, knit the next three together with the front and stretch them into two removed loops.  Then knit two facial loops that alternate with two crochets. </li><li>  Knit the fourth row with facial loops. </li><li>  Repeat pattern from the first row. </li></ol><h2>  Pigtail strip </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.studioknitsf.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting pattern with stripes vertical" class="if uuid-3046544" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3046544.jpg"></div><p>  A knitting pattern with vertical stripes in the form of a delicate pigtail can be used for any product.  The pattern is suitable for cotton thin yarn, as well as for models designed for the cool season.  The work is not particularly difficult, so it can be easily mastered even by beginners. </p><ol><li>  Rapport can be calculated independently.  The number of loops must be a multiple of a constant number.  A pigtail can pass on every third, fifth, tenth, etc. loop.  The more loops will be between the strips, the less often they will pass on the finished canvas.  In this case, it is proposed to consider the pigtail on the fifth loop. </li><li>  The first row of knit facial loops. </li><li>  Knit the second row with purl loops. </li><li>  Start the third row with four front loops, then remove one loop without knitting, continue until the end of the row. </li><li>  The fourth row to start with four wrong loops, remove one without knitting. </li><li>  The fifth row is knit all over with facial loops. </li><li>  Repeat the pattern from the second row. </li></ol><h2>  Vertical balls </h2><p>  Knitting vertical patterns with knitting needles looks great on different models of clothing.  The balls located on the lines will be very original and attractive.  This pattern is suitable for warm clothes, for its execution should choose medium or thick threads.  If six or half-wool is too thin, it is necessary to knit in several threads.  Knitting instructions look like this: </p><ol><li>  The rapport consists of twenty loops plus two hem. </li><li>  Knit the first row with one front and two wrong loops. </li><li>  Knit the second row as the loops look. </li><li>  The third row - one front, two wrong, then the ‚Äúball‚Äù (five loops should be made from one loop, alternating three facial with two crochets), two wrong. </li><li>  Knit the fourth row with nine face and one wrong side. </li><li>  The fifth and sixth rows are knitted according to the pattern. </li><li>  Seventh row - one person., Two out., Five together.., Two out. </li><li>  From the eighth to tenth rows, knit as the loops look. </li><li>  Eleventh row - from one front to make five loops (two faces., One out., Two faces.). </li><li>  The twelfth row - two persons., One out., Seven facial. </li><li>  Thirteenth and fourteenth knit according to the pattern. </li><li>  Fifteenth row knit five stitches together front. </li><li>  From the sixteenth to the eighteenth row, knit as the loops look. </li><li>  Repeat pattern from the first row. </li></ol><h2>  Vertical gyrus </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wave patterns" class="if uuid-3046530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3046530.jpg"></div><p>  This is a very beautiful vertical knitting pattern, which is suitable for products of any seasonality.  It makes wonderful sweaters, pullovers, jumpers, dresses, capes, hats, etc. If you knit summer clothes, you need to take thin yarn, for winter models thick or medium threads are recommended.  Such a pattern can also be used as a decoration for clothing parts (to process the bottom of the entire product or sleeves, collar, etc.).  The step-by-step instruction looks like this: </p><ol><li>  The rapport consists of thirty-two loops plus two hem. </li><li>  1, 3, 5 and 7 rows are knitted with four front and two wrong loops. </li><li>  The second and all subsequent even rows are knitted as the loops look. </li><li>  9, 11, 13, 23, 25 and 27 rows are knitted with one front and two wrong loops. </li><li>  15, 17, 19 and 21 rows - one person., Two out., Four persons., Two out., Three front loops. </li><li>  Starting from the twenty-ninth row, repeat the pattern from the first row. </li></ol><h2>  Openwork mesh </h2><div class="photo" data-original="purlavenue.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vertical mesh pattern" class="if uuid-3046501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3046501.jpg"></div><p>  This pattern is suitable for summer products, because it resembles a mesh.  It can be used as a decoration for model details or the main canvas.  Such dresses, blouses, tunics and shawls occupy a leading position in modern fashion.  The description of the openwork vertical pattern with knitting needles is as follows: </p><ul><li>  rapport is irrelevant; </li><li>  the first row is knitted with facial loops; </li><li>  the second row is made with purl loops; </li><li>  the third row begins with two front loops knitted together, then the yarn is thrown, this continues until the end of the row; </li><li>  the fourth row consists entirely of purl loops; </li><li>  the pattern is repeated from the third row. </li></ul><p>  Knits are distinguished by their practicality.  They look very advantageous in the summer in the form of openwork models or nets.  Warm products from thick types of yarn or mohair look no less attractive.  If you learn to do it yourself, any mods will be delighted to see the original and unique new thing.  In addition, knitting calms the nervous system.  Therefore, you should stock up on threads and boldly get to work, the result will greatly exceed the effort expended. </p>
