Many (we can say, most) choose this particular credit institution, although there are many others.  Most likely, this happens because other financial institutions provide funds on even less favorable terms. </p><p>  According to statistics, more than seventy percent of workers and pensioners choose the leader of the banking sector, the country's oldest financial institution.  Reviews on Sberbank loans are most often found on the Internet.  Most often they are of a business or fact-finding character, sometimes they contain complaints, which will be described below, and very rarely - sincere gratitude for the fact that people were financially supported in a difficult time for them. </p>

    <h2>  From the history </h2><p>  The activities of the Savings Bank began back in 1841, and during the existence of this financial organization, many interesting events took place.  Already in 1895 in Russia there were 3875 <span>savings banks,</span> about two million savings books.  In 1993, people started using Sberbank ATMs, in 2008 - using an online service, in 2010 - reviews about Sberbank loans for the first time wrote about the cancellation of all fees for a loan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, the bank is not only engaged in lending to the population.  All these years, he continued to grow, developed, surprised customers with more and more new technologies.  Now there is a well-developed remote control that helps to perform operations with cards and accounts.  A variety of offers to customers are regularly replenished regarding cards, deposits, brokerage services, mutual funds, insurance programs.  However, lending occupies a significant place in the bank. </p><h2>  Decor </h2><p>  Reviews of Sberbank on loans indicate that the list of loan products provided by this financial institution is expanding, various promotions for customers are held, and favorable offers are being received.  Opportunities in recent years are simply fantastic.  It is enough to open the website of Sberbank, make an application, attach documents, the list of which is indicated there, and you do not even need to go anywhere from the office or from home. </p><p>  The application will be considered and, most likely, accepted.  It remains only to receive the cash provided by Sberbank.  Customer reviews of loans are written by different people.  Someone needs extra money for consumer purposes (for example, to buy furniture), someone needs to improve their living conditions (with a pension of nine thousand rubles, it‚Äôs impossible to even change the heating batteries without outside investments, for example), someone wants to give the child a fee education ... And almost everyone helps Sberbank to endure difficulties. </p>

    <h2>  About consumer loans </h2><p>  You can take a consumer loan without collateral or guarantee for absolutely any amount up to one and a half million rubles from fifteen thousand.  The term can also be any - up to five years from three months, and this is determined by the Sberbank depositor.  Customer reviews of loans indicate rates starting at 14.9 percent per annum.  The simplest documents will be needed: a questionnaire, a statement of income, a passport and a copy of the work book.  If the salary is transferred to the Sberbank account, then you will not need anything other than an identity card.  The amount received can be used for absolutely any purpose: household appliances, car, travel, apartment repair. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you need an amount from one and a half million rubles to three million, you can not do without a guarantee, and such an application can also be issued online.  In this case, documents are needed both for the person applying for a consumer loan and for the co-borrower (just as accurately: a questionnaire, passport, a copy of the work book and a statement of income).  If the salary is credited to a card or Sberbank account, you only need a passport.  Citizens under the age of eighteen and who have crossed the line of seventy-five years by the time of repayment of the debt cannot issue such a loan.  The loan term can be adjusted from three months to 5 years, but the interest rate is higher - from 19.5 percent per annum.  Within two days, the application will be considered, and if the applicant for a loan is a client of Sberbank, then this period is also reduced. </p>

    <h2>  To buy an apartment </h2><p>  If the decision to grant a loan by the bank is made positive, cash can be obtained at any branch, there is nothing easier than taking a <span>loan from Sberbank.</span>  Reviews say that just repaying this debt, like any other, is difficult.  However, there is nothing to do, especially if you need to buy housing.  There are very few people in the country who have made such a purchase without the participation of financial institutions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Sberbank willingly helps to realize such a grandiose plan.  The interest rate here is slightly lower - 14.5 percent per annum, but much depends on the size of the initial capital, as well as the term of this type of lending.  The maturity of this debt is up to thirty years.  A loan can be any from forty-five thousand rubles.  Documents for obtaining a loan need exactly the same as those listed above. </p><h2>  For young </h2><p>  Young families will have to additionally attach a child‚Äôs and marriage certificate to this package of documents, as well as a certificate of maternity capital if the family participates in the mortgage program.  And then you just need to apply for a loan to Sberbank.  Mortgage <span>loans</span> collect numerous <span>reviews</span> , since this type of lending is very popular in recent years.  You can submit an online application, which will be considered in two days, then notifying the client of further actions. </p><p>  If the decision is positive, a mortgage loan is granted, and the client immediately becomes the owner of the selected housing.  Regular promotions are held for housing loans in Sberbank: you can get good discounts on the rate on this loan, the size of the initial capital can be reduced to 15 percent.  The term of such a loan is from one year to five years, the amount - from forty-five thousand to five million rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Subsidiary farm </h2><p>  People who are engaged in subsidiary farming can also qualify for a consumer loan.  Such a loan has subsidies at the interest rate at the expense of budget funds.  A loan is issued for a maximum of three hundred thousand rubles, if the contract is concluded for a period of up to two years, and seven hundred thousand rubles, if the contract is five-year. </p><p>  The borrower must be over 21 years old and under 75 years old at the time of conclusion of the contract.  Recently, Sberbank has been issuing such loans to individuals quite often.  Reviews say that the design is simple, no special documents are required.  On the site you need to fill out a questionnaire, wait for a decision, then get money in any department. </p><h2>  Credit Reviews </h2><p>  The reviews mention reduced interest rates, an <span>individual approach to each client,</span> and a minimum of documents is noted.  There are no hidden payments and commissions, early repayment of debt - both full and partial - is allowed, this can be done at any time, by a simple statement.  Reviews are also often noted: a loan at Sberbank can be repaid using the Sberbank Online system even from mobile applications.  There is a car payment service.  They use a mobile bank, and terminals, and ATMs. </p><p>  A cash loan can be obtained by all citizens who are 21 years old, pensioners and workers.  Special offers for military personnel - with a special program.  A soldier can receive a maximum amount of one million rubles for a period of up to five years at 15.5 percent per annum.  This amount can be not only an additional payment for the purchase of housing, but also be spent on any other purpose, which is often written about reviews. </p>

    <h2>  Refinancing a loan at Sberbank </h2><p>  An individual and a client of this bank who find themselves in a difficult life situation should be helped to reduce the amount of their principal debt.  Sberbank does this for people with the active support of the state.  However, reviews say that such shares meet hidden internal resistance from bank employees.  The timing of such stocks is usually very limited, and people who apply for refinancing wait for a decision so long that the time for the stock ends.  Even submitting such an application is difficult, because they do not take it in all departments.  The people have two explanations for such delays: Sberbank sabotages the government‚Äôs decision (and so that clients do not blame the bank, but the authorities - they don‚Äôt give enough money, everyone doesn‚Äôt have enough), or the bank‚Äôs policy is not thought out and the employees are not quick.  No one, of course, believes in the latter.  Sabotage is suspected. </p><p>  There are a lot of such reviews on the bank‚Äôs website, and we must admit that they respond to them quickly, intelligently, and smoothly.  However, the testimony is confused even on their own site.  For example: a loan is given to pay off a mortgage debt at a third-party bank, and loans taken from Sberbank are not refinanced.  This should not be, judging by the description of the conditions of the action.  In a word, to refuse an application, there will always be some reason. </p><p>  There are many failures.  There are practically no reviews on positive results.  On this issue, basically only resentment.  Either the employer of the client will not like it (of which Sberbank knows absolutely nothing), then the approval of the application will drag out ... There are a lot of reasons.  There are literally a few positive reviews on this issue, and frankly, they don‚Äôt really want to believe them.  There are even accusations that the bank itself does not personally understand the declared refinancing service.  This is what the reviews say. </p>

    <h2>  Credit insurance </h2><p>  Sberbank has one more weak link in its work.  There are no positive reviews about the return of insurance.  And in many cases they are obliged to repay it - with early repayment of a loan, for example.  This often does not happen.  It seems that by any means the bank needs to achieve that the client has this money taken forever.  And if you imagine that the main part of the clientele is pensioners who, due to insurmountable circumstances, were forced to borrow, who were starving, but repaid debt much earlier than the due date, because the old upbringing does not allow you to live on other people's money, the picture is very eloquent.  To take away from the pensioner an unfortunate couple of thousand rubles, which he would have had enough for bread, is a mortal sin.  Reviews write about this in 2017. A loan at Sberbank cost many at least the time spent, lost money and increased pressure from the breakdown. </p><p>  In 2017, several very unusual stories were described.  This applies to the fact that insurance is literally imposed on customers, although this cannot be done without the client‚Äôs wishes.  First, they force him to agree to an exhausting promise from one employee to another under the pretext of a non-working program, then they still calculate the loan with insurance, and when a person begins to resent, they simply refuse to grant him a loan.  This situation occurred according to almost the same scenario in many cities very distant from each other. </p><p>  Is that Sberbank‚Äôs policy demonstrated in all its glory?  In one of the cases, the client was not too lazy to go to court, in which Sberbank lost and had to, by court decision, significantly reduce the penalty that the client organized by his own actions.  Moreover, even without submitting an appeal, the bank decided not to comply, demanded the issuance of the initial amount, and then blocked the client's card.  On the Sberbank website, this review is ignored, although it is answered by many others. </p>

Sberbank Credit Momentum terms are good for those who are looking for a good loan and need money. </p><p>  Naturally, each offer has its pros and cons.  <span><span>The card is issued quickly, it has a grace period of fifty days, the account is serviced for free, the credit limit is quite high, there is auto payment and free SMS notification, you can bind the card to electronic wallets.</span></span>  <span><span>Also, as noted by the reviews, ‚ÄúCredit Momentum‚Äù (Sberbank) gives privileges and discounts from the payment system of partners.</span></span>  <span><span>The interest rate is not high.</span></span>  <span><span>Frequent bonuses.</span></span>  <span><span>Remote services.</span></span>  <span><span>Of the minuses: the fines for the slightest delay are very serious.</span></span>  <span><span>A card is issued only at the individual offer of Sberbank.</span></span>  <span><span>There is a very high commission for cash withdrawals.</span></span>  <span><span>Judging by the reviews, it will not work to extend the validity of this card: the card will be issued, but it will not be ‚ÄúCredit Momentum‚Äù, since it does not have practically all the advantages listed above.</span></span>  <span><span>This card is valid for a year.</span></span> <span><span><br></span></span> </p>
