Names of Russian tanks</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The story tells that the names of tanks appeared depending on the events that took place.  Some received the name due to their characteristics, others - the names of the commanders.  As you know, World War II became a catalyst for the development of tank building.  Therefore, these machines began to be widely produced in Germany and the Soviet Union. </p><h2>  Historical foundation </h2><p>  Before we figure out what the names of the tanks existed, we turn to the history.  Caterpillar vehicles first appeared during the First World War.  Now they are little recognizable and have only indirect features with modern designs.  The very concept of ‚Äútank‚Äù has English roots.  It means "tank."  Appeared during the British counterintelligence.  When England decided to send the first cars to the front, she needed to hide this fact.  Then, intelligence made a rumor that the railway was occupied by tanks sent by the Russian government.  Therefore, the British hid their armored vehicles with a warning inscription and sent them on rails. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tank names" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1286807.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The first prototype of the tank appeared in the Middle Ages, and there were many variations on this topic.  Various designs (on wheels, with shields and crossbows) were used in the field during the battle.  The first armored vehicles appeared at the beginning of the XX century and became something for granted.  Therefore, the Germans, French and British were ready to create military vehicles on their basis.  Already in 1915, it was simultaneously decided to design tanks in several countries at once. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First attempts </h2><p>  Together with the French and the British, Russia also began to design a tracked vehicle.  The son of the world famous Dmitry Mendeleev was the initiator of this business.  Vasily Dmitrievich developed a project for a land combat vehicle.  The next attempt was interesting designs.  The names of Russian tanks of this time were particularly original: ‚ÄúRussian all-terrain vehicle‚Äù and ‚ÄúTsar tank‚Äù.  These machines appeared in only one instance, as they were several unsuccessful attempts.  The government tried to track the projects of other countries in order to create its own, more advanced, military transport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="names of German tanks" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1284982.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition to unsuccessful decisions, since 1917 they began to produce better cars from the Rybinsk plant.  In most cases, the names of Soviet tanks began to appear thanks to the founders of the vehicles.  So, the armored tractor Gulkevich was released.  In order not to slow down the process of improving the army, Russia decided to ask for help from France, from which it acquired several military vehicles. </p><h2>  Legendary light tank </h2><p>  Over time, the names of tanks began to change to shorter ones.  So, the first military transport, which began to be widely distributed, had the name MS-1.  This abbreviation means ‚Äúsmall escort tank‚Äù.  It was first heard in the late 1920s.  In total, this LT totaled 960 copies.  Appeared in battle in 1929.  Then the tank managed to scare away all the Chinese infantry.  It is likely that the MC-1 served the army during the Great Patriotic War. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="names of tanks of the second world war" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1286815.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is also an abbreviation.  It stands for "high-speed tank."  He debuted on the battlefield against Japan in 1938.  He gained fame and success a year later on the territory of Mongolia.  Then in the steppe BT-7 was able to prove itself fully, and its speed played into the hands of the soldiers.  Until 1942, this machine was not inferior to its opponents and was used in the war.  From that moment on, armored vehicles began to be used much less, since more powerful models appeared. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="names of soviet tanks" class="if" height="248" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1286808.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <h2>  Mass production </h2><p>  The names of the tanks of World War II did not differ much in imagination, especially when it comes to Soviet vehicles.  So, in 1940, the T-34 began to operate, probably the most popular option.  Its combat effectiveness was used until 1942, when the enemy began to produce more powerful tanks on the battlefield.  Therefore, the following year, the T-34 was modernized, the reservation was improved and a seat was added for another crew member.  Also changed the gun.  In history, this tank has become one of the most famous.  And although it was not powerful enough, it was still very simple in design and operation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="names of tanks of Russia" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1284984.jpg" width="600"></div>

In 1941, the KV-1 became a real monster for German troops.  He held back the division for two days, and documents found indicated that the machine received 14 direct hits from a 50 mm gun.  At the same time, no damage was found on it - only small dents.  And yet, after two days, the Nazis cunningly damaged the armored car and destroyed the KV-1.  Their number during the Second World War was not large due to the fact that the state could not find funds for fuel and repairs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="names of Russian tanks" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1286811.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Battle "Joseph Stalin" </h2><p>  The world knows another victorious powerful series of tracked vehicles.  The names of the Russian IS tanks were dedicated to Joseph Stalin.  TTs were created specifically for breaking through enemy positions.  Therefore, everyone coped with the task.  IS-2 was the most popular among all ISs.  In a couple of days, he was able to defeat 17 enemy vehicles and successfully broke through the defense to Koenigsberg and Berlin.  The tracked vehicle served the Russian armament right up to 1995. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="names of Russian tanks" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1286812.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Contemporary exhibits </h2><p>  After World War II, designers analyzed the experience of military operations and began to develop even more powerful and robust machines.  The first of these attempts was the T-54.  He served in the second half of the 20th century.  And a few years later it was upgraded to version 55. This tracked vehicle was so popular that it served until the beginning of the 21st century. </p><p>  The names of tanks in Russia have never been distinguished by special options.  Each of them had only a serial number.  The T-72 became a later project.  The tank was designed in 1973 and was actively used after 10 years.  He served in Lebanon and the Middle East, and in 2008 carried out a successful operation in Tskhinval.  In the early 90s it was improved - the T-90 was released. </p><h2>  German experience </h2><p>  The names of <span>German tanks</span> have always been distinguished by vivid and memorable names.  So, during the Second World War, the Panther and the Tiger, the most popular tracked vehicles, were in service with Germany.  They appeared in 1943, a little later they were joined by a modified Royal Tiger tank.  In general, initially the Germans gave very long names to their armored vehicles.  But in practice, they simplified them.  For example, Pz.Kpfw.  - This is an abbreviated word Panzerkampfwagen, which could be translated as "tank" or "armored fighting vehicle".  Ausf - this is Ausfuhrung, translated from German as "modification".  To such long names, lettering of prototypes was usually also added.  In addition to the Panther and Tiger, the Lion and Leopard 1 were in German service. </p><p>  During World War II, I saw the first <span>radio-controlled tanks,</span> which were called "Goliaths."  They were released with a circulation of more than 2500 pieces.  They were used to pass through a <span>minefield</span> and to destroy protective structures.  Special mention deserves the legendary "Mouse", which was supposed to demolish everything in its path.  Its armor protection was maximum, and according to Hitler's plans it was a project of a ‚Äúbreakthrough tank‚Äù.  In 1944, two prototypes were created that could serve in hostilities.  But Hitler suspended production due to lack of funds.  The car was never destined to participate in a real battle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tank &quot;Mouse&quot;" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1284987.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The Mouse didn't look like a mouse at all.  It was a 180-ton monster that could not pass over bridges, but easily moved along the bottom of the river.  When the Red Army launched the offensive, the Germans could not quickly evacuate two prototypes and destroyed them.  One of the parts of the destroyed tracked vehicles was assembled and sent to Kubinka.  Then he stayed forever - in the Military History Museum. </p><h2>  Original names </h2><p>  The names of the tanks during the Second World War and after it were interesting.  Usually they popularized military leaders and other famous personalities.  American M4 "Sherman" has become the most popular in the United States and among its allies.  He glorified the famous General William Sherman.  But in England, the Comet tank was considered famous, which effectively fought with German cars and had many similarities with the Sherman and Firefly. </p><p>  The post-war period introduced us to advanced Americans: the M26 ‚ÄúPershing‚Äù, named after General John Pershing, and the M46 ‚ÄúPatton,‚Äù he was also called ‚ÄúGeneral Patton.‚Äù  The British introduced a medium tank with the original name "Centurion".  This caterpillar vehicle in 1960 was replaced by the "Chieftain" (translated from English as "leader"). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="M46 &quot;Patton&quot;" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1284989.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Over time, designers began to try to make each tank specialized.  Therefore, one of the reconnaissance vehicles was the M41 Walker Bulldog, also named after the general.  It was designed after the war to replace the famous Chaffik or General Chaffee.  As practice shows, in most cases, tanks during the Second World War and after it were named after the great generals and those who made a huge contribution to the fighting.  This trend was especially popular with the British. </p>
