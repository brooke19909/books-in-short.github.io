Working conditions as a security guard in Moscow</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, an increasing number of young people seek to get it on guard.  This is due to the demand for specialists in this field.  If we consider the numerous studies, it becomes obvious that today in the Russian Federation you can count about 800 thousand different security companies.  However, one must understand that this profession requires appropriate education and training. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vahtav.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="At the guard table" class="if uuid-3112779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3112779.jpg"></div><p>  Otherwise, working as a security guard in Moscow or smaller cities will not bring a lot of money.  However, even this does not stop young boys and girls who have undergone army training from being employed in such a position. </p><h2>  Development prospects </h2><p>  If we consider the salary of a security guard in Moscow, then at the initial stages, when the young employee still does not really understand what responsibilities he must fulfill, he does not have to rely on a lot of money.  However, you need to understand that this is an area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity in which you can develop and increase your income.  Thus, we can say that this is a rather promising direction. </p><p>  If an employee makes the necessary efforts and receives an appropriate license and rank, then in this case his salary will increase significantly.  If we talk about the salary of a security guard in Moscow or other cities, then in this case it all depends on how the person is employed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Gray salary </h2><p>  According to the legislation of the Russian Federation, today people with the appropriate license have the right to find jobs in security companies.  However, it is no secret to anyone that in almost any store or in another organization you can meet quite young security guards who are still studying or do not have any education at all.  It is easy to guess that they have no license.  In this case, we are talking about a part-time security guard in Moscow with a daily salary.  As a rule, in such situations, the salary is issued in an envelope.  Thus, no deductions to the pension fund occur. </p><div class="photo" data-original="02varvara.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Guard Salary" class="if uuid-3112704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3112704.jpg"></div><p>  Some job seekers like these vacancies as a temporary solution to their financial problems.  However, in this case, you need to understand that the salary can be significantly lower than actually allowed.  Salary may amount to 10 thousand rubles. </p><p>  There is also another tricky way employers resort to by paying official salaries to security guards in Moscow without a license.  They simply appoint them officially to a position that has nothing to do with security.  For example, in the work book it may be written that the person is working as an administrator or a watchman.  Although in fact he fulfills all the duties of a security guard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You need to understand that in the absence of a license, wages will be many times lower than that of a licensed specialist.  With a gray salary, a person can receive 10-15 thousand rubles.  If a specialist has no experience in work, most likely he is quite young.  This means that the employer will save on it, realizing that without experience it will be difficult for him to get to another place. </p><h2>  Official employment </h2><p>  Considering the average salary of a security guard in Moscow, it is worthwhile to understand that only a licensed specialist can count on a device with an appropriate entry in labor.  In this case, his salary will directly depend on the employer himself, as well as on work experience and rank.  Some organizations draw attention to the presence of positive recommendations from previous firms. </p><p>  You need to understand that in order to rely on the minimum official salary, you first need to undergo special training, as well as obtain permission for weapons.  After that it will be possible to increase your rank.  Thanks to this, wages will only increase. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.molnarfamilylaw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Contract signing" class="if uuid-3112710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3112710.jpg"></div><p>  The average salary of a security guard with a license in Moscow is at least 30,000 rubles.  If the employee has the highest level, then in this case this amount can be doubled.  In St. Petersburg and other large cities, this figure is slightly lower.  If we talk about the regions, then they can get a maximum of 25-30 thousand rubles.  Thus, the highest salary of a security guard of 4 category in Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Working conditions </h2><p>  If we are talking about a security company, then a lot depends on how severe the working conditions are.  The more complicated, the more expensive the services of a specialist will cost.  There are no problems with climatic conditions in Moscow.  But, nevertheless, if work on the street is supposed, then in this case it is possible to count on a bigger salary. </p><p>  Most of the money you can get if you go to work in the North.  However, in this case, much attention is paid to the medical commission.  If a person has serious chronic diseases, then he is not suitable for such work. </p><p>  In the North, a guard can receive up to 150,000 rubles if an employee goes on shift.  In Moscow, the security guard‚Äôs salary rarely reaches such a level, since the work schedule is usually 2/2, and a person returns home every day rather than forced to live in another city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.taggerd.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Work searches" class="if uuid-3112699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3112699.jpg"></div><p>  However, in the capital, the complexity of the work may be in danger to life.  In Moscow, a huge number of entrepreneurs who worry about their business or even their lives.  If we are talking about protecting finances, then on average the salary rises by 10%, it can reach up to 80 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  How much can I get in the store </h2><p>  Considering working as a security guard in Moscow, many pay attention to vacancies in various shopping centers.  As a rule, such employment rarely raises the issue of serious qualifications or work experience of the applicant.  The guards in this case are satisfied with a rather convenient shift schedule.  This is usually 2 through 2. </p><p>  Additionally, it all depends on the store.  For example, if we are talking about a grocery outlet, then corporate food is often provided in this case.  The employee can expect that the goods, the sale of which is coming to an end, will also be delivered to him. </p><p>  If a person gets a job in a sales outlet that sells some kind of clothing, then all of its employees automatically receive a good discount on their purchase. </p><p>  However, despite all this, working as a watchman or security guard in Moscow is not very profitable.  The salary is too small.  On average, it is 20-25 thousand rubles.  The maximum can reach 40,000 p.  In the regions, the salary will also be approximately 10,000 rubles lower.  Very often, guards who do not have any license are taken to this position.  In this case, you can expect a maximum salary of 25,000 p. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.4vsar.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Work as a security guard" class="if uuid-3112701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3112701.jpg"></div><h2>  Work through a security company </h2><p>  Many novice job seekers believe that in this case they can expect a more impressive salary.  However, it is worth noting that the salary of a security guard in Moscow in a private security company is approximately at the same level that was indicated earlier.  But a lot depends on the particular enterprise. </p><p>  There are chances that the organization will conclude a contract for private security services with a rather large customer, for example, a seller of real estate.  In this case, you can count on salaries of up to 60,000 rubles.  Sometimes it rises to 80 thousand, however, this is only in Moscow.  You need to understand that you can get a security company only with a license.  This is a plus.  This means that employment will be official.  The employee is provided with a full social package. </p><h2>  Work in a private security company without a license </h2><p>  If an enterprise offers a job to a person without a license, then you need to understand that there will be no guarantees in this case.  Again, it depends on the particular chop.  On average, they pay not more than 20 thousand rubles to unlicensed novice employees.  If the employee increased the rank or received permission for such activities, then the salary rises to 50-60 thousand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much does the guard earn" class="if uuid-3112706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3112706.jpg"></div><p>  There are organizations that send beginners to study at their own expense.  At the end of it, they can get a position in the company. </p><h2>  If work is related to children </h2><p>  Many believe that if you work as a security guard at school, then in this case you can get a decent salary.  However, most often in Moscow such guards do not receive more than 20 thousand rubles.  In fact, usually, when applying for such a vacancy, this is not about specific security services, but about access control.  In fact, schools need watchmen who will control who enters the school.  But the plus is that it is easiest to get such a job without a license. </p><div class="photo" data-original="versiya.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="School guard" class="if uuid-3112690" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/3112690.jpg"></div><h2>  How much can a guard in Moscow receive as much as possible </h2><p>  Today, numerous sites for job seekers have a huge number of offers.  If you deal with this issue, you can even find offers from foreign companies that operate in the Russian Federation.  They usually pay their employees the most.  However, in this case, you need to be prepared for the fact that the applicant will require knowledge of a foreign language.  In this case, a security guard in Moscow, if he works for an international company, on average can count on a salary that will be 10-20 thousand above the average level. </p><p>  In this area, there is indeed a fairly decent range of prices.  However, as mentioned earlier, it all depends on how skilled the employee is.  For example, a beginner can start with 15,000 rubles, however, if he very quickly receives a license to carry weapons and undergo appropriate training, then his salary will increase significantly.  As a result, you can get a salary of 60-80 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  How wages are calculated </h2><p>  As a rule, salaries for security guards are not calculated as monthly salaries.  Usually it is formed on the basis of the working hour, respectively its cost.  On average, per hour, guards earn from 100-250 p.  In this case, everything will depend on how many shifts the employee is ready to withstand.  Accordingly, the longer you work, the more you can get. </p><p>  Based on this, the salary of a security guard in Moscow per day can reach up to 6,000 rubles.  But such proposals are extremely rare.  Some earn only 2,400 rubles in 24 hours. </p><h2>  How to increase salary </h2><p>  First of all, you need to evaluate how promising this profession is for a particular person.  As a rule, guards who are in good physical shape, are able to wield weapons, and also have combat skills, receive the most.  The guard must be a stress-resistant person and be able to understand difficult situations.  If in an emergency he does not know what to do, then he should not count on a decent supplement. </p><p>  However, if there are all the prerequisites for moving in this direction, then first of all it is worth contacting good security companies, taking preparatory courses and gaining the necessary experience.  In a few years it will be possible to switch to a salary of up to 80,000 rubles. </p>
