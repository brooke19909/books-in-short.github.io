    <p>  In their comments, people write that this financial institution often issues fines to customers for allegedly late CASCO insurance documents.  And this happens against the background of the fact that in fact all the necessary papers have been sent long ago.  At the same time, when trying to contact the client‚Äôs institution, they promise to connect with the office worker, but in the end the call is simply dropped and the amount written off for the fictitious fine is not returned.  Therefore, it is not at all surprising that there are so many dissatisfied reviews about this banking structure in the network in which people who took a car loan advise others to bypass the bank.  We also provide feedback from employees about a car loan at the Setelem Bank of Tyumen. </p><p>  He deceives his customers with interest rates.  For example, people took out a loan at six percent per annum, subject to all the required conditions.  But immediately at the time of signing the contract, the interest rate increased sharply two and a half times.  In such situations, to the question of borrowers about where the originally promised six percent is, bank employees give slurred and inadequate answers.  Having a similar experience with Setel Bank, many people believe that this financial institution simply does not value its reputation, much less value its customers. </p><p>  Among other things, in the comments there is often dissatisfaction with the fact that bank employees are rude to customers when communicating, and many examples related to car loans once again confirm that this organization is trying in every possible way to extort money from people. </p><p>  Thus, based on the feedback of people who collaborated with him, we can say that this financial structure is not famous for the respect of its customers, therefore, when signing a car loan agreement with Cetelem Bank, you should be well acquainted with all the conditions that this financial organization offers. </p>
