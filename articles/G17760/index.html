    <p>  Vacationers can ride here in a unique Troika.  This is fun for the whole family.  The horses harnessed to the carriage are easy to drive on their own.  For children there are more modern means of transportation - electric cars.  It should be borne in mind that only those kids who are already three years old can control them.  The carousel with boats, on chains and with animals will attract the attention of children.  There are small multi-colored trains in the park. </p><p>  As for adult visitors, VVC offers more serious rides for them.  Among them are ‚ÄúCorkscrew Tower‚Äù, ‚ÄúEnterprise‚Äù, ‚ÄúCapsule‚Äù and others.
