At the same time, Umbria has the lowest unemployment rate in Italy, about 5.2%. </p><p>  It is important to note that domestic tourism plays a large role in Umbrian income, while external tourism is less developed.  Tuscany, which borders this region, attracts a significant flow of visiting tourists who agree to spend large sums to relax there for a couple of weeks.

Winemaking has been developing here recently, it is no more than 30 years old and, despite the small volumes, the products are of high quality. </p><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  There is no exact data on its construction, however, according to legend, Bishop Anastasius ordered the construction of a temple on the ruins of the pagan altar of Jupiter in the sixth century.  The reliability of the data is confirmed by scientists who have studied the foundation and details of the external masonry of the structure.  Terni Cathedral is located on Cathedral Square in the historical part of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shinneymissionrome.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the cathedral outside" class="if uuid-3213098" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3213098.jpg"></div><p>  The altar with the relics of the bishop was not preserved to our time, but graves belonging to Christian martyrs were found in the cellars of the cathedral.  According to experts, the building was originally intended for burial.  However, it is not possible to unequivocally state this, since little has been preserved from the past. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the XII century, the cathedral began to expand, which took about 300 years.  In the twelfth century, the first and central portal was erected, and the last was completed only in the XV century.  Later, in the XVII century, the interior of the cathedral was also redone - a font, a dome and side chapels were erected. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel.sygic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cathedral decoration" class="if uuid-3213083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3213083.jpg"></div><p>  The main planning detail of the cathedral is the Latin cross.  Well-preserved carved wooden choirs, a font and a fresco ‚ÄúHoly patrons of the city and angels‚Äù of the XVI-XVII centuries.  There is an organ in the cathedral, and in the crypt you can see the tombstone of St. Bishop Anastasius. </p><h2>  Church of St. Francis </h2><p>  It is another historical landmark of Terni.  During his lifetime, this saint preached in these places and, with the permission of the local bishop, a site was allocated for the construction of the church, which his followers could attend. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.umbriatourism.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="church of saint francis" class="if uuid-3213086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3213086.jpg"></div><p>  Initially, it was a one-nave building, and only at the beginning of the 15th century the Church of St. Francis became three-naved.  In the XVIII century, after the earthquake, it was rebuilt and restored, changing the exterior decoration.  During the Second World War, as a result of the bombing, the building was badly damaged, and the 2009 earthquake did not pass without a trace. </p><p>  Despite all the events, the facade of the temple has largely retained its appearance - a tympanum, a large round window, a portal in the center and Romanesque arches.  Of particular interest is the design of the bell tower with multi-colored majolica, quadriffs and bifors in the Gothic style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trekearth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Francis Church inside" class="if uuid-3213084" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3213084.jpg"></div><p>  Inside the church is decorated with numerous frescoes from different times, partially preserved to the present.  Here you can also see the sacristy of the 16th century with murals and stucco work by the artist-mannerist Sebastiano Flori da Arezzo. </p><p>  The main shrine of the church is a piece of the cross.  According to legend, Christ was crucified on it.  The relic is considered miraculous and attracts pilgrims from around the world. </p><h2>  Palace of Recession </h2><p>  The construction was erected in the 16th century for Count Michelangelo Spada.  Composed of powerful stones, it looks more like a fortress than a palace.  The rough facade is slightly facilitated by a portal consisting of three arches.  The side parts of the structure are raised in the form of towers.  Initially, they were not there, the terraces were built in only in the XVIII century, later they were walled up, and they began to resemble towers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.anticaviaflaminia.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palace of Recession" class="if uuid-3213105" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3213105.jpg"></div><p>  Inside the Palazzo Spada, frescoes of the 16th century are preserved, in some places covered with murals of masters of the 18th-19th centuries.  Many of the plots depicted on them are taken from ancient mythology.  Their author is considered the famous artist-mannerist of the time Van Munder. </p><h2>  City Spoleto </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.umbriatourism.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spoleto Cathedral" class="if uuid-3213176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3213176.jpg"></div><p>  40 km from Terni (Italy) is the city of Spoleto, recognized by contemporaries of that time as one of the most beautiful colonies of Ancient Rome.

Walking around the city, you can see the buildings of the V century and later, erected in the X-XI centuries.  Among them is Spoleto Cathedral, founded in 1175 and named after the Ascension of the Virgin. </p><p>  The tallest building in the city is considered the fortress of Albornocian, built in the XIV century.  For a while, it was the seat of the local dukes.  Since 1817, it has been used as a prison, and today it houses a historical museum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dronestagr.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Albornocian fortress" class="if uuid-3213106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3213106.jpg"></div><h2>  What else to do in and around the city </h2><p>  In February, the city celebrates Valentine's Day, born in Terni, and the chocolate festival, where you can participate in contests and workshops.  In March, a Norwegian truffle fair is held with a tasting of dishes from these mushrooms. </p><p>  In the spring, in the nearest cities to Terni (Italy), a kite festival takes place, costumed processions to mark the arrival of spring and a candle festival in honor of St. Ubalda. </p><p>  In summer, Perugia is worth a visit to the jazz festival; it takes place in July.  In autumn, a historical military festival is held in Terni, where military bands perform, equestrian tournaments, fancy-dress processions, etc.  At the end of autumn, an annual truffle fair is organized in Gubbio every year. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The opinions of those who were lucky enough to relax in Italy and visit Terni, speak of this time with admiration.  People are surprised by the rich nature, emerald greenery and natural landscapes. </p><p>  Travelers are also pleased that the process of obtaining an Italian visa is quite simple and does not overshadow the preparation for a vacation. </p><p>  Absolutely everyone likes historical sights, friendly people and Italian cuisine. </p>
