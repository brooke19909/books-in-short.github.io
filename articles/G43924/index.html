We are talking about Marsa Alam, the youngest resort in the country.  In addition, it is the southernmost resort and so far the cleanest.  One of the best hotels here is Desert Light Solitaire Resort Marsa Alam 4 *, pleasantly impressive and surprising tourists with a high level of service.  Literally, every guest is welcome here, regardless of his citizenship or religion.  The full name of the hotel is not always used, more often it is used without the first two words.  In Solitaire Resort Marsa Alam 4 * everyone can find what he likes.  For some, this is a good beach vacation, for others it‚Äôs interesting excursions, for others it‚Äôs exciting diving, and for some it‚Äôs just silence, peace and tranquility. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Solitaire Resort Marsa Alam 4" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1083307.jpg" width="591"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Marsa Alam is a small but very beautiful town and at the same time a resort that is still actively developing.  The hotels here are located quite apart.  Therefore, choosing the Solitaire Resort Marsa Alam 4 * as your vacation destination, you can fully count on spending your vacation away from the hustle and crowding of the people.  You also need to be prepared for the fact that most of the time will have to be spent on the hotel‚Äôs territory, since it is 25 km from the nearest city, which is Marsa al-Alam.  You will need to get there by taxi or by bus, but they do not go often.  Only 1 km from the city 15 years ago, an international airport was opened, accepting flights from many countries, but Russia is not among them.  Our tourists arrive by charter in Hurghada, from which to Marsa Alam is more than 270 km, or 3 hours journey (if you do not transport tourists to other hotels).  About the same from the hotel to Luxor, and to the famous Elba Nature Reserve a little less - 250 km. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Solitaire Resort Marsa Alam 4 * occupies an area of ‚Äã‚Äã210,000 square meters.  The territory is quite large, but every corner of it is carefully groomed.  Despite the fact that there is a hot desert around (in Marsa Alam, only 6 mm of precipitation falls annually), all the buildings and facilities of the hotel are buried in greenery and flowers.  Around there are many palm trees of different types, beautifully trimmed bushes, flower beds, neat lawns.  Paths and alleys paved with paving slabs are laid throughout the territory, benches are installed in some places, and there is a beautifully decorated stream.  Among the greenery harmoniously located villas and bungalows of the hotel, swimming pools, sports grounds, bars, restaurants, parking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Desert Light Solitaire Resort Marsa Alam 4" class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1083318.jpg" width="589"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Interesting and varied leisure activities at the Solitaire Resort Marsa Alam 4 *.  Marsa Alam and any other locality are not nearby, so the bulk of the time tourists spend on the hotel.  At their disposal are two large swimming pools with clear water and different depths, an excellent gym with large panoramic windows that overlook the sea, a spa that offers a steam room, sauna, jacuzzi, massage room (all for money).  Sports enthusiasts can use tennis courts for free (only lighting is paid extra), a billiard room located in the disco building, various sports grounds on the hotel premises and on the beach.  Exotic lovers have the opportunity to ride camels and horses in the surrounding area. </p><p>  So that tourists do not get bored, they are entertained from morning to night by a team of animators.  The program includes morning exercises, water aerobics, sports and comic games, evening contests and shows. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  The hotel offers the smallest guests a children's pool, a mini-club where tutors are engaged with the kids, a playground for games.  In the rooms, upon request, staff install cots, the restaurant has highchairs and a separate menu (for babies older than 1 year).  If necessary, parents can entrust their child with a caring nanny. </p><p>  Children under 12 years old without extra bed are not paid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Solitaire Resort Marsa Alam 4" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/280551.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  On the coast, literally a minute walk from the beach, is Solitaire Resort Marsa Alam 4 *.  Egypt owes much of its popularity to the Red Sea.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel it is particularly blue and clean.  In the waters near Marsa Alam, because of the resort‚Äôs novelty, you can still find dugongs (prototypes of mermaids), exotic hammerhead sharks listed in the Red Book, swim with dolphins and turtles, and there are a lot of small beautiful fishes.  The beach of the hotel pleasantly surprises with its length (about 500 meters) and cleanliness.  Free space and a sunbed here can be found even in peak season.  There are two calls to the sea - from the shore, where it is shallow for a sufficient length, and from the pier.  In shallow water there are corals, so it is advisable to have special shoes.  The pier from the hotel is 75 meters long.  Sun loungers are also installed on it, a bar is equipped, a rescue team works, and the depth of the sea here is from 8 meters or more. </p><p>  The only drawback of the beach is that there are waves on some days, and lifeguards do not allow swimming in depth. </p><h2>  Entertainment outside the hotel </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Solitaire Resort Marsa Alam 4 * is located somewhat detached and there is nothing special to do outside, tourists can spend time on excursions.  It is most convenient to get to Luxor, Cairo, Hurghada by air from the airport of Marsa Alam, as it is somewhat tiring on the bus.  A small nuance: there are no excursion companies here, only the hotel‚Äôs tour operator, working out of competition, which means that it is competitively priced.  Those who do not want to travel so far can get a lot of impressions from walking on ATVs, go to Abu Dabab, one of the most beautiful bays, visit the reserve, take a walk on a yacht.  But the most popular form of entertainment here are snorkeling and diving.  It is for their sake that many tourists come here, because such an underwater world, as near Mars al-Alam, is nowhere else.  Plus, here you can find several wrecks, which is also extremely interesting.  Equipment is issued in numerous diving clubs.  They organize trips to the sea on motor boats with a mandatory dive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Best Western Solitaire Resort Marsa Alam" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1083729.jpg" width="550"></div>
