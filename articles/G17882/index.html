    <h2>  The uniqueness of the Dead Sea </h2><p>  The healing ability of this body of water has been known since ancient times.  He was even credited with magical power.  Aristotle admired him.  Queen Cleopatra was looking for the source of eternal youth and beauty in the waters of the Dead Sea.  And this is not at all surprising.  Valuable cosmetics, perfumes and some medicines are made on the basis of plants of coastal oases. </p><h2>  Gentle sun </h2><p>  <span>The Dead Sea</span> is located at a uniquely low point on our globe, almost 412 meters below sea level.  This place has the most saturated <span>ozone layer, which</span> completely excludes dangerous ultraviolet rays from the solar spectrum.  Therefore, the resorts of the Dead Sea are a unique place for taking therapeutic sunbathing.  Even prolonged exposure to the sun does not threaten burns. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Healing water </h2><p>  It is difficult to call the <span>Dead Sea</span> water "water", it is much more correct to say that it is a strong saline solution, since the salt concentration reaches almost 42%.  The sea is enriched not only with salts, but also with minerals.  Water, salts, and mud include magnesium, bromide, and calcium.  Such minerals help to relax the body, smooth the skin, and stimulate blood circulation.  The pushing force in these waters is so great that the Dead Sea in Israel is famous for the fact that it perfectly holds on the surface even that person who absolutely can not swim. </p><h2>  Fresh air </h2><p>  The climate is unique due to the mixing of two different air masses.  Through the hundreds of kilometers of the desert, the Indian Ocean enriches the Dead Sea resorts with a dry, very clean, allergen-free air stream.  It is met by evaporation from the surface of the sea, richly saturated with healing substances.  Thanks to the hollow surrounded by mountains, the effect of combining air masses is greatly enhanced. </p>

    <h2>  Jordan Hotels </h2><p>  The east coast offers a variety of hotels.  Jordan used the Dead Sea to organize beautiful health resorts.  The most famous of them are Jordan Valley Marriott Resort &amp; Spa (5 stars), Movenpick Resort &amp; Spa Dead Sea (5 stars), Kempinski Hotel Ishtar (5 stars), Dead Sea SPA (4 stars).  These hotels successfully treat skin, respiratory, muscle and neurological diseases.  Guests who prefer outdoor activities can enjoy mountain climbing, jeep riding in the desert or even a camel.  All hotels on the Dead Sea provide the opportunity to go to the sauna, enjoy swimming in the pool.  Sports enthusiasts will be delighted with the fitness center, playing tennis. </p><h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  Despite the variety of hotels, all resorts of the Dead Sea have approximately the same cost of recreation.  Prices rise in the high season - from the first of March to the end of May and from the beginning of September to the end of November.  In low season, the cost drops significantly.  The price starts at $ 88 per night (for the 3-star Tsell Harim Hotel). </p><p>  Rest in the resorts of the Dead Sea is not cheap, but a competent approach and taking into account some factors will help to significantly reduce prices.  For example, booking a room for more than 7 days will give decent discounts.  In this case, the cost will be lower than in other world resorts. </p>
