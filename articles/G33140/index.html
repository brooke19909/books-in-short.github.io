Super MTS - how to connect?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Often, a mobile subscriber becomes a voluntary hostage of his tariff plan.  Seeing the current diversity of cellular services representatives, we analyze the activities of one of the leading GSM mobile communications companies and highlight the main criteria for the appropriate choice of a service package.  At the same time, we are exploring a number of issues, and in particular: how to switch to the Super MTS tariff, and what benefits the subscriber will receive as a whole. </p><h2>  Not only in the forest can you get lost ... </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to switch to the tariff" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/374042.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  An incredibly huge number of customer service configurations is provided for all of us by the well-known MTS company.  However, not always changing the tariff plan may be a reasonable means of saving.  Sometimes, when switching to a different service package, the user loses more than he gains.  In this situation, the question of how to switch to another tariff should, first of all, be determined by the conscious action of the subscriber, backed up by calculations.  Therefore, when you see, hear, or read about the favorable prices for a new or previously unknown package of services, do not rush to part with your current conditions of the current service plan.  Resort to a comparative analysis and understand in detail all the nuances of the tariff you are interested in. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  but on the other hand </h2><p>  We all understand that the diversity of starter packs must somehow explain, otherwise what is the meaning of their existence?  Therefore, when you choose certain conditions for using cellular communications, keep in mind that MTS tariffs tend to change.  That is, for example, the Internet is advantageous in payment on one package of services, but the cost of calls abroad is more acceptable in another subscription service plan.  Of course, there are optimal solutions, where a certain balance of payment for using mobile communication services is seen.  We will talk about one of them in the framework of this review. </p><h2>  Communication Leader </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Unlimited MTS tariff" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/374041.jpg?1397448965023" width="500"></div></h2><p>  Agree, you are definitely interested in the quality services of your mobile operator.  However, do not mind taking advantage of the best offer, providing ample opportunities for moderate payment.  But, paradoxically as it sounds, nevertheless, the functional versatility and low cost of the optional potential of the starter pack in maintenance cost money.  To date, the Super MTS tariff can be considered the closest to the concept of "all inclusive".  True, the subscriber will have to independently connect a number of additional options that, although expanding the user capabilities, nevertheless have a certain limit of use, which often casts doubt on the service's profitability.  Therefore, you need to clearly understand that some free options when activating a package imply a limited validity period.  Moreover, when they are used in the future, in case of non-disconnection, the fee is automatically charged from the user's subscriber account.  Therefore, before resolving the practical action of the question of how to switch to the Super MTS tariff, it is necessary to learn a little more about this starter pack and the conditions for its maintenance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Blurred borders </h2><p>  Each telecom operator, first of all, should provide for the comfort and ease of use of the services it provides, and most importantly - transparency of the terms of cooperation.  There is nothing to be said about the masterfully veiled restrictions expressed in time, data volume, etc., accompanying the process of using cellular communications.  Difficulties in understanding the essence of the useful property of one or another service provided by the tariff is an integral part of the commercial activity of many mobile content providers.  It is beneficial for them that the user does not fully understand the terms of service.  Therefore, giving preference to any package of GSM-services, pay attention to some important points, so to speak, markers of the benefits of use. </p><h2>  Favorable tariffs of MTS: what is their value? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to switch to another tariff?" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/374043.jpg?1397448849728" width="600"></div></h2><p>  First of all, the undoubted advantage of a prepaid communication service is a few indisputable universally valid advantages. </p><ul><li>  Lack of subscription fees per se. </li><li>  There is no need to conclude any contracts.  Therefore, the user of the services owes nothing to anyone. </li><li>  Anonymity factor. </li><li>  Flexible and comfortable conditions when changing the service plan. </li></ul><p>  The profitability of the tariff should be expressed in practical efficiency and ease of use.  The more options available to the subscriber, and the more loyal the conditions of service, the more appropriate your choice.  It is worth noting that only the Super-MTS tariff plan will allow you to truly feel the freedom of communication without the need to replenish your account and threats to terminate the terms of service in case of delay in monthly payments.  Of course, even this starter pack has its drawbacks, but they are so insignificant that the subscriber practically does not notice them.  Often, it is the user who, due to his reluctance to delve into the essence of the service process, becomes the culprit in non-standard situations: money disappearing from the account, using the phone in inter-regional roaming, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Super Advantage Details </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The most profitable MTS tariff" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/374038.jpg?1397448898795" width="550"></div></h2><p>  <em>Calls</em> </p><ul><li>  No monthly fee. </li><li>  Free 60 min / day (calls to local numbers of MTS and MGST). </li><li>  After exceeding the daily limit - 1.50 rubles / min. </li><li>  2.50 rubles per minute to local numbers of other operators. </li><li>  Long-distance calls to MTS numbers - 5 rubles / min. </li><li>  The remaining operators - 14.00 rubles per minute in Russia. </li><li>  Calls to numbers of CIS countries - 29.00 rubles per minute. </li><li>  49.00 rubles per minute - in Europe. </li><li>  International calls - 70.00 rubles per minute. </li></ul><p>  <em>SMS messages</em> </p><ul><li>  Free outgoing SMS to MTS local numbers. </li><li>  $ 2.00  to other operators. </li></ul><p>  <em>the Internet</em> </p><ul><li>  9.90 rubles / 1 Mb (GPRS traffic). </li></ul><p>  The most favorable tariff "MTS" implies the use of additional options. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Favorable tariffs of MTS" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/374039.jpg?1397450472351" width="600"></div>

For example, by paying a monthly subscription fee of 400 rubles, you can call local and interregional numbers not only of MTS, but also of other Russian operators.  15 GB of Internet traffic without speed limits will also be available to you.  And all this - when connecting the Smart tariff.  It is worth noting that this package of services is a kind of novelty and has several functional varieties: Smart + and Smart mini.  Another interesting offer from the MTS operator is Red Energy.  The tariff plan is quite attractive, considering that the cost of an outgoing call to any mobile phone number or city telephone exchange will be 1.60 rubles.  Prepayment makes this package even more interesting and, perhaps, just such a service option is suitable for those who were not attracted by Super-MTS.  How to connect the above packages, see below. </p><ul><li>  Activation of Red Energy - * 111 * 727 #. </li><li>  Dial * 111 * 1024 # - and you will connect Smart. </li><li>  The combination * 111 * 1025 # activates Smart +. </li><li>  Digital and character set: * 111 * 1023 # - Smart mini (activation). </li></ul><p>  However, if you have any difficulties, you can always dial 0890 and ask for help from a MTS service support representative at any convenient time. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Now you know not only how to switch to the Super MTS tariff, but also much more that is so necessary in the process of choosing the starter pack that best suits your needs.  By the way, for changing the terms of service and switching to another pricing plan, despite the fact that they are usually silent about this, they often charge a certain amount.  Therefore, before changing the tariff, still do not be too lazy to call the <span>MTS contact center</span> and specify all the points that interest you.  Have a nice call! </p>
