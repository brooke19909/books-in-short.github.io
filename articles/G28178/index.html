History</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  70 years have passed since the suicide of the bloody Fuhrer of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler, and the secrets and facts that remained unclear, today excite the public.  At the beginning of the new millennium, several researchers decided to find out more details and turn the story upside down and understand who Hitler is.  <span>The nationality of this</span> despot today remains one of the burning topics for discussion among intellectuals. </p><h2>  Parents and ancestors of the future Fuhrer </h2><p>  The official biography, which, as many of his contemporaries testify, Hitler often kept silent and rewritten in his own way, indicates that his ancestors were Austrians.  According to unbiased historians, Hitler, whose nationality is no longer a secret today, was not a representative of the Aryan thoroughbred race, but first things first. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hitler's nationality" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20759/828831.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The official story, adopted back in the Soviet period, told only about the mother and father of the future dictator.  Not surprisingly, the genealogy of this man remains a mystery today.  Hitler's life, like his demise, is fanned by many myths and rumors that have no documentary evidence. </p><p>  It is known only that Adolf's father was Alois Hitler (1837-1903), his mother Klara P√∂lzl (1860-1907).  If everything is clear from the pedigree of Adolf‚Äôs mother (it is recorded in the documents of that era), then the origin and relatives of the father remain a mystery today.  Russian researchers suggest that the father of the future Nazi conductor in Germany was born as a result of incest between relatives of the same clan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  European historians name Hitler, or rather, his origin, connect with Jewish roots, claiming that Alois was born after the abuse of his grandmother, Maria Anna Schiklgruber, perpetrated by the son of a Jewish banker (presumably Rothschild), in whose house she worked as a maid.  The last conjecture is not confirmed by historical facts. </p><h2>  "Mystery" of Hitler surname </h2><p>  A group of researchers claims that the name of Hitler, or rather, the name of his ancestors and even brothers, was spelled incorrectly for a long time.  And only the father of Adolf Alois, being a customs officer, decided to change the generic name Schiklgruber to Hitler.  According to some researchers, the reason for this was the dark past of the Shiklgruber clan, possibly engaged in smuggling and robbery in the border areas with Germany.  And in order to completely disown his past and be able to make a career for himself, Alois took such a step.  This version also has only indirect evidence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hitler's birthday" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20759/828837.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><p>  But Hitler‚Äôs birthday, as well as the place of his birth, are an indisputable fact.  On April 20, 1889, a boy was born in one of the hotels in the border town of Braunnau am Inn, baptized two days later by Adolf. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Father managed to get out of poverty - he became a petty official.  Due to the type of activity of the owner, the family was constantly moving.  Hitler recalled the childhood years with special trepidation, considering them to be a start on the way to his greatness.  Parents paid a lot of attention to the child, and before the birth of his younger brother Edmund, he was generally the <span>center of the universe</span> for a mother who had previously lost three children.  In 1896, his sister Paula was born, and Adolf was attached to her all his life. </p><p>  At school, the boy was distinguished by academic performance, he drew well, but, as modern historians testify, he never received a certificate of completion of secondary classes, because of which his attempt to enter the Art Academy failed several times. </p><p>  Adolf Hitler spent the years of World War I mainly at headquarters.  As his colleagues testify, he was distinguished by frail health and an arrogance to his superiors.  Among ordinary soldiers did not enjoy respect. </p><h2>  Take off on the career ladder </h2><p>  Adolf Hitler was an enthusiastic nature, which is why he could spend hours in a cafe drinking a cup of coffee, reading literature of interest to him.  But, fortunately (or unfortunately), all his knowledge was superficial.  But the future leader of the nation could not refuse oratory.  He is obliged to this gift by advancement on a career ladder. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hitler's name" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20759/828836.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After the defeat in World War I, there were a lot of dissatisfied Germans in the state.  Massive clandestine groups and societies formed that organized coups and riots in Munich.  At this time, Adolf was sent to political education courses and for some time worked as a ‚Äúlard‚Äù, exposing left-wing gatherings and communists.  The times of Hitler and the heyday of his Nazi ideology were just around the corner.  At one of the meetings of the group, which called itself the German Workers' Party, Hitler was inspired by the ideas of the people he was following, and by decision of the top leadership was introduced into its ranks.  Thanks to his <span>leadership skills</span> and oratory, he soon gathered many fans and attracted like-minded parties.  In the end, this group decided to remove the government in Berlin.  After this clash with the police in the capital, 14 Nazis were killed, Hitler broke his collarbone, was arrested and sent to prison.  In conclusion, he spent 13 months, where he published his work "My Struggle", which made him a wealthy man. </p><p>  It was in this work that he described the basic principles of Nazism and designated the main enemy of the Germans - the Jew.  From that moment on, Hitler, whose nationality at that time was of little interest to anyone, began to remain silent about his father and grandmother, and the name Schiklgruber, who could have compromised the new "Messiah of Germany," was not mentioned at all. </p><h2>  Adolf Hitler and the purity of the race </h2><p>  Being a very intelligent man, Hitler correctly decided that the image of a single enemy and <span>a scapegoat</span> in the form of Jews would rally all offended and offended around him.  And so it happened.  In 1923, an unsuccessful attempt to seize power led him to prison, but not in jail in the literal sense of the word, but in a sanatorium with a garden and soft beds, where Adolf was able to reflect on the purity of the nation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hitler years" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20759/828834.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The main tenets of Nazi ideology was the accusation of the Jews of all <span>"mortal sins"</span> against Germany and the desire of this race to weaken the Germans and drive them out of their territories through assimilation and <span>debt obligations.</span> </p><p>  Aryans - the legendary fair-haired people with blue eyes - became an object of adoration and imitation.  German scientists worked on reproduction of this race.  Thousands of Jews, blind, deaf, dark-skinned and gypsies were deprived of their right and ability to bear children by sterilization. </p><p>  Surprisingly, according to modern historians, Hitler, whose nationality was henceforth interpreted as Aryan, was friends with a Jew in his childhood, and, according to historians, came to power based on Jewish capitals.  The immediate surroundings of Hitler, whose nationality should have worried him, were Jews.  What are Himmler, Goering, Goebbels ... </p><h2>  "I decide who is a Jew" </h2><p>  The fact that Hitler was a Jew was known even during his ascension to the "throne" Churchill and Roosevelt, who are also representatives of Jewish nationality.  Perhaps the Jews were chosen as bait for the uneducated poor.  Although facts are known today that people who did not hide their Jewish past served in the army of fascist Germany at the highest posts.  It‚Äôs just that at that time it wasn‚Äôt customary to shout about it from all angles.  The facts were hushed up, and hordes of Jews were killed on the orders of this tyrant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hitler's life" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20759/828833.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Himmler‚Äôs signature phrase, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to me to decide who the Jew is,‚Äù disguises politics for those who are objectionable.  As practice shows, any objectionable person could become a Jew at that time, and no matter what nationality he was. </p><p>  As recently declassified documents say, only European Jews were destroyed.  Perhaps Hitler with his anti-Semitic theory did not fight at all for the purity of the Aryan race, but for the purity of the Jewish nation?  There is evidence that German Jews undergoing some training were sent to Palestine to defend a new future state. </p><h2>  Is Adolf Hitler a descendant of Jews and African Americans? </h2><p>  Thus, we can conclude that Hitler, whose nationality was silent for a long time, was a cog in a huge machine trying to create an ideal Jewish nation.  Who knows, perhaps the words of the theory of the great Jewish conspiracy make sense? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="times of Hitler" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20759/828832.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Be that as it may, Hitler‚Äôs birthday in the projection of history was a tragic day for all European Jews, Slavs, Gypsies and African Americans.  Perhaps the elite of the Zionist organizations saw in it precisely the murder weapon to which millions obeyed. </p><p>  The journalist of the German edition of Knack, Jean-Paul Mulders, has long been trying to find out who Hitler is.  The nationality of the Fuhrer excited him especially.  In order to collect the necessary material, the activist took a sample of the saliva of several relatives of the dictator, as a result of which a haplogroup was found, which is found only among Jews and African Americans.  So, most likely, Hitler was just a pawn in the bloody games of the powerful. </p>
