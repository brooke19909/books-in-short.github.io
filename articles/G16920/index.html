And only if all the requirements are met, everything is in the right strength and volume, is the new thing sitting on the figure perfectly.  One of the techniques by which the details are beautifully and elegantly designed is the one that will be discussed in this article.  How to knit shortened rows with knitting needles?  We‚Äôll try to figure it out. </p><h2>  What is it? </h2><p>  Let's start from the very beginning.  Before you understand how to knit shortened rows with knitting needles, you need to find out what it is.  These are rows that are not tied to the end.  This knitting is also called partial.  And sometimes, if the canvas requires a certain shape, such a technique is simply indispensable.  Yes, and they also help to do the work neatly and beautifully - shortened rows.  How to knit shortened rows with knitting needles without holes is easy to figure out. </p><p>  It is thanks to this technique that there is no need to knit a whole row until it ends.  This means that knitting is simply turned in the opposite direction and continue to work all in the same direction.  The result is very simple: the back side knitting is exactly the same as the front side.  In general, the most important thing in this case is not to make holes.  But there are several easy ways to do this. </p><h2>  The use of shortened row technology </h2><p>  This technique, performed using knitting needles, is applicable in several cases: </p><ul><li>  For the design of horizontal tucks.  After all, an even form is not always necessary.  It happens that women of fashion want a tight-fitting figure of their dress.  Here, thanks to the tucks, the <span>knitted fabric</span> will look perfect on the figure. </li><li>  A circular neckline and shoulder, which was tied with a bevel, using shortened rows, will look great. </li></ul>

Now quite popular models, which have different lengths of shelves, have creative valves and collars.  So that they blend harmoniously, the needlewoman also learns how to knit shortened rows with knitting needles. </li><li>  Knitters use a partial knit technique when they need to combine patterns of different heights in order to make the fabric even. </li><li>  With a flat armhole.  Work on shortened rows provides a smooth edge and a very effective look of the product. </li><li>  If you need to tie a flared skirt or dress, as well as wedges in berets, then the technique of shortened rows is quite applicable here. </li></ul><p>  In different descriptions, there are other names for this method, which introduce the beginner to some confusion.  Shortened rows are also called rotary knitting and partial knitting. </p><h2>  How to perform practically? </h2><p>  Help in understanding how to do everything right, how to knit with shortened rows of knitting needles (a master class will be given a little below), this article will provide.  And the meaning of this method is that the bevel, convexity or even a curved line on the working canvas is obtained due to the fact that incomplete rows are knitted in which the loops are not diminished or covered with knitting needles.  Those loops that do not knit remain open. </p>

    <p>  Further work continues, as is usually done when a certain convexity is provided on this canvas.  If this is another case, then you can very carefully connect the parts that were connected separately.  A convenient <span>knitted seam is</span> useful here <span>,</span> which can preserve all the aesthetics of the connection. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The first method of partial knitting </h2><p>  As it has already become clear, based on the name of the subtitle, such knitting can be done in several ways.

The canvas must be turned over, double crocheted and knit before turning.  But on the front side you can already shorten.

    <p>  If the craftswoman needs the shortened rows to be on the wrong side, then this is done like this: yarn, then the front row.  Turn the work sheet and knit the wrong side of the crochet. </p><p>  But in knitting it is important that the joints are as inconspicuous as possible.  Therefore, it is necessary to remove the yarn on the right knitting needle and, without fail, turn the next wrong loop back.  Now the yarn is returned to the left knitting needle, it should be knitted at the same time as the unfolded eyelet.  If it is not deployed, then ‚Äúfrom the face‚Äù of the canvas the whole pattern will be violated. </p><h2>  The second method of partial knitting </h2><p>  This method includes the ability to perform partial knitting with a twisted loop.  When the work is carried out to the marked place where you need to turn, you should remove the loop on the right knitting needle, which is next after the mark.  Now, after it, it is necessary to stretch the working thread forward, return this loop to its place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After that, the canvas turns over and work continues.  Now let's see how this method will look from the wrong side.  When the work is brought to the right place, you need to remove the next loop and get a working thread behind the canvas. </p>

    <p>  Knitting should be turned upside down.  The main working thread should be in the same place as always during operation.  But when during knitting we get to the loop, which is entwined, it should be turned.  Now tie the two together behind the back wall of the loops. </p><h2>  The third method of partial knitting - shortened rows with a stretched loop </h2><p>  This is another opportunity to learn how to knit shortened rows with knitting needles without making holes.  Perhaps some of the craftswomen will like this method more than others.  Moreover, the description will be given in the simplest, most understandable way even for a beginner knitter, in a language.  The front row must be tied to the place where you should turn the work.  We turn it and remove the knitted eyelet, like the wrong one. </p><p>  Now the working thread needs to be brought up and away from you and pulled so as to see two half-loops.  Then, when the back and front rows are knitted and the craftswoman reached this stretched buttonhole in the front row, it is necessary to knit her front, carefully inserting the knitting needle and stretching the working thread.  From the inside, it‚Äôs necessary to do exactly the same. </p><p>  It is necessary to tie to the turning point, remove the loop as the wrong one, and transfer the working thread above the knitting needle from yourself.  Next, pull the working thread, and then, in the next wrong row, knit it as the wrong one.  Now beginner knitters know how to knit shortened rows in three ways with knitting needles.  And everything is done so carefully that there are no holes.  But which of these options to choose, each craftswoman decides for herself. </p><h2>  We knit a neck </h2><p>  To figure out how to knit a neck with shortened rows of knitting needles, take for example an blouse with raglan sleeves.  The back and sleeves can be knitted in a straight line, without making reductions, leaving the loops unclosed.  But before doing so.  On two halves of the shelves, for starters, you can not knit 13 stitches in the center, leaving them on the spoke (the number of these stitches is directly dependent on the shape of the cut and the thickness of the thread). </p><p>  Then you need to knit in short rows (in each second without knitting one loop and wrapping it with a working thread).  Next, you need to knit all the loops with a garter stitch to the last, which will be the closest to the middle of the neck.  It must be removed, without knitting, entwined. </p>

    <p>  How to make entwined loops can be found in the same article, a little higher in the text.  After the knitter has finished knitting the shelves, it is necessary to collect all the open loops on the parts (on the sleeves, neck and shelves) in order, using circular knitting needles.  It was the turn to tie the neck.  When tying twisted loops, a working knitting needle should be inserted under the twist and into the loop, knitting them together. </p><h2>  We knit a collar </h2><p>  When it comes to how to knit a collar with shortened rows of knitting needles, this usually means a shawl collar.  So, for starters, the shoulder seams of the product are performed.  On circular knitting needles, dial an odd number of loops (you need to start along the left bevel) along the edge of the neck of the back and the edges of the neckline, which are beveled. </p><p>  But do the following wrong side row: knit one by one - one wrong side and one front, ending this row at the second shoulder seam.  Turn the work and remove the first loop.  Now continue work in the opposite direction to the first shoulder seam, turn and remove the first loop. </p>

    <p>  After this, it is necessary to knit at the end of each subsequent row a few more stitches than was done in the previous row (the approximate difference is one or two centimeters).  This should be done until all the loops are covered by the work.  Now knit right up to the width of the ends of the collar, which is identical to the length along the lower edge of the front cutout with closed loops. </p><p>  You can close the loops of the collar.  Its ends, laying them neatly on top of each other, can be sewn to the lower edge of the cutout: the inner tip with an overcasting seam, but the outer one with a vertical knit (or as it is also called a mattress). </p><h2>  Track and Beanie Hat </h2><p>  What are the traces knitted by shortened rows of needles (author Myasnikova)?  According to her advice, first the tracks should be knitted with the main color, and then a rainbow of multi-colored threads should be shortened in rows.  For example, 20 stitches with red thread, 18 - yellow, 16 - blue ... A certain number of wedges are knitted, then a few centimeters in the main color, the work is folded in half and sewn. </p><p>  The number of wedges depends on the size of the legs, knitting needles and yarn.  There may be 3 or 4, or maybe 7-8.  In the tracks, knitted according to the technique of the craftswoman, it is precisely the colored rows that will be shortened.  She knits twenty stitches with colored thread, three stitches remain on her knitting needles.  They do not need to be touched: just turn the work to the wrong side and knit the colored thread back to the beginning of knitting. </p>

    <p>  Knitting a beanie hat with knitting needles in short rows can also be done by making wedges.  And in this case, only the facial loops that are obtained if you do not tie all the loops to the end are suitable.  It will be a handkerchief.  By the way, such a hat is considered one of the most fashionable for several seasons. </p>
