In addition, it remains a complete mystery where our employees get all kinds of phone numbers from various companies and firms that issue loans and loans in the shortest possible time with a minimum of documents. </p>

    <h2>  Is prankers fun for children or a method of provocation? </h2><p>  Many will surely recall cases from childhood when they dabbled with the phone, dialed a familiar number and asked to call Masha or Tanya, although they knew that they did not live there.  This can be called harmless childish mischief.  Regarding the prankers, their behavior can hardly be called childish fun, first of all, because they have not been schoolchildren for a long time.  These people call for a specific purpose - to bring the object of the telephone rally to a state where it ceases to control its words, switches to screaming, obscene language, and sometimes threats, and then publish the recorded conversation on the Internet to the delight of many.  The victims of prank succumb to provocation and, of course, later regret it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Telephone draw: who becomes its object </h2>

    <p>  If you are a very <span>calm person</span> and to some extent even a bore, the chance that prankers will call you is minimal.  The objects of the draw are, as a rule, emotional, rude persons.  They are easy to get mad and cause vivid emotions.  Elderly people also become victims of prank. </p><p>  Prankers of Russia do not deprive even the police and other government agencies of their attention.  And the most favorite characters for bullying are famous people and stars. </p><h2>  Prank Draws: Genres and Varieties </h2><p>  Phone hooliganism in a standard way usually starts with phrases and questions, for example, ‚ÄúHow to get to the library‚Äù or ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù  As a result, the raged victim with curses is turned off.  But not all telephone pranks aim to bring to an extreme nervous state.  There are several types of draws. </p><p>  <em>Hard prank</em> </p><p>  The most brutal genre is called hard prank.  In this case, it is hysteria that becomes the culmination of the conversation.  Often used curses and <span>obscene words.</span>  When the victim understands, she became the object of a rally, she proceeds to threats, warns that she will figure out the hooligans with the help of law enforcement agencies or other equally impressive people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <em>Light prank</em> </p><p>  The opposite of this genre is light prank.  If you got a call for this purpose, you are definitely lucky.  They plan to cheer you up and just laugh together, chat on intimate topics.  There is no malicious intent. </p><p>  <em>Radio prank</em> </p><p>  There are times when the object of the draw are radio stations.  In this case, we are talking about a call leading live.  Often used obscene language.  This is called radio prank.  The world famous Echo of Moscow wave faced such draws. </p><p>  <em>Technoprank</em> </p><p>  This variety is different from the rest.  Telephone hooligans, prankers in this case do not participate in the conversation.  Instead, a record prepared in advance is used.  It can be a clipping from a computer game or other prank, phrases from films or just sounds.  The purpose of this rally is to keep the conversation going.  As a rule, the victim does not realize that he is not talking to a person.  Sometimes pranks use the words of the object of the rally.  Even so, many will not recognize their speech in the recording. </p><p>  <em>Conference Prank</em> </p><p>  A drawing of such a plan has recently appeared.  There are already two victims, and they communicate with each other.  First, a call is made to one person, he is brought to the desired state, and then it is connected to the second participant.  At the same time, both characters are sure that a pranker calls them.  The main point of the conversation is figuring out who is calling whom.  This is the most unpredictable variety, since the duration and format of the conversation can not be controlled by hooligans.  A conversation usually ends when someone hangs up. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Vivid examples of prank </h2>

    <p>  To understand what prank is, it is not necessary to become its victim.  Just watch the famous cartoon about the Simpsons family.  Bart Simpson acts here as a typical pranker.  Unfortunately, this character is loved by children, so children's telephone hooliganism is only gaining momentum. </p><p>  On the Internet, a famous person is Evgeny Volnov.  His direction is trolling ordinary people.  His draws are created in a Western manner.  It's hard to call them hard prank.  He participated in many projects, including trolling for the ‚ÄúWait for me‚Äù program on Channel One.  The best pranks are posted on social networks and on its official website. </p>

Nastya calls to invite on a date.  And many representatives of the stronger sex agree, for which they become the heroes of commercials that are actively watched and listened to on the Internet.  Despite the strange voice, the heroine has a lot of fans who track her adventures.  Volnov himself voices it, his voice is changed using a special program.  Phone bullies call Nastenka the goddess of prankota.

    <h2>  The famous prank character - ‚ÄúATS grandmother‚Äù </h2><p>  The objects of banter were both stars and ordinary inhabitants.  A long-time participant of the prank is ‚ÄúATS grandmother‚Äù.  In March 1988, a senior student in the city of Kemerovo called the telephone exchange to find out if there was a debt on the phone, but dialed the wrong number.  An elderly woman answered.  To the question: ‚ÄúIs this a PBX?‚Äù  responded with selective abuse.  A high school student Roman, along with a friend, recorded several conversations with this woman, who received the nickname ‚ÄúGrandma ATS‚Äù.  Friends managed to make 7 entries, but then the phone number was lost.  Cassettes with her speech passed from hand to hand, and as a result, the tracks were posted on the Internet. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best pranks" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/133/371788.jpg?1397195716125" width="256"></div><br><br>  How to avoid becoming a victim of prankers </h2><p>  First of all, you need to install the caller ID.  This measure will free you from inexperienced phone criminals.  Trolling professionals use IP telephony cards. </p><p>  So, the masters of their craft still got through to you.  In this case, you need to follow a few rules: </p><ul><li>  The reaction should be calm and calm. </li><li>  Do not continue the conversation, just hang up, the prankers will soon get tired of calling you. </li><li>  Do not show your emotions, do not swear, try not to use foul language. </li></ul><p>  Hooligans expect bright emotions from you, if you do not give them to them, then they will cease to be an interesting character for them. </p><p>  Please note that numbers of particularly intractable victims are distributed among prankers.  And in this case, you become the object of not one, but several telephone criminals. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prank raffles" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19190/369497.jpg?1396939701582" width="300"></div>  The secret from <span>Ksenia Borodina:</span> how to behave with prankers </h2><p>  As an example of the correct reaction, we can cite the case of the leading TV project "House 2" Ksenia Borodina.  The callers introduced themselves as Woland and Koroviev, characters from The Master and Margarita.  Mystical characters tried to convince her that her cat was obsessed with demons.  Ksyusha decided that this was a joke of her friends, she reacted with humor.  I did not try to be rude to them, I just played along, not giving free rein to my emotions.  She noted that the characters performed their roles convincingly and originally.  All day, the host asked her friends who they were, Woland or Koroviev.  No one confessed.  As it turned out later, these were professional prankers, which greatly surprised Ksenia. </p><p>  She indicated her attitude to such an occupation clearly negative.  Each person has his own personal life, and no one has the right to cross borders.  For one ridiculous original case, there are hundreds of stupid harassment, the purpose of which is to bring a person to an extreme state.  As a rule, they‚Äôre not calling to cheer you up.  Obscene offers, threats, declarations of love arrive.  For her, prankers are sick people who have nowhere to put their energy. </p><h2><br>  Prank from a legal point of view </h2><p>  In Russia, prankers are hooligans, the fight against which is being conducted by the police, guided by articles of the Criminal Code.  An offense of such a plan amounts to an insulting harassment of citizens.  This is called <span>petty hooliganism.</span>  It is very difficult to collect evidence base in such a case, therefore, as a rule, it is not possible to punish prankers. </p><p>  As for Europe, in this part of the world this is also recognized as a violation of the law, a form of terror.  Violators of the order receive an imposing punishment, a fine or criminal prosecution.  Therefore, there are few people who want to call for the purpose of drawing. </p><h2><br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="telephone draw" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19190/371371.jpg" width="284"></div>  Prank Psychologists </h2><p>  For many people, it does not seem ridiculous to become an object of trolling.  Often, bullying does not pass without a trace for elderly and sick participants.  Psychologists advise to look at this situation from the other side.  Annoying prankers are not really full-fledged personalities.  Surely, they are not too loved by others and are not taken seriously by them.  The inferiority complex is there.  Provoking others anonymously is a way of self-realization.  In fact, these are insecure people or problem teenagers. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Prank is a phenomenon that is very popular in the modern world.  It can be treated differently, badly, well, neutrally, but from this its manifestations are not getting smaller.  In my opinion, the most profitable approach is to perceive with humor, not to take seriously and, if possible, play along.  If this does not work, then remember the words of psychologists about <span>the inferiority complex of</span> prankers and try to regret them.  The most important thing is to protect your nerves and not pay attention to these pranks. </p>
