This is a great way to relax after a hard day.  Ancient art combined with modern animation.  Creating an anime picture by embroidering with a cross according to the character‚Äôs pattern, which will remain nearby when the series is over, is a great opportunity to give yourself a lot of pleasant moments.  Of course, this theme of embroideries on clothes is more suitable for children or adolescents.  But what mother does not want to please her child?  Consider the technique for performing this type of embroidery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.advancedcrossstitch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="anime embroidery pattern" class="if uuid-2809400" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98155/2809400.jpg"></div><h2>  What is an anime? </h2><p>  Today there are few people who have never heard of anime.  This has become part of the lives of many teenagers, children and even adults.  Anime comes from the English word Animation (animation) - this is a Japanese animation with easily recognizable images: big eyes in half faces, incredible hairstyles, bright colors. </p><p>  The first anime began to appear in the early 1900s.  By the beginning of World War II, the style of drawing was controlled by the government, so a technique appeared that was as different as possible from Western cartoons.  Over time, Japanese culture has penetrated the west, winning fans around the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Bright and beautiful characters from Japanese cartoons won the hearts of millions of people, including needlewomen.  The art of embroidery allows you to see your beloved hero nearby, create it with your own hands.  High-quality work will become an original bookmark, decorate clothes or successfully fit into the interior of the room.  Consider the anime cross stitch patterns. </p><h2>  Where to get ready-made? </h2><p>  Works of this style are not the most common, but you can find them if you wish: </p><ul><li>  In the Internet. </li><li>  In the needlework store. </li><li>  At professional masters. </li></ul><p>  You can embroider any picture you like, the main thing is to qualitatively transfer it to the canvas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="embroiderylibrary.ws" data-author=": " data-source="http://embroiderylibrary.ws/doraemon_01_embroidery_design.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch patterns anime characters" class="if uuid-2809293" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98155/2809293.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make an embroidery pattern yourself? </h2><p>  Such schemes are not widely distributed on the Internet or sold in needlework stores.  If you cannot find the desired sample, you can do it yourself. </p><p>  Method 1. Photoshop. </p><p>  Making an anime pattern for cross stitch using Photoshop is easy.  To do this, follow the algorithm of actions: </p><ol><li>  Select the anime picture you want to embroider. </li><li>  Download it into the program and follow the path: ‚ÄúImage‚Äù - ‚ÄúCorrection‚Äù - ‚ÄúPosterize‚Äù.  This will help remove multiple shades of the same color.  The lower the level, the less will be.  In the case of animation schemes, a large number of shades of the same color is not required. </li><li>  Then the image must be filtered.  To do this, you need to go along the path: "Filter" - "Design" - "Mosaic".  If we take the minimum sizes of the squares, then their number will be greater, and in order to eliminate turbidity, it is necessary to apply "Sharpness". </li><li>  This can be stopped, or ruled out the finished scheme into standard 10 * 10 squares.  The Line tool will help. </li><li>  The work is ready, now it remains to print it and choose the colors. </li></ol><p>  Method 2: Pattern Maker </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Download and install Pattern Maker. </li><li>  Add the desired picture to the program.  To do this, go along the path: "File" - "Import Image" - "Browse".  Next, find your image and upload. </li><li>  Then select the function ‚ÄúSet image as background for stroke‚Äù, click ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù. </li><li>  Optionally adjustable contrast and other options. </li><li>  Having activated the magnifying glass, impose a grid on the picture, by clicking on the tab ‚Äú1,2,3‚Äù hold the cursor from one corner of the diagram to another. </li><li>  Choose a color palette yourself or adjust existing ones.  Define a symbol for each color. </li><li>  The circuit is ready.  You can still work with it by adding various techniques. </li><li>  Further "Import".  After that, you can embroider. <div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidery Threads" class="if uuid-2809283" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98155/2809283.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Tips for Beginners </h2><p>  The theme of anime patterns for cross-stitch will be preferred by teenage girls rather than adult and experienced needlewomen, so there are some tips for beginners.  They will help to enjoy the work. </p><p>  The main set of tools for embroidery: </p><ul><li>  Thread floss. </li><li>  Hoop. </li><li>  Canvas. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Lamp. </li><li>  Needles. </li></ul><p>  Recommendations: </p><ol><li>  Canvas "Aida 14" is most convenient, since it has medium-sized crosses. </li><li>  Canvas needs to be bought with a margin.  Cutting off the desired piece from it, it is desirable to overcast the edges. </li><li>  Mark the fabric into 10 * 10 squares. </li><li>  Start embroidering small patterns, immediately do not undertake large ones. </li><li>  Prepare a well-lit place for embroidery, where it is comfortable to sit, enough light, and everything you need (threads, scissors, needles) will be at hand. </li><li>  Wash hands before starting work so as not to stain the picture. </li><li>  It is better to embroider with a full cross, other methods are more difficult. </li><li>  Do not make knots - this will affect the beauty of the wrong side and the durability of the finished work.  A loose thread may come out at the first wash. </li><li>  Sew even crosses.  Do not take too long a thread, otherwise it will be confused. </li><li>  The top stitch should look in the same direction.  The lower half-cross is embroidered from the lower left to the right (looks like this: /), and the upper from the upper left to the lower right (looks like this: \).  The process is better not to get confused. </li><li>  It is more convenient to start embroidery with the color that is most. </li></ol><p>  Embroidery should bring joy, so you need to do the work at your own pace, without competing with anyone.  The main rule is to have fun.  The finished picture can be framed in a baguette by contacting the workshop, or make a frame yourself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="anime cross stitch patterns small" class="if uuid-2809366" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98155/2809366.jpg"></div><h2>  Cross stitch patterns of anime characters for true fans </h2><p>  Cross stitching is painstaking work.  Creating a favorite character from an anime series will bring real pleasure to fans.  When the image of Naruto, Yagami Light, Nami or Luffy will look at you from the wall - this is a wonderful feeling.  By gaining more experience in embroidery, using various techniques, over time, you can recreate memorable events: the battles of the characters of Feri Tail or Code Giass, love dates of the Oran school club and much more. </p><h2>  Examples of work for embroidery </h2><p>  Despite the fact that anime themes are not the most popular among needlewomen, you can find them. </p><p>  Small anime patterns for cross stitch are best suited for the first trial stitches of paintings.  A simple character will allow the skilled worker to understand: whether to continue sewing further.  You can try to create a miniature Alenn Walker from Dee Gray Man.  Pictures are small in size, so they won‚Äôt take much time and effort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch anime patterns" class="if uuid-2811584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98155/2811584.jpg"></div><p>  One of the first animes that hit the screen of the Russian audience was Pok√©mon.  This hero will become a cheerful decoration of the room and a reminder of a cheerful childhood.  The famous Pikachu will charge positively with only one glance at him. </p><p>  Naruto and Sasuke are some of the <span>most popular anime characters.</span>  They will be embroidered in one breath.  Bright and emotional, strong and controversial heroes are a good solution for a more experienced needlewoman. </p><p>  There are sites on the Internet where you can download anime schemes, but they are not always made by masters of their craft.  Often they are created by ordinary fans.  These works are not processed carefully, they have a large color palette that can be easily reduced. </p>
