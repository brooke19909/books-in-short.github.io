    <h2>  Partisan movement </h2><p>  The head of the 94th Skole border detachment - this is the position that Mikhail Naumov was at the beginning of the war.  The Second World War took the future general by surprise.  In the early days of the war, he was surrounded and wounded.  Michael had to stay with the locals to recover.  For the next six months, the young man lived in the occupied lands.  And after recovering, he went to the Hinel forests in the Oryol region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the beginning of 1942, Mikhail Naumov went to the partisans of the Chervony district <span>(Sumy region).</span>  He joined the squad as an ordinary soldier, and after some time became the unit commander.  Then the future general headed the center of the operational composition of the partisan detachments. </p><h2>  Cavalry unit </h2><p>  In early 1943, on the orders of the chief who headed the Ukrainian headquarters of the partisan movement, and on the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (b) U, three groups and four detachments were allocated.  Of them formed a cavalry unit of 650 people.  The new division of the partisan groups was headed by Mikhail Naumov.  His cavalry detachment was assigned several tasks: to raid the southern outskirts of the Sumy region, to eliminate the movement of enemy trains on the sections of Sumy - Kharkov and Sumy - Konotop.  And the ultimate goal is to conduct a military operation in the Kirovograd region. </p>

    <h2>  Sabotage events </h2><p>  In February 1943, headed by M.I.  Naumov's cavalry unit of the partisans went on a raid from the Fatezh district (Kursk region).  Over 65 days of raids, they covered almost 2,400 kilometers in several occupied territories of Zhytomyr, Kiev, Vinnitsa, Odessa, Kirovograd, Kharkov, Poltava, Sumy regions of Ukraine, as well as in the Polessky region of Belarus.  The cavalry unit conducted 47 sabotage and combat operations.  The most significant of them were Andreevskaya, Shevchenkovskaya and Yunkovo-Sumy.  As a result of hostilities, many units of army equipment, as well as hundreds of German officers and soldiers, were destroyed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  New rank </h2><p>  In March 1943, for military service to the country in organizing the movement of partisans, Mikhail Naumov received the Golden Star medal, as well as the <span>Order of Lenin.</span>  Well, and, of course, he was awarded the title of Hero of the USSR. </p><p>  Also, Mikhail Ivanovich was awarded for a successful steppe raid.  In April 1943, he became a major general.  Naumov was almost the youngest military man with a similar rank.  And indeed, his assignment to the senior lieutenant can be called a unique case. </p><p>  After the raid, partisan detachments went to the Khrapuni region (Polesskaya oblast, Belarus).  There, the soldiers re-equipped, re-formed and prepared for further hostilities.  And the commander of the compound M.I.  Naumov had to fly to Moscow for treatment. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the raid in the southern steppe lands of Ukraine carried out by partisan detachments under the command of Mikhail Ivanovich was of great political importance.  First of all, in terms of organizing the struggle of local residents against the invaders. </p>

    <h2>  Second raid </h2><p>  In mid-1943, the Ukrainian headquarters of the partisan movement set a new task for the Naumov unit: the fighters had to raid the Zhytomyr and Kiev regions.  And then move to the Kirovograd lands for a new battle. </p><p>  The second raid lasted from July 12 to December 22.  On the rear of the enemy partisan formation of the hero of this article passed about 2500 kilometers.  It crossed 23 rivers.  The largest of them: Grouse, Sluch, Clean up, Pripyat.  Held 186 military operations.  The most significant were Emilchinskaya and Rachkovskaya in the <span>Zhytomyr region.</span>  Many enemy officers and soldiers were destroyed there, as well as food, ammunition, and weapons were seized.  The strength of the compound of Mikhail Ivanovich increased from 355 to 1975 partisans. </p><p>  In December 1943, Naumov‚Äôs units merged in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGorodnitsa with the troops of the Red Army. </p>

    <h2>  Third raid </h2><p>  Being on the liberated territory, the partisan formation was re-equipped and understaffed.  After a short rest, the troops received a new order from the chief of the Ukrainian headquarters.  Under the command of Naumov, they were to go to the Drogobych region to conduct military operations.  In January 1944, the partisans raided the third.  Advancing with battles in the rear of the enemy, the troops marched through the territory of the Lviv, Drogobych, Ternopol, Rivne regions of Ukraine, as well as the Lublin Voivodeship (Poland).  The compound conducted 72 sabotage and military operations.  In March 1944, Naumov‚Äôs unit met with the Red Army. </p><p>  It is worth noting that Mikhail Ivanovich was the only organizer of the cavalry unit of partisans in Ukraine.  Naumov preferred precisely maneuver warfare.  Therefore, raids became his element.  He repeatedly criticized the partisan commanders, who from 1941 to 1944 were based only in marshy and wooded areas, avoiding raids in the lowland areas. </p>

    <h2>  Life after the Second World War </h2><p>  In 1945, the war ended.  But Mikhail Naumov decided to continue his service.

In 1953, Mikhail Ivanovich was appointed Acting Minister of the Interior.
