The developer - the Oykumena company - has a reputation on the market as a developer, ‚Äúentertainer‚Äù, since all of his projects are distinguished by their unusual appearance and original design.  The <span>residential complex</span> under <span>construction</span> is unique in that it is created as part of a very peculiar project, supervised by the Museum of <span>Street Art.</span>  All facades of the buildings of the complex will be painted with the hands of famous street artists of Russia.  So, who knows, maybe someday many will not only be happy, but also proud that they live in the Graffiti residential complex.  Prices for apartments here are not very affordable, but they are not sky-high.  So if there is a desire to live in such a unique place, then you can pull yourself up and get at least a studio, especially since there are a lot of them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd graffiti" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1286247.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  About the developer </h2><p>  The Oykumena company has been operating in the real estate market since 1997.  Since 2005, it has been actively developing the territories of the North-Western District of St. Petersburg, and Graffiti is its fifth project in the housing segment.  The developer is considered reliable, delivering objects on time.  In addition, the company has its own capacity for the production of building materials, which allows it not to depend on suppliers and build its facilities with minimal costs.  A feature of the developer, as already mentioned, is the creation of original architectural forms and the use of advanced technologies in the construction industry.  Housing provided on the market receives only positive feedback from buyers, and therefore we can conclude: LCD Graffiti (St. Petersburg) is a worthy place that can be considered as an excellent option for buying an apartment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About the complex </h2><p>  The construction of the Graffiti residential complex started in 2013.  It is planned to build 16 buildings in total.  15 - in twenty four floors and one - in ten.  The first was commissioned in 2015.  Customers are invited to purchase in it any of the 200 apartments that they like.  These are studios, 1, 2 and 3-room apartments.  All premises belong to the comfort class, in connection with which they have already been finished.  In total, 482 residential premises were put up for sale, but half of them have already been purchased.  The completion date of the entire complex is 2019.  Construction is carried out using monolithic-brick technology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd graffiti apartment prices" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1286249.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Location of the residential complex "Graffiti" - St. Petersburg, Primorsky district.  The houses will be located at the intersection of Parachute Street with Shuvalovsky Prospect.  The nearest metro station is Komendatsky Prospekt.  Getting to her on foot is quite difficult, but public transport can be reached in 15 minutes. </p><h2>  Ecological situation in Primorsky district </h2><p>  This region is considered in terms of <span>environmental conditions</span> one of the cleanest in the Northern capital.  There are no production facilities, large highways are located at a sufficient distance from the houses, in connection with which residents of the Graffiti residential complex can enjoy fresh air directly from the open windows of their apartments.  Near the buildings there are several parks and a conservation area, which also contributes to clean air and allows you to spend weekends and leisure hours not in the walls of stuffy high-rise buildings, but in nature. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, as evidenced by the reviews available at the moment about the LCD ‚ÄúGraffiti‚Äù, the developer very competently approached the issue of planning.  The fact is that this region is blown by winds from all sides, in addition, air humidity is increased here, since the Gulf of Finland is not so far from the complex.  The developer, on the other hand, arranged the houses in such a way that, upon completion of construction, they will create a space closed from the wind in the complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD graffiti St. Petersburg" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1286271.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Transport connection </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the complex is a 15-minute drive from Komendatsky Prospekt Metro Station.  It cannot be said that it is practically nearby, nevertheless it is quite clear that there are more houses in St. Petersburg than stations.  So to brag that literally from the threshold of the house you can see how proudly the metro symbol shines nearby, few can boast.  Nevertheless, this is not bad, especially taking into account the fact that in parallel with the commissioning of all the facilities, a new station, Shuvalovsky Prospect, will be commissioned.  And then it will be possible to say that the metro is within walking distance from Graffiti. </p><p>  In addition, near the house there is a bus stop and minibus.  I must say that Primorsky is a district with a sufficiently developed transport infrastructure, so the residents of the complex will not have problems with quickly getting to a particular place in the metropolis.  As for motorists, the proximity of the ring and WHSD to help them.  Using these highways, you can get to the center in half an hour, provided that there are no traffic jams, of course, and also leave the city without any problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd graffiti spb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1286250.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  With regard to this issue, here residents of the Graffiti residential complex can immediately after settling in enjoy all the benefits of the existing trade and social infrastructure of the region.  Nearby there are gardens, schools, large chain stores, entertainment centers, cafes and restaurants. </p><p>  In addition, commercial real estate, as well as pharmacies, hairdressers, and offices of several banks, will be located on the first floors of the buildings.  In addition, the developer, in order to improve the quality of life of the inhabitants of the Graffiti residential complex, plans to commission the school building and three kindergartens after all the buildings have been commissioned, which, of course, will be appreciated by all potential clients. </p><h2>  What does the developer offer? </h2><p>  As already mentioned, it is planned to commission 16 residential buildings.  In fact, this is a real neighborhood - LCD "Graffiti".  The layouts of buildings and apartments are very peculiar and have a number of interesting differences.  So, for example, the builder wisely approached the design of entrances.  In some of them there will be living quarters of a more ‚Äúyouthful‚Äù type - studios and ‚Äúodnushki‚Äù, in others - apartments that are often purchased by families with children - two and three bedroom apartments.  Such a division into segments is very profitable, as residents of different ages and interests will not interfere with each other. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd graffiti reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1286259.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe offered apartments is from 26 to 72 squares.  All housing belongs to the comfort class, in connection with which the company's specialists tried to create the most ergonomic and functional layouts of apartments.  All of them are distinguished by the correctness of geometric shapes, in addition, there is a choice, and quite a lot, in terms of the ratio of the areas of kitchens and residential premises.  Bathrooms in all studios and some one-room apartments are combined, while in larger apartments they are separate.  Ceiling height - 2 m 75 cm. Each living room is equipped with a glazed balcony or loggia. </p><p>  Also in the halls there are rooms for a stroller and small pantries.  All apartments completed turnkey works. </p><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  Since the LCD "Graffiti" refers to comfort class housing, all its inhabitants can celebrate a housewarming immediately after settlement.  All necessary finishing work has been carried out in the apartments.  The walls and ceilings are painted, laminate is on the floors of the rooms, and tiled flooring is in the kitchen and in the bathrooms.  All plumbing equipment is installed.  In the window openings there are two-chamber double-glazed windows, in the doorways there is a metal entrance and veneered interior doors.  The kitchen has <span>a sink</span> with a mixer and an electric stove.  All counters are in the hall. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd graffiti layout" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1286270.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  LCD "Graffiti": apartment prices </h2><p>  As for the cost of housing, it is quite acceptable taking into account the fact that the developer ranks his objects in the prestigious comfort class.  So, a studio with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã26 to 28 "squares" can be bought at a cost of two and a half or more than a million rubles.  "Odnushka" - from 35 to 37 square meters.  m - will cost almost four million, "kopeck piece" (60-83 squares) - five and a half, "treshka" area from 70 to 72 square meters.  m will cost more than six million rubles. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What do the reviews of those who have already purchased housing in the complex or are only considering options for buying say about Graffiti?  Residents of new apartments, as a rule, do not present any special complaints.  The finish is high-quality, fully consistent with what the developer stated.  Not everyone likes, of course, that construction is still underway, which, incidentally, will continue for another three years.  However, firstly, four more buildings will be commissioned soon, after which the developer will immediately begin to improve the territory.  And secondly, do not lose sight of the fact that apartments are bought today in the first house of the microdistrict and at the lowest possible price, but what will happen tomorrow with their cost is a big question.  So it‚Äôs better to be patient a bit, especially since it‚Äôs not long. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd graffiti builder" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1286272.jpg" width="600"></div>

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Without exception, everyone is delighted with the infrastructure of the district and they say that they have everything missing.  No one particularly claims to transport links.  In relation to the developer, there is also no discontent.  He answers all questions about the progress of construction and the terms of completion, and the deficiencies found in the rented apartments (which, incidentally, are rare) are eliminated instantly.  As for the cost, no one especially grumbles, everyone is happy with everything and no one considers it overpriced. </p><p>  So by and large the Graffiti residential complex is worthy of acquiring an apartment in it. </p>
