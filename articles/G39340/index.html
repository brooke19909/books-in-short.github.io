  <section class="page js-page"><h1>US Tourism: Views, Main Areas, Development</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As in any large state, tourism is one of the main revenue items in the USA.  Millions of people come to the country every year to get acquainted with culture and sights.  Not only foreigners travel around the country, but also the Americans themselves. </p><h2>  Types of Tourism in the USA </h2><p>  America is a country of vast areas and vast resources.  Therefore, the development of tourism in the United States goes in several directions.  It is worth saying that America ranks second in the world in terms of attendance after Europe.  The annual income of this sector of the economy exceeds one hundred billion dollars a year.  Six types of tourism in the USA prevail: </p><ul><li>  beach; </li><li>  skiing; </li><li>  ecological; </li><li>  event </li><li>  business; </li><li>  sightseeing. </li></ul><p>  In territorial terms, it is impossible to distinguish the main areas of US tourism, each part of the country is notable for its own interesting places and events.  Americans themselves are very respectful of their history and historical monuments, and always, like any nation, in principle, are glad when residents of other states and cultures show interest in their historical lands and events. </p><h2>  Beach tourism </h2><p>  Recreation and tourism of the United States in the view of not only the Americans themselves, but also the guests of the country are inextricably linked to visiting beaches and national water parks.  At any time of the day on the golden coast you can meet people who, hiding behind their hats, peacefully sunbathe in the sand or splash merrily in the warm ocean.  The main directions for lovers of water procedures are known.  This is Miami Beach, Tampa, Palm Beach, located in the hottest state - Florida.  If you want something more exotic, vibrant and fun, you can go to Hawaii.  Among several dozens of the Hawaiian archipelago, you can choose an island to your liking and settle comfortably in one of the many luxury hotels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The California coast, the most popular in the world, is also always happy to welcome travelers.  On the beaches of Santa Barbara, Palm Springs, Long Beach, San Diego, you can even meet Hollywood stars of the first magnitude and supermodels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.psholidayrentals.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ocean shore" class="if uuid-3242160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3242160.jpg"></div><h2>  Ski vacation </h2><p>  There are a lot of beaches in America, but even more ski resorts, which are scattered almost throughout the country, even in California.  Appalachian Mountains is the oldest ski resort located about three hundred kilometers from Boston.  The oldest routes with a length of about forty kilometers are ready to provide tourists with routes of any difficulty level.  The spread of height in these places is from 600 to 900 meters.  It is interesting to spend time here not only for adults.  Children will find entertainment in sports parks, which are considered the largest in America. In the Appalachians, there are about two hundred slopes and 32 lifts.  You can ride all day until you get tired.  It is better for beginners to use the services of professional trainers. </p><p>  One hundred kilometers from New York Albany Airport - and you will find yourself in the delightful Lake Placid Park.  This is a national park with a large number of ski slopes, about thirty, over 40 kilometers long, with modern ski lifts.  For lovers of extreme sports in the form of a snowboard, special tracks are also built.  There are several tracks for regular cross-country skiing.  A distinctive feature of this ski park, almost every American will call sports facilities of the Olympic level. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="everythingrevelstoke.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resort" class="if uuid-3242172" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3242172.jpg"></div><h2>  Ecology and excursions </h2><p>  Cultural tourism in the United States is inextricably linked with visiting attractions, which in America, contrary to popular belief, are also many.  Most tourists do not see any significant cultural monuments, since America is a relatively young country.  And there is something to see. </p><p>  One of the largest parks on the planet - Yellowstone Park - with a length of almost 900 thousand hectares, is a cultural heritage and a kind of geographical miracle.  You need to get out here for at least a couple of days, since in one it is impossible to see many gorges and valleys with a unique landscape that formed millions of years ago as a result of the movement of mainland plates.  A special pleasure is to enjoy the view of rivers and waterfalls.  The height of some reaches one hundred meters and leaves a lasting impression in the soul.  The park has over 200 geysers and hot springs and rich flora and fauna. </p><p>  Another unique park is Bryce Canyon.  It is located in Utah.  The development of transport and tourism in the United States has always gone hand in hand, so it is not difficult for Americans to get anywhere in the country to enjoy the beauty of nature.  Bryce Canyon attracts tens of thousands of tourists every year with its unusual cliffs.  Curious forms formed millions of years ago and still delight the eye with their delicate colors and decent height.  Thin cliffs reach 70 meters in height.  It looks many times more magnificent in winter, when snow covers bizarre rocks that alternate with coniferous forests.  This creates a unique natural pattern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.internationaltraveller.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yellowstone park" class="if uuid-3242174" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3242174.jpg"></div><h2>  Business tourism </h2><p>  Well, who did not dream of going to New York, this eternally peppy business city?  US international tourism has always considered visiting the Big Apple to be something special, because the energy of one of the largest cities in America is over the top.  The Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, Broadway - all these city sights require special, respectful, attention. </p><p>  The capital is Washington, the most visited American city.  White marble is everywhere, extensive parks, fountains and ponds create a special atmosphere.  Washington is a concentration of attractions.  Getting to know the city is best started from Capitol Hill.  This is the central point of the city, from which a few dozen meters is almost the main attraction of the capital - the obelisk to the first US president George Washington.  This is the tallest building in the city with an excellent observation deck.  A bird's eye view offers panoramic views of the city, the Potomac River, the Greek-style temple. </p><p>  The temple has 36 columns.  That was the number of states at the time of President Lincoln’s death. </p><p>  Washington has the National Wax Museum and the Museum of American History. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kids.nationalgeographic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The capital of the USA" class="if uuid-3242158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3242158.jpg"></div><h2>  Entertainment and events </h2><p>  There is a special part of tourists who consider traveling exclusively on one plane - visiting entertainment events and entertainment.  In America, during the year, there are many large-scale music events, air shows, car races, theatrical performances, beer festivals and much, much more.  Large events, as a rule, are held in different states in order to enable residents of other regions to travel around the country and get to know it in more detail, because many people live within their state for years and cannot get out without any reason at all.  The main events of the year are: </p><ul><li>  Cowboy Poetry Festival in Elko; </li><li>  Winter Carnival in Minnesota, which is famous for its "Siberian" frost; </li><li>  Daytona Beach Florida Auto Racing; </li><li>  Washington Jazz Festival; </li><li>  500 miles Indianapolis auto racing. </li></ul><p>  This also includes the Coachella Music Festival, which takes place in California.  Music lovers from all over the world come to him annually to listen to music, chat and make new friends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.acmehouseco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palm springs road" class="if uuid-3242159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3242159.jpg"></div><h2>  Bars and Restaurants </h2><p>  Tourism in the USA cannot be imagined without a hot dog or bacon burger, a national treasure of the food industry.  Food has grown into a completely separate, gastronomic part of the tourism business, and for quite some time travel companies have been offering tourists exclusively gastronomic tours.  Such trips are popular especially among people whose life is connected with the preparation or production of food. </p><p>  Strong drinks in America are sold and served far from everywhere.  Mostly the bar menu is limited to wine and beer.  Beer is presented in a huge assortment.  But the best wine is to be found in California, where the most famous vineyard in America is located - Napa Valley. </p><p>  American food is, for the most part, fast food.  In the search for unusual combinations, the Americans have achieved tremendous success, so if you are on a short train in America, you should try as many different burgers as possible, which you will not find anywhere else in the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.businessinsider.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="american burger" class="if uuid-3242169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3242169.jpg"></div><h2>  Children's entertainment </h2><p>  Tourism in the United States is aimed at children's entertainment.  What is worth only Disney Park in Orlando.  There are performances and carousels, dozens of types of slides that will appeal to active adults, all kinds of sweets and themed souvenirs.  To see everything, to participate in all quests and games, one day is not enough.  If you are going on such a trip, plan a minimum of three days so that you will remember your vacation for a lifetime. </p><div class="photo" data-original="disneyparks.disney.go.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Disney park" class="if uuid-3242157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3242157.jpg"></div><h2>  Individual tours </h2><p>  A few years ago, a new trend emerged in the tourism business - individual tours.  This means that for a certain amount of money experienced guides will form your route, taking into account the individual wishes of the client.  You only need to correctly state all your “Wishlist”, and the tour operator will offer you several options for rationalized routes that will significantly save time and money, as opposed to independently planning a trip, because tourism in the United States is very diverse and it is very easy to succumb to temptations and turn off the intended path. </p>
