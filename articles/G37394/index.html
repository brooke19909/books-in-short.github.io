Reviews and recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Crimea has always been considered a children's health resort.  On this small peninsula caressed by the sun, there are two climatic zones, and it is washed by the waters of two seas - Azov and Black.  The main part of it is dominated by a temperate climate, and the section closed between the Sudak and Foros, closed by the Crimean Mountains, is subtropics.  It remains only to choose where to go on vacation in the Crimea with a child. </p><p>  Reviews of doctors are unequivocal: with children it is preferable to stay in the temperate zone - so they will need less time for acclimatization.  The southern coast of Crimea is more focused on adult recreation. <strong><br></strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in crimea with a child reviews" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15539/256896.jpg" width="389"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Solar Evpatoria</strong> </p><p>  A very good solution would be to choose Evpatoria for vacation.  It is easily accessible from Simferopol, where vacationers usually arrive.  This is important for those couples who want to spend their <span>holidays in Crimea with a child.</span>  <span>Reviews of</span> tourists say that the city can be reached by bus or electric train in 2 hours.  You can take a taxi, it will take about an hour. </p><p>  The city is located on the shores of the <span>Gulf of Kalamits.</span>  Beautiful beaches lined with coarse sand stretch for many kilometers, going far beyond the city.  Descent into the sea is flat and gentle.  In shallow water, the water warms up quickly, so families willingly come here even with very young children.  Streets and squares are densely planted with vegetation; conifers make up a large share of green spaces.  The unique combination of sea air and the aroma of pine needles has a beneficial effect on children's health. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can settle down for a vacation both in a sanatorium, which has more than 80 in the city, and in the private sector, renting housing at very affordable prices.  This is important for those who prefer an inexpensive vacation in Crimea with a child.  Reviews about the living conditions are good, they can host guests here. </p><p>  The city was originally built up as a children's resort, the proportion of children's places in the sanatoriums of Yevpatori reaches 73%.  During an independent holiday with children, you can purchase a heading and take the kids to the procedures. </p><p>  Evpatoria offers a lot of entertainment that will appeal to both children and adults: this is a visit to the Chocolate Museum, and an exciting performance at the Dolphinarium, and "Glade of Fairy Tales" in Frunze Park.  Older children are willing to visit a crocodile farm with their parents, and even take pictures with dangerous reptiles.  And in the heat of the day you can go out of town to the water park "Banana Republic". </p>

    <p>  Many can not imagine a vacation on the peninsula without the Black Sea.  But there is another Crimea.  Rest with a small child on the Azov coast is a great option for those who are limited in means.  There are a lot of advantages: the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov is shallow, it warms up quickly, and at the end of May the temperature is about +20 ¬∞ C. The beaches are sandy, the entrance to the sea is convenient, children can run barefoot all day on the edge of the coast. </p><p>  Some parents doubt whether it is worth spending a vacation in Crimea with a child.  Reviews from numerous families who have been there say that we must safely go on a journey.  On this fabulous peninsula you can not only relax and improve your health, but also gain experience until next year.  And then again return to the Crimea. </p>
