Especially if the object is located in a large city.  In this case, you must contact the banks.  Each credit institution offers its own conditions for processing the transaction.  Sberbank has favorable offers. </p><p>  The procedure for obtaining a mortgage is quite complicated.  Often applications are rejected.  The reasons for the refusal of a mortgage in Sberbank can be various.  Often this occurs due to insufficient income, poor credit history and non-compliance. </p><h2>  Reasons for refusal </h2><p>  Not everyone knows how to approve a mortgage at Sberbank.  The reasons for the refusal can be found after the decision of the bank.  This takes into account the marital status, income, credit history of the client, as well as many other factors.  It is important whether a person has property that can be used as a guarantee of payment.  If there is any doubt about the borrower, then there should be a denial of a mortgage at Sberbank. </p>

    <p>  Why this happened, the bank is not required to report.  This is enshrined in Art.  821 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, according to which the creditor may refuse the transaction in the presence of certain circumstances.  But customers need to know the reasons for the denial of a mortgage at Sberbank.  After all, this has an effect on further actions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Borrower Requirements </h2><p>  How to find out why Sberbank refused a mortgage?  To do this, you need to familiarize yourself with the requirements for borrowers: </p><ul><li>  Age.  When submitting an application, a person must be over 21 years old, and at the time of the last payments he must not be more than 75 years old. </li><li>  Income.  It must be official and permanent.  For registration, a highly paid job is required. </li><li>  Lack of criminal record.  Otherwise, such clients cannot get a mortgage.  A small probability of a positive outcome is with a conditional conviction. </li></ul>

    <p>  Banks may have other requirements for borrowers.  For example, you need to provide the necessary list of documents.  In many institutions, a 2-personal income tax certificate is considered mandatory, but not everyone can provide it. </p><h2>  Non compliance </h2><p>  Each institution has its own requirements for borrowers.  The reasons for the refusal of a mortgage in Sberbank may lie precisely in this.  Work experience at the last job of 6 months may also be required.  Sometimes you need a total working time of at least 1 year. </p><p>  Only if all the requirements are met, you can apply for <span>a mortgage.</span>  Only then can a positive decision be expected. </p><h2>  Insolvency </h2><p>  The cost of real estate is quite high, so a client must have a good income to get a mortgage.  The average amount in the country is different every year, but now it is about 35 thousand rubles.  In some regions, it may be more or less. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__zaa"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__zaa"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__zaa"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__zaa"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__zaa"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Sberbank takes into account the solvency of borrowers.  The maximum mortgage payments should not exceed 30% of the income of working people in the family.  Living wages for unemployed people are deducted from it.  If the income does not fit the required threshold, then a mortgage denial will follow.  Sberbank of 2016 has the same reasons for such transactions as in previous years. </p><p>  This can be fixed if you increase the amount of the first payment, which is usually 20%.  The larger the amount, the less you will have to pay every month.  As a result, the size of payments is reduced to the level needed for a positive response from the bank. </p><h2>  Credit history </h2><p>  If a refusal on a mortgage came, Sberbank may not notify the reasons for such a decision.  They may be in the credit history.  If customers paid loans on time, then they are likely to approve a mortgage.  When considering the application, all the nuances are taken into account.  The reasons for failure include: </p><ul><li>  Delays in the payment of loans issued at any financial institution.  If there were no timely payments in one structure, very often other organizations refuse to receive a mortgage. </li><li>  Recently issued small loans.  For example, loans on the phone.  This may cause doubts about the solvency of the borrower. </li></ul><p>  To change the credit history, current loans must be paid on time.  Perhaps in the future it will turn out to issue a mortgage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Documents </h2><p>  The reasons for the refusal of a mortgage in Sberbank may be due to incorrectly executed or fake documents.  All information that is transmitted to the bank upon application is verified.  If false information is revealed, then the client will not be given a mortgage.  When filling out an application, information should be reviewed, check them for errors, blots. </p>

    <p>  Men should have a military ID with them, which should indicate the passage of service in the army, the reasons for the delay.  If fake documents are used to obtain a loan, then such a person may be blacklisted.  Then no financial institution can issue a mortgage.  This applies to all documents. </p><h2>  Debts in tax and traffic police </h2><p>  Why is a mortgage denied?  Sberbank may not give a reason, but customers should be aware that this is due to a debt to the traffic police or tax. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, you should pay fines and other fees.  You can check their availability and deposit funds through various services - special sites, payment systems, terminals and ATMs.  If there are no debts, then you can apply for a loan. </p><h2>  Health status </h2><p>  Why did Sberbank refuse a mortgage to a payday client?  This may be due to non-compliance or insufficient income.  Sometimes a failure occurs due to a state of health.  Usually they do not allow to issue a mortgage to pregnant women, as well as to those people who are treated for a long period in a hospital.  You can‚Äôt get a mortgage for illness or disability. </p><h2>  Real Estate Liquidity </h2><p>  A lot of demands are made on the pledge.  Low liquidity also becomes the reason for the refusal of mortgages.  Property valuation is carried out by specialists.  The bank must be sure that the mortgage will be paid.  In case of non-payment of real estate is sold, and the proceeds will cover the debt. </p>

    <p>  The following requirements apply to real estate: </p><ul><li>  the location of the facility in the region where the branches operate; </li><li>  year of construction - not earlier than 1965; </li><li>  type of facility - comfortable housing; </li><li>  lack of encumbrances, debts, illegal redevelopment. </li></ul><p>  Typically, banks do not provide loans for rooms in communal apartments and dormitories.  Difficulties arise with objects located in remote regions.  Sberbank may refuse to issue a mortgage due to a mismatch in the formation of the position, an unpresentable appearance, and dangerous work. </p><h2>  What to do in case of failure? </h2><p>  Although the rejection is considered unpleasant for the client, you should not despair.  Usually, Sberbank reviews applications, and therefore in the future it can make a positive decision.  And in order to prevent failure, its cause should be eliminated.  For example, get a more paid job or find an object at a bargain price. </p><p>  If the reasons for rejection are negative credit history, then it should be corrected.  It deteriorates not only due to late payment of loans, but also due to technical errors and inattentive attitude of bank employees.  To correct errors, you need to contact the financial institution with the appropriate application.  If the client did not pay the loan on time, then he should do it in a timely manner to correct the situation.  After that, you can apply again. </p><p>  You can find a new property.  The facility must be suitable for the requirements of the bank.  It should be borne in mind that financial institutions more easily provide large loans for the purchase of a comfortable apartment than small loans for the purchase of a village house. </p><p>  Sometimes borrowers use consumer loans to buy real estate.  Although the amount may not be enough, it will cover most of the price of the property.  To obtain a consumer loan, the borrower needs to provide a few documents compared to a mortgage. </p><p>  You can apply to other banks.  Each organization has its own requirements for customers.  If one was a refusal, then the other may have a positive decision. </p><p>  If banks do not issue a mortgage due to low income, then the borrower has the right to raise additional guarantees, for example, inviting co-borrowers or guarantors.  The first can be only close relatives, and the second - wealthy individuals.  The client can pay a large down payment or provide other material values ‚Äã‚Äãas a security.  Then a review of the decision is possible. </p><h2>  Credit brokers </h2><p>  Many turn to loan brokers who provide assistance in obtaining a mortgage.  But keep in mind that for this work you will have to pay a commission. </p>

    <p>  The services of brokers are perfect for: </p><ul><li>  citizens who do not have time to collect documents, perform other formalities; </li><li>  borrowers who have been refused credit in several organizations. </li></ul><p>  If the above tips did not help, then you need to remember that loans are issued for other family members.  Perhaps someone is more suited to the requirements of the bank.  For most, a mortgage provides the only opportunity to purchase their home, so you need to draw up it responsibly.  No need to despair in case of refusal, because in the future, probably, it will turn out to take a loan. </p>
