It is this detail that is the basis for this type of toy.  The first thing that is required is to execute the template.  Using a compass, draw a circle on the cardboard.  Its diameter will be equal to the size of the pompom.  Inside the large circle, outline the same small figure (approximately 2-3 centimeters in diameter).  Fold the cardboard in half and cut two identical pieces.  On one side, cut through each part.  The photo above shows how the template should look. </p><p>  The next step is winding the threads.  Lay the circles one on top of another and wind the yarn tightly and evenly over the entire surface of the pattern.  It should be noted that the tangle that you take for work should not be large, otherwise it will not crawl through the internal hole of the template.  Consider this point: the thicker the layer of thread you wrap, the more magnificent and beautiful the ball will turn out.  For the manufacture of toys from pom-poms with your own hands, just such details are needed. </p><p>  Next, carefully cut the scissors in a circle in a circle around the outer edge of the product.  Between the cardboard circles, put a piece of yarn, tighten it and fasten the knot.  It should turn out so that the whole bunch of threads from which the main part of the pompom is made is tied exactly in the middle.  Now remove the pattern, and straighten the soft ball.  That's all.  One pompon is ready! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make toys from pompons" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/341782.jpg" width="355"></div>

Most often, such elements serve as paws, ears, noses of animals.  How to make a small ball?  It is almost impossible to make it on a cardboard template.  The needlewomen came up with a different elementary method.  Take an ordinary fork and wrap yarn around the teeth with a tight ring.  Then enter the scissors under the layer of thread and cut them in one place.  Tie the bundle in the middle in the same way as described above.  Spread the little pompon. </p><p>  For those who do not want to tinker with the execution of templates each time, we recommend that you purchase a special device for making pompons in the needlework store  It consists of four plastic molds.  Clips allow you to configure the device to make <span>balls of thread of</span> different diameters. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Soft toys from pompons.

    <h2></h2><h2>  Instruction manual </h2><p>  From yellow yarn, make two balls of different sizes.  Sew these parts together.  Attach two dark beads to the small pompom that serves as the head of the toy.  These are the eyes of the chicken.  From the orange or red felt, cut out two triangular parts, from them form a beak.  On the pompom, which is larger (serves as the body), sew wings made of felt or feather.  Now make the paws. </p><p>  Cut out an oval from cardboard, paste over it with orange felt (or any other cloth).  Attach a chicken to this stand.  So the toy will be stable.  A soft figure can be supplemented with decorative elements: a hat, a bow, a bow tie. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Caterpillar made of colored <span>pompons.</span>  <span>How to make</span> such a soft toy? </h2><p>  Make six identical-sized balls of yarn of different colors and one slightly larger than the rest.  This large pompom will serve as the head of the caterpillar.  Tie the pieces together at the ends of the threads that bundles were tied during the formation of the balls.  If you cut them off - it doesn‚Äôt matter.  Pompons can be sewn together.  Make buttons out of buttons or beads.  Next, follow the foot.  To do this, weave braids from threads or crochet chains of air loops about 8-10 centimeters in size.  Two such blanks are required for each ball.  Fold them in half and sew on to the pompons below.  You can put a bead on each foot. </p><p>  Such a caterpillar will definitely please the baby.  It will perform not only a game function, but also a development one.  Why?  During manipulations with such an object, the baby learns to distinguish colors, develops <span>fine motor skills of</span> hands, <span>tactile sensations.</span>  So, dear mother-needlewomen, literally in an hour you can make a toy that is not only beautiful, but also very useful for your baby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make toys from pompons" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/341785.jpg" width="600"></div>
