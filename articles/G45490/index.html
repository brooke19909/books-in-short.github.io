    <h2>  Museon - what is it? </h2><p>  This place is officially called an art park.  Among the people, he has one more name, the national name is the cemetery of sculptures.  Indeed, the history of the creation of the park begins in the 90s of the last century.  At that time, it was decided to get rid of some of the monuments glorifying Soviet power, leaders and figures of a bygone era.  In 1992, a landscaped green area was allocated for the transportation of statues, located not far from the Tretyakov Gallery and the <span>Central House of Artists.</span>  The Museon (art park) is located in a relatively small area - only 24 hectares.  Today there are 700 sculptures and compositions.  What is striking, the monuments of Soviet culture here peacefully coexist with the works of modern authors. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Museon Park: how to get there by public transport </h2><p>  A walk among the original monuments is not difficult to combine with excursions to the historical center of Moscow.  The nearest metro stations to the park are Kropotkinskaya and Polyanka.  The distance from them to the attractions of interest to us is about the same.  But if you want to see as many interesting things as possible, it makes sense to go to Kropotkinskaya.  So, we arrive at the necessary station, but where is the Museum Museum, how to get to this place?  Tune in for a short walk.  From the subway you need to climb into the city using the exit to the Cathedral of Christ the Savior.  Next you need to get to Volkhonka street.  If you find the right way, the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and the square will be on the right.  Next, you need to go through the territory of this cult religious building and then move along the pedestrian bridge across the Moscow River <span>(Patriarchal Bridge).</span> </p><p>  Next, you need to focus on the <span>monument to Peter I,</span> from afar you will see the abundance of greenery at its foot, this is the Museum Museum.  Do not be afraid not to find the right place.  Near the monument to the great sovereign, beautiful flowerbeds and lawns begin, here you can see the cafe "Shardam".  As soon as you read this sign, you can be sure that you are there!  For those who are afraid of getting lost, we recall that the Museum Museum has the following address: Moscow, <span>Krymsky Val</span> Street <span>,</span> ow.  2. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The most interesting exhibits </h2><p>  Even if you do not like to be photographed with sights, do not forget to charge the camera well before this walk.  Among the huge number of sculptures installed in the park, everyone will find at least some of the most interesting and attractive for themselves.  In ‚ÄúMuseon‚Äù you can see the creations of recognized masters of their era, such sculptors as V. Mukhina, S. Merkulov, E. Vuchetich.  Lovers of Soviet art will especially like this place.  The image of the <span>coat of arms of the USSR</span> in the historical part of the park is found at almost every step, it is also impossible to count the number of sculptural portraits of Lenin and Stalin.  Museon Park in Moscow should be visited not only for the sake of receiving a portion of aesthetic pleasure.  This is a full-fledged <span>open-air museum,</span> next to each sculpture there is a sign indicating the author and the name of the work. </p>

    <h2>  A place where sculptures of different styles and times meet </h2><p>  In addition to the "classic" portrait portraits in height and busts of famous figures of past times, other sculptures can be seen in the park.  There are completely ‚Äúnon-Soviet‚Äù images of naked women, and touching children's figures, as well as images of literary and fairy-tale heroes, in the Museon.  You can also see original avant-garde monuments here.  The sculptures presented in this green zone are made in various techniques and styles.  Monuments and sculptural groups are distinguished by the materials used.  "Museon" (art park) is a unique place in which a huge number of art monuments are collected, including historical ones. </p>
