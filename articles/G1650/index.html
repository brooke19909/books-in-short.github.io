Origami - simple entertainment for children and adults</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How to make a <span>tank with your own hands</span> in three minutes, for sure, everyone who likes to create unusual crafts will want to know.  It is to such people with tireless imagination that this article is dedicated.  Origami is an incredibly popular hobby that is rightfully considered an ancient art.  Creating various crafts from an ordinary sheet of paper, children develop fine motor skills and imagination, while adults are distracted from everyday problems, relieve stress and cheer up. </p><p>  It is almost impossible to surprise a modern child with a simple piece of paper and some products from it.  But still, there are methods to combat the ever-growing popularity of computer entertainment.  Here is just one of the few tricks.  Everyone knows how to make an airplane.  A simple model is created in just six movements.  But such an assembly is extremely unreliable, and the flight range is not the best.  The most popular is the one that is collected in 15 movements.  Such a glider can fly for a rather long time, and even maintains a trajectory more or less.  Almost everyone knows how to fold airplanes.  But did anyone think how to make a tank with their own hands?  All that is needed is to read our instructions, not to be lazy, to have a couple of sheets of paper and a desire to teach the child to craft interesting crafts with his own hands. </p><p>  On the Internet there are lots of recommendations on <span>how to make a tank out of paper,</span> so everyone can choose a model that will appeal to him.  You can even learn how to make a tank from a coupon for travel on the bus.  As a rule, the videos show models that are incredibly difficult to create, but there are also simple ones that any child (with minimal parental help) will collect if desired.  Learn how to make a tank of paper in three minutes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We need two sheets of paper, the first smaller (3 cm * 5 cm) and the second, respectively, larger (27 cm * 5 cm).  The color of the paper does not matter, this moment depends only on your imagination.  The first step is to put a large sheet with the narrow side facing you.  We bend inward and unbend back in turn all four corners of the rectangle.  As a result, at each end of the sheet we get a crease resembling the letter ‚ÄúX‚Äù.  Now we need to assemble the corners so that as a result we have a multilayer triangle.  To do this is simple, just fold the two inner corners to the center of the impromptu letter ‚ÄúX‚Äù.  We collect and slightly press down.  On the other side of the rectangle, repeat the same procedure, but on the reverse side.  As a result, we get a kind of arrow in two planes and each consists of a two-layer triangle.  Now we take one edge of the ‚Äúarrow‚Äù and bend the corners of the ‚Äúupper‚Äù triangle so that we get a rhombus (only 2 movements).  On the back of the "arrow" you need to bend the corners of the upper triangle inward so as to get a rhombus with a flat surface.  It is easy to guess that these ‚Äúrhombuses‚Äù became like two parts of the same castle, and this is true.  So now we raise these two ends of the "arrow" and connect with each other.  We get an arc with closed valves, which assume the function of a tower.  The tank is 90% ready!  It remains to install the barrel.  This is where a small piece of paper sheet comes in handy.  We turn it into a tube and mount it in the "tower".  Here is the easiest way to make a paper tank.  Children are happy with this ‚Äútrick‚Äù and almost everyone wants to learn this simple thing.  Now everyone can form their own <span>tank division.</span> </p><p>  There are many videos on the Internet about how to make a tank from a one-dollar bill with your own hands or how to make a tank from a napkin.  These methods guarantee the surprise of everyone around absolutely any age.  Just choose the difficulty level.  Notice that the higher the difficulty, the greater the similarity.  And if you show at a party in 2 minutes how to make a tank out of paper, then you are guaranteed a good mood and the lion's share of attention.  Take a piece of paper and try it! </p>
