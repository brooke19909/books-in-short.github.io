This settlement with a fairly small area is known primarily for the production of vinegar and palm wine.  But for some time now, Wadduva has become Sri Lanka's most visited resort.  The city has earned such popularity due to its beautiful beaches stretching for eight kilometers, the purest water of the Indian Ocean, tropical gardens, huge plantations of coconut palms and cinnamon, whose aroma literally hovers in the air. </p>

    <h2>  Hotels in Wadduwa </h2><p>  Tours to this resort have, for some time now, become very popular with our compatriots - beach vacation lovers.  Wadduwa hotels are located on the beach quite far from each other.  Thus, guests are provided with silence and privacy. </p><p>  The resort got its name from local doctors: the Vedas lived in this area.  Today, they have been replaced by experienced specialists working in SPA salons and health centers, offering tourists yoga classes, Ayurvedic treatments and meditation. </p><p>  In general, there are few hotels in Wadduwa.  Among them there are very large hotel complexes with their own SPA salons, and cheaper mini-guest houses.  Almost all accommodation options, regardless of category, are built on the coast, although with rare exceptions.  Some hotels are located far from the bathing area, for example, Kumbukgahawatta Hotel.  They have their own, already existing contingent of holidaymakers who need isolation and peace on vacation.  For those who plan not only to swim and sunbathe, but also to travel to local attractions, relatively inexpensive three-star hotels, for example, Villa Ocean View 3 *, are most suitable. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  This hotel complex, located on the west coast of Sri Lanka, in the Wadduwa region, has two categories.  The three-story building, in which rooms with increased comfort are equipped, is positioned as a four-star. </p>

There is all the necessary furniture.  The staff is helpful and always smiling.  As for nutrition, no one has any complaints, although the menu, of course, does not have beef and pork.  But a lot of chicken dishes and an abundance of exotic fruits. </p><p>  The area is very green, comfortable.  In the evenings you can walk among tropical plants.  A lot of positive words were said about the sea, although some tourists were unlucky, and they lived in a hotel in the rainy season, however, this category of tourists does not regret that they arrived.  Here you can often witness a wedding celebration, as the hotel is very popular among Europeans as a place to get married. </p>

    <p>  Many advantages that Russians celebrate at Villa Ocean View Hotel 3 *.  Sri Lanka in recent years has become quite a sought after destination for tour operators.  And a lot of this contributes to the amazing atmosphere that prevails in the hotels of this country.  Nevertheless, there are drawbacks: the Russians living in it note a small room area, a ban on the removal of products from the restaurant (they are fined for this) and high waves in the ocean, regardless of the season. </p>
