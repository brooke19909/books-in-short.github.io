The hotel positions itself as a five-star.  It is two hundred meters from the sea.  It opened in 2005.  It is believed that the hotel is in the most idyllic and romantic place.  Holidays in Utord - the so-called village and the beach of the same name - does not at all resemble the usual pastime in the state of Goa, about which so many legends go.  The Russians began to travel there only recently, therefore, in order to study comfort and service in this complex, we analyzed only the reviews of recent years.  So, what attracts tourists to the hotel <span>Royal Orchid</span> Beach Resort spa 5 *? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal Orchid Beach Resort spa 5" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1802001.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  India, South Goa.  Utorda </h2><p>  This is a great place for a relaxing holiday.  Utorda Beach is called by many the pearl of South Goa.  Despite this seemingly banal characteristic, many tourists share this opinion.  The fact is that on this beach you can still find that pristine exotic beauty, for which tourists go to Goa.  The beach is located between two coasts - Majorda and Arossim.  Its natural boundaries are rivers flowing into the ocean.  There are many palm trees, which not only creates the shadow necessary for vacationers, but also gives the beach a resemblance to advertising posters.  The scenery here is simply incredible.  Unlike the ‚Äúhippar‚Äù North Goa, people with average incomes, couples with children, come here.  Hotels are often located directly on the beach or in the immediate vicinity.  The real resort atmosphere reigns here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where is </h2><p>  Royal Orchid Beach Resort spa 5 is located among tropical greenery, near the ocean.  Next to it is Calangute and Colvia.  <span>Goa International Airport</span> and Magdaon Railway Station are not too far, no more than twenty kilometers.  This means that you do not have to worry about a long transfer, and if you get to the hotel on your own, then this is easy enough.  From <span>Dabolim Airport,</span> you take a bus to Majorda, and from there you will be there by rickshaw or other public transport in a few minutes.  The hotel is somewhat out of the way.  Therefore, if you want to buy fruit at the local market, then you will have to get to the nearest village either by taxi or on foot along the shore.  And this is about an hour's go.  Therefore, it is better to carry out such sorties in the evenings when it is not too hot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Royal Orchid Beach Resort spa 5 reviews" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1801988.jpg" width="600"></div>
