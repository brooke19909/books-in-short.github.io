    <h2>  How not to be deceived with the grace period </h2><p>  It is important for card recipients to know that the grace period only works if non-cash payments are made for different goods and services.

This is actually not the case. </p><p>  Mandatory payment amounts are paid every month on the date that appears in the reporting period, determined by the date the credit card was received.  For this reason, even if the purchase is made a day before the reporting date by card, in order to comply with the program conditions, it is required to pay the required amount on the day of payment.  In this case, during the entire <span>grace period,</span> it will be possible to repay the debt without overpaying interest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mail bank credit card terms and conditions reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47818/2072147.jpg"></div>
