In this old park, just a huge number of all kinds of exotic plants are collected.  The arboretum is located almost in the very center of the city, on a hillside.  This place, according to most guests of the main resort of the country, is really very interesting. </p>

    <h2>  What was the cableway built for? </h2><p>  The inconvenience of the Sochi arboretum, according to many vacationers, is only one.  In order to inspect the exotic plants of this park, tourists have to climb the mountain.  Which, of course, in the heat can be quite difficult.  And especially for the elderly or children. </p><p>  Therefore, in the last century, the Sochi administration decided to build a <span>cable car, the</span> terminal station of which was the top of the arboretum hill.  For several decades now, thanks to the presence of this object, tourists have the opportunity to comfortably reach the highest point of the park and inspect plants, not climbing a mountain, but going down from it. </p>

    <h2>  Property Description </h2><p>  The cable car <span>(Sochi, arboretum)</span> has a total length of 908 meters.  In total, there are two stations at it - the initial and the final.  They are located on special platforms, arranged inside huge towers.  The starting station of the road is 500 meters from the main entrance to the park.  Ultimate - on the top of the hill.  Both towers are equipped with viewing platforms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In total, the path from the lower to the upper station takes only about 4 minutes, but tourists are very attracted by the cable car to Sochi (arboretum). </p><p>  The height of the upper tower at the level of the terminal station is 170 meters and the majority of Sochi visitors consider the trip in trailers above the park at a bird's eye view very interesting. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The construction of this road began in 1972.  The author of her project was engineer B. Guryanov.  Finished construction in 1977. </p><p>  Initially, the cable car (Sochi, arboretum) was not quite the same as it is now.  In 2006, its large-scale reconstruction was carried out, during which the wooden fences of the upper station were replaced.  Instead, they installed metal, much better in harmony with concrete supports.  The decoration of all structural elements of the road was also changed and some other types of work were performed.  From Soviet times, only bulk floors with flat stones at the station sites remained at this facility. </p>

    <p>  In the 70s, beautiful views opened from both towers of the arboretum cable car.  Later, however, many high-rise buildings were built in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe initial station.  Therefore, today you can admire the city landscapes of Sochi and the sea only from the top observation deck.  It is located in a tier above the terminal station. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Viewpoint </h2><p>  Unfortunately, far from all tourists know about the existence on the upper tower of the cable car of a specially equipped place for exploring the surroundings.  Upon arrival at the terminal station, most vacationers immediately descend to the Sochi Arboretum.  The cable car runs daily and can demonstrate many beauties, so experienced tourists are advised to visit the arboretum observation deck all the same.  The views from here are really amazing. </p><p>  In order to get to the site from the terminal station, you just need to climb a tier higher along a convenient concrete staircase.  Actually the site itself is fenced with a reliable parapet of classic design.  Inside it, on a special concrete column, large binoculars are fixed.  Inspecting the city with this optical equipment is not too expensive.  To use binoculars, you just need to put a 100 or 50 ruble bill in a special receiver on the column. </p>

    <p>  Reviews about this interesting service on the observation deck of the arboretum are mixed among tourists.  For some, the opportunity to look at the significant architectural objects of the city from a bird's eye view through binoculars seems very attractive.  Other vacationers believe that this service is too expensive, and the binoculars themselves are not particularly high-quality (with a 20-fold increase and a small viewing angle). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What can be seen </h2><p>  Great views from the observation deck of the cable car open almost at any time.  But the best thing, of course, is to visit her in fine weather.  On such days, not only the city and the sea are visible from here, but also the snow-capped mountains.  For example, tourists have the opportunity to look at the famous Akhun, whose height is more than 600 meters.  Sea view opens from the south side of the site. </p><h2>  Upper tower </h2><p>  Of course, the cable car (Sochi, arboretum) is very reliable and absolutely safe.  Its supports installed in the park are made of durable steel.  They are painted green.  Such a design was chosen, apparently, so that these not particularly attractive designs were less noticeable against the background of the park‚Äôs vegetation. </p><p>  There are two stairs in the upper tower of the road.  One of them is open, and from it, like from the observation deck, almost the entire city of Sochi is visible. </p>

    <p>  The second staircase goes to the center of the tower.  She has a little march already, and there are practically no views from her.  Tourists use it mainly in bad weather or when there are too many people on the open staircase.  Also, this option, of course, is better for those who are afraid of heights.  If you wish, you can go from one staircase to another right inside the tower.  For this, special platforms are provided. </p><h2>  Cableway (Sochi, arboretum): description of the lower tower </h2><p>  In order to buy a ticket for the arboretum of the arboretum, as already mentioned, from its main entrance you need to go a little deeper into the city.  The lower cableway station is a completely unusual structure in design.  As conceived by the architect, it was erected as a stylization of a large tree.  Once the top tower had such a design.  However, during the reconstruction, its design was completely changed. </p><p>  According to many Sochi guests, the design of the lower tower, in comparison with the upper, is much more creative.  Finishing the parapets of the stairs and facades of the structure itself is stylized as baobab wood.  In the form of thick trees, supports for platforms were also made.  The paths leading to the stairs are already almost a historical landmark, as they have been preserved since Soviet times.  The area around the lower tower also looks very beautiful.  Exotic greenery is planted just a huge amount. </p>

    <h2>  Carriages </h2><p>  Not only reliability, but also convenience is what distinguishes the cable car in the Sochi Arboretum.  Photos of this building, presented in the article, its modern and creative appearance demonstrate clearly. </p><p>  Before the reconstruction, ordinary Soviet tube cars were plying the cableway.  This equipment was reliable and very comfortable for tourists.  However, having served faithfully for more than 30 years, the Soviet cars, of course, worked out their resources.  In 2006 they were replaced by modern, Austrian production. </p><p>  New trailers accommodate a larger number of people, but, according to many tourists, they do not harmonize with the overall design of the road and with the beauties that distinguish the arboretum (Sochi). </p><h2>  Cableway: opening hours, reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Of course, the opinion of vacationers about this complex technical object was very good.  For several decades, the cable car has made visiting the Sochi arboretum much more convenient, interesting and informative.  The views from the road to the park and from the observation deck of the upper tower, most vacationers find simply magnificent. </p><p>  The cost of travel on the arboretum of the arboretum does not cause almost any complaints among tourists.  The price of a one-way ticket is only about 200 rubles for an adult.  Children under 7 years old can travel with parents for free. </p>

    <p>  The cable car in the Sochi Arboretum did not deserve too good reviews of tourists mainly only for long queues at the box office.  Many guests of the city simply refuse long waiting time and go upstairs in the park on foot. </p><p>  She works from nine in the morning until six in the evening.  On Mondays, the first trailer leaves at 11 o‚Äôclock.  You can buy a ticket on the road and on your own.  However, more often tourists still buy an excursion with delivery to the upper tower in the trailer and at the same time inspecting the arboretum.  Of course, a walk both along the road itself and through the park with a guide can be much more interesting and informative. </p>
