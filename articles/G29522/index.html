However, modern Russian cities are less and less different from European ones.  Where to go in search of true national color?  An excellent choice is Mandrogi - a village whose sights will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><h2>  Rebirth from the ashes </h2><p>  In a picturesque area between Ladoga and Onega lakes, on the banks <span>of the Svir River,</span> people have lived since time immemorial.  The local settlement consisted mainly of the Finno-Ugric people - the Veps.  Peter I ordered the laying of <span>shipyards</span> on the river <span>.</span>  Svir, like many other Siberian rivers, had many rapids, the Vepsians called them in their own language - ‚Äúmandrogs‚Äù.  It is from this word that the village of Upper Mandrogs got its name. </p>

    <p>  Local residents were engaged in agriculture, among them there were many talented carpenters and potters.  The village was characterized by a measured pace of life, before the start of World War II, its population reached 450 people.  During the fighting, the territory between Onega and Ladoga lakes was occupied by enemy troops.  All local settlements were completely destroyed and destroyed.  In 1996, it was decided to create a unique ethnographic-tourist site on the site of the ancient settlement.  Today Mandrogi is a village whose sights amaze visitors from other countries and residents of our country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  National traditions combined with modern comfort </h2><p>  Today Mandrogs are not only a reconstruction for tourists.

    <p>  Developed infrastructure and a variety of entertainments - this is how the village differs from its analogues in Mandrogi.  Attractions reviews are positive, as is the organization of entertainment.  Russian tourists do not always like the prices of the services provided.  Indeed, local prices were developed taking into account the popularity of the object with foreigners.  However, if you want to relax inexpensively, you can, for example, if you come one day on an excursion and participate in master classes. </p>
