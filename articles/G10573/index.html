But every year more and more people send money to their near and dear ones.  There are times when a person, not really understanding, sends money through a not very well-established transfer system.  The Golden Crown is <span>the standard of</span> financial reliability. </p><h2>  In which regions does the Golden Crown system operate? </h2><p>  The list of states where to receive the Golden Crown translation is absolutely realistic, quite wide.  First of all, we highlight the countries of the former USSR: Armenia, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Moldova, Uzbekistan.  The system also works in countries where Russian tourists often visit: Czech Republic, Nepal, Vietnam, Greece.  Of course, you can get the translation "Golden Crown" in Israel.  Indeed, there are such strong ties between our countries! </p>

    <p>  What is needed to receive a money transfer?  The main thing is to know the control number of the transfer, because the operator can find the transfer in the system only by this code.  From the documents you need only a passport.  The operator who pays the money must make sure that it is the client whom they intended the sender to receive the funds.  <span>The</span> recipient's <span>passport data</span> is entered into the software package as confirmation that the passport has been presented. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The list of partner banks of the system in Russia </h2><p>  Where can I get the Golden Crown translation in <span>Russia?</span>  The system cooperates with a number of large Russian banks, which have a wide network of branches throughout the country.  Among them are MDM Bank, Energomashbank, Uralsibbank, Moskomprivatbank. </p><p>  Let's talk about some of these financial institutions specifically.  MDM Bank has been operating in <span>the financial</span> services <span>market</span> for quite some time.  Almost immediately, he began cooperation with the <span>Golden</span> <span>Crown</span> system <span>(Moscow).</span>  You can receive the transfer in 9 branches of the bank, which are located in most areas of the metropolis.  Throughout the country, the bank opened over 100 points of sale. </p><p>  Uralsibbank also has many branches throughout the country.  Most of the offices (39) are located in Moscow and Moscow region.  In addition, the bank's offices can be found in 43 more cities of the country.  Although the Central Administration, where it is also possible to obtain the Golden Crown transfer, is located in Moscow, the bank focuses on its representation in the Ural and Siberian regions of our country.  By the way, the client can receive the transfer absolutely free of charge, and you can send money by paying only 1-2% of the transfer amount. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golden crown moscow receive transfer" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29179/775917.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  For residents of St. Petersburg it will be convenient to contact one of the eight branches of Energomashbank, which operates in the city.  You will be waited at any convenient time from the morning until 19 p.m.  You will be offered excellent rates for sending a transfer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Receiving a transfer in Ukraine </h2><p>  In Ukraine, you can also use the services of the service, the main thing is to know where to go, which banks.  The translation "Golden Crown" is not everywhere yet. </p><p>  First of all, the Golden Crown is in one of the most reliable banks - Oschadbank.  The client should know that the transfer can be obtained not only in regional cities, but also in the smallest district center.  We remind you that receiving a translation is free not only in Russia, but also in other countries where this popular system works. </p><p>  Of course, the system cooperates with Privatbank.  This is absolutely logical, because it is a Ukrainian bank, which is also represented in Europe (there are branches in Portugal, Cyprus, and the Baltic countries).  Of course, among Ukrainian banks, Oschadbank has the widest network of branches, but not all branches work with money transfers.  If we talk about Privat, then the client will be able to receive and send the transfer in any branch of the bank.  In addition, operations can be carried out in the Internet banking system "Privat24", which will significantly save the cost of personal time of customers. </p>

    <p>  So we have learned where to get the Golden Crown translation.  An important advantage of the system is the lack of attachment to a specific city.  The transfer is sent to a specific country, and the recipient can receive money at any point of the partner of the system who works in that state. </p>
