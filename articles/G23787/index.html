    <h2>  Stages </h2><p>  Selye‚Äôs theory of the general adaptation syndrome explores the process of turning on the body‚Äôs special protective tools that adapt to the external environment developed during evolution.  This happens in several stages.  Within the framework of the study, three stages of the development of the general adaptation syndrome were identified: </p><ol><li>  Stage of anxiety.  It is associated with the mobilization of protective tools of the body.  During this phase of the general adaptation syndrome, the endocrine system responds by increasing activation of the three axes.  The main role in this is played by the adreno-cortical structure. </li><li>  Stage of resistance, or resistance.  It is distinguished by the highest degree of body resistance to the effects of negative factors.  At this stage, the general adaptation syndrome is expressed in efforts to maintain the equilibrium state of the internal environment under changing conditions. </li><li>  Exhaustion.  If the impact of the factor continues, then the protective mechanisms will eventually exhaust themselves.  The body in this case will enter the stage of depletion, which under certain conditions can jeopardize its existence and ability to survive. </li></ol><h2>  The mechanism of general adaptation syndrome </h2><p>  The essence of the phenomenon is explained as follows.  No organism can ever be in an anxious state.  The impact of a negative factor (agent) can be strong and incompatible with life.  In this case, the body will die even at the stage of anxiety in the first few hours or days.  If he survives, the stage of resistance will begin.  He is responsible for the balanced use of reserves.  At the same time, the existence of the organism is maintained, which does not practically differ from the norm, but in conditions of increased requirements for its capabilities.  However, adaptive energy is not unlimited.  In this regard, if the factor continues to impact, depletion will occur. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="general stress adaptation syndrome" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1415156.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is believed that the symptoms provoked by nervous shocks are psychosomatic.  This means that all body systems are involved in the reaction to stress: cardiovascular, endocrine, gastrointestinal, etc.  Quite often, after a long shock, weakness occurs.  Usually stress provokes a deterioration in the work of the weakest, diseased organ.  Weakening the immune system, it increases the risk of infectious pathologies. </p><p>  Most often, stress has an effect on cardiovascular activity.  With a short nervous shock, shortness of breath occurs.  It is due to the ingress of excess oxygen into the blood.  If the shock is prolonged, then breathing will be quickened until the mucous membranes of the nasopharynx dry out.  In such a situation, the general adaptation syndrome manifests itself in the form of pain in the chest.  It occurs due to <span>spasm of the diaphragm</span> and respiratory muscles. </p><p>  With a decrease in the protective function of the mucosa, the risk of an infectious pathology increases significantly.  The general adaptation syndrome can manifest itself as an increase in blood sugar.  This phenomenon provokes a chain reaction.  First of all, increasing sugar levels enhances insulin secretion.  It contributes to the accumulation of glucose in the liver and muscles in the form of glycogen, as well as its partial transformation into fat.  As a result, the concentration of sugar decreases, the body experiences a feeling of hunger and requires immediate compensation.  This condition stimulates the subsequent production of insulin.  In this case, the sugar level will fall. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Individual differences </h2><p>  General adaptation syndrome G. Selye formed the basis of research by other scientists.  For example, in 1974 a book was published by R. Rosenman and <span>M. Friedman.</span>  It explores the relationship between cardiovascular disease and stress.  The book distinguishes two types of behavior and the corresponding categories of people (A and B).  The first includes subjects focused on life achievements and success.  It is this type of behavior that significantly increases the likelihood of cardiovascular pathologies and sudden death. </p><h2>  Reactions </h2><p>  In laboratory conditions, the response of both groups to the information load was studied.  The specificity of the reactions corresponds to the predominant activity of a particular department of the nervous (vegetative) system: sympathetic (group A) or parasympathetic (group B).  The general adaptation syndrome of people of type A with information load is expressed by increased heart rate, increased pressure and other vegetative manifestations.  Under the same conditions, group B reacts with a decrease in the heart rate and other relevant parasympathetic responses. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Type A, therefore, is characterized by a high degree of motor activity in the predominant sympathetic reactions.  In other words, people of this group are characterized by a constant readiness to perform actions.  Type B behavior suggests a predominance of parasympathetic responses.  People of this group are characterized by a decrease in <span>physical activity</span> and a relatively low readiness for action.  The general adaptation syndrome, therefore, manifests itself in different ways and suggests a different sensitivity of organisms to influences.  One of the methods for the prevention of cardiovascular pathologies is the reduction of the manifestations of type A in the patient's behavior. </p><h2>  Therapy Features </h2><p>  Studying the general adaptive syndrome of Selye, it should be noted that the treatment of the body's reactions to the influence of factors is a rather difficult task.  It includes several aspects.  As the first, it is necessary to note the patient's own position.  It is, in particular, about his responsibility for his health.  The very possibility of using a number of tools to combat stress and their effectiveness depend on how consciously a person approaches existing problems. </p><h2>  Pain </h2><p>  Theoretically, it is not considered as a special <span>functional state.</span>  Pain is an unpleasant emotional and sensory experience that is associated with potential or true damage to the tissues or is described in terms of such an injury.  Long-term conditions of this nature significantly change the psychophysiological reactions of a person, and in some cases - the perception of the world as a whole. </p>

    <h2>  Classification </h2><p>  Pain is divided into different types according to several signs.  Depending on the nature of localization, it can be: </p><ol><li>  Somatic.  Such pain, in turn, is divided into deep or superficial.  The latter occurs in the skin.  If the pain is localized in the joints, bones, muscles, then it is called deep. </li><li>  Visceral.  It is associated with sensations that arise in the internal organs.  Severe contractions or cramping are also referred to this pain.  It is provoked, for example, by a strong and rapid extension of hollow organs in the abdominal cavity. </li></ol><h2>  Duration </h2><p>  The duration of pain acts as its main characteristic.  Short-term sensations are limited, as a rule, to the damaged area (burn on the skin, for example).  A person in this case knows exactly the location of the pain and understands the level of its intensity.  Sensations indicate a probable or already occurred damage.  In this regard, it has a clear warning and signaling function.  After the elimination of damage, it quickly passes.  Along with this, recurrent and persistent manifestations are chronic types of pain.  Their duration is usually more than six months.  Moreover, they are repeated with one or another regularity. </p>

    <h2>  Elements of pain </h2><p>  In any reaction there are several components.  The pain is formed by the following components: </p><ol><li>  Touch.  It transmits to the cerebral cortex information about the localization of pain, the beginning and end of the source, as well as its intensity.  A person's awareness of this information is manifested in the form of sensation by analogy with other signals, for example, about smell or pressure. </li><li>  Affective.  This element includes information unpleasant experiences, discomfort. </li><li>  Vegetative.  This element provides the body's response to pain.  For example, when you immerse your hands in hot water, the blood vessels and pupils dilate, the pulse quickens, and the respiratory rhythm changes.  With severe pain, the response may be more pronounced.  For example, biliary colic may be accompanied by nausea, a sharp decrease in pressure, and sweating. </li><li>  Motor.  As a rule, it manifests itself in the form of a reflex of protection or avoidance.  Muscle tension is expressed in the form of an involuntary reaction aimed at preventing pain. </li><li>  Cognitive.  This element is associated with a rational analysis of the content and nature of pain, as well as the regulation of behavior when it occurs. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Elimination of discomfort </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the body‚Äôs reserves are not unlimited, and with continued negative impact, they can be depleted.  This, in turn, can lead to various serious consequences, including death.  In this regard, external assistance is provided to the body.  So, various methods are used to relieve pain.  As one of them is the so-called electron-anesthesia.  The essence of this method is to influence the centers located in the deep brain structures.  Due to this, anesthesia occurs.  Among the therapeutic methods should be noted psychological, physical, pharmacological.  The latter involve the use of medications that alleviate or relieve pain.  Psychological methods are usually used in cases where the peripheral nature of sensations is not entirely clear.  These methods include hypnosis, meditation, auto-training.  Physical methods involve the use of physiotherapeutic agents.  Among them, the most common are: gymnastics, massage, neurosurgery, electrical stimulation. </p>
