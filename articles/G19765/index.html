    <h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  Be sure to take into account the fact that the creation process may take some time, so it is better to plan your resources in advance.  Having dealt with the question of how to make a car out of wood, you should pay attention to the tool that you need.  Everything is extremely simple and clear here.  The most ordinary <span>carpentry tools are</span> perfect <span>.</span>  You also have to decide on the size of your creation.  The machine may be the size of the original, but in this case it will take a lot of materials and time. </p><h2>  How to make a great wood car? </h2><p>  Start with a sketch.  This should not be an artistic creation in all its details or a masterfully executed drawing, rather ordinary sketches on paper are enough.  The main thing is that you understand the main idea and see in which direction you need to move forward.  Do not go in cycles in trifles, they can always be completed during work.  Put your ideas on paper and change them as the project moves towards its end. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As already mentioned, stock up on the necessary tools.  Make sure that the saw and jigsaw, fasteners and shoelaces, hammer and tape measure are always available.  When the final work is already close, you will also need paint and a brush.  To get all this will not be difficult.  If you are missing something from the above, then the tool can always be safely purchased at the nearest construction supermarket.  You can share your idea with a consultant, and he will certainly help you find everything you need.  Or you can purchase one of the special kits for craftsmen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a great wood car" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/845417.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to do? </h2><p>  Having picked up all the necessary tools, take care of the materials from which your masterpiece will be created.  Here you can go in different ways.  Materials can be easily and simply purchased at a construction or furniture supermarket, and you will not be denied special workshops.  However, you can always use old improvised things.  For example, in a future project, you can easily use old chairs, countertops, or even ordinary wooden boxes.  This approach will help reduce the cost of creating a car. </p><h2>  So, let's begin </h2><p>  You already know how to make a VAZ or Mercedes from a tree, or, perhaps, some other car, it does not matter.  Any construction begins with the creation of the frame.  If you have a great spatial imagination, cutting out the details yourself will not be any problem.  However, if such talent is not included in the list of your advantages, turn to the services of professionals.  Order or find the necessary drawings yourself, and then take them to a furniture workshop.  When creating a wireframe, problems should not arise.  Almost everyone perfectly understands what the car looks like. Be sure to make sure that the car is comfortable for its future owner.  Legs should fit freely under the torpedo, and the steering wheel should not hit the knees.  Think over all the small details, and then there will be no limit to delight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Since you already know perfectly how to make a car from wood, it will not be news to you that the parts are well connected with self-tapping screws, and for greater strength they can also be coated with special glue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a vaz from a tree" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/845415.jpg" width="330"></div>

    <h2>  Decor and decoration </h2><p>  How to decorate your brand new car is up to you.  It depends on the taste and the purposes for which the masterpiece was created.  If you have old wheels, you can use them to create a project.  You can also make wooden tires, but in this case, you will need additional raw materials.  Do not be lazy and make the car as realistic as possible, think over <span>door handles</span> and the <span>exhaust</span> system <span>.</span>  Install a tape recorder and real seats, and you can even attach numbers if you wish.  All these little things make the car realistic and improve the appearance. </p><p>  Now you already know how to make a car from wood from start to finish.  When creating a car, pay attention not only to the exterior, but also to what is inside.  Decorate the interior with cute little things, without which you can not imagine your car.  Perhaps hang an air freshener or cubes on the windshield.  Such a machine will be an unforgettable gift for any child, and his joy will have no boundaries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="machines made of wood" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/845416.jpg" width="600"></div>
