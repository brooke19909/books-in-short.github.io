The question of where to go in Stockholm is simple and at the same time complicated.  The history of this city is very saturated.  In each of its periods, new buildings appeared on the territory of the capital of Sweden, which later became famous European sights.  It is impossible to go around all these historical monuments in a few days.  The article tells about the main attractions of Stockholm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handluggageonly.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stockholm city sweden" class="if uuid-2550090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2550090.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  In the XII century, where today is the Swedish capital, there was a small fishing village.  In 1187, construction of fortifications began on its territory.  The first mention of Stockholm as a city dates back to 1252. </p><p>  The future Swedish capital quickly gained influence in Europe, because it was already in the early Middle Ages a large trading city.  Where to go in Stockholm?  This question can be answered in different ways.  Someone prefers excursions to historical places, while others prefer light pleasure trips.  However, having been in this city, you should definitely visit at least one of the museums. </p><p>  The expansion of the city began in the XV century.  In S√∂dermalm, one of the districts of Stockholm, there are several buildings erected back in those days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1634, the city became the capital of the Swedish state.  At the beginning of the XVIII century a terrible plague epidemic erupted here.  And after about ten years, many of the city‚Äôs buildings suffered as a result of the war with Russia.  Where to go in Stockholm?  First of all, it is worth visiting the Old Town - the historical district of the Swedish capital, in which there are buildings erected in the XVIII century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handluggageonly.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="capital of sweden" class="if uuid-2550095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2550095.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The list below is the answer to the question of where to go in Stockholm.  True, it is quite extensive, and it is impossible to visit all the facilities in a few days.  Sights of Stockholm: </p><ol><li>  National Museum of Sweden. </li><li>  Modern Art Museum. </li><li>  Skansen. </li><li>  Museum of the Nordic countries. </li><li>  Royal Palace. </li><li>  City Museum of Stockholm. </li><li>  Livrustkammarin. </li><li>  Museum of the Middle Ages. </li><li>  German church. </li><li>  Stockholm Cathedral. </li></ol><p>  The capital of Sweden has all the conditions for a family holiday.  Where to go with a child in Stockholm?  With children, you can visit one of the museums mentioned above.  But it will be a sightseeing tour, which may tire young tourists.  Those who have been to the Swedish capital, to the question of where to go to Stockholm with a child without hesitation, answer - to the amusement park Grena Lund. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Kungstradgarden Park, based on the site of the royal garden, is a place that will appeal to both adults and children.  Kaknes Tower is one of the tallest structures in Northern Europe.  The panoramic platform offers a wonderful view of Stockholm. </p><p>  Where do lovers of ancient architecture go?  At the Skugschurkogorden cemetery.  It is not just a necropolis.  Skugsch√ºrkog√•rden Forest Cemetery is an architectural complex, on which a whole team of the best Swedish artists worked. </p><p>  The ABBA Museum is a landmark that is visited mainly by representatives of the older generation, fans of the popular group of the 70s. </p><h2>  Carlson House </h2><p>  Tourists from the countries of the former Soviet Union, wondering where to go in Stockholm in one day, remember for some reason a cartoon created by the <span>work of Astrid Lindgren</span> and try to find out where is the house on which the jam lover lived. </p><p>  Locals do not tell the road to this attraction.  Because there is no Carlson‚Äôs home in Stockholm.  Any Swede when asked about the character Astrid Lindgren will only shrug.  To ask a resident of Stockholm the address of Carlson‚Äôs house is like asking a Muscovite about where is the house of a certain Ivan.  Carlson is a very common name.  There is no such museum dedicated to this hero.  Despite the fact that many travel agencies talk about a tiny house, which can supposedly be seen even from the ferry. </p><p>  Where to go with children in Stockholm?  An amusement park or museum dedicated to the famous Swedish writer.  By the way, Russian tourists are more interested in the work of Astrid Lindgren than her compatriots.  A small house on the roof of one of the Stockholm houses is nothing more than a fiction.  Attraction, fictional travel agencies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Unibakken is a museum where to go in Stockholm with a child is really worth it.  Unlike Carlson's house, it is a real attraction.  The characters of fairy tales live here: dragons, knights, mummy trolls.  The museum is dedicated to the works of Lindgren and other Swedish storytellers.  Unibakken is an interesting place where you can go from Stockholm for 1 day with the whole family.  The museum is located on the island of Djurgarden. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  In order not to ask the question ‚ÄúWhere to go from Stockholm for 1 day?‚Äù, Many tourists resort to the services of guides.  Ferries to the Swedish capital are regularly sent from St. Petersburg.  As part of the tour group, you can see the main attractions of Stockholm.  Where to go from the ferry after a sightseeing tour? </p><p>  In the vicinity of the Swedish capital there are also many interesting places.  On Djurg√•rden there is not only Unibakken, but also other museums.  For example, Skansen, which is described in more detail below.  A lot of interesting water excursions in Stockholm.  Where to go on a ferry with my family, except for the island of Djurgarden? </p><p>  There is a tour ‚ÄúUnder the Stockholm Bridges‚Äù.  In just an hour, at least from a distance, you can see all the main attractions of the city and its environs.  The city hall in Stockholm, where you can go as part of the tour ‚ÄúAround the Royal Island‚Äù, is one of the most interesting buildings of the Swedish capital.  During the trip, tourists learn about important events from the history of Sweden.  The main object of the tourist route is, of course, the Royal Island itself. </p><h2>  National Museum of Sweden </h2><p>  It has been under reconstruction for several years.  It will be opened again in October 2018. The history of the collection presented at the National Museum of Sweden begins in the 16th century, during the time of Gustav Vas.  In the first decades of its existence, the collection was replenished by trophies. </p><p>  In the forties of the 18th century, the Swedish envoy acquired several French canvases for the collection.  After the death of King Gustav III, the collection of paintings was transferred to the National Museum.  The pearl of this collection is a painting by the Dutch artist Rembrandt "Conspiracy of Julius Civilis." </p><div class="photo" data-original="stockholmtourist.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="national museum stockholm" class="if uuid-2550103" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2550103.jpg"></div><h2>  Skansen </h2><p>  This is one of the most beautiful places in the capital of Sweden.  Skansen is an open-air museum.  Located on the island of Djurgarden. </p><p>  This museum was founded in 1891.  80 years before its opening, a Swedish merchant built a pavilion on the island with a beautiful view of the city.  Here he set up a magnificent garden.  These places are called ‚Äúskansen‚Äù, which means ‚Äústrengthening‚Äù.  The fact is that there was a small fortress nearby. </p><p>  In 1891, these lands were acquired by the director of the Museum of the Northern Countries.  Then the idea came up to create a cultural complex, which had no analogues in Europe.  This is the first ethnographic museum in Sweden, which contains architectural monuments.  Here you can see a forge, a glassblower workshop, a medieval bakery. </p><p>  Today, the museum has collected more than a hundred estates and houses of the 18-19 centuries.  Here, the atmosphere in which representatives of various social strata lived is preserved.  Employees of the museum, dressed in costumes of the past, tell visitors about interesting events from the history of Stockholm.  Various holiday events are regularly held here.  One of them is Swedish Flag Day. </p><h2>  Museum of the Nordic Countries </h2><p>  The initiator of the creation of an exhibition devoted to Swedish culture and ethnography was Arthur Hazelius, a cultural scientist who lived in the 19th century.  The construction of the building, in which the Museum of the Northern Countries is located today, continued until 1907.  The building looks like a Danish <span>castle Frederiksborg.</span>  In the main hall is a huge sculpture depicting King Gustav Vasu.  Skansen, located nearby, until 1963 was part of this museum. </p><h2>  Royal Palace </h2><p>  This landmark of Stockholm is the official residence of the monarchs.  Located on the main promenade of Stadsholmen island. </p><p>  In the Middle Ages there was a castle on the site of the palace, designed to protect the waterway.  With the construction of this building began the history of the Swedish capital.  The gloomy castle was replaced by a magnificent residence under King Johan III.  But by the end of the XVII century, and it seemed to the mayors obsolete.  The building was demolished, a baroque palace was built in its place, which burned down in 1697.  The construction of the new residence, which is now included in the list of the main attractions of Stockholm, continued until 1754. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kickifotograf.se" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="royal palace stockholm" class="if uuid-2550115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2550115.jpg"></div><h2>  Stockholm City Hall </h2><p>  This is another attraction that is included in most tourist routes in Sweden.  The town hall was built in 1923.  The author of the project is the architect Ragnar Estberg.  The beauty of the building can be appreciated from the promenade, but you can not visit it at any time.  Important political negotiations are held here and city government meetings are held.  There is also a museum in the town hall. </p><p>  The height of the tower - the main part of the structure, 106 meters.  In the construction, more than two million bricks were used.  The museum exhibits sculptures, here you can see rare in beauty works of mosaic art.  The main exhibit is a statue of St. Eric, the Swedish king who ruled the country in the 12th century. </p><p>  From the museum, a staircase leads to the Round Gallery, where sculptures depicting historical figures and biblical characters are installed.  The observation deck of the town hall is often called the Copper Tower.  There are nine bells here, the largest of them weighs about three tons.  Guided tours of the town hall are held from May to September, from 9:00 to 16:00. </p><div class="photo" data-original="enacademic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stockholm town hall" class="if uuid-2550119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2550119.jpg"></div><h2>  German church </h2><p>  The temple is located in the Old Town, which in the Middle Ages was inhabited mainly by Germans.  Hence the name.  Every Sunday, church services are held in German.  It is worth saying a few words about the history of this temple. </p><p>  In the 15th century there was a building on the site of the church, which was occupied by a German public organization.  In the eighties of the XVI century it was rebuilt into a church.  A large number of Germans then lived in Stockholm, among them, as a rule, there were traders and artisans.  But they did not have their own temple. </p><p>  In 1558, King Gustav allowed religious meetings to be held in German.  In 1571 a separate parish was organized.  Pastors from Germany served here.  In 1607, the building in which the church is located today was transferred to the Germans.  The construction was expanded, supplemented by a bell tower.  The opening took place in 1642. </p><h2>  Church of St. Nicholas </h2><p>  This is the oldest temple of Stockholm located in the historical center.  The building is an example of neo-Gothic architecture.  Located near the Royal Palace, the facade faces the Royal Square.  For the first time this church is mentioned in documents of 1279.  Since the XVI century, the cathedral became Lutheran, in the XX century it received the status of the cathedral.  This is where the coronation of the Swedish kings takes place. </p><h2>  Grena Lund </h2><p>  Stockholm's most famous amusement park is located on the banks of the Djurgarden.  This attraction of the Swedish capital appeared about 130 years ago.  At first, there were several attractions in the park established by a German merchant in the territory he rented.  This place was liked by the <span>residents of Stockholm.</span>  There are new rides.  The park has become a permanent venue for various celebrations. </p><p>  Popular objects of Grena Lund are a room of laughter, a tunnel of love, a roller coaster.
