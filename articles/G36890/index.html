The Mercure chain (operated by Accor Group) includes more than 700 three- and four-star hotels located in 52 countries (including Russia). </p><p>  This article describes, prices, photos and reviews of tourists regarding hotels of the Mercure chain (4 *) in Spain (Costa Brava), Egypt (Hurghada) and Bulgaria (Sunny Beach). </p><h2>  International hotel chain </h2><p>  Accor Group of Companies is a French company founded in 1967, which for almost half a century has successfully managed a chain of hotels (about 4,000 hotels of various classes) and restaurants (Ticket Restaurant and Luncheon Vouchers), as well as many casinos and travel agencies. </p><p>  Accor Group hotels are designed for different categories of tourists - these are establishments from luxury (Sofitel) and upper class (Novotel) to standard budget hotels (Ibis) and motels (Motel 6).  The Mercure network is designed for middle-class visitors. </p><p>  Accor Group is a huge company with a multimillion-dollar turnover, which can afford to invest in the development of personnel and the material base of its enterprises, therefore Mercury Hotel 4 * is very popular in various countries. </p><h2>  Costa Brava </h2><p>  Costa Brava, or the ‚ÄúRocky Coast‚Äù, is a place on the Mediterranean coast in Catalonia <span>(Spanish Kingdom).</span> </p><p>  It is interesting that the district acquired such a name only at the beginning of the 20th century, when a local journalist called it ‚Äúthe shore of the rocks‚Äù in his article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to picturesque cliffs, on which slender pines and firs rise, there are many cozy bays and snow-white beaches (sand and pebble), and in the mountains you can see ancient buildings made of stone blocks (dolmens), ancient monasteries and the ruins of medieval castles. </p><p>  Mercury <span>Hotel 4 * (Costa Brava)</span> is located in one of the most ancient and interesting places of the province - the city of Santa Susanna. </p><h2>  Santa susanna </h2><p>  The city of Saint Susanna was founded in the 12th century and is located near Barcelona (1 hour drive). </p><p>  Tourists are attracted by the warm and calm sea, golden and white beaches and coniferous forests, which Spain is famous for.  The Mercury Hotel 4 * was built in the large resort center of Costa del Maresme, on the shores of the <span>Balearic Sea,</span> where the climate is much milder than in southern Spain, because the mountains protect the area of ‚Äã‚Äãbeaches from the wind. </p><p>  It is warm in summer, but not hot (+29 <sup></sup> ), and in winter it is not at all cold (+10 <sup></sup> ), therefore the tourist season begins in May and ends in November. </p><p>  Outdoor enthusiasts enjoy surfing, boogie boarding (riding a small foam board), diving, snorkeling, yachting and water skiing, windsurfing and parasailing (parachuting behind a boat), and also participate in kayaking along the mountain rivers. </p><p>  Curious tourists visit numerous attractions, and family groups with children find the most cordial welcome here. </p><h2>  Attractions in Santa Susanna </h2><p>  Santa Susanna stands on eight hills, and from anywhere in the city overlooks the blue sea and green parks and gardens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tourists living in the Mercury Hotel 4 * (Santa Susanna) can take fascinating excursions to the castles, chapels and palaces of the ancient city, where they will see a lot of interesting things. </p><p>  For example, the city‚Äôs patron saint church is decorated with paintings painted on canvases, which are covered with a thin layer of real gold.  In the chapel of St. Isidore, the monks annually hold a "fraternal dinner" (May 15), which can be visited by any stranger, and motorists gather in the chapel of St. Christ and pray for protection from accidents and traffic police. </p><p>  It often hosts fun carnivals, various festivals and crowded fairs that adorn the city and attract visitors from all over the world. </p><h2>  Mercury Hotel 4 * (Santa Susanna) </h2><p>  The hotel is located on the first coastline (less than two hundred meters from the sea) of the Costa del Maresme, 40 km from Barcelona Airport. </p>

    <p>  Good food: standard European set, lots of fruits. </p><p>  The beach is covered not with sand, but with small pebbles.  Although this does not bother tourists at all.

For example, in some rooms old linen and plumbing, the air conditioner does not work at full capacity and the balcony does not close (therefore, you have to pay for the safe for the safety of valuables). </p><p>  The rooms on the ground floor hear noise from dishwashers (if the room is located above the kitchen). </p><p>  The room has three outlets, and two of them are occupied by a TV and a refrigerator.  The Internet is slow, network access often breaks. </p><p>  The road to the beach goes through a dirty underground passage, and on the approach to the sea you can sometimes smell the sewer.  Great depth begins two meters from the coast, so tourists with children find the beach uncomfortable. </p><h2>  Mercury Hotel 4 * in Egypt </h2><p>  Mercure hotel chain hotels operate in many countries, including Egypt.
