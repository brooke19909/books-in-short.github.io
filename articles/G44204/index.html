To do this, it is better to come to it in late spring or summer, when the greenery of numerous trees hides the shortcomings of the city. </p><h2>  History of the foundation and development of the city </h2><p>  In 1716, at the confluence of <span>the Om</span> and Irtysh <span>rivers,</span> by the order of Emperor Peter I, a fortress was set up - a prison.  The place where Omsk of the 21st century is located was very convenient for a strong military point, since it made it possible to protect Russian settlements from the nomadic Dzungars, who were ravaging Central Asia at that time.  The fortress became a key point in the line of the Irtysh border line, and in 1764 was supplemented by another defensive structure - the New prison on the right bank of the Irtysh. </p><p>  Since 1782, Omsk received the status of a city and for several decades eked out the existence of an ordinary county seat.  The development of the city began only in the 3rd decade of the 19th century, when the flow of settlers increased, industries (manufactories) appeared.  After the reform of <span>M. M. Speransky,</span> Siberia was divided into Eastern and Western Governor Generals.  The capital of the latter was Omsk, moving from this place the uncomfortably located Tobolsk. </p><p>  The branch of the <span>Trans-Siberian Railway</span> stretching through the city provided him with a high position in the region and steady growth.  According to the project of invited architects, magnificent buildings are erected, banks and representative offices of foreign companies are opened.  The place where Omsk is located is in every way very convenient for transporting goods both from the Altai Territory and from Central Asia.  Until the outbreak of World War I, the city experienced an agrarian and financial boom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The Supreme Ruler of Russia A.V. Kolchak made Omsk his capital for 1 year.  This "status", as well as several peasant uprisings in the 1920s, provided the city and the population with the closest attention of the Soviet government. </p><p>  During World War II, Omsk became a refuge for more than 100 enterprises evacuated from the central regions of the country.  Most of them remained in it after the war, giving rise to the industrial giants - the plants to them.  N. G. Kozitsky, them.  P. I. Baranova, ‚ÄúFlight‚Äù, etc. There were no more sharp growth spikes in Omsk.  The development of the city is slow, but increasing. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  Many highways pass through the region where Omsk is located, and you can get to or leave the city using any of the following methods: </p><ol><li>  Highways of federal significance M-51 "Baikal", M-38, 1P402 (in a southerly direction).  Transport is constantly moving along these roads, and parking with food points and hotels is enough for a leisurely and comfortable trip.  The road surface on them sometimes leaves much to be desired, since the area where Omsk is located is replete with small swamps and is prone to permanent subsidence. </li><li>  Railways in the directions "West-East" (Novosibirsk-Tyumen) and "South" (Kazakhstan).  They connect Omsk not only with other regions, but also with the cities of the region - Isilkul, Nazyvaevsky, Kalachinsky. </li><li>  Airport "Omsk-Central" accepts regular flights from Moscow 2 times a day, as well as a large number of charters abroad.  Near the city, it was also planned to build a more modern airport in the village of Fedorovka, but due to lack of investment it was stopped at an early stage. </li><li>  River routes along the Irtysh are mainly used for communication with the settlements of the region and cities upstream (Tobolsk).  Most of the Omsk river fleet is designed to transport building materials. </li></ol>

Among the vast number of attractions, the following can be highlighted: </p><ul><li>  Holy Assumption Cathedral - the temple restored at the beginning of the XXI century in recent years has become a real symbol of the city.  Around it there is a well-groomed park and the main government buildings of the city, including the FSB Directorate, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Omsk Diocese and the Prosecutor's Office of the Omsk Region.  Each of them is an architectural monument in itself. </li><li>  Omsk fortress, consisting of several buildings of the XVIII-XIX centuries, including the magnificent Tara Gate.  The buildings have retained most of the architectural features and are still in use.  For example, the building of the commandant‚Äôs office houses the Literary Museum. </li><li>  Lenin Street is remarkable in that it permeates the entire historical center of the city, and the main attractions seem to be strung on it.  In particular, from this street you can get to the River Station and the wharf, pass by many decorative monuments (Lyubochka, Gorodovoy, Dynamic Balance, etc.), admire the building of the Baroque Drama Theater and the Museum named after  Vrubel, get to the Fire Tower and Cathedral Square. </li></ul>

    <p>  The Resurrection Cathedral in Omsk, which was finally restored in 2016, can be of great interest to tourists, where the Gospel is unique from a historical point of view - a gift from Empress Catherine the Great.  The temple is located at the intersection of Partizanskaya and Taube streets, and you can get into it during walks along Lenin, simply by turning off near the Seraphim-Alekseevskaya chapel. </p><h2>  Major events </h2><p>  Omsk year-round becomes the venue for events of various levels, among which it is worth noting: </p><ul><li>  Siberian international marathon, which has gained fame throughout the world.  Every year amateur athletes from all over the world come to it, and sometimes the number of participants reaches 10-12 thousand people.  Residents and guests of Omsk run alone and in groups, with prams and flags of their companies.  For the whole day, the street of the city Red Way from Sobornaya Square to the Telecentre <span>(Lysaya Gora)</span> turns into a sports track. </li><li>  The Christmas half marathon is unofficial and extremely popular among extreme sports.  It takes place on January 7 and in any weather.  There are cases when athletes fled at -35ÀöC, during heavy snowfall and heavy wind. </li><li>  Omsk <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãday</span> (first Sunday of August).  By this day, venues are being set up throughout the city, the Flora exhibition, trade fairs are opening, and shortly before the parade, historical reconstruction clubs hold demonstrative knightly tournaments.  The last many years have been spent on the territory of the Fortress, but since 2015, you can look at the battles of knights and Russian soldiers between Tarskaya and Herzen streets, where <span>Victory Square</span> is located in Omsk. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Living in the city and beyond </h2><p>  Places where the city of Omsk is located are deprived of exotic recreation like mountains, hot springs or the sea shore.  But the latter successfully replaces the full-flowing Irtysh, and its steep descents in winter are used by snowboarders and skiers.  Directly outside the city, in the villages of Krasnoyarka and Chernoluchinsky, there are many rest houses and boarding houses - "Fairy Tale", "Forest", "Maryina Roscha", "Russian Forest", etc. </p><p>  Perhaps there is nothing easier than finding housing within the city.  Omsk offers its guests hostels, inns and hotels of various levels and price categories.  Among the most famous are the Mayak Hotel on the Irtysh Embankment and the Ibis Sibir Hotel, where hockey teams from other cities stop during matches with the Hawks (Vanguard). </p>
