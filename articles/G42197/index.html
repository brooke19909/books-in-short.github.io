How to knit a jacket: schemes and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A fashionista who has a non-standard figure often faces the problem of choosing a wardrobe.  A crocheted jacket for women is a comfortable and versatile clothing that fits any shape.  Most often, it is created as an independent element, combined with various details of the wardrobe.  But it can also be part of a suit that has a skirt or pants.  Thanks to <span>this, the jacket</span> remains relevant today.  In this article, we will consider the stages and methods of knitting these sweaters. </p><h2>  A variety of knitted jackets </h2><p>  The many types and styles of jackets offered by various knitting magazines are striking in their diversity.  Their appearance is constantly changing and transforming.  <span>Crocheted jackets</span> for women can be made in one piece, given the neckline and sleeves.  Often, models are knitted from several parts: backs, shelves and sleeves.  Individual styles have an additional turn-down or shawl collar.  Jackets can also be formed from individual elements called motifs.  Knit such details in the form of a circle, square, rhombus, triangle and various multifaceted figures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="crochet-sweaters.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet jacket for women" class="if uuid-2239771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2239771.jpg"></div><p>  Jackets are mainly designed to be worn in cool weather, but there are also lightweight openwork options that adorn the summer outfit.  When donning these <span>types of sweaters,</span> they can fasten with buttons, catch with a belt or freely fall along the silhouette.  <span>A crocheted</span> jacket for women can have a length reaching the waist or hips.  The color palette is diverse.  In addition to solid colors, combinations of compatible colors are used, as well as bold, rich and vibrant solutions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Light outfit for warm weather </h2><p>  Beginning needlewomen below are invited to crochet a jacket for women according to the given scheme.  This model consists of an openwork pattern that passes air well.  You will need cotton yarn of the desired color, 6 buttons and a knitting tool at number 3. </p><p>  The jacket is knitted in several stages: </p><ul><li>  creation of the back of the product; </li><li>  tying the front shelves; </li><li>  sleeve formation; </li><li>  assembly and strapping of the product along the edge. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="crochet-sweaters.blogspot.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://crochet-sweaters.blogspot.ru/2012/10/cardigan-crochet-cardigan-pattern.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="patterns for knitting a jacket" class="if uuid-2239770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2239770.jpg"></div><p>  The diagram contains some simple conventions. </p><ul><li>  Mugs mark air loops. </li><li>  X is a regular column. </li><li>  An icon that resembles the letter T with a dash indicates a column with 1 double crochet. </li><li>  Arrows in the form of daws indicate that in the indicated place you need to make the attachment of the thread. </li><li>  Empty spots in the pattern mean repetition of rapport knitted in the front rows. </li></ul><p>  The sketchy pattern of this crocheted cardigan for women is created on the basis of fillet knitting.  The principle of this technique is that the web is formed from through or filled square links.  The cells are separated by walls from the same double crochet column.  The empty link is formed of two air loops, and the filled one contains two columns with one double crochet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="crochet-sweaters.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet cardigan pattern for women" class="if uuid-2239775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2239775.jpg"></div><h2>  Create Parts </h2><p>  Crocheting a jacket for women starts at the bottom of the back.  Following the pattern, an openwork cloth with a height of 32 cm is knitted. Next, armholes are formed by shortening the cells according to the drawing.  At a height of 19 cm from the beginning of the cuts, shoulder bevels and a neckline on the back are created. </p><div class="photo" data-original="crochet-sweaters.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet cardigan pattern for women" class="if uuid-2239772" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2239772.jpg"></div><p>  The right and left shelves, as well as the rear part, start from the bottom edge and fit in mirror image to each other.  Having risen 32 cm from the bottom, it is necessary to form armholes at the right shelf - on the right side, at the left, respectively, from the left edge.  After 19 cm, you need to make bevels on the shoulders and finish knitting the parts of the front. </p><p>  Sleeves are created with a cuff equal in width to 6 cm. Next, it is necessary to perform uniform expansion of parts on both sides, following a schematic description.  Having tied up the sleeves to 37 cm, it is necessary to cut the rows from two edges to several cells equally.  At the end of the work, fasten and cut the thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="crochet-sweaters.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted jacket for women" class="if uuid-2239777" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2239777.jpg"></div><h2>  Assembly and strapping </h2><p>  After all the details of the jacket are ready, they must be sewn.  To do this, you need to make shoulder and side seams, then connect the edges at each sleeve, place them in the armholes of the vest and sew on. </p><p>  At the last stage, the finished product is tied around the edge: </p><ul><li>  the bottom of the jacket is processed; </li><li>  shelves and a neck are formed; </li><li>  sleeve cuffs stand out. </li></ul><p>  Tying the product brings its appearance to perfection, as well as smooths out knitting irregularities.  On the open edges of the shelves, you need to tie a border for sewing buttons and form buttonholes.  They are created from two or three air loops in the process of strapping, taking into account the omission of the same number of columns of the last row.  Then buttons are sewn and, if desired, pockets are created. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kimcrinochet.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet cardigan for women" class="if uuid-2239773" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2239773.jpg"></div><h2>  Cardigans </h2><p>  We offer you another option for crocheting a jacket for women with a pattern.

Then, single crochet columns are knitted into this ring, according to the scheme.  When stitching parts, their alternation is observed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kimcrinochet.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted cardigans for women" class="if uuid-2239776" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25985/2239776.jpg"></div><p>  Using the tips and descriptions of creating jackets from this article, you can knit unique products and replenish your wardrobe with charming outfits. </p>
