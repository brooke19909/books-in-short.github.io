    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  There were some negative moments in the Rivijera 4 * hotel (Petrovac, Montenegro).  Reviews say the following: </p><ul><li>  the restaurant has a fairly uniform food (therefore, it is better to limit yourself to breakfast, and get acquainted with local cuisine in neighboring establishments); </li><li>  the rooms are quite cramped; </li><li>  the restaurant flies a lot of wasps, and the staff does not struggle with this phenomenon; </li><li>  even taking into account the fact that sunbeds on the beach are paid, they are not enough for all, and therefore you need to take places literally from 6 in the morning; </li><li>  although the hotel is smoke-free, the restaurant and bar smelled of tobacco smoke; </li><li>  beaches open only in June, and therefore in the spring neither toilets nor other infrastructure work on them; </li><li>  the air conditioner cools the air slightly enough, which is especially noticeable in the summer heat; </li><li>  there are few walking paths in the territory; </li><li>  the hotel does not have its own beach (only municipal); </li><li>  almost no animation (this is offset by a convenient location next to a variety of entertainment venues). </li></ul><p>  Hotel Rivijera 4 *, located in the town of Petrovac, is a good option for those who want to swim in the clear sea, as well as enjoy the beauty of nature and fresh air.  He is often chosen for a quiet family and romantic getaway. </p>
