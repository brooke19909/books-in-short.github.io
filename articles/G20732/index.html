    <h2>  A few words about the developer </h2><p>  The Prok company has been implementing its services in the real estate market since 1993.  During this time, she managed to master more than forty projects, among which there are not only residential and administrative, but also social facilities.  Today it is one of the largest developers of the Northern capital, which has proven itself in the market and fully deserves the trust of customers.  The main task of the builder is to provide residents of St. Petersburg with high-quality, reliable and, most importantly, affordable housing.  The Prok company offers apartments in both finished and under construction houses.  The “Shuvalovsky duet” LCD also belongs to the latter option.  The developer offers to purchase residents of the apartment in the complex at the initial stages of construction at the lowest possible and extremely favorable cost.  The property will be commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2018. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About the complex </h2><p>  The Shuvalovsky Duet will be a complex consisting of two buildings, each 25 floors high.  They will be located in the form of a square next to the <span>Shuvalovsky park,</span> well-known to all residents of St. Petersburg <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Shuvalovsky duet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1274956.jpg"></div>  There will be 1380 apartments in the houses, in addition, it is planned to erect a parking space for about eight hundred cars.  The Vyborg district, where the complex is being built, already has an excellent infrastructure of its own, which is a definite plus, since all residents of new buildings can use its facilities.  In addition, the developer plans to build his own next to the house.  In particular, it will be one kindergarten and two schools.  In addition, in order to better provide residents with social infrastructure, the first floors of both buildings will be given to pharmacies, sports sections, etc.

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  The Vyborg district, in which the Shuvalovsky Duet residential complex is being built, has long been considered relatively clean in environmental terms.  Close proximity to the park of the same name is one of the main advantages of the new building.  Also not far from the complex is the Novoostrovsky Forest Park, which will also undoubtedly appeal to future residents.  In addition, potential buyers should pay attention to the fact that just a few kilometers from the threshold of their home are <span>Suzdal Lakes,</span> as well as the Gulf of Finland. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Transport connection </h2><p>  The Shuvalovsky Duet complex is located in close proximity to the Parnas metro station, which can be reached in 15 minutes by leisurely steps, and even faster via public transport, which is in abundance.  The trip by metro to Nevsky will be no more than 20 minutes.  The region is served by the <span>Vyborg highway,</span> and along the Engelsky Prospect passing through the microdistrict, you can go to the roundabout.  The distance to it is only five kilometers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shuvalovsky duet builder" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1274975.jpg" width="598"></div>

    <h2>  Shopping and entertainment infrastructure </h2><p>  Residents of the houses of the residential complex “Shuvalovsky duet” will be able to use the already existing infrastructure of the village.  Here there are not only small grocery stores and a quite good mini-market “Lilia”, but also real monsters of the trading business - “Pyaterochka”, “Dixy”, “Seven I”, O'KEY hypermarket.  Literally a few kilometers from the houses there are two more trade giants - Auchan and IKEA.  There are several cafes and restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the Shuvalovsky Duet, and a couple of kilometers away is the excellent Grand Canyon shopping and entertainment center.  In addition, a grocery store will be located on the ground floors of the complex, as well as a bakery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  By the way, if you look at the reviews available about the Shuvalovsky Duet residential complex, you will notice that some people are not completely satisfied that the first floors are given for objects of social infrastructure.  Nevertheless, many people really like this way of posing the question, since, you see, it’s very convenient to have a store near the entrance where you can buy the necessary products. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shuvalovsky duet reviews" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1274970.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Apartments in residential complex "Shuvalovsky duet": plans and prices </h2><p>  The developer assigns housing in the complex under construction to the comfort class.  Nevertheless, trying to carefully follow the chosen concept, the company does not overstate the cost of it.  Yes, the area of ​​the proposed housing is somewhat underestimated and does not quite correspond to the declared class, nevertheless, the apartments are carefully planned, each centimeter of such a precious living space is correctly taken into account.  All rooms are extremely ergonomic, which, as the construction company hopes, customers will appreciate. </p><p>  As mentioned above, 1380 apartments are offered.  As for the choice, it is available.  So, in the residential complex "Shuvalovsky duet" you can buy both a studio apartment and rooms with one, two or three rooms.  Their area varies from 27.5 to 75 square meters.  In addition, all of them are equipped with balconies or loggias, everywhere there is a large kitchen.  If we talk about the layout, then the client has a choice.  Two types of apartments of each type are presented, which differ in the total area and arrangement of the rooms.  Ceiling height is 2 m 75 cm. </p><p>  As for the cost, it primarily depends on the type of payment.  But on average, about two million rubles will have to be paid for a studio apartment, from 2,400,000 for a one-room apartment, and 4,000,000 for a two-room apartment. Treshka will cost 4,400,000 rubles.  The average cost per square meter is quite acceptable for such a large city as St. Petersburg, and ranges from 58 to 75 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zhu Shuvalovsky duet St. Petersburg" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1274976.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What does the buyer get for his money </h2><p>  Every potential buyer should know that apartments in the Shuvalovsky Duet residential complex are sold with rough finish.  But if there is a desire, the developer offers the services of an interior designer and specialist builders.  For an additional fee, of course.  In this case, the buyer will be able to enter the already fully finished apartment and literally immediately after unpacking the suitcases to celebrate a housewarming party. </p><p>  In the draft version, it is envisaged to carry out all engineering communications, the availability of plumbing and all relevant equipment, the connection of electric meters, gas stoves and heating radiators.  In addition, the windows imply the presence of PVC structures, and in the doorway - a metal entrance door.  The loggias are planned to be glazed using stained glass technologies of the Avangard type. </p><p>  All entrances by the time the complex is commissioned will be fully finished, there will be an intercom in them, a place for a concierge will be allocated.  And naturally, elevators will function.  And not only passenger, but also cargo. </p><h2>  The territory of the complex </h2><p>  The developer company plans to carry out a rather significant number of works on landscaping and greening of the territory adjacent to the Shuvalovsky Duet residential complex.  So, places for rest and footpaths will be equipped.  Across the territory, there is a lawn and trees planted.  For children, it is planned to build special playgrounds, and for adults - sports equipped with special street exercise machines. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd shuvalovsky duet reviews" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1274966.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, bicycle paths will be laid everywhere, and there will also be guest parking (in addition to the underground one mentioned above).  The territory of the complex will be under protection in order to ensure the safety of residents.  Everywhere, including at the entrances, it is planned to install CCTV cameras.  So young families with small children can be calm for their children and quietly let them go for a walk in the yard.  Fortunately, the view from the windows of the complex is magnificent.  So, being in the apartment, it will be possible to control the situation on the playground without problems. </p><h2>  LCD "Shuvalovsky duet": reviews </h2><p>  Since the complex is still under construction, reviews on the quality of housing in it at this stage, of course, will not succeed.  However, it is worth noting that in this regard, the Prok company has proven itself just fine, so future residents are unlikely to be disappointed with their apartments.  Someone is dissatisfied with something else.  The developer handed over the last two objects with some delay, and so the customers are worried that the described complex does not suffer the same fate.  It is worth noting that it is not worth worrying.  After all, those houses were built in the midst of a severe financial crisis.  Now the market situation has stabilized, and therefore, we hope that the company will cope with its obligations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc shuvalovsky duet layouts and prices" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1274967.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It causes some dissatisfaction among potential customers and the fact that a metro depot is located near the complex.  Which, of course, affects the environment.  However, firstly, this drawback compensates for the presence of a large natural forest area near the complex, as well as the Shuvalovsky Park.  And secondly, do not forget that the houses are located almost within the metropolis.  And where did you see the city without industrial facilities?  In all other respects, there are no special complaints yet, people especially like the fact that the developer makes it possible to purchase housing with the help of all the programs available at the moment, and in addition, constantly carries out various promotions, thanks to which you can significantly save on buying an apartment. </p>
