I. Kutuzov is the largest figure in the history of the Russian state.  He was the greatest Russian commander, diplomat, statesman.  Mikhail Illarionovich had the rank of Field Marshal, participated in the Russian-Turkish wars, commanded the army in the war of 1812.  As a rule, he is depicted with a blindfold on the eye.  What is the reason for this?  Today we will tell a story about where Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov lost his eye, or rather, how he damaged it. </p><h2>  Biography Facts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portrait of M.I. Kutuzova" class="if uuid-2739487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2739487.jpg"></div><p>  Before answering the question where Mikhail Kutuzov lost his eye, we will consider some facts of his biography. </p><p>  He was born in 1745 in St. Petersburg in the family of a lieutenant general.  In 1759-1761 he studied at the Artillery and Engineering School, where one of the teachers was his father. </p><p>  In addition to being a military man, Kutuzov managed to visit the governor-general (Kazan, Vyatka, Lithuania), as well as the military governor (Petersburg and Kiev).  And also - the plenipotentiary ambassador in Turkey. </p><p>  He was a count, and in 1812 received the title of His Grace Prince Golenishchev-Kutuzov-Smolensky.  He was a student and associate of A.V. Suvorov, a full holder of the Order of St. George. </p><h2>  Carier start </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bust of Kutuzov" class="if uuid-2739469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2739469.jpg"></div><p>  Prior to a direct examination of the facts telling about where Kutuzov lost his eye, we will analyze the facts from his career advancement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  In 1762, managing the office of the Revelation Governor General, he received the rank of captain.  And then he was appointed company commander in the Astrakhan infantry regiment.  Then this regiment was commanded by Suvorov. </li><li>  Since 1764, he served in the Russian troops in Poland, who fought against the Confederates, was the commander of small detachments. </li><li>  In 1767 he was involved in the compilation of an important legal document of the 18th century, which enshrined the foundations of an "enlightened monarchy", apparently as a secretary-translator.  He understood well and spoke German, French and Latin. </li><li>  Since 1770 he took part in the Russian-Turkish war of 1768-1774. </li></ul><h2>  Not a loss, but a mutilation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="napoleon1812.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The battle with the troops of Napoleon" class="if uuid-2739484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2739484.jpg"></div><p>  Starting to explain how Kutuzov lost his eye, it is necessary to clarify this issue.  Strictly speaking, he was not deprived of this organ in the direct meaning of the word.  It is a fact that he received two injuries at the location of his right eye.  Therefore, he saw them poorly. </p><p>  In this regard, in fact, one should speak not about the lost eye of Kutuzov, but about the damaged one, since this fact is true.  Based on this, speaking of injuries that led to mutilation, the word "lost" must be quoted. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Punishment for wit </h2><div class="photo" data-original="lombardmaps.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napoleon and Kutuzov" class="if uuid-2739482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2739482.jpg"></div><p>  For the first time, the future field marshal was wounded during the Crimean army's repulse of the enemy attack in one of the battles of the Russian-Turkish war.  Kutuzov did not get there from the prosperous Danube army as an outstanding expert on strategy and tactics.  In this case, a cheerful nature and a sharp tongue let him down. </p><p>  At one of the friendly meetings that took place in 1772, Mikhail Illarionovich spoiled the gait and manners of Commander-in-Chief Rumyantsev.  When management became aware of this, Kutuzov was urgently transferred to a hot spot.  After that, Kutuzov began to exercise caution and restraint in feelings, even with loved ones. </p><h2>  Noise Fight </h2><p>  Now we begin the story of why Kutuzov actually ‚Äúlost‚Äù his eye (recall that in fact he did not lose it, but damaged it). </p><p>  Being appointed commander of the Grenadier Legion, July 24, 1774 M.I. Kutuzov took part in the battle with the Turks who landed near Alushta, near the village of Shumy.  It was during the pursuit of the enemy that Mikhail Illarionovich, who led the attack, was seriously wounded in the head. </p><p>  The bullet hit him in the left temple.  She went through the nasopharynx and left the right eye socket, miraculously not knocking out her eyes.  Despite the pessimism of the doctors, he survived, and he could see the injured eye, but began to mow slightly.  Legends began to compose the valor of a brave warrior.  Catherine II received a report from Dolgorukov, the Commander-in-Chief of the Crimean Army, in which he described the facts. </p><p>  The Empress was struck by courage and an unprecedented will for the life of a young commander.  In it, she noticed the features of a future outstanding general.  Kutuzov was granted the Order of St. George, 4th class and sent to Austria to improve his health for two years.  Upon his return, Mikhail Illarionovich was full of strength.  Only the scar and eyelid of the right eye, which was half closed, reminded of a serious injury. </p><h2>  Storm Ochakova </h2><p>  Continuing the story of where Kutuzov ‚Äúlost‚Äù his eye, we will talk about a second wound to the head.  It followed 14 years later, when Mikhail Illarionovich was already a general.  This happened during the assault on the fortress Ochakov, in which he participated.  A fragment of a grenade fell into the right cheekbone, knocking out almost all of its teeth and exiting through the back of the head.  It should be noted that this is only one version of what happened. </p><p>  There is a second one.  In a medical journal, a military surgeon Massot recorded not fragmentation, but bullet damage.  In his notes, it is said that, ironically, the shell practically repeated the old ‚Äúroute‚Äù.  The left temple was pierced by a bullet, it passed behind both eyes, flying out from the opposite side, and demolished the inner jaw angle. </p><p>  Doctors fought for the life of Kutuzov for seven whole days.  To everyone's amazement, regaining consciousness, he did not show any signs of dementia and did not lose his sight. </p><p>  The general‚Äôs miraculous rescue inspired physician Massotte for a noteworthy diary entry.  In it, he believed that since Kutuzov survived, having received two wounds, which, according to the rules of medical science, were considered fatal, fate, apparently, meant him to something great. </p><p>  Mikhail Illarionovich returned to the army a year later and continued his brilliant military career.  Her climax fell on his confrontation with Napoleon Bonaparte. </p><h2>  Visual impairment </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Council at Fili" class="if uuid-2739491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2739491.jpg"></div><p>  In the story about where Kutuzov ‚Äúlost‚Äù his eye, one cannot fail to report on the negative changes in his vision that still occurred after the wounds.  Until 1805, he did not experience tangible discomfort from injury.  But then the vision on the right eye began to weaken.  In addition, pain intensified, as well as increased pain.  They were caused by strabismus and the fact that the eyelid involuntarily fell, and the eyeball was motionless.  These pains did not release the commander until the last days of his life, that is, until 1813. </p><p>  But in his letters to relatives, Kutuzov did not focus on the continuing deterioration of health.  When the messages were not written with his hand, he tried to find all sorts of excuses for this.  For example, he reported that his eyes were tired. </p><h2>  There was no bandage </h2><p>  Nevertheless, it has not been recorded in any portrait or document that Kutuzov wore a blindfold in his eye.  On the contrary, the artists clearly deduced the mutilation of the right eye. </p><p>  Based on the medical report drawn up by the attending physicians of Mikhail Illarionovich, modern ophthalmologists came to the following conclusion: he did not need to cover his eyes.  This is done in the following situations - either when they want to hide an unsightly picture of the lack of an eye, or to eliminate the effect of bifurcation of surrounding objects. </p><p>  As we have already found out, the loss of the eye as such was not observed by the commander, but a doubling of objects was present.  This defect, as a rule, is a companion of strabismus with available vision in both eyes.  But Kutuzov at the same time had a ptosis of the eyelid, which was used to cover his injured eye.  It served as a bandage, eliminating the bifurcation defect. </p><h2>  Fiction </h2><div class="photo" data-original="in.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kutuzov did not wear a bandage" class="if uuid-2739475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/2739475.jpg"></div><p>  At the end of the story about where Kutuzov ‚Äúlost‚Äù his eye, it should be said that the filmmakers put a black bandage on him.  This was done in the film "Kutuzov", released in 1943. </p><p>  In this regard, there is evidence that, with the help of this technique, director Petrov sought to raise the morale of soldiers who fought on the fields of World War II. </p><p>  He believed that the blindfold on the eye of the great commander demonstrates that, being seriously wounded, he continues to defend Russia, showing an unbending will.  Later in this image, Kutuzov appeared in the film ‚ÄúThe Hussar Ballad‚Äù, and then in magazines, books, and on monuments. </p>
