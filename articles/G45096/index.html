Anyone can make jewelry with his own hand, only a little patience is needed.  On the Internet you can find <br>  many video tutorials and workshops on how to make a hairpin.  Process <br>  making jewelry, as a rule, does not take much time and effort, But <br>  results exceed all expectations - attention and enthusiasm of others <br>  needlewoman provided.  In addition, find materials for making jewelry <br>  today is not difficult. </p><p>  Do-it-yourself hair clips can be made from velor, satin, velvet and other fabrics.  Decorate products with beads, a variety of beads, stones, pearls, ribbons and laces.  Unusual materials such as luminous acrylic plastic and felt are also used.  DIY hair pins made <br>  based on metal invisibility or other hair holder, <br>  manufactured in industrial conditions. </p><p>  The size and shape of the accessory will depend on the tastes and personal preferences of the needlewoman.  Unique and at the same time simple decoration can be made on the basis of ordinary invisibility, in the widest part of which you need to glue a pearl, pebbles or rhinestones.  For a more complex version of the hair clips with your own hands, you can string beads or small beads on a thin wire and <br>  twist it in a spiral. </p><p>  For the manufacture of an exclusive accessory, even a simple nail polish is suitable, with which you can get transparent petals for hairpins.  For this, a thin wire is cut into identical pieces 7-8 cm long.  The wire segments are folded in such a way as to make a kind of ring on a stick.  The varnish is carefully applied in the middle of the ring, gently pulling it out.  For uniform distribution of varnish, the workpiece must be smoothly twisted in different directions.  Using different colors of varnish, you can get hairpins of the most fantastic colors.  For convenience, while drying the workpiece can be inserted into a piece of plasticine.  After complete drying, the petals are bonded into one flower and fixed on an invisible or other basis. </p><p>  Do-it-yourself hairpin can be made of any fabric you like.  In addition, she can make up a magnificent ensemble with an existing outfit.  If small pieces of fabric remain during sewing, they can always be used to create unique and elegant accessories.  To make a hair ornament, you will need a fabric with any pattern, a metal base, printed material and silk thread, matching the color of the fabric.  For decoration, beads or small beads are used.  The fabric is folded in half and a circle is drawn on it, which, by the way, can be done with a glass or mug.  The contour must be sewn on a sewing machine, after which the resulting circle is cut taking into account a seam of 4-5 mm.  Stuffed material is placed inside the mug; cuts are sutured manually.  The silk thread is removed with a needle on the front side of the "pillow" and stringed with beads or beads.  The pattern and number of stitches depends only on the imagination and patience of the needlewoman.  After the decoration is embroidered with beads, it remains only to attach a metal base. </p><p>  Another decoration option can be made using beautiful and unusual buttons, automatic hair clips and a small length of cord.  A lace is passed through the holes in the buttons, onto which the beads are fixed.  It remains only to glue with the help of superglue the resulting decor to a metal hairpin automatic. </p>
