    <p>  <strong>Dream come true</strong> </p><p>  They created a unique yacht project at the design company Terence Disdale Design Ltd in London.  And built in Hamburg.  This ship is made to order by the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.  It was first launched in 2009 on June 9.  Tests were carried out and some improvements were made, after which in December 2010, his yacht was handed over to Roman.  This unit was the largest private vessel in the world until Azzam appeared. </p><p>  <strong>Specifications</strong> </p><p>  The vessel is 162.5 m long and 21.5 m wide. The hull is made of high quality aluminum using nanotechnology.  There is a dual engine - there are as many screws on two shafts.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãdevelops from 22 to 38 knots.  At the same time, according to some reports, up to 200-250 people can be accommodated on a yacht, of which 70 are crew and 100 are maintenance personnel.  The yacht has 24 luxury cabins and 24 apartments.  The bedroom of the oligarch is upholstered in stingray leather.  By the way, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis room is 80 square meters.  For the decoration of other cabins and rooms, marble, wood, and gold were chosen.  Throughout the ship you can see expensive paintings - the originals of the works of famous artists, as well as sculptures and other works of art.  The yacht has 2 swimming pools, a disco and gymnasiums, a cinema, a sauna, two kitchens and a wine cellar with the most expensive and exclusive drinks. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Of course, the Russian oligarch, one of <span>the richest people in the world,</span> took care of protecting his yacht.  Around the perimeter of the vessel is powerful armor.  In addition, the yacht has a missile defense system.  Eclipse - Abramovich‚Äôs yacht - is completely safe for senior guests to relax.  To protect against annoying journalists in the territory there is a laser installation that distorts the image.  On board the most expensive vessel there are two helicopters, a mini-vessel, 20 scooters and four small boats, as well as a submarine for 12 seats.  About 70 people take care of the safety of the owner and dignitaries.  One day a yacht is in the water, according to experts, costs Roman $ 80,000. </p>

    <p>  Daria Zhukova, the civil wife of Roman Abramovich, lived for a while on a yacht.  When she was pregnant, she needed safety and comfort.  For some time Daria was on a yacht, but because of her excellent position, she had to leave the ship, as she was greatly rocked.  Roman is already the seventh child, with Daria - the second. </p><p>  <strong>Photo story</strong> </p><p>  Protected and enclosed place - Abramovich's yacht Eclipse, the photo of which is allowed to be taken only from a decent distance.  Some paparazzi noted that they tried to approach the yacht to take pictures, but the guards did not miss, they required a distance.  This is the most expensive and guarded yacht of Abramovich (Eclipse), the photo inside of which is absolutely impossible to make.  I note that this is not the first ship with Roman.  Since 2002, the Russian oligarch acquired 4 yachts.  In the media, his hobbies are called "disease on yachts." </p>
