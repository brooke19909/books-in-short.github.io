    <p>  <span>It is recommended that refrigerators with a drip defrosting system, including Indesit SB 185, be completely turned off once every 6-8 months to wash and remove the ice that forms in the freezer compartment.</span> </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  <span>Judging by the reviews of the Indesit SB 185 refrigerator, it stands out among its brothers.</span>  <span>From such a capacious and thanks to the drip defrosting system, which does not ‚Äúeat up‚Äù the usable volume, as the No Frost system.</span>  <span>Not noisy, although many people are confused by class B before buying. After all, everyone is already used to the fact that a large number of such devices have A or A +.</span>  <span>But the representative of the second class does not cause discomfort to users during their work.</span>  <span>This is also evidenced by numerous reviews.</span> </p><p>  <span>The Indesit SB 185 white refrigerator will perfectly fit into any interior.</span>  <span>It is tall - 185 cm, which makes it roomy.</span>  <span>Due to the ability to outweigh the doors, the device can be placed in absolutely any angle.</span> </p><p>  <span>The temperature control in the refrigerator compartment is mechanical.</span> </p>

    <p>  The control is located on the top panel, above the door of the refrigerator, outside.  If a person doesn‚Äôt tightly close the door or completely forgot to do it, after a minute the refrigerator will definitely let you know. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  For many modern consumers, the main advantage of the Indesit SB 185 refrigerator is its affordable price.  The average cost is 17,000‚Äì25,000 rubles, depending on the outlet.  For a high refrigerator with similar characteristics, this is a reasonable price. </p><h2>  The presence or absence of the ability to change the location of the shelves </h2><p>  The refrigerator compartment has several shelves dividing the common space into uniform parts.  However, in any family there is a tall dish that cannot be delivered with such a distribution.  Since the manufacturer notices the wishes of his consumers, he made it possible to independently adjust the position of the shelves, depending on the needs of the owners of the equipment. </p><p>  According to reviews by some users, corners on shelves sometimes break if products are distributed unevenly.  Under heavy load, the shelf may not be able to withstand at all.  This should be considered during the operation and distribution of products. </p><h2>  Model benefits </h2><p>  Analyzing customer reviews, we can distinguish the following advantages of the model: </p><ol><li>  Convenient transformation of shelves, changing the height of the storage space. </li><li>  Even when used at medium power, the refrigerator copes with its functions perfectly and does not allow a malfunction. </li><li>  It is quiet. </li><li>  No odor of plastic even in the new device. </li><li>  For a small price, the capacity of the two cameras is good. </li><li>  Works offline for up to 15 hours.  Thanks to this, you can not be afraid of defrosting products in the event of an emergency power outage. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Model flaws </h2><p>  The Indesit SB 185 refrigerator, as well as in any equipment, the following disadvantages were noticed: </p><ol><li>  Impractical <span>drawers of the</span> freezer, plastic often breaks off when accidentally pressed. </li><li>  Sealing gum during operation begin to let air through, which is why ice forms in the chambers. </li></ol><p>  The second problem is easily solved by replacing components.  Repair in this case does not require large expenses.  As for the boxes, they will have to be ordered at specialized service centers. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  For almost a century, Indesit has been pleased with its customers with high-quality and reliable technology.  Of course, according to user reviews, we can only talk about subjective assessment.  Everyone has different preferences, tastes and requirements for such household appliances.  Therefore, until a person independently tries this model in action, it will be extremely difficult to evaluate the product. </p><p>  If you look at the overall ratings given by users, you can see a rather high average score.  Accessibility in financial terms, of course, affects the decision-making, therefore, each buyer should also keep this in mind. </p>
