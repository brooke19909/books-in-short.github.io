Today, these places attract a lot of tourists.  They come from different republics of the former USSR and even from abroad to watch the festive holidays or just to familiarize themselves with the conditions under which our soldiers fought and what the victory cost them. </p><h2>  A bit of geography </h2><p>  The Valley of Glory is located on the right bank of the Western Litsa River.  From Murmansk only 40 kilometers.  This is if you move in a straight line.  And you will go by car along the highway - already 74. In general, it is not far from the place where the Western Litsa River spreads widely. </p>

It stretches for thousands of meters.  In some places it is interrupted.  Either the stream runs, then the swamp underfoot, or in general the pass.  This is a beautiful area.  After all, here is a rare, unusual for the northern latitudes landscape of the plain.  In summer, the grass is pretty tall everywhere.  Silence.  Only birds sing.  Very majestic, solemn.  Already breathtaking.

    <h2>  Change of name </h2><p>  Here along the river (from July to November 1941) the defense line passed.  Today it‚Äôs even hard to imagine how it was possible to carry out at least some very simple military operations in such places.  In addition, in the summer there is a decent cold.  Tundra!  And they held defense here in the fall.  So our people had very considerable losses in the battles not just because of such, let's say mildly, unsightly weather conditions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And how many difficulties there were to deliver weapons and ammunition to the soldiers.  To this day, various remnants of both Soviet and German equipment and weapons come across in this area. </p><p>  But people withstood everything.  It was the Valley of Glory that became an insurmountable obstacle for the German troops.  They received an order to capture Murmansk as soon as possible.  To do this, here, through an impassable tundra, they sent "Norway" - a mountain building.  It consisted mainly of Austrian and Norwegian soldiers.  They were commanded by German Colonel-General Edward Dietl. </p><p>  But the enemy received a powerful rebuff from the Soviet troops when he tried to force the river.  The military, led by the commander of the 205th Infantry Regiment, Anatoly Ivannikov, not only resisted and didn‚Äôt let the enemy go further, but severely battered the enemy, which was twice as powerful. </p>

There were real melee fights.  After all, delivering weapons and ammunition to the tundra, and even on the road, was incredibly difficult.

    <p>  And such fights the Valley of Glory (Murmansk region) saw a lot.  During the whole confrontation, more than two thousand people died on the banks of the river.  And on the surrounding hills - for several tens of kilometers - there are still scattered German weapons. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also in the safe and sound trenches, fortifications.  Yes, many of our brave fighters were killed here.  It is no coincidence that the soldiers nicknamed this place the Death Valley.  And nowadays, the name has been changed to a lighter, more memorable. </p><h2>  Memorial to the Defenders </h2><p>  Today, the Valley of Glory is, first of all, a large <span>Memorial complex.</span>  It is built on the site of those tragic and heroic battles.  And here is the burial of soldiers and officers.  Warriors who did everything so that the enemy did not go further into the country. </p><p>  Five years ago, the complex was updated.  Also done reburial.  And every year on May 9, the Valley of Glory receives thousands of people who specially come here from everywhere.  They want to honor the memory of those who defended the Arctic.  Meetings and conversations, stories of witnesses and researchers, historians, and various other events are organized here.  Activists of military historical clubs in the field of past battles are excavating. </p>

    <h2>  Features, Attractions </h2><p>  The area itself is very beautiful.  She has such a severe, austere, restrained look.  That is, you can come here not only to see the famous memorial, but also to admire the unusual nature of the tundra.  And also find out something else interesting. </p><p>  That was such a fact.  The Germans in 1941-42 built a <span>road</span> (in the Titovka area) <span>.</span>  <span>Cable car!</span>  Purpose: to supply their parts with everything necessary.  Such an order was issued by Ferdinand Sherner (general of the sixth mountain division division). </p><p>  The capacity of the cable car is as follows: from 150 to 250 kilograms.  A single cable was in its design, the so-called towing.  Closed moved in a circle.  Plus drive. </p><p>  Of course, the Germans also used the labor of our prisoners of war for this ... </p>

    <h2>  The longest cable car </h2><p>  Today, anyone can see the remains of this impressive engineering system.  Assembled it from separate sections.  Each was like a loading and unloading site.  She worked herself and was not dependent on others in any way.  The cars were of two types.  Or a wooden platform, or a metal bucket.  Fastened to a figured metal suspension.  When the trolleys hit the station, they disconnected from the cable (automatically).  And already on the monorail (also suspended) they were manually rolled. </p><p>  When the Germans retreated, they themselves damaged it.  Our experts dismantled the cable car after the war.  Allowed for household needs. </p><p>  It was the longest military cable car. </p><h2>  Good holidays </h2><p>  Have a desire to come here?  The final destination is clear: Valley of Glory (Murmansk region).  How to get there, it remains only to find out.  But you will read more about this below. </p><p>  Activities in the Valley of Glory are diverse.  So, a large project of volunteers dedicated to the heroes of the Great Victory is working.  The second movement has the same character - ‚ÄúNobody is forgotten.  And nothing is forgotten. " </p><p>  And there‚Äôs a Memory Watch.  Many have heard about her.  This June, for example, a team of two settlements walked along the defense line (on the Western Face).  The guys examined several graves.  We made a plan of work to restore them - this summer.  The graves were also cleaned of debris.  They embellished them with flowers. </p><p>  We finished our shift on June 22 this year.  And, of course, on the important Titov line. </p>
