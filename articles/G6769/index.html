The fact is that this microdistrict is not too popular, and not so many people visit it as Central.  The local infrastructure is developed enough not to be bored during the holidays.  Interestingly, in this area pebbles are not very large, which means that walking on it is not too painful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  central District </h2><p>  All the most popular beaches of Adler are concentrated in the Central District.  Until 2016, it was possible to get to some of them only by passes, but now most of the beaches are open for visiting.  Anyone can walk without obstacles on a variety of beaches, such as ‚ÄúThe Seagull‚Äù, ‚ÄúTwinkle‚Äù, ‚ÄúLighthouse‚Äù and ‚ÄúSouthern Seaside‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  The beaches of the Central District of Adler have an indisputable advantage in comparison with the Railway Station.  The fact is that railway lines do not pass here, which means that local beaches are much cleaner.  The coast here is pebble, but there are several sandy corners.  Pebbles have to go into the sea, as the sand is not very close to the water.  Along the main beaches of this microdistrict, there is a promenade with various cafes, restaurants, excursion bureaus and souvenir shops. </p><h2>  Spark Beach, Adler </h2><p>  Reviews about this place are very good.  Here you can rent equipment, swim on a boat or catamaran.  Since Ogonyok is located in the central area, all of Adler‚Äôs night infrastructure, such as clubs and restaurants, is located nearby.  True, this beach has disadvantages: the water is cool, and there are very few sandy areas. </p>

    <p>  Children will love this part of the Adler‚Äôs coast, as planes fly over this beach very often.  In addition, there is an amusement park in which little travelers can play enough. </p><h2>  Imereti Bay </h2><p>  The length of the coastline of this microdistrict reaches 6 kilometers, the maximum width is 60 meters.  The beach strip is conditionally divided into several parts.  As a rule, a piece of the beach refers to some hotel, so a similar division of territories was adopted. </p><p>  Pebble beaches are publicly accessible, but there are also completely sandy ones.  You will have to pay for the entrance.  You can walk along the beautiful promenade with a bike path at any time of the day, visiting cafes and restaurants, as well as shops and souvenir shops that operate year-round. </p><h2>  Beach "Imeretinsky" </h2><p>  The only completely sandy beach in Sochi is located in the same area.

There are locker rooms and showers, as well as a jacuzzi. </p><p>  This place is a beach club, which means that on its territory are all the entertainment that can appeal to both children and adults.  This beach is located not so far from the facilities for the Olympics.  He himself is divided into two levels: lower and upper.  The lower one has the best sports grounds and dance floors, and the upper one has a beach recreation area. </p><p>  So, which beaches in Adler, according to reviews, are considered the best?  Of course, this is the Imereti sandy beach with a warm sea and picturesque landscapes, which can be observed from the promenade. </p><h2>  State Farm "Russia" </h2><p>  The territory of the farm "Russia" is part of the Imereti Bay.  However, it is often isolated as a separate microdistrict.  The southernmost point of Greater Sochi, partly the outskirts of Adler, is not the most popular among tourists.  However, on the local beaches you can find everything you need for a comfortable stay, such as sun loungers, showers and changing rooms.  The beach is pebble. </p>
