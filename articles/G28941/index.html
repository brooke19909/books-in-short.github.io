    <h2>  Where to get a loan to an unemployed pensioner </h2><p>  Sometimes older people need to solve the question: which banks give loans to non-working pensioners?  Let's try to figure it out.  For most financial companies, retirees are profitable and desirable borrowers.  What is the reason for this?  First of all, each of them has a stable income.  In addition, it cannot be lowered.  On the contrary, although slowly, but pensions in our country are growing. </p><p>  Well, and secondly, pensioners are one of the most diligent and responsible borrowers. </p><p>  However, not everything is as good as it might seem initially.  The main criteria for refusal are the age limits of the borrower.  The higher it is, the more the bank risks when issuing a loan.  For example, it is easy for a person at the age of 60 to take a loan, but finding non-working pensioners which banks give loans up to 80 years is not so simple.  Banks will either refuse to grant a loan, or greatly increase the interest rate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Requirements for a retirement loan </h2><p>  In order to find out which banks give loans to non-working pensioners, it is necessary to study the requirements for future credit customers. </p><p>  In cases where a person of retirement age applies to a financial institution to obtain a consumer loan, the requirements for documents will be minimal.  It is enough to provide the bank with only three documents: </p><ul><li>  pensioner's ID; </li><li>  valid original passport; </li><li>  health and life insurance of a potential borrower may be required (in accordance with Article 7, Part 10 of the Federal Law of the Russian Federation No. 353). </li></ul><p>  In addition, the borrower must be a citizen of the Russian Federation, have a permanent residence in one of the Russian regions.  The age of the borrower, under the terms of lending to a particular bank, should not be more than seventy-five, eighty years.  And, of course, the availability of a personal mobile phone number to keep the bank employees in contact with the client.  A high credit rating of the borrower will not be superfluous. </p><p>  And <span>which banks give loans to non-working</span> pensioners for a larger amount?  It does not really matter what kind of financial institution it will be.  If necessary, issue a larger amount than stipulated in the contract, the bank will require a pledge or guarantee. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Banking terms </h2><p>  Most older people may ask: Which banks give loans to non-working pensioners up to 70 years old?  There are such financial organizations, but for this they are developing special programs.  The terms and conditions of this loan may differ at an overestimated interest rate.  Its size will be influenced by many circumstances.  Many private banks offer pension credit systems in order to increase their ratings and increase their loan portfolio. </p><p>  Large state-owned banks offer pensioners standard terms of pension lending.  For example, Sberbank of Russia offers its potential borrowers represented by non-working pensioners two types of consumer loans - with and without a guarantee.  Moreover, a loan can be issued for a period of three to sixty months. </p><p>  Without a guarantee, pensioners can be given a loan, provided that they are sixty-five years old at the end of the contract.  And with a guarantee, the age range increases to seventy-five years.  Moreover, if the borrower receives a pension on a Sberbank card, then consideration of his application will take no more than two hours.  For other borrowers, the term increases to two to three days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another question: which banks give loans to non-working pensioners up to 75 years?  Bank Vostochny offers retirees a loan of up to 200 thousand rubles.  The loan term will be from three months or more.  However, it is worth considering that the age of the borrower at the time of full repayment of the loan should not be more than seventy-six years.  And the interest rate on the loan is as much as 34 percent per annum. </p><p>  Russian Agricultural Bank provides loans at 17.5 percent per year.  For recipients of pensions on a bank card, the rate will be reduced to fifteen percent.  If the borrower refuses to take out life and health insurance, the interest rate will increase by three points in any case. </p>

    <h2>  Loan interest rate </h2><p>  Banks that issue loans to non-working pensioners deliberately overstate the interest rate.  This is done in order to insure the risk of non-repayment of borrowed funds.  The lending rate for pensioners on consumer loans is very unstable.  It can be from 15 percent and go up to 65-70.  For <span>pension card</span> holders, the rate, as a rule, does not exceed 20 percent. </p><p>  The availability of a guarantor will also reduce the loan rate, but only if he does not have a retirement age and his income is stable. </p><h2>  Loan terms </h2><p>  Unfortunately, most banks provide pensioners with very tight credit terms.  In cases where the borrower's solvency is confirmed, and it fully complies with all the requirements of the bank, you can count on getting a loan for a period of 3 months to five years. </p><p>  If there are guarantors or a pledge is issued, the pensioner can get the maximum available loan term - up to 60 months.  Without them, only up to three years (36 months). </p>

    <h2>  Age restrictions </h2><p>  Banks issuing loans to pensioners determine the age limit for them to 75 years.  But still, some commercial banks are ready to increase the age range of potential borrowers to 85 years. </p><p>  But it is very important to take into account the fact that the age limit is calculated at the time of closing the loan agreement. </p><h2>  Which banks give loans to non-working pensioners </h2><p>  The list of banks that are ready to issue consumer loans to pensioners is increasing annually.  Banking insurance for pensioners is able to cover all the risks of a possible loan default, and the solvency of a pensioner is guaranteed by the state. </p><p>  Here is a list of banks that issue loans to non-working retired people: </p><ul><li>  Sberbank of Russia. </li><li>  "Post Bank". </li><li>  Russian Agricultural Bank. </li><li>  Sovcombank. </li><li>  "Eastern Express". </li><li>  "Alfa Bank". </li><li>  "Renaissance Credit". </li></ul><p>  However, this list is constantly updated, and banks make lending conditions for pensioners more profitable due to growing competition. </p>

Now about the documents necessary for obtaining a cash loan. </p><p>  In order for a pensioner to receive a loan without pledging property, it is necessary: </p><ul><li>  Contact the bank with a completed application for a consumer loan. </li><li>  Provide the employee with the original passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Present a pension certificate and SNILS. </li></ul><p>  If the loan is executed with a pledge, then from the documents you will need: </p><ul><li>  Original passport. </li><li>  Pensioner's ID. </li><li>  Certificate of ownership of property pledged. </li></ul><p>  In cases where a loan is executed with the participation of the guarantor, it will be necessary for him to provide the employees of the credit department with a 2NDFL income statement for the last six months.  You also need to write a receipt, which gives consent to the guarantee.  In case of default by the borrower of credit obligations, the guarantor assumes all financial responsibility. </p>

    <h2>  If a surety is required </h2><p>  Both the borrower and the guarantor, the bank makes special demands.  Indeed, in case of non-payment by the borrower of the loan, all responsibility passes to the surety.  For this reason, he must prove to the bank his solvency. </p><p>  If a close relative who is also retired was chosen as a guarantor, then you should not hope for a large amount of a consumer loan. </p><p>  But if the guarantor is a young and working person with a stable income, which is documented, the loan amount may be higher.  Interest on the loan, on the contrary, can be reduced. </p><p>  However, it is worth considering that, in addition to a certificate of income of the guarantor, documents may be required that will be evidence of the relationship between the guarantor and the potential borrower. </p>
