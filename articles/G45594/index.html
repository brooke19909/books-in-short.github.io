What to see in this amazing land, where even the gods descended from Olympus to rest?  Most tourists come here to sunbathe and swim.  And they are right.  Swimming in Rhodes really is where.  There are two seas of your choice: the Mediterranean and the Aegean.  They join together to form the Prasonisi sand spit.  Most of the beaches on the island are pebble.  For some, this is a drawback, but the Greeks are very proud of their coasts, considering them a sign of pristine nature.  In addition, pebbles do not stick to the body and do not clog into the hair and eyes.  Well, locals send lovers to build castles at the edge of the sea on the sandy shore of Tsampiko. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What to see on the island of Rhodes" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/227071.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But one beach vacation should not be limited.  You are in the cradle of European civilization, which means there is something to see in Rhodes.  The excursion program includes the conquest of Mount Monte Smith, a visit to the medieval fortress of warlike monks, hospitaliers.  You will find a walk through the maze of shady streets of the town and a view of the harbor, in which the <span>Colossus of Rhodes</span> towered in ancient times <span>.</span>  This is one of the wonders of the world praised by ancient authors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nature lovers also have something to see in Rhodes.  A cruise to the island of Symi or an ascent to the peak of Filerimos, which is called the local Golgotha, will give you unforgettable views.  At sultry noon, it's good to relax in the Valley of the Butterflies, where thousands of exotic bright moths flutter everywhere.  Also, postcard views can be recorded on the memory card of the camera in the town of Lindos.  Donkeys will take you to the top of the hill, where the second most important after the <span>Acropolis of Athens</span> rises. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What to see in Rhodes" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/227072.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  What to see in Rhodes for young and active people?  Favorite party place with all sorts of discos and clubs - the town of Faliraki.  Surfers booked for themselves the village of Ialyssos.  And for those who came to the island just to lie on the beach, resort Ixia is suitable.  To whom the sea is not enough - welcome to the giant Rhodes water park. </p><p>  Those who are not indifferent to the issues of soul salvation should remember that Christianity came to our lands from Greece.  Therefore, such people also have something to see in Rhodes.  The most indisputable shrine of the island are Epta Piges, in translation - Seven Sources.  Whatever sins you have had in your history, walking barefoot through a dark dungeon where an ice stream streams, you will become as innocent as a baby.  It is also good to climb Mount Tsampika, but not for the sake of beautiful views, but to touch the miraculous icon, which is stored in the monastery on top.  In addition to a variety of ancient pagan temples (in </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece Rhodes island what to see" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/227073.jpg" width="600"></div>  particular temple of Aphrodite of the III century BC), in Rhodes there is no shortage of ancient churches.  The Temple of the Virgin in the village of Asklipio was built in the XI century.

    <p>  Of course, everyone independently decides for himself what to see on the island of Rhodes.  Someone likes museums and ancient ruins, someone tries to ride a wave on the Prasonisi Spit, and someone does not think vacation without shopping.  He is also present in Rhodes, and not bad.  Clothing and shoes of well-known European companies are best bought in the capital, but souvenirs that can only be found at this point on the planet should be purchased in small shops.  Avoid the stalls in tourist places, go to the Big Market, where in addition to commemorative gizmos, you can buy completely fresh fruits and vegetables. </p>
