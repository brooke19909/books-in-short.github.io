Becici is a popular modern tourist center located a few kilometers from the city of Budva, on the Adriatic coast.  The presence of a wide pebble beach and clear sea brought fame to this resort as an ideal place for a family vacation.  The beaches in Becici are municipal, but all the hotels located on the coast have small areas reserved exclusively for guests.  This provides an opportunity for guests to retire, hiding from everyday hustle and bustle, and truly enjoy a well-deserved rest. </p>

    <p>  Hotel Stella di Mare 4 * <span>(Montenegro, Becici)</span> is considered one of the most profitable vacation options.  The proximity of this area to Budva contributed to the fact that specialized sites sometimes mistakenly attribute the hotel to this legendary resort.

    <p>  Guests note that the Wi-Fi at the hotel is working smoothly, a set of quality shampoos and shower gels is constantly replenished, slippers and bathrobes are provided in all rooms, towels are changed daily. </p><p>  Many people like the location of the hotel: the proximity of the sea and shops.  The hotel is very close to various convenience stores, guests say: at a distance of 50-100 m. To the sea, the authors of the reviews say that there are two roads - one 450 m (here is more abrupt descent), the other - 650 m (it is more gentle, and tourists follow it, more interesting - it passes by shops, other hotels, etc.).  And such a path is overcome, as the tourists testify, somehow quickly and imperceptibly. </p><p>  A separate plus is the presence of scales on the floors in front of the elevator, which remind you to keep in shape.  At the reception, according to the authors of the reviews, fresh newspapers and magazines, interesting books are offered.  Beach umbrellas and towels can be used free of charge, a ration is given out (in case guests go on excursions early). </p><p>  Tourists claim that the staff at the hotel is very friendly, always ready to help in solving any problems. </p><p>  The authors of the reviews talk about the local tradition: leaving guests leave some kind of keepsake for the hotel.  At the reception there is a kind of library of books left by visitors to the hotel, also previous tourists have left many beach umbrellas. </p><p>  Not without cons.  Many residents do not like the choice of desserts and pastries for tea.  Many people find a coffee machine simply awful.  Because  the hotel is small, according to the guests, it would be possible to purchase a more suitable device.  The same goes for breakfast juices. </p><p>  The guests of Stella di Mare 4 *, in spite of the available disadvantages, are very satisfied with the level of services received: it looks like an ordinary hotel, but a lot of pleasant little things make it ideal: quality and cleanliness of rooms, impeccable service, the presence of bathrobes and slippers provided even in the standard room ", Delicious breakfast dishes, the provision of free secure parking, etc. Tourists thank the staff for the ideal conditions for relaxation and promise, if they find themselves on the Budva Riviera, stay exclusively in Stella di Mare. </p>
