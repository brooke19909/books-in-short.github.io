What are these substances?  Any vegetable oil is a mixture of unsaturated fatty acids (the molecules of such an acid have double bonds).  But this is not all, since vegetable oil is a source of vitamins, phospholipids, phytosterols and other <span>biologically active substances.</span> </p><p>  <strong>How to get base oils?</strong> </p><p>  Vegetable oil is obtained mainly from the kernels, fruits or seeds of plants after the so-called cold pressing.  Subsequently, the resulting substances drive a series of filters.  Such technology does not provide for exposure to high temperatures, and, therefore, finished oils retain their beneficial properties to the maximum. </p><p>  <strong>What are base oils used for?</strong> </p><p>  The beneficial properties of vegetable oils have been known for several thousand years.  After all, it was with their help in the ancient world that women looked after their skin.  In addition, oils were used in medicine. </p><p>  These healthy products have not lost their significance to this day.  Indeed, almost any cream, lotion, mask or any other cosmetic product contains certain vegetable oils.  Each of them has unique properties. </p><p>  Cosmetic oil nourishes and moisturizes the skin, normalizes metabolism and blood supply, promotes the formation of collagen and fibrinogen, normalizes the sebaceous glands. </p><p>  In addition, vegetable base oils are used in medicine, for example, in the manufacture of ointments or creams.

In a word, the range of use of these natural products is very wide. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Basic base oils</strong> </p><p>  The skin of every woman needs special care.
