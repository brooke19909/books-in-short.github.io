In its historical center you can visit the main attraction - the castle.  However, not all locals know that it is in their hometown that the longest residential building in the world is located.  The building, included in the Guinness Book of Records, has a double address: Sobornosti Avenue and Youth Street.  If you look at the record house from a bird's eye view, it is easy to notice that its shape resembles a honeycomb.  The building consists of many buildings with a height of 5 and 9 floors.  The construction of an impressive <span>residential complex</span> began in 1969.  And only after 11 years, the longest house in the world was commissioned and received the first happy new settlers.  What is noteworthy, even today this attraction remains unofficial.  About the long house do not write in travel guides.  Even many apartment owners are not aware that they live in a building with a record length.

Officially, the length of the building is 1750 meters, but if you measure the building along with all the branches, you get a more impressive figure - 2775 meters.  There are legends that the first tenants often confused courtyards and porches.  It became easier to navigate after the <span>improvement of the local area.</span>  Bright playgrounds, flowerbeds and trees allowed residents to recognize their homesteads.  There are only 120 entrances in the gigantic building. When visiting Lutsk, you should definitely see with your own eyes the longest house in the world.  A memory photo with this attraction, however, is unlikely to be done.  The thing is that the house is so long that it does not fit entirely into the camera‚Äôs lens from any point of view.  Locals sometimes even prefer to take a minibus or bus to visit their home neighbors from another entrance.  The people call this unusual building the "Wall of China."

One of the most famous among them is the ‚Äúgut‚Äù house, located in the Spartanovka Volgograd microdistrict.  The total length of the structure is 1140 meters.  The long nine-story building got its popular name because of its unusual twisted shape.  If you look at the building from a height, its contours resemble the letter G. In total, there are 1,200 apartments in the gigantic residential complex.  Like the longest house in the world, its Volgograd counterpart has a double address: Nikolay Otrada Street and Gramshy Street.  Long residential buildings are available in the capital of Russia.  Often the longest Moscow house is called the residential complex in Otradnoye, whose length is about 1400 meters.  However, this is not entirely true, since this structure consists of many separate buildings built too close to each other.  But in the Khoroshevsky district of Moscow there really is a long house located at 4 Gribuzova Street.

What caused the creation and implementation of such projects?  In fact, the answer is quite simple.  In the USSR, the main requirement of the government was: build quickly and efficiently.  At the same time, from an engineering point of view it is easier, and sometimes cheaper, to build one building, albeit not quite ordinary, than several separate ones.  As for aesthetics - typical high-rise buildings at that time were fashionable.  It is worth noting that upon commissioning, they looked much prettier than today, after almost half a century.  Today, urban architecture solves completely different tasks.  Most likely, for a long time the building in Lutsk will retain its honorary title - the longest house in the world.  The Guinness Book of Records is now actively updated with the names of high-rise buildings, arguing for the title of the tallest skyscraper.
