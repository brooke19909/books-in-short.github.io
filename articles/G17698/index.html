Every day, thousands of tourists seek to visit a living fairy tale on the water and imbued with a romantic atmosphere.  The greatness of Venice's architectural masterpieces is simply stunning; these are real works of art that leave an indelible impression on all lovers who have visited the city.  One of them, the most ancient, will be discussed today. </p><h2>  Construction history </h2><p>  The ancient Rialto Bridge is rightly called the hallmark of Venice.  Until the 19th century, only this building connected the banks of the Grand Canal.  All previously built wooden bridges collapsed, unable to withstand human weight, or were destroyed by fire.  The authorities began to think about building the first <span>stone bridge,</span> because the multiple shops located at the crossing brought considerable income to the city treasury.  In the XVI century, a competition was announced for the best design of a durable bridge, the winner of which was Antonio de Ponte. </p><h2>  Breaking Canon Project </h2><p>  By the way, contemporaries did not understand the choice and gossip that the elderly architect was chosen only because of the sonorous name, translated as ‚Äúbridge‚Äù.  It was strange that his project went around the project of Michelangelo himself, in addition, the architect proposed a construction with one, not several arches, as was customary at that time.  But we must pay tribute to the genius of the master who designed the favorite place for tourists - in its original form the Rialto Bridge has survived to this day.  It is believed that this project is most consistent with the spirit of the time, in addition, it did not require large expenses.  It is interesting that the architect violated all the canons of bridge construction by lowering the height of his brainchild. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ialto bridge" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1063298.jpg" width="360"></div>

The canal of palaces (Grand Canal) permeates the whole of Venice, and the amazing structure was the first to be laid through it.  Later 3 more bridges were built, but the Rialto is considered the most beautiful of them. </p><h2>  Grand construction </h2><p>  A unique architectural monument was named on behalf of the Rivoalto Islands, which from Latin translates as "high coast".  It was on them that from time immemorial, refugees who had saved their lives from the invasion of the Huns had found refuge, who had fled from the shores of the Gulf of Venice.  Later, the islands turned into a city, which today is a truly amazing building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rialto bridge venice" class="if" height="216" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1063296.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Rialto Bridge was built without reinforcement in the form of a metal frame, and for extra strength 12 thousand piles were driven into the bottom.  The single-arched covered bridge, lined with marble and decorated with reliefs, has a height of seven and a half meters above the water.  Thanks to this, large vessels pass freely under the span.  The grandiose building immediately becomes the busiest place, and to this day it is extremely popular among visitors, and on the pier near the bridge there is a large parking of gondolas.  Every day, the oldest attraction is visited by about seven thousand tourists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tips for travelers who decide to visit the Rialto Bridge (Venice) </h2><p>  Tourists strive to walk around the local architectural monument, buy souvenirs from numerous shopping arcades and take vivid photographs.  Local guides advise making wishes as soon as the gondola is under the Venetian bridge.  And ancient legends say that all lovers will be inseparable and happy if they kiss each other in this place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ialto canal bridge" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1063295.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Due to the fact that the Rialto bridge was erected in a rather narrow place, its throughput is very low, and therefore we have to expect to go through it.  The inexhaustible flow of tourists is explained not only by the historical value and beauty of Rialto, it houses modern boutiques selling expensive jewelry, leather souvenirs, world famous <span>Venetian masks.</span>  The guides warn that prices here are unusually high, so people on a budget have to enjoy just the look of Venice's business card.  From early morning, fish and fruit markets selling only fresh produce begin to operate on the bridge.  It must be remembered that Sunday is a day off for all shops, so on the weekend you can only contemplate the beautiful view that opens onto the Grand Canal. </p><h2>  Bridge restoration </h2><p>  Surprisingly, indescribably beautiful arch bridge Rialto.  Venice considers it to be its symbol and takes care of its restoration.  A myriad of tourists is destroying the Italian pearl.  Radiography of the underwater and ground parts of the bridge revealed significant wear and tear, requiring immediate restoration.  The restoration, planned in 2012, was postponed due to the lack of a contractor for such serious work.  It was planned to open a bridge for tourists in May, but reconstruction is still underway. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rialto bridge italy" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1063293.jpg" width="338"></div>

    <p>  In November, a seminar on the restoration of city monuments was held in Florence, during which specialists from Moscow met with foreign colleagues.  Our delegation visited Venice and examined the Rialto Bridge.  Italy shared with Russia the secrets of restoration work to save the unique masterpieces of world culture. </p><p>  I would like to believe that the protracted restoration will end, and millions of tourists will enjoy the view of the renewed <span>sights of Venice.</span> </p>
