Surrounded by majestic stone blocks-idols covered with rich vegetation, rivers and rice fields, it does not seem at all divorced from civilization.  Restaurants and cafes amid stunning landscapes, the friendliness and hospitality of local residents, a humid tropical climate, many interesting places have turned the city into a small tourist paradise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="philippineslifestyle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yangshuo China" class="if uuid-2980929" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2980929.jpg"></div><h2>  Yangshuo in China: a description of the city </h2><p>  A small town is located 70 km from the resort of Guilin.  From Chinese, its name can be translated as "Bright moon."  Judging by the reviews of tourists, the nature here is not inferior to the picturesque Guilin, but less spoiled by city buildings. </p><p>  A feature of these places can be considered karst peaks.  These are huge limestone rocks that underwent erosion for several centuries.  Over time, they acquired an unusual and very beautiful appearance.  There are 18 of them here. In the karst mountains, inland waters wash caves, which also became natural monuments of the Yangshuo neighborhood in China. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.1zoom.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Description of the city" class="if uuid-2980948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2980948.jpg"></div><p>  Only thirty years ago, until China opened its borders to tourists, including independent ones, this place was an ordinary tiny village in which the life of Chinese peasants was calm and measured.  Today, the city of Yangshuo in China, whose photo we posted in this article, is visited by about 8 million tourists annually.  In fairness, it should be noted that the vast majority of them (about 7 million) are travelers from the Middle Kingdom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Russian tourists in this city are still not very frequent, but there is something to see here: the picturesque landscapes of Yangshuo seem to have gone from the pages of a book of ancient fairy tales and have preserved their charming attractiveness to this day. </p><h2>  Sights of the city and surroundings: Silver Cave </h2><p>  Karst cave is located in the picturesque area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGuilin.  It passes through twelve mountains, and its length is about two kilometers.  The silver cave can be divided into three parts: the upper, the grand hall, as well as the lower cave.  Inside, you can see more than 40 amazing natural "paintings" that form stalactites. </p><p>  The cave impresses with its high ceilings, a river flowing deep underground, waterfalls and, of course, picturesque stalactites and stalagmites, stone curtains and pillars and several dozens of amazing places with screens, lights and music. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.visitourchina.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Silver cave" class="if uuid-2980980" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2980980.jpg"></div><h2>  Moon hill </h2><p>  The mountain, located in the vicinity of Yangshuo in China, gained its popularity due to an unusual peak.  In its center is a hole resembling a crescent in shape.  The Chinese are confident that from different angles the mountain changes shape, and its opening resembles the moon, which is in different phases. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From the top of this unusual peak offers stunning views of the hills and rice fields, the Li River Valley.  The hill is located 10 km from Yangshuo.  You can get to it on your own by bicycle, which can be rented at any hotel, or take part in guided tours organized by local travel agencies. </p><p>  Climbing to the top of the hill along the stone steps (more than a thousand) will take you about an hour and will require some effort.  It is necessary to choose the most comfortable shoes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yangtzecruiseexperts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moon hill" class="if uuid-2981006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2981006.jpg"></div><h2>  Yulong river </h2><p>  This is the largest tributary of the Li River flowing in the vicinity of Yangshuo.  Its name translates from Chinese as "Meet the Dragon."  Sometimes the river is called Dragon.  According to legend, in ancient times, a dragon flew into these parts from the South China Sea.  He was so impressed by the beauty of the area that he stayed here to live. </p><p>  The purest river carries its blue waters, meandering between karst hills.  At their feet are rice fields and tiny villages.  A small path has been laid along the river, along which you can ride a bicycle or a moped.  You can get acquainted with the landscapes of the river, going on an exciting journey on a raft along Yulun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You can see traditional Chinese houses and ancient bridges, peasant women who wash clothes directly in the water, fishermen, farmers who cultivate rice fields, enjoy the beauty of local landscapes.  The longest river excursion takes almost five hours.  During this time, tourists swim under five ancient bridges, see the ancient settlements of Gucheng, Beisha and Huantu, as well as another attraction of Yangshuo in China - a huge thousand-year-old banyan tree. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.edeltrips.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yulong river" class="if uuid-2981022" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2981022.jpg"></div><p>  We recommend that you pay attention to the Dragon Bridge.  The age of this building, according to local residents, exceeds five centuries.  It is located in Zhujiazhai Village.  The arched stone bridge really impresses with its beauty. </p><h2>  West street </h2><p>  This pedestrian Yangshuo street in China is located in the very center of the town.  It starts at the bus station and leads to the very banks of the Lijiang River.  The buildings here are mostly carved with beautiful roofs, whitewashed white walls, made in the South Chinese style. </p><p>  All tourists come to this street in search of souvenirs.  If you combine a walk along the street with a visit to each souvenir shop, it will take at least three hours, while without going into the shops, you can walk the street in only a quarter of an hour from start to finish.  But do not deny yourself the pleasure - in the shops they sell Tibetan silver, handmade pillowcases with national embroideries, silk robes and jewelry, designer bags, felt toys, and the extraordinary beauty of porcelain dolls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cavinteo.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="West street" class="if uuid-2981047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2981047.jpg"></div><p>  In all stores that do not have a No bargain! Sign, you can feel free to bargain.  There are dozens of restaurants on West Street.  The vast majority of them offer dishes of national and European cuisine.  Most cafes here open in the morning, offering guests comprehensive breakfast options that include juice, coffee, scrambled eggs and toast. </p><h2>  Light show </h2><p>  Well-known far beyond the city, the evening music and light show was staged by renowned director in China Zhang Yimou.  "Liu Sanjie" is a unique production of its kind.  The performance takes place on the Lijiang River, three kilometers long, in the open.  Its decorations were 12 illuminated peaks of the city, a starry sky and a river shimmering with shimmering glare. </p><p>  The show was first presented to the public in March 2004.  Preparations for it took almost five years.  This is the largest show in the world where natural landscapes are used as scenery.  Rain and fog, moonlight, reflections of the hills in the river - all this is part of the performance, which is designed to sing the beauty of Lijiang. </p><div class="photo" data-original="daybydaybyphoto.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Light show" class="if uuid-2981038" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2981038.jpg"></div><p>  The color of the mountains changes from blue, red, green and gold to silver and purple, depending on the scenes of the performance.  The auditorium is located on a natural island surrounded by trees and bamboo. </p><h2>  How to get to Yangshuo in China? </h2><p>  The most convenient way to get to the city is from Guilin Airport.  When transferring a group of three to four people, it is better to use a shuttle bus that runs from the airport to Yangshuo Station.  The bus leaves strictly according to the schedule almost every hour starting from 9:30.  The last bus leaves at 22:30. </p><p>  There is also a more affordable option for traveling to the wonderful city of Yangshuo in China.  To do this, get to Guilin by train.  In this case, the road will take a day. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="24.77848" data-lng="110.49659300000008" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/2/4/3/12243.png"></div><h2>  Reviews and recommendations of tourists </h2><p>  Almost all travelers were delighted with a trip to Yangshuo in China.  In the reviews, people note the stunning beauty of these places - it seems that you were in a fairy tale.  The unique landscape, stunning nature, hospitality and friendliness of local residents cannot but admire.  Since everything in the city is aimed at a comfortable stay for tourists, there are no problems with accommodation and meals in Yangshuo.  Everyone who has already visited this city recommend that those who are just planning a trip pay attention to several important points: </p><ul><li>  The Chinese wake up very early - at 5 o‚Äôclock, and the working day ends no later than 18:00.  It gets dark early here, so many shops and public places are closed at this time. </li><li>  Rafting on the river is better to start in the afternoon, when there are much fewer tourists on rafts. </li><li>  For souvenirs, it is better to go to a huge market in the village of Xinping.  There you can buy gifts and antiques cheaper than in Yangshuo. </li></ul>
