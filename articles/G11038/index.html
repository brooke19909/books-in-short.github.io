  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Canon 1200D Digital Camera: Professional Reviews and Findings</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Canon EOS 1200D model was created to become the new basic level SLR camera, replacing the EOS 1100D.  Since the camera is aimed at beginners and those who are not familiar with the use of Digital SLR, the manufacturer has released a new application for devices running Android and iOS so that users can find out how the camera works.  The application covers the basics, including the operation of the mode switch, changing settings, and teaches how to hold the device to get the best photos. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The 1200D, also known in the US as the Rebel T5, is available both without a lens and with EF-S 18-55 mm DC III optics and EF-S 18-55 mm IS II with integrated optical image stabilization. </p><p>  The device is equipped with an 18-megapixel APS-C sensor used in the manufacturer‚Äôs 700D model and other EOS cameras, which replaced the 12 megapixel sensor on the 1100D.  In addition, the camera has a 3-inch screen, which is also an improvement on the old 2.7-inch screen.  Instead of 720p, Full HD video appeared.  As a result, the Canon EOS base-level camera almost caught up with Nikon's similar DSLR offerings, though without having received continuous shooting at 4 fps, the external microphone jack and the 11-point autofocus offered in the D3200, content with relatively slow three frames in second and 9-point AF system. </p>

    <p>  There are a number of creative shooting modes, as well as scene modes with simple settings described in an understandable language, so you do not need to understand apertures and shutter speeds to, for example, change settings, create a blurry background or a brighter image.  To change the camera settings and get the desired results, just change the on-screen option. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Key Features: </p><ul><li>  18MP CMOS APS-C sensor, </li><li>  3 '' screen with 460,000 dots, </li><li>  DIGIC 4 processor, </li><li>  1080p high definition video </li><li>  ease of use Intelligent Auto, </li><li>  ISO 100-12800 (extended), </li><li>  maximum shutter speed 1/4000 s, </li><li>  9 AF points located throughout the frame. </li></ul><p>  The 1200D was released with an app called the EOS Companion App, which can be downloaded from the Google and Apple stores.  It has several parts.  The basics of photography are outlined in the training section.  This is followed by a fact-finding section, where you can learn more about the camera and its settings, followed by ‚ÄúInspiration‚Äù, intended for further introduction into the photo after the initial acquaintance with the camera. </p><h2>  Canon 1200D review: professional reviews </h2><p>  The camera sits perfectly in the hand thanks to a nice rubber handle with textured rubber for the thumb on the back, along with an improved textured plastic case compared to the 1100D.  The optical viewfinder is equipped with a rubber frame that will be needed by those who wear glasses.  The screen is quite difficult to use in bright sunlight, but at other times it is quite bright, with good color reproduction and easily readable text and options.  Camera controls provide access to necessary functions, and the Q button provides quick access to frequently used rear screen settings. </p>

    <h2>  Menu </h2><p>  The <span>Canon 1200D</span> menu system <span>reviews by</span> professionals are called logically well thought out.  The items used during shooting are highlighted in red, the playback menu is marked in blue, the settings in orange, and the custom menu in green.  It allows you to place all your favorite settings on one page for quick access to frequently used functions.  In addition, the camera allows you to get help for each menu item, which together creates a very convenient system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Battery life </h2><p>  According to Canon / CIPA test results, the battery is rated for 500 shots.  This is a lot, but it is customary to expect better battery life from digital SLR cameras. </p><h2>  Canon 1200D: professional reviews and descriptions </h2><p>  To check the speed of the device from turning on to take the first photo, focus, time between shots, etc., several shots were taken.  The obtained values ‚Äã‚Äãwere averaged, which gave the following results, which make it easy to compare the camera with other cameras: </p><ul><li>  shutter release time: 0.1 s; </li><li>  same with wide focus: 0.3 s; </li><li>  same with full zoom: 0.25 s; </li><li>  turn on time: 0.4 s; </li><li>  time between shots without flash: 0.4 s; </li><li>  same with flash: 0.5 s; </li><li>  JPEG shooting speed (number of frames to slow down): 3 fps (16 frames); </li><li>  same with flash: 2 fps (36 frames); </li><li>  RAW shooting speed: 3 fps (6 frames and stop). </li></ul><p>  Focus and shutter response are quick, the camera turns on quickly and takes pictures quickly, even when using a Canon 1200D flash.  Experts' reviews of the characteristics of the camera when viewing on the screen are called unacceptable, and when shooting moving objects, it is better to avoid it, except when you need to use the device away from the eyes at different angles. </p>

    <h2>  Control </h2><p>  The controls are simple and functional.  Four navigation buttons allow you to change the ISO sensitivity, shooting mode (single; burst and 2-, 10-second and custom self-timer), white balance and autofocus settings (single, AI and Servo AI). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Exposure compensation, video recording, on-screen sighting, menus, quick controls, playback, and on-screen buttons occupy the rest of the space around them.  All keys are flat, with a slight tactile feedback.  The exception is the exposure lock and AF point buttons located under the thumb.  They still manage to stay soft to the touch. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúSet‚Äù button in the center can be programmed so that you can improve image quality, compensate for flash exposure, preview depth of field, and turn the LCD on or off.  True, a preview of the depth of field, as a rule, cannot be seen in small dim viewfinders, like this camera, so the owner is very limited in choosing the destination.  In addition, you can reassign the flash button to control the ISO speed, although there is already a dedicated button on the rear panel for this.  A limited feature set does not require much direct access flexibility. </p><p>  On the top panel is a hot shoe, mode switch, flash button and power switch.  The mode dial contains the usual modes: manual, semi-automatic and automatic.  Unlike many manufacturers that have smart or intelligent auto mode (auto mode in which you can change some settings), Canon calls it ‚Äúcreative auto‚Äù.  And Canon's intelligent scene mode is actually a simple, old automatic. </p>

    <h2>  Test shots </h2><p>  The reviews of professionals call the exposition of Canon 1200D reliable, the camera allows you to receive images with excellent color, a good level of saturation and very pleasant skin tones.  Portrait photographs taken with the flash do not give red-eye effect.  Images shot in low light have good color reproduction, and a complete lens is capable of taking close-up photos with a pleasantly blurred background. </p><h2>  Lens </h2><p>  Photos have good exposure and dynamic range, and the automatic lighting optimization feature improves detail in shaded and bright areas of the image.  Canon EOS 1200D Kit lens reviews of professionals characterize as a device with a good level of detail in both wide-angle shooting and using a telephoto lens.  Photos are less contrasted in the corners, have a purple halo and chromatic aberration, also more in the corners, especially when photographing with high contrast.  Optics are quite resistant to glare, even when shooting with the sun in the center of the frame.  Focusing with the optical viewfinder is fast and reliable, but much slower with on-screen viewing. </p>

    <h2>  Noise characteristics </h2><p>  To achieve the lowest noise and highest detail on the Canon 1200D, professional reviews recommend using ISO100-800.  For lower light levels, ISO1600‚Äì3200 still gives good results, although the amount of noise increases and detail decreases.  At ISO6400, the noise becomes loud, and professionals recommend avoiding this setting if possible.  True, while reducing the size of the image, the images may still be suitable for use on the Internet.  ISO12800 is best avoided as noise is extremely high and detail is low.  To evaluate the impact of interference on images in the Canon 1200D, professional and customer reviews recommend viewing them at 100% magnification. </p><h2>  White balance </h2><p>  In warm light incandescent bulbs, automatic white balance (AWB) works well.  The corresponding preset gives a similar result, and to achieve more accurate color reproduction, it is recommended to use a custom white balance.  AWB works very well in fluorescent lighting.  Preset allows you to shoot no worse. </p>

    <h2>  Digital filters </h2><p>  The camera has several ‚Äúauto-creative‚Äù modes, each of which gives the pictures a slightly different look and style.  In order to shoot in an extended dynamic range, you need to use auto-exposure bracketing and independently combine photos using Photoshop or another image editor.  An alternative is to write the image to RAW files. </p><h2>  Video </h2><p>  Video quality when recording in 1080p at a speed of 30, 25 or 24 fps is good, although due to the fact that there is no image stabilization of the manual video in the lens, camera shake will most likely be noticeable.  For best results, it is recommended that you use the IS version or use a tripod.  For a more serious work with video in the Canon 1200D, reviews by professionals and owners are advised to use a camera with an external microphone jack. </p><h2>  Price and quality </h2><p>  The camera is available complete with an 18-55 mm lens, without or with image stabilization, with a very good price-quality ratio, which makes the camera one of the cheapest Canon DSLR cameras with an 18 megapixel sensor.  The price is in the same range as the 24-megapixel <span>Nikon D3200</span> and the 20-megapixel Sony Alpha A58.  Before choosing a Canon EOS 1200D Kit, professional reviews recommend that you consider the following alternatives: </p><ul><li>  Canon EOS 600D, 18 MP, 3.7 fps, 18-55 mm IS; </li><li>  1100D, 12 MP, 3.2 fps, 18-55 mm (without IS); </li><li>  100D, 18 MP, 4 fps, 18-55 mm (without IS); </li><li>  Nikon D3100, 14 MP, 3 fps, VR lens; </li><li>  D3300, 24 megapixels, 5 fps, VR II; </li><li>  D3200, 24 MP, 4 fps, VR II; </li><li>  <span>Sony Alpha A58</span> (EVF), 20 megapixels, 5 fps with continuous autofocus; </li><li>  <span>Pentax K-50,</span> 16 megapixel, 6 fps, the lens and body are resistant to weathering. </li></ul><p>  You can also consider the following mirrorless cameras if you need a smaller camera with a built-in electronic viewfinder: </p><ul><li>  Panasonic Lumix G6, 16 megapixel, 7 fps </li><li>  Panasonic Lumix G5, 16 megapixel, 6 fps </li></ul><p>  In addition, you will need to purchase a memory card and a case or bag so that the device is safe and secure. </p>

    <h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  The 1200D offers a decent upgrade to the 1100D, featuring an 18-megapixel APS-C sensor, an improved rubber grip and a more ergonomic body, with an improved finish compared to the rather budget and ‚Äúplastic‚Äù 1100D.  The camera can also shoot Full HD and provides vivid colorful images.  However, for those who have previously used a compact camera, viewing on the screen will be depressingly slow when focusing.  Technical specifications, which, compared to the 1100D, have improved in the Canon 1200D, are not considered by professionals to be competitive or correspond to the more impressive characteristics of the basic level offers from Nikon, Sony and Pentax.  These companies have noticeably raised the bar for DSLRs <span>for beginners.</span> </p><p>  Canon 1200D camera reviews by professionals are called the long-awaited and long overdue update, which, instead of competing with its technical specifications and functions, offers a fairly standard set of options.  Nevertheless, for those who want to purchase a basic level of Canon EOS digital SLR camera, the 1200D provides excellent image quality and has a convenient body with good ergonomics.  The Canon 1200D is characterized by professional reviews as a device that is easy to use, with an application useful for both beginners and those who want to know more about their camera.  The low cost of the kit with the lens makes it extremely competitive, although the lack of image stabilization in comparison with competitors looks mediocre.  For beginners or those who want to have an optical viewfinder along with the ability to change lenses, which Canon has a lot, the EOS 1200D is a good choice. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  In the Canon 1200D, reviews of professional dignity are found by: </p><ul><li>  good value for money; </li><li>  excellent color reproduction; </li><li>  availability of an application convenient for beginners; </li><li>  ease of use; </li><li>  good noise characteristics; </li><li>  fast focusing (except for on-screen sighting); </li><li>  large battery capacity. </li></ul><p>  In the Canon 1200D, reviews of professionals see the following flaws: </p><ul><li>  the lens included in the kit does not have image stabilization; </li><li>  there is no automatic mode of the extended dynamic range (Auto-HDR); </li><li>  selective focusing on screen sight; </li><li>  continuous shooting speed is only 3 fps. </li></ul>
