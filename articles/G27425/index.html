    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is next to the hotel </h2><p>  Hanioti Grandotel 4 * hotel is located on a peninsula called Kassandra.  It is near the city of Thessaloniki.  The hotel is located in the village of Hanioti, so it is called that.  Thanks to this, guests can roam the old picturesque streets of this town, see its sights and visit souvenir shops, grocery stores and even hypermarkets.  In the village you can buy everything that only you want to bring from Greece.  By the way, Chanioti is not inferior in its popularity to the famous Kallithea.  It is pleasant to walk here, the streets are very busy, there are many cafes and authentic taverns with amazingly delicious Greek food.  Tourists recommend the Omega-3 restaurant for lunch, which is located immediately upon leaving the hotel.  There is also a park, a church and all the tourist infrastructure.  At the same time, although the Hanioti Grandotel 4 * hotel (Halkidiki, Kassandra) is a five-minute walk from the central square of Hanioti, it is very quiet on its territory.  On the other hand, the hotel stands directly on the sea, to the water from any of its buildings no more than two hundred meters - one or two minutes to go.  And in sunny weather from the windows you can see the holy Mount Athos.  Some write that this alone can charge with positive energy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hanioti Grandotel 4 Greece Halkidiki Cassandra" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1393837.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Thessaloniki and the surrounding area - is it possible to go on a seaside vacation to the mainland? </h2><p>  And what is this place where the Hanioti Grandotel 4 * hotel is located (Greece)?  Halkidiki, Kassandra - these regions are known for the fact that there are many very deep bays that penetrate into the sea, which quickly warm up.  Therefore, the season here begins earlier and ends later than in other places on the mainland.  The peninsula is very green, so even in the hot summer it seems that eternal spring reigns here.  Yes, and there are not very many people, although it is enough that infrastructure and all conditions for recreation are created for them.  Halkidiki is one of the most "promoted" mainland Greek resorts.  It is a trident shaped peninsula.  There is never a choking heat.  And Cassandra is one of his "teeth."  The peninsula is famous for a very comfortable and relaxing holiday.  To come here to plunge into the warm and clear water, as well as bask in the sun, you need from May to September.  The sea is calm, waves are rare, and the mountains protect the area well from cold winds.  The peninsula of Kassandra has the glory of the mystical.  It is also one of the most environmentally friendly Greek resorts.  The air here smells like cypresses, sea breezes, it’s good for those who have lung problems or respiratory diseases to breathe.  So, if you choose the mainland for relaxation, and not the Greek islands, you will not regret it. </p><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  The Hanioti Grandotel 4 * hotel (Halkidiki) has a paid parking for guests and a shop with fur coats.  In the lobby at the reception there is an Internet cafe with Wi-Fi.  Here you can rent a car.  The hotel is designed in such a way that you can see the sea from the restaurant and bar.  The territory is small, but beautiful and very well maintained.  In fact, it consists of a courtyard between the buildings and a patio by the pool bar.  But the convenient location of the hotel completely compensates for its size.  The first cottage is located on a hill.  From there, a small staircase leads to the sea.  There is also a restaurant and lobby where the Internet works.  There is no elevator, but the rooms are larger.  From the windows of the second building, parallel to the first, you can see mostly mountains, and there are fewer rooms.  But in this building it’s more shady and the sun never looks there.  In addition, an elevator works there.  Since the Hanioti Grandotel 4 * hotel (Kassandra) is Greek, that is, European, the rest in it is designed for self-sufficient people.  Therefore, tourists are not accepted here in the same way as in Egypt and Turkey, and what is better is up to you.  If you want to go to the promenade, then you don’t need to walk around the hotel.  Go out the gate - and there the whole world opens for you.  This is one of the main bonuses of the hotel.  After all, most of the resort hotels of the peninsula are located far from the villages, and to go to the store or to the club, you need to go by public transport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hanioti Grandotel 4 Halkidiki Cassandra" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1393833.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach, sea, pool and water activities </h2><p>  Hotel Hanioti Grandotel 4 *, the reviews of which we analyze here, positions itself as a beach.  Therefore, it has its own coast.  It is well equipped - showers, toilets, umbrellas, trestle beds.  But lying comfortably in the shade is free only for holders of all inclusive vouchers.  Towels are also issued to them without money (however, on bail).  There are always sunbeds, they are enough.  A beautiful staircase leads to the beach.  Here you will find many water activities - canoeing, water skiing, scooters, parachutes - but all this for extra money.  The sea itself is very transparent, emerald in color, with amazingly clear water.  There are no jellyfish, so vacationers with children can not be afraid.  You can watch the fish and the underwater world without a mask at all.  The beach itself is sandy, with a convenient pebble entrance to the sea.  Compared with neighboring hotels, this beach was called the best.  The Hanioti Grandotel Hotel 4 * has a freshwater-filled pool.  It is small, and tourists mainly use it as an opportunity to swim after salt baths. </p><h2>  Excursions and shopping </h2><p>  Of course, the main trip, which is especially impressive for the guests of the Grandotel Hanioti Resort 4 * hotel, is Meteors.  No one can resist the beauty of these monasteries, like eagle nests hanging on huge sheer cliffs.  Tourists also recommend a sightseeing tour of Thessaloniki, and the most active can make a trip to the immortal gods - to the foot of the legendary Mount Olympus and even its peak.  Fans of history and philosophy can visit Stagira - the place where Aristotle was born.  And the <span>cave of Petralon</span> and the Anthropological Museum will attract those who are interested in ancient people.  Those who come for the long term are advised to take a day trip to Athens.  If you rent a car, you will gain a sense of freedom and you can see a lot in the short term.  Indeed, there are also many interesting sights on the Kassandra peninsula.  For example, in Agios Pavlov there is an ancient tower of Byzantine times.  The village of Afitos lives according to the traditional rules; excursions are also carried there.  And in Nea Foki is the famous monastery on Mount Athos.  Once Zeus and Apollo were worshiped here, and now it is one of the most famous Christian shrines.  Just keep in mind that women are strictly forbidden to enter there, and not every man (if he is not Greek) can get there.  Want to buy something in memory of Greece?  A fur coat can be purchased directly at the hotel, but if you want to visit a good fur factory, go to Kastoria.  Hanioti itself recommends a children's clothing store where you can buy quality items from European and American brands.  Fur items are also cheaper in the village than in a hotel - discounts are up to fifty percent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hanioti Grandotel Hotel 4 Reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1393839.jpg" width="600"></div>
