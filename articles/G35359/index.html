    <h2>  Party boss gift </h2><p>  Hitler's favorite dog was a German shepherd named Blondie.  The Fuhrer was presented with it in 1941 by the head of the Party Chancellery of the NSDAP, <span>Martin Bormann.</span>  Her portrait, personally painted by Hitler, opens the article.  The dog was so fond of his new owner that he stayed with him throughout the war years.  At the end of 1944, following the Fuhrer into the underground bunker, which became his last refuge, Blondi shared the inglorious death of her master. </p><p>  Shortly before the tragic end, Adolf Hitler's dog gave birth to five puppies.  Their father was a purebred representative of the German Shepherd breed, a male dog named Harass, owned by the widow of the famous German architect Paul Troost, who was also looking for salvation behind the concrete walls of the bunker. </p><h2>  The death of Blondie and her Wolf </h2><p>  Hitler gave one of the puppies the name Wolf, which means “wolf”.  It is believed that he did this in his honor, since his own name - Adolf - translates as "a noble wolf."  As it became known later, shortly before the suicide, the Führer ordered his personal doctor Ludwig Stumpfegger to euthanize Blondie by giving her a cyanide tablet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In May 1945, when the half-burnt bodies of the Fuhrer and his wife Eva Braun were found in the garden of the Reich Chancellery, a corpse of Hitler's dog was found next to them (a photo of the animal is given in the article) and her puppy Wolf.  The fate of the rest of the offspring remained unknown.  An interesting detail: at the same time, the remains of not only the head of the Third Reich and his wife, but also of both dogs were opened. </p><p>  As can be seen from the surviving documents, Blondie was killed not by the action of poison, as her master desired, but by a shot in the head.  This is evidenced by a bullet hole in the skull.  It should be assumed that the dog spit out a cyanide tablet placed in her mouth, and then someone from Hitler’s entourage had to resort to weapons.  A similar fate befell the little Wolf.  So they replenished the number of innocent victims of the war unleashed by their possessed master. </p><h2>  The birth of a legend </h2><p>  In the postwar years, the image of Blondie was repeatedly used in cinema and literature, as a result of which the nickname of the dog Hitler became known to the general public.  In particular, we can mention the film “The Fall of Berlin”, directed by Mikhail Chiaureli, released in 1949 on the country's screens. </p>

    <p>  It would seem that this completes the story of Hitler’s dog, and we can only talk about it as an insignificant episode in the life of a bloody dictator.  However, fate decreed otherwise: the physical death of the animal was the beginning of an amazing legend, in which frank mysticism intertwined with pseudoscientific fiction. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Newspaper sensation </h2><p>  Soon after the end of World War II, reports appeared in the pages of the Western yellow press that in the 40s, German scientists conducted strictly classified experiments to create some kind of artificially bred creature, which was based on a German shepherd. </p><p>  The result of these genetic experiments should have possessed, in addition to the qualities inherent in every true Aryan, such as excellent muscles, ruthlessness to enemies and Nordic temperament, also completely unique properties ─ the highest intelligence and physiological immortality.  But that is not all.  It was assumed that the monster, bred in the laboratory, will be able to contain the soul, and with it the intelligence of a particular person, thus providing him with eternal life. </p>

    <h2>  The legend that excited the minds </h2><p>  It should be noted that the idea of ​​reincarnation (relocation of souls) was close to Hitler, who had a fair tendency to mysticism.  It is enough to recall the Nazi attempts to find the holy grail.  Therefore, the legend of the immortal dog of Hitler, in which the dictator was going to reincarnate in the event of the failure of his military adventure, fell into fertile soil. </p><p>  Immediately there were reports that indicated not only the name of the scientific center in which the studies were conducted, but also the name of the head of work.  This role was assigned to Wolfram Sievers ─ a major German scientist specializing in applied bacteriology. </p><h2>  Escape from Berlin </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the inevitability of the collapse of the Third Reich became more apparent every day, and work had to be done in a hurry, scientists were able to artificially create only one individual, supposedly possessing the required qualities and then nicknamed, or rather, the symbol MUHA.  It was she who allegedly was the <span>famous dog of</span> Hitler. </p>

    <p>  Further in the newspapers, it was suggested that perhaps the inner essence, or, more simply, the soul of Hitler, moved into the dog, which was then taken out of Berlin, and will live with it indefinitely because of its unlimited life cycle.  Regarding the corpse of Blondi, discovered in the garden of the Reich Chancellery, it was said that, apparently, these remains belonged to a completely different dog, and were planted for misinformation. </p><h2>  A new round of insanity </h2><p>  Having made a lot of noise at one time, this story gradually died out and gave way to other sensations in the press.  However, in 2007 she received her new development.  This time, the media surprised the world with a message that allegedly secret documents related to the creation of a Hitler dog and taken out of Germany in 1945 were discovered in the Central Archive of the Russian Ministry of Defense.  Moreover, among the materials was a photograph of the only individual that German scientists managed to get. </p><p>  The real sensation was the message that at the time when agents of the Soviet special services removed documents related to the creation of an immortal monster from secret vaults, Hitler’s supporters managed to secretly take the dog to Moscow, since they reasonably believed that this was the last place in the world, where they will look for her.  Given the inherent ability to endlessly reproduce its life cycle, such information suggested that Hitler’s dog, or rather, its possessed owner, is today somewhere in the very center of Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Legend hunters </h2><p>  Is it any wonder that after this there was a mass of initiative groups that set off to search in the capital, and not only in it, the ill-fated dog with a Nazi past.  Based on the surviving photographs of the real Blondie, a digital reconstruction was created by computer, capable, according to its creators, of the million simple dogs to identify the one that so excited their imagination. </p><p>  They say that in recent years she was seen three times in different parts of the capital, but each time the insidious animal, growling viciously, hid from its pursuers.  This is not surprising, because once upon a time they invested in it powerful intellect and fearlessness of a true Aryan.  What was the name of Hitler’s dog in the past, it’s known, but no one knows what name she is hiding today.  Most likely, she has several of them, like any self-respecting secret agent. </p>
