The fabric should be dense and durable.  In the presence of animals, claw resistance is important.  Fabrics with water-repellent impregnation are ideally suited, it is not afraid of moisture and dirt, it is easily washed. </p><p>  The most suitable options for a cover are: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Velor is an ideal option.  It is soft (like velvet), but more affordable.  There are varieties of velor with stretch fibers.  Such material stretches perfectly. </li><li>  Flock is a very durable material and delicate.  This fabric contains natural and synthetic fibers.  Teflon flock is saturated with liquid Teflon, repels dirt, does not absorb liquid, does not absorb dust.  This kind of flock is easy to wash and dries quickly.  This is also ideal for a sofa cover. </li><li>  Jacquard - one of the most durable fabrics, strong, resistant to deformation.  The jacquard contains natural and synthetic fibers, which makes it pleasant and durable in quality. </li><li>  Microfiber is considered by many as a substitute for suede.  This fabric is also ideal for a case (due to its strength and durability).  There is a variety of microfiber impregnated with Teflon. </li><li>  Cotton attracts with its naturalness, is environmentally friendly and ‚Äúbreathable‚Äù.  Easy dyeing of this fabric allows you to get many color options.  Cotton is very pleasant, but short-lived.  The material wears out quickly and burns out.  Cotton is the best option for a kids room because it is completely safe. </li><li>  Shinil looks very noble, it‚Äôs nice to sit on it, it‚Äôs very nice to touch it.  The tire is dense, but at the same time quite light (thanks to acrylic fibers). </li></ol><p>  There are plenty of fabrics suitable for sewing a cover.  The result largely depends on the fabric, so be careful in this matter.  Choose a color and style to your taste and depending on the interior. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="fjellkjeden.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sofa cover pattern" class="if uuid-2521961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87357/2521961.jpg"></div><h2>  Measurement Methods </h2><p>  To cut the cover to the size of the sofa, you need to take measurements correctly.  The final result of the work depends on the quality pattern.  What and how to measure?  It depends on the design of the cover and the model of the sofa, but it‚Äôs better to measure everything: the seat, armrests, sidewalls, pillows. </p><p>  To make a quality pattern, you can use several options: </p><ol><li>  Open the old case (if one is available) and cut out a new one exactly on it. </li><li>  Get a cheap fabric and carefully cut it to the size of the sofa, and then transfer the patterns to the fabric for the cover. </li><li>  Make a pattern of paper (tracing paper, newspapers), laying a sofa and cutting along the contours. </li><li>  Measure with a centimeter tape. </li></ol><p>  If you have chosen the last item, then measure the length at the longest part of the furniture, and the width at the widest.  Measure the armrests and headboards for maximum protruding parts. </p><p>  For any measurements, add 10 cm for allowances for seams and hem, and at the edges that will be brought in, 20 cm each. </p><h2>  Cut cover </h2><p>  When the pattern is ready, it can be transferred to the fabric.  If you have little experience in sewing, then choose fabric without a pattern.  Its presence only complicates the cutting and requires more material.  Large parts of the pattern should be in the center of the details, and even the fabric may involve connecting the pattern to different parts. </p><p>  Cut on a flat surface with chalk.  The paper or fabric pattern should be secured with pins and carefully circled in chalk. </p><p>  Remember the Russian proverb: "Measure seven times, cut once."  If everything is correct, feel free to cut the details of the cover. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sewing on a sewing machine" class="if uuid-2521913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87357/2521913.jpg"></div><h2>  Sewing a cover </h2><p>  When you have cut out the details of the cover, you can start sewing.  How to sew a cover on a sofa?  Step-by-step instructions are presented below: </p><ol><li>  First connect the parts with a gusset. </li><li>  Try the product on the sofa. </li><li>  Check the dimensions of the cover, and if necessary, reduce or increase the allowances for the seams.  Repeat this procedure until the cover ideally "sits" on the furniture. </li><li>  Stitch parts on a sewing machine. </li><li>  Work the internal seams of the product on an overlock or zigzag. </li><li>  Hide and sew the lining part (if available) according to the size of the product, sew to the finished cover. </li><li>  Work on the fasteners and the edges of the product. </li><li>  Decorate the cover with decor (if necessary). </li></ol><p>  When all the work is behind, and the cover is ready, rejoice at your result! </p><h2>  Easy way to stitch a sofa cover </h2><p>  The task of <span>sewing a cover</span> can be simplified and sew a new thing for a sofa from one piece of fabric.  To do this, you need a piece of material of a sufficiently large size that can completely envelop the furniture, enveloping all protruding parts.  The hanging parts with this method are cut or pulled under the sofa, and the excess volume is draped and secured with neat folds. </p><p>  For this method, use a well-stretched cloth.  This will help to accurately repeat all the details without a complicated cut. </p><p>  To prevent the fabric from deforming and not moving, wooden slats or cuts of a metal-plastic pipe are laid in the recesses between the parts of the sofa over the cover. </p><p>  See an example in the photo.  How to sew a cover on the sofa with your own hands without patterns and a sewing machine?  It is very easy! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.centerfordivinity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="easy way to stitch a sofa cover" class="if uuid-2521900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87357/2521900.jpg"></div><h2>  Corner sofa cover </h2><p>  Covers for sofas are much cheaper than hauling furniture.  And if you intend to sew a cover with your own hands, the costs are required only for the material.  Many housewives wonder about how to sew a cover on a corner sofa, which is necessary for this. </p><p>  This will require the same procedure as when sewing on a straight sofa.  Only the number of parts will increase. </p><p>  An angular sofa can be considered as two straight lines, the covers of which should be connected.  You can simplify the task by stitching two separate elements.  This case is easier to care for, the parts can be washed separately.  Sewing a <span>cover on a corner sofa with your own hands</span> is as simple as on a straight sofa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="arafen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="corner sofa cover" class="if uuid-2521952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87357/2521952.jpg"></div><h2>  Secrets of quality tailoring </h2><p>  How to sew a cover on the sofa with your own hands, so that it turns out beautiful and comfortable?  Tell the secrets of experienced hostesses: </p><ol><li>  Choose a dense, but not very stiff (not upholstery) fabric. </li><li>  Make a pattern slightly larger than the required size so that in the process of work it can be adjusted to the size of the sofa. </li><li>  Decorate unsuccessful places with decor - bows, ribbons, lacing, etc. </li><li>  So that the cover is not afraid of animal claws, tighten the fabric with 10-15 mm foam. </li><li>  If the pattern is very dense, then sew the seams twice so that they can withstand the load. </li><li>  Carefully make a pattern, draw it on paper, carefully plan sewing and joining parts. </li><li>  A looser case will last longer because it will not be under tension. </li><li>  For the first sewing, take an inexpensive fabric.  The features of each sofa are individual, so there is no 100% advice.  The second time your cover will turn out exactly better, so it can be sewn from more expensive fabric. </li></ol><h2>  Original ideas </h2><p>  Such an inexpensive and easy-to-care way to update the interior, such as sewing covers on sofas with your own hands, is in demand.
