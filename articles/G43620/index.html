    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Among the negative reviews, the following are often found: </p><ul><li>  very high prices for holidays; </li><li>  Before checking into a room, tourists who have been there offer to check the availability of promised amenities, as sometimes the equipment does not work, and the use of this equipment is included in the price of the room; </li><li>  Recently, there is often no water at the camp site, which guests will learn about when they have already arrived at the place of rest; </li><li>  some of the tourists were discouraged by the fact that they were not provided with the promised free beer and no apologies were made; </li><li>  it is surprising that, along with high prices for accommodation, parking is also paid; </li><li>  many vacationers complain that ants live in the rooms; </li><li>  lack of food in the cost of living; </li><li>  sometimes for a free pool they begin to charge unreasonably and without explanation; </li><li>  The rooms are not always cleaned. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Despite the most mixed reviews, the tourist complex ‚ÄúAssembly‚Äù is one of the largest and most modern.  It is located at: Saratov region, Engels district, the village of Shumeyka.  In order to understand the charm of relaxing on the river bank far from the city, you probably need to come here yourself and make up your own opinion about this place.  By bus you can get to the Assemblage camp site (Saratov) from the railway station by route No. 379 to the Shumeyka stop. </p>
