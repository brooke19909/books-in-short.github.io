  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to crochet a children's dress: scheme and description of work</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For every mom, a daughter is a true princess who wants to be surrounded only by the best.  In an effort to highlight their favorite, many creative parents begin to master the technology of knitting in order to then perform for the baby not only beautiful, but also unique, one-of-a-kind things.  But if you can think of the details by turning on your imagination, then far from everyone can figure out the technology of this or that product on their own.  Therefore, in the current article we will talk in detail about how to crochet a children's sundress. </p><h2>  Which yarn to choose </h2><p>  In order not to make a mistake when buying knitting threads, you should think over the model of your idea in advance, and also decide what season the girl will wear the finished product.  For summer sundresses, it is better to choose linen or <span>cotton yarn.</span>  It is quite thin, and therefore is best suited for knitting openwork.  In the spring - a denser yarn, for example, acrylic.  For crocheting a sundress in the fall, an ideal option would be mohair or angora.  For the winter, you need to make a warm sundress.  Woolen yarn is suitable for its implementation.  But, if the girl is prone to allergies, it is better to choose cashmere, merino wool or consider special children's yarn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet sundress pattern" class="if uuid-2952254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2952254.jpg"></div><h2>  Most suitable tool </h2><p>  Another important part of the preparatory phase is the selection of a convenient hook.  Professionals recommend purchasing a medium-length tool that lies well in the hand.  The yarn will help determine the correct size.  Therefore, it should be bought first.  Typically, labels indicate the most appropriate tool.  But, if the tag is missing, you can navigate by the thickness of the thread.  For patterned products and lace, it is recommended to choose a hook equal to the diameter of the thread.  And to make the face or shawl with the fashionable effect of elongated loops, it is better to use the tool about three times thicker.  But do not crochet a sundress too large.  The product will turn out holey or, on the contrary, too dense and thick.  In addition, working with this tool will be very inconvenient. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sundress pattern" class="if uuid-2952252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2952252.jpg"></div><h2>  Pattern selection and sample preparation </h2><p>  When the material and the tool are ready, you can proceed to the next part of the preparatory phase.  It involves the search for an interesting pattern.  However, it is important to note: if the needlewoman acquired a mottled yarn, gradient, patchwork or other unusual, it is more reasonable to carry out the idea with simple columns.  Otherwise, the pattern will be lost against the background of bright yarn.  For crocheted patterned or lace sundresses, it is better to buy plain knitting threads. </p><p>  When the pattern is selected, carefully study the technology for its implementation, and then prepare a centimeter tape, notebook and pen.  We knit a sample - a square with a side of ten centimeters.  And we count the number of loops and rows in it.  Divide both values ‚Äã‚Äãby ten.  Then we write two new parameters.  They will still be useful to us. </p><h2>  Measurement Technology </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet dress" class="if uuid-2952255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2952255.jpg"></div><p>  Our next step is to measure the model.  Therefore, we invite you to a girl, on which we will knit the conceived product, and determine the following parameters: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  hip girth; </li><li>  estimated length of the product; </li><li>  the distance from the lower edge of the sundress to the armpit; </li><li>  the width of the base of the neck. </li></ul><h2>  Calculation of the parameters necessary for knitting </h2><p>  You can crochet a sundress for a girl, focusing on standard parameters.  But in this case, there is a risk that the finished product will not fit the baby, because each person has an individual body structure.  If possible, it is best to take measurements yourself, and only after them calculate the parameters needed to complete the sundress.  It is very easy to do: </p><ol><li>  Divide all horizontal measures by the number of loops in one centimeter.  We got this value in the third paragraph of the current article, when we counted the number of loops in the sample. </li><li>  From the same point we take the second value - the number of rows in one centimeter.  And we divide all the vertical measurements taken from the girl into it. </li></ol><p>  Professional knitters recommend preparing a pattern or pattern of a conceived sundress, marking it with parameters in centimeters, and next - in loops and rows.  This will allow you to not make a mistake in the actions when crocheting a sundress. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="dress for girls crochet" class="if uuid-2952258" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2952258.jpg"></div><h2>  Implementation of a Conceived Product </h2><p>  We figured out what the preparatory phase implies.  Having completed it, we proceed to the realization of our ideas in life.  The idea is implemented quite simply: </p><ol><li>  First of all, we knit a chain of the previously calculated number of loops.  As a result, we get a rope whose length is equal to the circumference of the hips.  However, it is important to note that for the execution of a summer sarafan, many choose an openwork pattern with a crochet, and then the number of loops should be calculated, focusing on its rapport.  To make the drawing complete, additional loops will have to be added to the typed loops.  If it‚Äôs easier to remove, then you should limit yourself to five loops, otherwise the girl may not fit into the finished sundress. </li><li>  We close the chain into a ring, knitting the first and last loop together. </li><li>  Then we make two lifting loops and proceed to knitting the first row.  In this case, we focus on the selected pattern. </li><li>  Having reached the end of the row, we again connect the first and last loop. </li><li>  Then we repeat the two previous steps, gradually reaching the desired length of the product.  We need to tie the sundress to the level of the armhole - the armpit. </li><li>  Then we fold the resulting "pipe" in half and outline in the middle a distance equal to the width of the base of the neck.  You can designate it with a thread of a different color. </li><li>  On both sides of the separated area we knit straps.  The length of each should be equal to the following value: the estimated length of the product is the distance from the lower edge of the sundress to the armpit): 2. </li><li>  Having connected two identical straps, we sew them to the opposite side of the sundress. </li><li>  So, we almost finished crocheting a sundress.  The description of the latter actions involves only preparing a chain equal to the circumference of the hips.  It must be passed through the main part of the product at waist level.  And then tie on a flirty bow. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="children's crochet dress" class="if uuid-2952260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2952260.jpg"></div><p>  That's the whole technology for making a children's sarafan with a hook.  Even novice masters can understand it. </p>
