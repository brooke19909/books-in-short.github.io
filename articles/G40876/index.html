Reviews about models and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The wireless headset is tightly integrated into our daily life, and the wired connection, which is inconvenient to use, is less and less used every day. </p><p>  Therefore, on the Web more and more questions arise about how to connect headphones with bluetooth, which are much more convenient to use than their wired counterparts.  In this article we will try to answer this question and consider the connection to the phone, computer and laptop. </p><h2>  How to connect to the phone </h2><p>  In order to configure the headphones on your phone, first turn them on.  After that, you need to activate the wireless communication module on your mobile.  The system will automatically search for devices available for connection. </p><p>  It is worth noting that we are considering the connection procedure for headphones that are used for the first time. </p><p>  So, the phone automatically found available connections and gave a list, if there are several.  You just have to choose the name corresponding to the headset and click the "Connect" button.  Typically, the device will require a PIN to pair.  As a rule, it can be found on the box or in the instructions.  But in most cases, the key is 0000. Now we go into the connection settings and set the tick to ‚ÄúSound during a call‚Äù.  The sound during calls will therefore be transmitted to the headphones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jlabaudio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="For sports" class="if uuid-2485113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2485113.jpg"></div><p>  But on some models of a wireless headset, before you start searching on your phone, you need to set the mode for detection.  On different models, this is done in different ways.  On some devices there is a multifunctional special wheel that needs to be switched to the appropriate mode, on others, the power button is just clamped until the indicator lights up.  Further actions can only be performed after this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Some features </h2><p>  Above, we examined the connection of headphones to the phone, which is carried out for the first time.  But how to set up synchronization for a phone with bluetooth headphones that have already been paired with another device?  Everything is extremely simple here.  You will need to turn on connection discovery again, which will automatically turn off after synchronization ends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dgit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connect to the phone" class="if uuid-2485127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2485127.jpg"></div><p>  To do this, hold down the power button on the headset until the indicator lights up.  And if the headphones are equipped with a multi-function wheel, then transfer it to the upper position and press the call button.  After that, pair as described above. </p><h2>  We connect to the computer </h2><p>  Having considered the connection of wireless headphones to the phone, it will be logical to try to carry out similar actions with other devices.  Many will agree that it is really convenient, for example, when communicating on Skype, do not sit all the time near the computer, but move freely around the room or even the apartment.  So, how to connect headphones to a computer via bluetooth? </p><h2>  Training </h2><p>  On the advice of specialists, you should prepare your computer before proceeding with a direct connection.  The thing is that in smartphones, tablets, laptops and so on in most cases, the wireless communication module is already built-in.  But a desktop computer does not have such equipment.  It should be connected separately. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  First of all, you need to connect the Bluetooth adapter to the computer.  Usually it plugs into a USB port and comes with a driver disk.  In addition, the required software can be found on the Internet.  Only for this you need to find out the exact model of the device.  You can check if the equipment is connected through the device manager. </p><p>  After the equipment is connected and the driver is installed, the corresponding icon will appear in the lower right corner of the Windows desktop in the system tray.  By right-clicking on it, you will see the control menu. </p><h2>  Bluetooth control </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the adapter can be controlled by installing a special utility, for example, BlueSoleil.  This versatile program allows you to easily and easily control the adapter.  Thanks to her, connecting to a stationary computer via bluetooth headphones is greatly simplified.  After installing the driver and connection utility, you can proceed to configure it. </p><h2>  Computer connection </h2><p>  Typically, the mechanism for connecting and configuring on a computer working with wireless headphones for bluetooth is described in detail in the equipment manual.  But often, users lose it.  So, we have a prepared PC. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jlabaudio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wireless gadgets" class="if uuid-2485095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2485095.jpg"></div><ul><li>  On the headphones, press and hold the power button until the indicator flashes blue and red. </li><li>  Right-click on the Bluetooth icon in the tray and select "Add device". </li><li>  At the next stage, the computer should start searching for equipment available for connection and offer a list of found devices.  You just have to choose the appropriate name and click "Next". </li><li>  Now you will be offered three further options - generate a password for verification, enter a code for the device and do not perform verification.  Select the second item and enter the key - 0000. Next, follow the instructions on the computer monitor. </li></ul><h2>  Possible problems </h2><p>  Sometimes it happens that the user can not connect headphones via bluetooth to a computer.  The reason may be a malfunction or even lack of the necessary driver.  Try reinstalling it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, standard Windows tools can sometimes work incorrectly with a wireless module.  To avoid this, the BlueSoleil program exists.  By installing it, you can easily and quickly configure the connection.  It has a convenient and intuitive interface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connecting headphones to various devices" class="if uuid-2485151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2485151.jpg"></div><h2>  Laptop and headphones </h2><p>  Many users, having bought a Hands Free headset, are wondering how to connect headphones or another gadget to a laptop via bluetooth. </p><p>  As a rule, connecting to a laptop does not cause any problems and difficulties.  Everything is pretty simple here.  In addition, an instruction with a detailed description of the connection process is usually attached to the device. </p><h2>  Connection process </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that not all laptops are equipped with a built-in wireless communication module.  If you have just such a model, then first connect the external Bluetooth module and install the driver for it.  Check if the driver is installed in the hardware manager.  If everything works fine, then you will find the connected Bluetooth adapter. </p><p>  Now you can go directly to connecting headphones via bluetooth to a laptop.  Such synchronization is already described in detail in the ‚ÄúConnecting to a Computer‚Äù section. </p><p>  It is worth noting that sometimes errors and difficulties may occur. </p><h2>  Stable communication </h2><p>  In addition to connecting, you may have to tune the system a bit.  To do this, right-click on the speaker in the tray and select "Playback Device".  In the window that opens, you need to enable "Bluetooth Audio."  Although usually all settings occur automatically. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jlabaudio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bluetooth headphones" class="if uuid-2485099" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2485099.jpg"></div><p>  Thanks to the control buttons present in almost every model, such headphone models not only solve some problems associated with wires, but also allow you not to get your phone out of your pocket at all. </p><h2>  Review and reviews </h2><p>  Bluetooth wireless headphones by functionality are usually distinguished into two types: </p><ul><li>  consignment notes - for lovers of super-high-quality sound and music lovers; </li><li>  sports - designed to stay in place even with the most active physical activities. </li></ul><p>  Here are some interesting models of such headphones with consistently positive reviews from customers. </p><h2>  JBL Headphones </h2><p>  JBL E55BT Bluetooth Wireless On-Ear Headphones is a proprietary sound quality from the famous JBL brand. </p><p>  This model is the most versatile and features a battery life of up to 20 hours and a stylish innovative headband in a fabric finish. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jbl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Headphones JBL E55BT" class="if uuid-2485156" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2485156.jpg"></div><p>  The ergonomically laid on design allows you not to part with your favorite music and have fun wherever you are - at work, in transport or on vacation. </p><p>  In their reviews, users note a variety of color schemes, elegant appearance and additional convenience of the control panel and microphone with a removable cable. </p><h2>  Bluedio T2 </h2><p>  The incredible battery size and design, providing a comfortable fit in size - these are the distinguishing features of this model of headphones.

By cons, users attributed the lack of radio and memory card support. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wireless Bluedio T2" class="if uuid-2485162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2485162.jpg"></div><h2>  Folding Sound Intone BT-09 </h2><p>  Bluetooth headphones that are capable of playing music via an audio cable, via a Bluetooth connection, from a memory card, and are also equipped with a radio.  Also in this model there is a built-in microphone and a powerful battery, which, according to reviews, can withstand up to 8 hours of continuous operation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sound Intone BT-09" class="if uuid-2485164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60789/2485164.jpg"></div><h2>  Waterproof Meizu EP51 </h2><p>  These sports with Bluetooth earbuds from the famous Meizu brand are made in an aluminum case.
