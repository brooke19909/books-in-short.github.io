And the MTS credit card is one of them.  Since today the citizens of our country are increasingly using such cards, they realized the advantage of owning them.  Often cards allow not only to pay for goods and services in non-cash form, but also to accumulate bonuses for purchases that you can spend in the future on the purchase of different types of goods with a good discount. </p>

    <p>  Documents to the bank can be submitted as follows: </p><ol><li>  Personally visit the office. </li><li>  Call the bank and fill out the application remotely. </li><li>  Filling out an application on the site is the easiest way to get a credit card.  For this, only a client fills out a questionnaire, then, after its consideration, you will receive an SMS message with a decision of the bank.  If the decision is positive, a bank specialist will contact you and agree on a convenient place and time for transferring the card. </li></ol><h2>  How to recharge MTS card </h2><p>  The bank management is interested in timely repayment of loans, therefore, it took care of its customers and offers several ways to replenish the card.  The main ones are listed below. </p><ol><li>  <em>Through a personal account.</em>  The client can replenish the card completely free of charge at any time of the day from any account opened with MTS Bank, or from a card of another bank. </li><li>  <em>Through payment terminals.</em>  When using this method, the client needs to pay a commission in the amount of 1-1.5% of the replenished amount. </li><li>  <em>In the shops-salons "Euroset", "Messenger" and "Eldorado".</em>  In this case, a commission of 1% of the replenished amount is charged. </li><li>  In the MTS mobile phone salon. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="get a credit card pay money" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32473/749250.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  How to close the MTS card </h2><p>  It is possible to close the card in the city where the bank office is present.  To do this, you need to contact the nearest branch with a statement for closing.  But before that, you need to make sure that there is no debt on the card.  If everything is in order, then we wait for the decision of the bank. </p><p>  But if in your city there is no MTS-Bank office, and there is no time and opportunity to get to the nearest settlement where it is, is it?  There is also nothing complicated.  On the MTS Bank website you can fill out an application for closing the card.  You print it out, sign it and forward it by ‚ÄúRussian Post‚Äù to the head office (7550 Sadovnicheskaya St., Moscow, 115035).  In order to avoid loss, we recommend sending by registered mail.  Before sending, it is necessary to clarify the exact amount of debt through the bank's hotline and pay it off.  As soon as the application is received by the bank and executed, you will receive an SMS notification that the card is closed. </p>

    <h2>  Map Reviews </h2><p>  There are many clients who have issued MTS Bank credit cards.  Reviews on their part are different.  There are those who noted the speed of processing the card, because in almost 15 minutes a decision is made on the issue.  Someone liked the fact that it is very convenient to use - you can pay for goods and services by bank transfer, there is a grace period for using borrowed funds, you can easily replenish it, manage accounts. </p><p>  But there are also dissatisfied customers who have issued MTS Bank credit cards.  Their reviews are negative, mainly due to poor service.  Sometimes it is simply impossible to get through the hotline.  This is due to its congestion due to the large number of customers who want to know the amount of debt.  The bank management did not think over these issues, and they, unfortunately, strongly repel <span>potential customers.</span>  In addition, negative reviews are also associated with the size of fees for withdrawing and transferring funds - they are simply predatory!  If a person intends to withdraw only 100 rubles, then he will still need to pay a commission of 450 rubles. </p><p>  After reading the reviews of experienced users of the MTS card, everyone will draw their own conclusions, but do not be too categorical.  Everyone has their own opinion.  We recommend that you analyze all the pros and cons of the card yourself and decide whether to use it or not. </p><p>  If you still decide on a credit card from MTS, we strongly recommend that you carefully study all the proposed conditions and tariffs, read the contract carefully.  If you want to close the card, then make sure that the whole procedure goes right to the end.  So that one day it doesn‚Äôt appear that you have a debt to MTS Bank.  It will not be superfluous if you require a certificate from the bank stating that the card is closed and the institution has no complaints against you. </p>
