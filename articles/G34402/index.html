At the same time, Abkhazia is a very convenient destination.  "Miya" (recreation center, Goudauta), is located very close to the border with Russia, which means that there is nothing easier than arranging a car ride.

This issue is completely resolved by Miya.  The recreation center (Abkhazia), reviews of which are only positive, provides leisure activities for the youngest tourists.

These are rides, a multi-tiered slide, trampolines and electric cars, fish floating in the air on the control panel, board games and much more.  Older children can find entertainment on the playground. </p><p>  In addition, I would like to note the presence of an excellent swimming pool, which is located near the children's center.

    <h2>  Cost of rest </h2><p>  Everyone is trying to calculate future costs before the holidays.  This is very important for family budget planning.  A fairly economical option is the recreation center "Miya" (Abkhazia, Gudauta).  Reviews emphasize that the cost on the Black Sea coast is everywhere higher. </p><p>  A double room with all amenities and meals in high season, that is, in July, costs only 1200 rubles per person.  1000 is paid for a child.
