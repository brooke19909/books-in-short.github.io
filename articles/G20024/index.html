But quality assembly is not everything.  To please their <br>  owners, the equipment should have a certain set of functions and be convenient to use.  Multicookers in this case are no exception.  Most often they are bought as a gift to please their loved ones, often not imagining how to choose a quality multicooker. </p><h2>  What is a quality multicooker? </h2><p>  First you need to understand what the phrase "high-quality multicooker" means.  In the understanding of the majority, this is a device that will not fail for many years.  However, this definition is not entirely true.  Is it possible to call a quality multicooker that will not bake pies, in which milk will boil off when cooking cereals on milk?  I think no.  The highest quality multicooker should be able to cook a variety of dishes, have a certain set of functions and, of course, be reliable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="slow cooker inexpensive and high quality" class="if" height="484" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/745221.jpg" width="600"></div>  Most buyers also want it to be inexpensive.

    <h2>  Design and ergonomics </h2><p>  Quality multicookers should be convenient to use.  They should be equipped with rubberized legs and a handle for carrying the device.  It is desirable that the device fits into the interior design - for this, many manufacturers produce models in different colors, using metal and plastic.  There is an opinion that devices in a metal case are more reliable - if they fall, they will not chip or break.  However, this is not entirely true.  Even the highest quality crock-pots in a metal case are made of a thin sheet that can be easily pressed with your fingers.  Therefore, although they cannot chip, when dropped, the case is very deformed.  It is very good if the handle is not supplied <br>  only the case itself, but also the bowl - in this case it will be much easier to get the finished dish. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Programs </h2><p>  This item should be treated especially carefully.  High-quality multicookers prepare a variety of dishes, models from which 1-2 out of 10-15 programs are excellent, you should not buy.  Especially often problems arise with baking and cooking cereals.  Pies and charlotte are obtained unbaked or baked on one side.  It happens that cakes are fried outside and raw inside.  Most often, budget models suffer from this.  In more expensive manufacturers, they install a 3D heating system that allows you to bake pies from all sides.  The operation of this technology is provided by installing an additional heater on the side or using the heat transfer function. </p><h2>  Cooking features </h2>

A slow cooker may not initially be intended for cooking such dishes.  Therefore, before buying, you should definitely look in the instructions which cereals can be cooked in this model.  Very often, budget models cook cereals only on water, boiling in milk is simply not incorporated in them.  Models are already a little more expensive with this option, but, as a rule, it is partially implemented.  During cooking, milk often boils off, after which the owner has to tear off the entire device.

Quality multicookers come with a durable Teflon or ceramic coating that withstands daily cooking.  However, after about six months, the non-stick layer becomes thinner and the food begins to stick to the bottom.  The thicker the Teflon layer, the stronger the coating - the slower the process will go. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to choose a quality multicooker" class="if" height="465" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/745228.jpg" width="600"></div>  To increase the <span>life of the</span> bowl, you can purchase another additional one, made of stainless steel, and use it for cooking soups and liquid dishes.

    <h2>  Is it expensive or cheap? </h2><p>  Buyers often ask themselves: ‚ÄúWhich multicookers are of the highest quality - expensive or cheap?  Is it worth it to overpay for a brand if additional features are not needed? ‚Äù  This question cannot be answered unequivocally.  As practice shows, the highest quality multicookers cannot cost cheaply.  Reviews indicate that if the price of the model is low, then there is a high risk of encountering problems during operation.  For example, you can take one of the budget models of the company "Eden".  Roomy, in a metal case, with electronic control and a delayed start, it, at first glance, seems to be the best option for the acquisition.  However, this model has only 6 cooking programs, and their duration is practically unregulated.  The buyer is forced to stew vegetables for 2 hours, for which 40 minutes would be enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="slow cooker inexpensively and efficiently" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/745233.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Does it follow from this that a slow cooker is inexpensive and of high quality in nature?  No, it should not.  There are several manufacturers whose products have already established themselves. </p><p>  Below are the best quality multicookers from different manufacturers. </p><h2>  "Polaris PMC 0517AD" </h2><p>  Many are prejudiced by this company, knowing that it produces equipment of the cheapest price segment.  However, as practice shows, today it is one of the leading manufacturers of multicookers, ideal in terms of price-quality ratio.  However, not every multicooker is inexpensively and efficiently made under this brand.  There are a number of flagship models on which the least complaints and the most positive reviews.  First of all, it is the Polaris PMC 0517AD.  This model comes with a 5 liter bowl coated with a layer of ceramic.  "Polaris PMC 0517AD" - a multicooker inexpensive and high-quality, with touch control, sixteen cooking modes, the program "Multipovar".  Included with the device is a book with recipes, shovels, a measuring cup and 6 containers for preparing portioned yogurt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quality multicooker pressure cookers" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/745235.jpg" width="500"></div>  Buyers note that she perfectly cooks cereals and soups, as well as stews and fries foods.  Some note that the products cooked in this model often burn, but the number of such reviews is insignificant.  Part of the comments concerns the features of the touch control, namely, after some time the display begins to freeze.  Such errors apply to factory defects and occur almost immediately after the start of use.

    <h2>  "Redmond RMC-M90" </h2><p>  This German company currently holds a leading position in the market.  It produces high-quality <span>crock-pots, pressure cookers of</span> various price categories, many of which deserve the most positive reviews.  One of the most popular models is the <span>Redmond RMC-M90.</span>  In its appearance and functionality, it is almost completely identical to the Polaris 0517 model.  True, if you look closely at <span>the control panel,</span> you will notice that the program "Multipovar" is replaced by "Express", the menu does not contain "Oatmeal" and other similar nuances.  This model expands the list of its capabilities due to the deep-fat fryer, which comes with the device.  The device is a metal bucket with a removable handle, into which potatoes cut into cubes are laid.  The manufacturer claims that this model has 47 cooking programs, but in reality there are only 17, the remaining 28 are various variations of the Multi-Cook mode.  According to owners, redmond multicookers are one of the most reliable.  The percentage of marriage among them is extremely low.  If the device does not fail in the first days after the start of operation, it will probably be finalized before the end of its service life, which for such equipment is 3 years. </p>

    <h2>  Redmond 4525 </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, a high-quality multicooker does not mean expensive.  Customers who do not pursue a wide range of functions and want to buy an affordable, simple, high-quality model in order to cook cereals, soup and a couple of types of the second should pay attention to the "Redmond 4525".  It includes only 6 main programs that satisfy the needs of most consumers: porridge, pastries, cereals, stewing, double boiler, frying, pilaf and pasteurization.  The multicooker does not have such a popular and widely advertised 3D-heating, so the pies and cupcakes turn out to be pale on top, however, if you do not exceed the norms for laying the products, they will bake perfectly inside.  The bowl in this model goes for 5 liters, with a <span>non-stick coating.</span>  The large volume makes it convenient to use in a large family.  The model comes in a metal case with a simple and clear button control.  Additional functions include heat maintenance, manual time adjustment and delayed start.  Among the shortcomings, one can note the absence of rubberized legs and a removable inner cover, however, largely due to the lack of secondary functions at a price, it is in last place in the Redmond model line.  The owners note that she cooks well and is inexpensive.  Included is a book of 100 recipes, which allows you to diversify the menu. </p><h2>  "Panasonic RMC-M90" </h2><p>  This company began to produce multicookers one of the first, when other manufacturers did not even think about it.  Unlike other companies, it did not actively develop in this field: annually update the lineup, introduce new technologies, change the design.  Panasonic releases just a few time-tested models, such as the Panasonic RMC-M90.  This multicooker with a capacity of only 2.5 liters and a power of 450 watts.  It is designed for a small family of 1-2 people, very light (2.4 kg) and compact.  In this model, electronic button control is installed, there is a function of delaying start for 13 hours and maintaining heat.  There are only five programs: baking, porridge, stewing, cereals and steaming.  It does not have new-fangled programs, such as fondue, yogurts and deep-fryers, the temperature is also not regulated, you can only change the cooking time.  But the existing programs are brought to automatism. </p><h2>  Reviews on the model "Panasonic RMC-M90" </h2><p>  This model exists for a long time, so a great many reviews have accumulated.  Owners practically do not have problems with a multicooker; it honestly fulfills the set time, without hanging in the process, without overheating food.  Some complaints are caused by a bowl of aluminum and a small number of recipes.  Aluminum is a soft material, so it is easily scratched, and users will have to search for modern dishes on the Internet themselves.  This slow cooker is a great option for those who prefer quality to the original design and a variety of programs.  A distinctive feature of the models of the company "Panasonic" - low power, which affects the duration of cooking. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="top quality multicookers reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/745339.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  "Mulinex RMC-M90" </h2><p>  As one of the largest manufacturers of small appliances for the kitchen, the Mulineks company could not ignore crock-pots.  She produces several models of different price categories and functionality.  The highest quality of them can be called "Mulinex RMC-M90".  It combines speed, reliability and stylish design.  This model can work not only as a multicooker, but also as a pressure cooker - that is, to cook products under pressure in a shorter time.  It comes in a stylish glossy metal case, with a hermetically sealed lid and a 1000 W heating element.  There are only 6 programs in it: these are high and low pressure modes, frying, stewing, frying vegetables, keeping the food hot, but in reality its capabilities are much wider.  A pressure cooker can cook stews, meat in pots, mussels and much, much more.  Her bowl is very spacious - as much as 6 liters, there is a container-double boiler.  The cover is equipped with a wide, durable handle; small but comfortable handles are also on the case itself.  The slow cooker has earned many positive reviews for the longevity of its work and the speed of cooking. </p><h2>  Philips HD3136 / 03 </h2><p>  Listing the highest quality crock-pots, one cannot fail to mention the "Philips HD3136 / 03".  Like any other equipment of this brand, this model is highly reliable.  <span>The Philips cooker</span> cannot be called budget, but at the same time it is an ideal combination of price and quality.  Her bowl is not very big - only 4 liters, which is perfect for a family of 3-4 people.  For such a volume, it is very powerful, which means it will quickly cook food.  It has 14 cooking programs, including yogurt, delayed start and heating.  The manufacturer gives two years of full warranty on his equipment, despite the fact that the entire service life is three years. </p>
