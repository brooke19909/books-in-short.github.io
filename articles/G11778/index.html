In Casablanca more than 25 years ago, the majestic mosque of Hassan II appeared, which has become the main attraction of Morocco.  Surprisingly, it was designed by a non-Muslim French architect. </p><p>  The building, built using the most modern technologies, can be entered even by those who do not profess Islam.  And tourists are sure to visit the business card of Casablanca, because in Morocco there are not many mosques where guests from Europe are open. </p><h2>  Mosque symbolizing the unity of the country </h2><p>  In 1980, King Hassan II announced his desire to build the tallest mosque in the world.  He laid the first stone in the foundation of the future attractions.  13 years later, on the platform above the water, an authentic symbol of the nation appeared, reminiscent from afar of a frigate looking upward.  When the 10-meter waves of the Atlantic Ocean during the tides beat against the walls of a religious masterpiece, it seems to believers that the great mosque of Hassan II floats forward like a ship. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hassan II Mosque photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1729368.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The monument to the unity of the country, built in honor of the sixtieth anniversary of the monarch, is impressive in size: its length is 183 meters, its width is more than 90 meters, its height is almost 55 meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A masterpiece of architecture resembling a ship </h2><p>  The religious object that made the modern city the heart of the Muslim state, rises above the Atlantic Ocean on a small artificial peninsula and is a true embodiment of those lines of the Qur'an that describe the throne of Allah built above the water.  Hassan II Mosque, standing on a rock, as if emerging from the white foam of sea waves, combines modern and ancient Islamic traditions that have developed in architecture.  The giant complex, spread over nine hectares, is able to accommodate up to 100 thousand believers in the halls and courtyard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the great mosque of hasan ii" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1729372.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The architectural ensemble includes a library, an underground parking lot, a madrasah (Muslim theological seminary), a museum and a stable.  Therefore, the real decoration of Casablanca, as if ready to soar from a cliff above the ocean into the sky, can rightly be called the main cultural center of the city. </p><h2>  Innovative technologies </h2><p>  The architect Michel Pinso worked for a long time on the design of the grandiose building, which became the national heritage of the country.  During the construction of the wonder of the world of the Muslim world, innovative technologies were used, since it was built, thinking about adapting to any weather conditions.  The earthquake-resistant structure, which can withstand even a strong earthquake, does not rise on a natural surface, but on an artificially created platform supported by pylons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hassan II Mosque Morocco" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1729381.jpg" width="365"></div>

Building materials, decor items were brought from different parts of Morocco.  The facade of a gigantic architectural monument is lined with snow-white and cream marble, and its roof is lined with emerald granite slabs.  Spacious rooms iridescent with different colors are decorated with rare marble finishes, frescoes, stucco moldings and mosaics. </p><h2>  What will surprise the magnificent mosque of Hassan II? </h2><p>  The main prayer hall delights with wonderful chandeliers made of Murano glass, the creation of which the best craftsmen from Venice worked on.  The total weight of the only decoration of the mosque brought from abroad exceeds 50 tons.  78 tall columns of pink granite, beautifully shimmering in the rays of sunlight, a marble floor casting in gold, slabs of green onyx, colored mosaics will delight even many tourists who have seen it. </p><p>  At the highest minaret in the world (210 meters) in the evenings, a laser spotlight starts, which sends light rays towards the center of the Islamic world - Mecca, calling for night prayers.  Curiously, this is the first mosque with heated floors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hassan II Mosque Casablanca" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1729382.jpg" width="453"></div>

    <p>  The guests with a wonderful example of Moroccan architecture, which has become the most visited in the country, will be surprised by the doors with electronic locks, the roof, which will open if there are more worshipers than can accommodate the Hassan II mosque (Casablanca), floor coverings from transparent high-strength glass, allowing see the waters of the ocean and the inhabitants of the seabed. </p><h2>  Pride and discontent of citizens </h2><p>  Most of the locals pride themselves on a luxurious structure, the construction of which was spent more than $ 800 million.  However, those who were evicted without any compensation from houses located on the territory of the future construction site are unhappy and believe that such an impressive amount could be spent not on the Hassan II mosque, but on the construction of social facilities in the city. </p><h2>  The monarch's dream come true </h2><p>  Luxurious, resembling a pearl that fell into the hands of a skilled jeweler, the tall building fancifully shimmers in the rays of sunlight, each time changing colors.  It is admired by all visitors who have arrived on an excursion to the mosque of Hassan II. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hassan II Mosque" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1729384.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Morocco is an exotic country that boasts unique attractions.  Each ruler dreamed of leaving a memory of himself in the form of real architectural works, which over time became a national treasure.  And the symbol of the city of Casablanca is the best achievement and the realized dream of the king, who cared for the unity of the state. </p>
