    <h2>  ‚ÄúDiyar El Andalus 5 *‚Äù </h2><p>  We begin our review with the most prestigious fives.  This Iberostar Hotel (Tunisia) is located in Port El Kantaoui.  This place is completely at the mercy of hotels and foreign tourists.  ‚ÄúDiyar el Andaluz‚Äù is located on the front page, has its own beach.  Analyzing reviews about this hotel, we can say that tourists were satisfied with the location of the hotel regarding the resort infrastructure.  This is a place for a relaxing family vacation.  Tourists who visited the hotel this season said that the hotel is a full-fledged five and costs the requested money (five thousand four hundred and ten rubles per night).  Naturally, the all-inclusive concept operates here, and the food, according to travelers, is very tasty and varied.  By the way, this is a feature of all Tunisian resort hotels.  There is animation - both for adults and for children.  Two pools, a huge well-groomed territory, spacious rooms - what more could you wish for?  Because many do not even want to go outside the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunis Iberostar Hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1495923.jpg" width="600"></div>

They have a private terrace with a jacuzzi and a bar.  Guests of these rooms have the right to visit all a la carte restaurants for free (once each time they stay in a hotel).  The reviews say that the ‚Äústandard‚Äù is also quite good - a spacious, clean and comfortable room, with a free minibar on the day of arrival, a safe and other amenities befitting the ‚Äúfive‚Äù.  Among other advantages, reviews mention that the Iberostar hotel (Tunisia, Port El Kantaoui) has two pools.  In one of them, sun loungers are installed directly in the water.  Animation and entertainment are up to standard.  For the category ‚Äústandard‚Äù - a one-time visit to the Italian restaurant a'la carte and spa is free.  Of the minuses, tourists noted beach towels for the deposit and the fact that the All Inclusive system stops working at midnight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Iberostar 5 Tunisia" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1495918.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Iberostar Royal (Tunisia, Mahdia) </h2><p>  The previous hotel is located in a new resort, where there is no hint of Africa.  But "Iberostar Royal El Mansour Hotel and Thalasso 5 *" (Iberostar Royal El Mansour Hotel &amp; Thalasso 5 *) is located in the heart of the ancient city.  The medieval Medina and the El Jem Amphitheater are located just seven hundred meters from the hotel.  This resort is an ideal place to relax with young children.  On the hotel beach there is a white soft sand, the absence of waves and dangerous animals, a gentle slope, a clean and transparent sea.  The territory of Royal El Mansour is large, well-groomed.  However, any Iberostar 5 * hotel can boast of this.  Tunisia is known among all inclusive lovers because, in fact, not everything is included here.  Imported alcohol and freshly squeezed juices are provided for a fee.  And at midnight, as in the fairy tale "Cinderella", the rest of the "all inclusive" ends.  There are three swimming pools on the territory - two adults and one for children.  There is also a spa. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pros and Cons of Royal El Mansour </h2><p>  Thalasso Center - this is what pleased the guests of this Iberostar hotel.  Tunisia is exactly the country where people go for treatment by sea.  All kinds of seaweed wraps, massages and other procedures are provided for you here.  Tourists often praise the rooms.  They say that it‚Äôs worth paying extra for the ‚Äúview‚Äù, since the alternative to it is a view of the road.  The guests liked the fact that at the main meals four different menus were presented.  Among the dishes were dishes of Tunisian cuisine.  One could visit <span>the √† la carte restaurant.</span>  He specializes in grilled meat and fish.  And on the territory there is a Moorish cafe and two bars (by the pool and in the lobby).  The animation team entertains guests day and night.  As a minus, reviews noted that drinks were paid at discotheques.  The overall impression of this hotel is very positive.  Impressive building, clean and green area.  There is a fence between the beach and the hotel, and the gate closes in the evening - night swimmers complain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iberostar Royal Tunis Hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1495930.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tunisia, Iberostar Mehari Hotel </h2><p>  Would you like to visit the City in the Sands where Luke Skywalker, the hero of Star Wars, spent his childhood?  You do not need to fly to the planet Tatooine, just go to the Tunisian island of Djerba.  True, you can live not in a hut underground, but in a completely prosperous hotel of the Iberostar chain.  Djerba is the name of both the island and the main city on it.  Sand storms and dunes, as in a movie, you will not see.  But the set for Star Wars didn't need much change.  Nature and urban architecture here are really peculiar.  But there are beautiful beaches and, of course, thalassotherapy, which Tunisia is famous for.  The Iberostar Mehari Djerba Hotel is not a sandy desert at all, but a well-kept garden surrounded by lush Mediterranean greenery.  The hotel has direct access to Sidi Akku beach.  The facade of the hotel is decorated with four stars.  Therefore, the cost of living in it is somewhat lower.  The price for the "standard" starts from fifty euros per night. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunis Hotel Iberostar Mehari" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1495939.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pros and cons of the Iberostar hotel in Djerba </h2><p>  Tourists in general were satisfied with their stay at this hotel.  Many write that they will be happy to stay here next year when they arrive in <span>Tunisia, Djerba.</span>  Hotel "Iberostar", according to reviews, pulls on the top five.  Spacious rooms in which towels and very often linen were changed daily were especially pleased.  Cleaning is beyond praise.  Nutrition - too.  Tourists especially recommended to try grilled tuna.  For breakfast, give pancakes, delicious omelet.  The all-inclusive concept allows you to gain two kilograms per week.  Unlike other Tunisian hotels, where the ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù is in fact a ‚Äúfull board‚Äù, you can eat here from early morning until late at night.  The pool bar serves brunch, lunch, afternoon tea.  Guests are given the right to visit two a la carte restaurants once a day for check-in: Oriental and Fish.  Great animation and pools.  New arrivals are greeted with soft drinks.  Of the minuses, only powdered juices for breakfast were noticed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunisia Djerba Iberostar Hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1495942.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "Iberostar Averroes 4 *" </h2><p>  And finally, the last hotel of the chain in Tunisia.  It is located in the very south of the country, in the resort of Hammamet.  It is only sixty kilometers from the <span>capital of Tunisia</span> , so the transfer from the international airport to the hotel will be short-lived.  As in Sousse, where there is a resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPort El Kantui, in Hammamet there is the Yasmin district.  The name is not accidental.  At every step, jasmine bushes grow here.  The four-star Iberostar Hotel (Tunisia) occupies an honorable place in the very center of the resort area and stands on the first line of the beach.  This is a luxury hotel, although the prices are quite low - fifty euros per room per night.  The entire hotel is stylized as a garden of paradise.  Lawns are interspersed with palm trees and other Mediterranean plants.  Among this magnificence rises a three-story building.  Tourists note the presence of a large swimming pool and a huge relaxation area around it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tunis Hotel Iberostar Mehari Djerba" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1495937.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pros and Cons of Iberostar Averroes </h2><p>  The hotel chain in Hammamet has earned many accolades.  Tourists liked the spacious rooms with balconies with wicker chairs and a table, soft mattresses, and thorough cleaning.  Separate bathroom, there is a bidet.  The cuisine, as in many hotels in Tunisia, is beyond praise.  But in "Averroes" you can feel the North African flavor.  Here you can relax in the Moorish cafe with a hookah.  The hotel also has a beautiful spa with a hammam, sauna and indoor pool.  Guests also liked the fitness room, where the simulators are outdoors, under the arcade.  There are excellent conditions for children.  There is a mini club, a playground.  The beach is also wonderful, sandy, very well equipped.  The only negative tourists called a large number of merchants wandering along the coast. </p><h2>  General reviews about the Iberostar network </h2><p>  Those who are familiar with this hotel chain did not remain disappointed with its representative offices in Tunisia.  The European level of service here is successfully combined with Moorish exoticism.  It shows through in the design of buildings, in the design of rooms, restaurants and cafes.  The friendliness and professionalism of the staff note all the reviews.  Hotel Iberostar (Tunisia) is a standard of quality relaxation.  Wherever you come - to the island of Djerba, to Sousse, Hammamet or Mahdia - everywhere a high level of services burns you. </p>
