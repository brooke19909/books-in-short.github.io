    <h2>  Nikolaev Nikolai Mikhailovich: biography </h2><p>  <span>Nikolai Nikolaev</span> was born on December 19, 1918 in the village of Pechersk Vyselki, Samara Region.  He graduated from a seven-year school.  After that, he worked as a tractor driver at MTS.  In these times, industrialization took great strides, so in many villages electricity appeared simultaneously with machines unknown until then.  Nicholas can be called one of the pioneers. </p><p>  In 1938, Nikolaev was drafted into the armed forces, where he served in the NKVD.  After returning, he stayed at home for less than a year.  In 1941 he was mobilized into the workers 'and peasants' Red Army.  Already in December, he goes to the front, where he takes part in various operations.  In one of the battles, he is seriously wounded, after recovery he is again sent to the front line. </p><p>  By 1944, Nikolaev Nikolay Mikhailovich rose to the rank of foreman and commanded anti-aircraft crew as part of the 1st Ukrainian Front. </p><h2>  Lviv-Sandomierz operation </h2><p>  In the middle of the summer of 1944, Soviet troops drove the Nazis, freeing their land.  But in the territory of Western Ukraine the Nazis were going to stop them.  From Berlin, an order was received by any means to keep the Red Army from entering Poland.  Therefore, the regions of Western Ukraine and partially Poland were actively strengthened to repulse the offensive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At this time, the supreme commander‚Äôs headquarters developed an offensive plan, which was to be carried out simultaneously with the Belarusian operation.  The troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front were to march on Rava-Russkaya and Lviv in order to encircle and destroy the Nazis at Brody, which opened the way to Poland.  Simultaneously with the preparation of the Soviet offensive in the German rear, an operation was being prepared by the Polish partisans ‚Äî the Craiova Army.  Also, the Soviet partisans intensified and sabotaged the transfer of German troops in this direction. </p><h2>  The beginning of large-scale hostilities </h2><p>  The offensive of the Soviet troops was carried out mainly by tank formations, which quickly broke through the front in narrow sections, which made it possible to develop tactical superiority after deepening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikolai Mikhailovich biography" class="if" height="231" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/972417.jpg" width="400"></div>  <span>Nikolaev Nikolai Mikhailovich</span> attacked Lviv as part of the 6th Guards Tank Corps.

    <p>  The Red Army broke through to the Vistula, where the Germans hastily created the line of defense.  Here they transferred significant forces.  Soviet troops had to force the river, waging fierce battles.  The crossing was shot through, and this significantly slowed down the progress. </p><h2>  The battle for Przemysl </h2><p>  By the end of July, the Red Army reached Przemysl.  In the city, the Germans seriously dug in.  During the crossing of the Vistula, aircraft and artillery of the Nazis hit direct fire, stopping the advance.  Nikolai Mikhailovich managed to suppress enemy artillery calculations, which fired on Soviet units.  After that, his anti-aircraft gun shot down three aircraft.  Almost alone, the gunners valiantly repelled raid after raid, thanks to which the Red Army managed to develop an offensive and liberate Przemysl.  In honor of this event, a festive salute was given in the capital of the USSR.  For heroism and courage, by order of the Supreme Council, Nikolai Mikhailovich was awarded the honorary title Hero of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  After the end of the Lviv-Sandomierz operation, Nikolai fought and liberated Europe from the Nazis.  In 1946 he returned to his native Syzran, where he lived until 1989. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikolaev Nikolay Mikhailovich" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/972413.jpg" width="210"></div>  In addition to the golden star of the hero, Nikolai received several medals and two orders of the Great Patriotic War.  His exploits are still remembered not only in his native city, but throughout the territory of the former Soviet Union.
