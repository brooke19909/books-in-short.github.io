These primarily include reliability and durability.  These properties have a waterproof phone. </p><h2>  What is he like? </h2><p>  Every day, fresh gadgets enter the market that do not stop surprising customers with their new capabilities.  Not every manufacturer can safely say that when creating technology, he focuses on quality.  In pursuit of trends, people are sweeping models with huge displays and <span>multi-core processors</span> from store shelves <span>.</span>  Often they turn out to be short-lived and are forced out of the top by the new brainchild of their developers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="a waterproof phone" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/730595.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Protected communications are capable of easily transferring force and not to let moisture in.  There are several types of shock resistance.  It can be declared by the manufacturer (nominal).  Or, it can significantly exceed this indicator and withstand even the most powerful mechanical loads from the outside. </p><h2>  Moisture Protection Levels </h2><p>  A waterproof phone can also be of different types.  It is able to withstand only splashes or withstand prolonged immersion to a considerable depth.  In addition, such gadgets are able to combat the penetration of dust and grains of sand under the body. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="waterproof shockproof phones" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/730598.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Shock-resistant and waterproof mobile phones are models whose design is designed to protect the mechanism from power loads and moisture.  They cope with these tasks much better than conventional means of communication.  These devices are more durable and less likely to break.  Before purchasing such a gadget, each buyer needs to remember several of their features. </p><h2>  What you need to know about shockproof? </h2><p>  When talking about a model that is able to withstand mechanical stress, the following is implied: </p><ol><li>  Such a gadget is protected from shock and often vibration.  But he is not immune to erasure, scratches on the body, buttons and display.  These phenomena are common in <span>these models</span> no less than in others. </li><li>  No matter how high the degree of protection of the device, it is not one hundred percent.  If the phone has a strong case, its owners often arrange for it the so-called "strength tests".  They throw him on the floor, against the wall, from the window, onto the asphalt, and so on.  If you conduct such "test drives" thoughtlessly and regularly, no equipment (even the phone is shockproof, waterproof) can not stand it. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shockproof and waterproof mobile phones" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/730594.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Even the most stable models have their Achilles heels.  These include, for example, a display.  When applying a strong point effect on it, it may not withstand.  If you drop the gadget face down on a hard uneven surface (stones, rubble, sticking out pieces of iron), there is a high probability that the glass on it will crack.  The case itself can safely transfer such a load, and the mechanisms will continue to work in normal mode. </li></ol><h2>  Tightness - what is it? </h2><p>  A variety of portable gadgets are on the market.  Waterproof phone has long occupied its niche among modern communications.  It has its key features.  This is the ability to withstand splashes, tightness and the ability to function after prolonged immersion entirely under water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are frequent cases when waterproof mobile phones cannot boast of a completely closed housing from moisture.  During dipping, the liquid can penetrate inside literally in a matter of seconds and cause serious damage to the mechanism of the apparatus.  Many gadgets of this type are able to withstand one hundred percent water.  But such a phone, for example, can easily cope even with the most heavy rainfall. </p><h2>  Dust confrontation </h2><p>  Protection against small particles (such as sand) getting under the casing is on par with water resistance.  Models belonging to this segment easily survive both a fall on the beach and a stay in such dangerous places as a vacuum cleaner.  So that the phones are shockproof, waterproof, can cope with such tests, their creators require less effort than when working on resistance to moisture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone shockproof waterproof" class="if" height="228" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/730593.jpg" width="416"></div>

    <p>  After serious dust loads, it is advisable not to forget about blowing vulnerabilities like keyboards, connectors and slots.  The same rehabilitation measures must also be carried out after the phone falls into the water.  In addition, it is worth disassembling and drying the ‚Äúinsides‚Äù of the apparatus in order to avoid failures in its operation in the future. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hidden features of other phones </h2><p>  Some gadgets, in the characteristics of which shockproof and resistance to water are not prescribed, can cope with these tasks no worse than protected models.  They successfully withstand mechanical loads, although the manufacturer does not claim this ability.  During various crash tests at factories, these models are much weaker than shockproof, waterproof phones. </p><p>  In order to describe the level of security of communications, a special classification system is used.  It is based on various degrees of protection of the aggregate shell from the penetration of foreign microscopic bodies under its body.  This applies to both dust and water molecules. </p><p>  The term ‚Äúprotected‚Äù is also periodically used to describe cryptophones.  These are special devices that have a barrier against spying on the conversations of the owner.  Due to the fact that these phones are very few in the market, it is quite difficult to mix them up with ordinary gadgets.  In addition, in this context, this concept is often used in the phrase ‚Äúprotected from listening‚Äù. </p><h2>  Sony offer </h2><p>  In March 2015, a big presentation from Sony was held at MWC in Barcelona.  The waterproof phone Xperia M4 Aqua was the opening of this event.  Its main distinguishing feature is the level of protection of the case, which is determined by the IP68 standard.  This unit can stay under water at a depth of one and a half meters for half an hour.  However, in his work there are no failures. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  Sony's first waterproof phone came out in 1999.  It was a Ericsson R250 model.  The company's next attempt to create a secure device was in 2008.  But it was not successful due to the fact that the developers did not plug the communication port with a stub.  This actually reduced the tightness of the housing to zero. </p><p>  In June 2011, in Singapore, the world saw the Sony Ericsson Xperia Active.  This time, the mistakes of the engineers were fixed.  This unit was equipped with a double case.  Its upper part performed a decorative function, and the inside - protective.  The phone could withstand immersion by 1 meter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony waterproof phone" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/730596.jpg" width="600"></div>

This smartphone could be connected to any device for listening to music - from headphones to the music center and speakers. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  In addition to reliable tightness, the protected gadget of 2015 differs from its predecessors by the presence of a connector port, which does not need plugs when immersed.  After being under water, the phone dries in thirty minutes.  After that, it can be charged without risking being hit by electric current, Sony developers say.  Waterproof phone is a budget model. <br><br>  Compared with the first representative of the Xperia M2 Aqua series, it has grown significantly in terms of technical characteristics.
