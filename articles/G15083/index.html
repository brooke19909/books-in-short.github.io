In 1800, on the banks of the Obitnaya river, serfs founded the village of the same name.  In 1817, by order of the <span>Duke of Richelieu,</span> who at that time was the governor of the Novorossiysk Territory, the construction of the Azov port began.  Initially, its construction was planned in the valley of the Obitonnaya River, but later it turned out that this place was not suitable for the construction of such a structure.  The port was built on the east <span>coast of the Berdyansk</span> Bay (the modern territory of Berdyansk). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1821, the village of Obitochnoe, now Primorsk (Zaporizhzhya region), with the surrounding environs was renamed Nogaysk.  In 1813 - 1814 the church of the Holy Trinity was built in connection with the victory in the war of 1812. In 1836 the church was made stone.  In 1936, it was partially destroyed (the bell tower was lost).  Since 1991, the church is recognized as an architectural monument.  The inhabitants preserved the icon of the Kazan Mother of God, which is now in the cathedral. </p><p>  Before the war in 1940, on the <span>seashore of the</span> outskirts of s.  An upscale found skeleton of a mammoth, which was taken to Germany during the occupation.  At the moment, the find is one of the exhibits of the St. Petersburg Zoological Museum. </p><p>  In 1964, Nogaysk was renamed Primorsky, and in 1967 the town was given the status of a city.  Soon the name of the city was slightly corrected in Primorsk. </p>

    <h2>  Road junction </h2><p>  A global highway E-58 Reni - Odessa - Rostov-on-Don runs through the city.  Photo Primorsk Zaporizhzhya region, as it is now, you can see in the article. </p><p>  The city has a bus station, from which buses and fixed-route taxis depart regularly.  There is no train station, and the nearest one is 32 km away in Elizavetovka.  That is why buses are the only form of public transport. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  There are not many attractions in the city, but the buildings of the 19th century are preserved - the structure of the Ukrainian-Bulgarian Lyceum, the Museum of Local Lore and the Holy Trinity Church, which is now working and being restored. </p><p>  Primorsk (Zaporizhzhya region) is famous for its underground routes.

However, there are legends that even during the Turkish invasions, local residents hid in them, and thereby escaped from slavery. </p><p>  In 1980, the landscape state reserve was founded on the spit of the river.  Inhabited area of ​​9 thousand hectares.  On its territory, favorable conditions have been created for a huge number of animals and birds to live. </p><p>  Primorsk (Zaporizhzhya region) is rich in many unique plants.

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  The population of the city is small and amounts to approximately 14 thousand people, but in the holiday season the number of inhabitants noticeably increases several times due to visiting tourists.  To put it mildly, it’s rather difficult to work in this city.  The choice here is small.  Many local residents earn on renting premises in the summer season, and also open small cafes and canteens, the main clientele of which are tourists.  The rest of the time, people sit out of work or leave to work in other larger cities. </p><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  Primorsk (Zaporizhzhya region), as a resort area, is currently actively developing and building up.  A huge number of <span>boarding houses, recreation centers</span> and children's camps are located along the estuary.  The city has no industrial plants, which makes it environmentally friendly.  Sea mild climate, warm sun, therapeutic mud of the estuary create the best conditions for families with children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in Primorsk Zaporizhzhya region" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1252542.jpg" width="600"></div>
