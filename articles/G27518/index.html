Do not forget that this country has another plus.  This is more than five hundred kilometers of the <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãcoast.</span>  The entire northern part of Poland is washed by the Baltic.  And along the coast are resort towns.  Iodine-rich air, beautiful nature, a wide strip of sandy beaches - and all this is framed by historical and cultural attractions: castles, cathedrals, palaces.  In this article we will consider the resorts of Poland on the <span>Baltic Sea.</span>  The main city on the entire coast is Gdansk.  It is a must-see.  In this city, which became the center of the liberation movement of Poland against the Soviet occupation, many sights are preserved.  But if you want the atmosphere of a resort, you need to stay in small places. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resorts in Poland" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1363594.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How to come to the resorts of the Baltic Sea </h2><p>  Poland is not as far as it seems.  Airplanes of various companies regularly fly to the capital, Warsaw.  Next you need to get to Gdansk, Szczecin or Swinoujscie.  Well, then with regional trains or buses you can quickly get to the Baltic resorts.  Each of them is unique, has its own ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù.  Gdansk and Gdynia are cities for lovers of excursions.  But in Krynica Sea visitors are waiting for a relaxing holiday.  Kolobrzeg, Miedzyzdroje and winoujcie are famous for their mineral springs and, accordingly, hydropathic centers.  Ustka is the youngest city, and Jastrzƒômbia Gora and Sopot are the most popular resorts in Poland.  Of course, the easiest way to get to the place is to the residents of Kaliningrad and the region.  Trains and buses run from Amber Land to the Baltic coast of a neighboring country. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kolobrzeg </h2><p>  The name of this city is translated from Polish as ‚ÄúNear the Coast‚Äù.  The name is given for a reason.  The entire tourist infrastructure of the largest resort in the central north of the country is aimed at meeting the needs of beach people.  The coastline is straight.  The beaches are sandy, very spacious.  In Kolobrzeg beautiful nature.  The beaches are bordered by forests with lakes.  The resort has its own microclimate.  Since the seventh century, Kolobrzeg has been famous for its salt springs.  Rapa was once evaporated, and precious crystals were exported to Western Europe or Scandinavia.  Kolobrzeg is unofficially called the ‚ÄúPearl of the Baltic‚Äù.  If we compare the sea resorts of Poland, then this town is the oldest, which began to receive tourists.  The first holiday home was built at the end of the century before last.  Now it is a sanatorium.  The best time to try Kolobrzeg‚Äôs microclimate is August.  Twenty kilometers of beaches equipped by European standards for the services of vacationers.  In the town itself you need to see the cathedral.  But most famous Kolobrzeg peat and salt springs.  They are used by doctors in more than thirty local sanatoriums.  It treats diseases mainly of a rheumatic nature, as well as the heart, blood vessels, metabolism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resorts in Poland on the Baltic Sea" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1363598.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Krynica Morska </h2><p>  In Poland there are at least three settlements with the name Krynica (‚Äúwell‚Äù).  Therefore, the town in the Baltic was assigned the definition of Morsk.  It is located ninety kilometers from Gdansk.  In summer, ferries from <span>Kaliningrad</span> go to Krynica Morska <span>.</span>  <span>The</span> town cannot boast of <span>climate</span> - the average monthly temperature in July is + 21. But in terms of ecology, Krynica Morska leaves other Polish resorts far behind.  Herds of wild boars can be seen even in the city.  These animals are not dangerous.  Despite the fact that Krynica Morska is the smallest <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãin Poland</span> (population - one and a half thousand people), there is something to do.  All entertainments are somehow connected with nature.  It is worth to climb the highest dune called ‚ÄúCamel Hump‚Äù to view the panorama of the Gulf of Wisla and the spit, as well as visit the Bird's National Park, where gray herons and black cormorants nest.  History buffs are advised to visit Frombork, which is located just seven kilometers from Krynica Morskaya, Stegna, and the Stutthof concentration camp museum in the village of Konty Ryback. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resorts of the Baltic Sea Poland" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1363623.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Forehead </h2><p>  Like many Polish resorts on the Baltic Sea, this one is also located at the mouth of the river.  Leba gave the name not only to the town in its delta, but also to the lake, which was formed as a result of the reclamation of the dunes.  This resort is suitable for outdoor enthusiasts.  There are three beach areas with clean sand.  The whole history of the town is connected with the struggle against the dunes.  Sand hills move at a speed of five meters per year, and in the storm they cause serious damage.  But the coast provides an opportunity for horse riding and cycling, surfing.  Lakes Sarbsko and Lebsko are separated from the Baltic Sea by the oblique, which is the main natural attraction of the town.  Children will surely be delighted with the <span>eba Dinosaur Park</span> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baltic resorts in Poland" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1363610.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Miedzyzdroje </h2><p>  Now consider the Baltic resorts of Poland near the German border.  The main cities here are Szczecin and winoujcie.  Twelve kilometers from the latter, on the island of Wolin, is the resort of Miedzyzdroje.  This town is very ancient.  It was founded in 1186.  And in the first half of the nineteenth century, Miedzyzdroje turned into a resort.  Here the softest microclimate in the Baltic Sea, mineral springs, clean sandy beaches, beautiful nature and developed leisure infrastructure.  However, it should be remembered that the entertainment in Miedzyzdroje is designed for a special contingent of tourists.  After all, the resort is famous primarily as a hospital.  Active tourists can make a trip to the Volinsky Natural Park or visit the ducal castle in Szczecin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resorts in poland reviews" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1363644.jpg" width="555"></div>

    <h2>  Swinoujscie </h2><p>  This port city is located on the very border with Germany.  Seventy-five kilometers separate it from Szczecin Airport.  Like many other Polish resorts, which were formerly German for a long time, winoujcie has a developed health resort infrastructure.  Here, skin and gynecological diseases, metabolic disorders, problems with the respiratory system and the cardiovascular system are treated with mud, boric, bromine and iodine mineral waters.  The pride of winoujcie is the old fort (a copy of the Roman castle of Sant'Angelo) and the spa park, which was established in the early nineteenth century.  And the city beach stretches for ten kilometers.  The width of the sand strip reaches one hundred meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="All Resorts in Poland" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1363637.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Yastarnya </h2><p>  Baltic resorts in Poland are called affordable prices.  But there are absolutely exclusive ones among them.  One of them is Yastarnya.  It is located on the Hel Peninsula.  As early as the seventeenth century there were several islets.  But over time, the sea and the wind connected them into a scythe, and the fishing villages turned into one resort.  In the era of <span>developed socialism</span> on this peninsula were located the closed dachas of party bosses.  And even now Jastarnia is not like other resorts in Poland.  There is a completely different, unhurried atmosphere.  The contingent resting in Yastarn - yachtsmen, avid fishermen, windsurfers.  Due to the prevailing south winds, a unique microclimate has developed in Puck Bay. </p>
