  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to prepare your wardrobe for your own vacation. Where to get dress patterns.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the approach of summer, many are thinking about updating the wardrobe.  The anticipation of summer, warmth, vacation, the sea makes you dream of light, flowing, cool outfits, almost weightless and imperceptible on the skin.  However, there is one problem with them: dresses that are really pleasant to the body made of natural materials are usually very expensive, and cheap synthetic ones stick to the body, do not allow the skin to breathe, soak later, and they have to be washed every day, which simply has no time in the summer - such a beauty around.  There is only one way out - to sew the dress on your own, fortunately, patterns of dresses in large quantities are freely available on the Internet.  Sewing <span>dresses with your own hands</span> gives such an invaluable advantage as the uniqueness of your outfit: even if someone decides to sew a dress for themselves according to the identical pattern, the probability of choosing the same fabric is almost zero.  The choice of materials in the stores is huge, and you can afford any fabric, both very inexpensive and luxurious silk - it will still cost much cheaper than buying such a dress in the store. </p><p>  Incidentally, not only a <span>summer dress,</span> but also a unique swimsuit can be sewn for vacation: there are also patterns of underwear on the Internet, including for swimming.  Here you can show your creative inclinations and imagination to the fullest - a swimsuit is sewn quickly, and there can be many decor options, and you can surprise your beach neighbors with a new exclusive little thing every day.  <span>Knitted swimsuits are also</span> very interesting <span>,</span> recently very popular.  In a set for a swimsuit, you can make a pareo or a light <span>beach dress.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To go out to dinner, you may need an evening toilet, and here patterns of evening dresses can come to the rescue.  You can create any toilet - it all depends on your perseverance and imagination, but most importantly - it will be unique.  By the way, you should not think that it is very difficult to sew an evening dress - there are such patterns of dresses that they are sewn easily even by novice craftsmen, but look brilliant.  Usually this is indicated in the description of the model, so it should not be a problem to find.  The choice of dress patterns is huge, and the choice of fabrics is even greater, you can decorate it than it is suitable, and you can additionally sew a light transparent scarf or a wrap of the same, harmonious or <span>contrasting color.</span>  You can even go further and make yourself suitable jewelry, but that's another story. </p><p>  So, in addition to the pattern of dresses and fabric, we will also need threads.  There are no problems with the choice of threads either: now in stores there are a lot of threads of different thicknesses and hundreds of shades.  In our case, preference should be given to durable and thin synthetic ones, for example, No. 40 or even thinner - it all depends on the fabric chosen.  Synthetics is more suitable because it does not fade, does not sit and has high strength, which is important for an active summer holiday.  The color of the threads is chosen half a tone darker than the main color of the fabric, and if the colors are the same, then at your own discretion, although they often choose dark, the main thing is not bright.  We build a pattern on paper on an appropriate scale, then transfer it to the fabric, pin it with pins, carefully cut it out, leaving a centimeter for allowances - we don‚Äôt need to dress anymore, we process the edges in a zigzag pattern - this is important because summer fabrics are often crumbled, swept and stitched.  The dress is ready.  In more detail, all stages are described in special manuals, which can also be found on the network. </p><p>  Thus, even without a lot of sewing experience, during the day you can sew a new dress, even at home, at least in the evening.  The only thing, if there is not enough experience, it is better to give preference to non-slip fabrics and simple models, and then everything will turn out in the best way. </p>
