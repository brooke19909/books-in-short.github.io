After the broadcast of the program "Best of All", a 4-year-old boy became the idol of many children and adults.  He was shocked by his reasoning, and at the same time, the audience could not hold back the tears when Misha burst into tears after playing with Karpov. </p><p>  The boy’s mother quickly reassured her son and reminded that a lot of children dream of such a party, and this opportunity turned up for him, and he must prove that he is brave and fair.  At that moment, Misha quickly wiped away his tears and, with great courage, hurried to decide etudes. </p><h2>  A very small chess player </h2><p>  The boy’s parents say that the son showed his first interest in this board game at the age of 2 years.  At first, father thought it was a short-term outburst and did not focus on him.  Over time, Misha absorbed more and more information about the game and asked his mother to deepen his knowledge. </p>

    <p>  Thus, dad realized that he needed to develop his son further.  It was difficult for parents to find a coach who would undertake to train such a small player.  But still, Misha was lucky, and he got to classes with a good specialist. </p><p>  By the age of 4, Mikhail Osipov had mastered many sketches and learned to count several moves ahead. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Show participation </h2><p>  When the first issues of the program “Best of All” were released, the boy’s parents realized that he must take part there.  Leading Maxim Galkin was surprised at the independence of the boy at such a young age. </p><p>  Mikhail Osipov shared his plans for the future with the studio, and he was offered a game part with the outstanding chess player Anatoly Karpov.  Then the boy lost to the champion and could not restrain his tears. </p>

    <p>  But he quickly pulled himself together and showed a few more decisions of sketches.  For his efforts, the boy received a medal with the logo of the program and a backpack with other gifts. </p><h2>  Party with Sergey Karjakin </h2><p>  The next arrival on the show took place before the New Year.  The program brought together all the children who conquered the audience with their talents over the season.  Little chess player Mikhail Osipov was no exception.  He happened to play an unusual game with Sergey Karjakin. </p><p>  Opponents were waiting for an original large-sized chessboard on the floor and huge chess pieces almost the size of Misha.  It was evident that Karjakin was surprised at such abilities of the boy.  In the middle of the game, Sergey offers the kid a draw so that he won’t be upset again due to the loss.  Mikhail Osipov accepts this scenario and proudly shakes hands with the champion. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Karjakin admits to Galkin that he did not succumb to his opponent.  He claims that he has not yet had to fight with such a young chess player.  After the release of both programs, fame fell on Misha.  He began to be invited to play all new games with famous chess players.  In one of these games, little Osipov defeated the 95-year-old grandmaster Yuri Averbakh. </p><h2>  How life and plans for the future have changed </h2><p>  The boy’s parents admit that participation in the show “Best of All” to Mikhail Osipov brought many benefits and new discoveries.  The boy was invited to study at the chess school of the Olympic reserve.  Here he receives invaluable lessons from his favorite game.  But the boy does not stop training with his first coach.  Because she already has an approach to a little genius and immediately believed in his strength. </p><p>  Parents note that they will not be able to send him to an elementary school early.  Misha will go to 1st grade, like everyone else, at 7 years old.  The boy already knows how to read and easily retells the meaning of the book, but dad decided that his son would better give himself completely to chess for several years.  Mikhail Osipov supports parents and is not in a hurry to go to a regular school. </p><p>  The little genius recently met again with Anatoly Karpov and again lost in time.  But this time the guy was not upset and was very happy with the useful advice of a world famous chess player. </p>

    <p>  Papa notes that the Vector Capital construction company took patronage of a promising boy and promised to pay for all the costs of travel to tournaments over time.  Such help is now very necessary for a young family, because so far only the father works, and the mother devoted herself completely to the development and education of her son. </p><p>  In 2018, Misha will take part in international competitions.  In Russia, he recently won the quick game in the under-9 category during the Russian Championship. </p>
