Its lands are full of legends and stories, backed up by unique sights.  The Mediterranean Sea washes the southern part of the country, creating excellent conditions for relaxing on the coast.  Beautiful beaches, some of the best resorts in Europe, temperatures not exceeding 32 ¬∞ C, water parks and many other attractions - all this is provided by the southern cities of Spain. </p><p>  On the Mediterranean coast are the most popular resorts that Spain offers to visit.  Lorca, Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãMalaga, Almeria - cities that are ideal for holidays with the whole family or friendly company. </p><p>  Lorca is located in the southeast of the <span>Spanish province of</span> Murcia.  The city has a very high <span>cultural value,</span> which is appreciated by tourists coming from Barcelona and other cities of the country. </p><p>  This territory was once ruled by Islamic peoples, which influenced the architecture of cities.  Spain, Lorca is one of their representatives.  Its ancient part is a lot of lanes and streets characteristic of those times.  Later, various <span>architectural structures</span> were built here <span>,</span> among which powerful fortresses are especially noticeable.  The cities of Spain on the coast were later conquered by Christians, and Lorca became a border town.  Several churches were built here, which today belong to architectural monuments. </p><p>  Like most European countries, Spain is interesting and politically important.  Lorca is a city especially important for cultural and historical recreation, as well as for the development and prosperity of the region.  Very important lines of communication between the cities of the Mediterranean coast pass through it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Spain is famous not only for its Mediterranean resorts.  Almost all types of industry are developed here.  Thanks to the development of livestock, ore mining, agriculture, Spain, Lorca is a wonderful example in this area, has its own production of tailoring from wool and leather.  In addition, irrigation systems created at one time by the Moors were preserved in Lorca.  Therefore, even on the semi-desert terrain characteristic of this region, agricultural development became possible.  Thanks to this, tourists who go on excursions to the southern cities of Spain can get to the weekly fair, which presents a wide variety of local products. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, the fairs for which Spain is famous, Lorca - not the only why tourists come to this city.  Among cultural attractions, Lorca Castle, which has a second name, The Fortress of the Sun, is especially appreciated here.  In the heart of the city is <span>Plaza Espanya.</span>  Also, tourists are invited to visit the municipal museum of archeology, the walls of which not only keep centuries-old history dating back to the 16th century, but also have very valuable historical exhibits.  Two centuries later, the Town Hall building was built in Lorca, which was also used as a prison. </p><p>  The cities of Spain on the coast provide their visitors with all the conditions for an excellent holiday.  In Lorca, tourists most often choose first-class hotels Hacienda Real Los Olivos and NH AMALTEA, in each of them organization of meetings and banquets is possible. </p><p>  Despite all the attractiveness, Lorca remains a city for excursions.  In 2011, many travel companies offer many different tours, among which there are both sightseeing tours and tours that provide for independent movement around the country in a rented car.  Beach lovers should still take a closer look at the Costa Dorada, where family vacations are especially popular.  There is a huge park with all kinds of attractions, as well as various water parks. </p><p>  And yet Lorca is for those who wish to diversify their beach and leisure activities with informative city tours in order to plunge into the ancient history of these places. </p>
