Every year more and more such organizations appear in the country.  You need to know what customers think about them.  After all, there are a lot of dubious and even unscrupulous firms.  What gets your <span>money feedback?</span>  Does this corporation really provide quality services and are not cheating?  Financial issues generally require separate and enormous attention.  Sometimes, taking a microloan, you can incur trouble.  So is it worth resorting to your money at all?  Is she really worth attention?  Or is this the most ordinary microfinance organization, from which it is desirable to stay away?

    <h2>  What does </h2><p>  To begin with: what is our today's organization doing?  Does it really deserve attention in its direction?  If you need a quick loan or loan, then yes.  "Your Money" is <span>a</span> <span>microfinance organization.</span>  She gives, according to the creators, favorable loans and borrowings.  And instantly.  And without too much paperwork. </p><p>  In principle, the activities of the corporation are "transparent."  Her competition in Russia is really huge.  After all, as has already been said, <span>microfinance organizations</span> are currently gaining enormous distribution.  In any case, for the direction of your activity, ‚ÄúYour <span>Money‚Äù</span> receives positive <span>reviews</span> .  There is no deception or scam.  Need a loan or loan as soon as possible?  Then you came to the address! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Spread </h2><p>  By the way, our today's organization has been operating in the market for quite some time.  And she for all this time has helped many citizens.  Yes, competition is increasing, but "Your Money" still works.  Moreover, she has been known for 5 years.  In 2011, it was opened in Moscow, and now it is distributed throughout Russia. </p><p>  True, so far not as good as we would like.  "Your money" addresses are diverse.  And in different cities of the country.  There are a lot of them in Moscow.  And it pleases.  That is, it is safe to say that this is not a lie.  Fraudsters rarely distribute their "left" firms throughout Russia, and even openly advertise it. </p><p>  If you want to find out specific addresses, it is recommended to use the official page "Your Money".  Offices will be shown on an interactive map of selected cities.  There you will see full addresses.  No cheating!  Everything is extremely clear and simple.  So, you can trust our organization today.  For this, she receives many positive opinions from potential customers.  Yes, a microfinance institution is a big risk in itself.  But, as you can see, ‚ÄúYour money‚Äù has existed for a long time.  Moreover, she is not hiding from anyone, is constantly developing and opening up new and new branches in different cities of the country.  Fraudsters will not do so explicitly.  This is painfully suspicious and dangerous. </p><p>  Not sure where to turn in Moscow to receive services from an organization?  Then look at the interactive map on the main page "Your money".  The head office is located on Pervomaiskaya street, house 73, building 6. Here (and not only) you can get a loan or a loan in person.  On Taganskaya 1 (building 1), as well as on Open Highway 5 (building 11), you also have the right to use the services of the organization. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But the details of the receipt, as well as all the questions you are interested in, are asked on the hotline.  To do this, dial 8 800 700 22 29 on the phone. This number is suitable for all regions of Russia.  These are the contacts your company has. </p><h2>  Service list </h2><p>  Of course, a huge role is played by the various services that this or that company is able to provide.  To be honest, there is nothing special about ‚ÄúJet Money‚Äù (sometimes called ‚ÄúYour Money‚Äù).  This, as already mentioned, is a microfinance organization.  It is not clear what exactly she can offer her customers? </p><p>  Credits and loans.  And on favorable terms.  In any case, so many say.  Low interest, quick clearance.  In principle, the whole list of services ends there.  If you specify a little, you can notice several directions of the organization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quick loan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1259599.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The first is the issuance of short-term and quick loans for any needs.  True, the payment period is not too long.  You should not be surprised, because we will deal with short-term loans.  Nothing complicated, right? </p><p>  The second is short-term loans.  Almost the same as a loan.  But here the overpayment, as a rule, is slightly less. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The third is a ‚Äúpaycheck‚Äù loan.  It is this service that attracts most consumers.  Money to paychecks is perhaps the most popular and common service with all microfinance modern organizations. </p><p>  All this generates positive reviews about the company called ‚ÄúYour Money‚Äù.  We can say that you have the right to apply here when you urgently need money.  And do not worry that the process will ‚Äúdrag out‚Äù or require a lot of papers from you, not at all.  The possibilities and advantages of the company do not end there.  What else stands out by customers?  What are the pros and cons most often highlighted? </p><h2>  Opportunities </h2><p>  ‚ÄúJet Money‚Äù receives quite good, though sometimes skeptical reviews about its capabilities.  And this is not about services at all.  And how exactly they are provided.  The thing is that ‚ÄúYour Money‚Äù is a microfinance organization, which not only offers to issue a loan or credit in offices, not at all.  Among other things, you can get certain services without leaving your home.  That is, through the Internet! </p><p>  Such activity causes suspicion among many - but is it a lie?  Indeed, most organizations that offer loans and loans through the Internet, as a rule, only deceive their customers.  But the MFO "Your Money" has long existed in Russia.  Will she cheat her customers? </p><p>  Not at all.  You really can use the Internet and the official page of the organization to apply for a loan or a loan.  True, its issuance will occur either at the office (this will have to be noted during the preparation of the application) or directly to a bank card.  No other is given.  Nothing suspicious, although the virtual design option itself does not greatly inspire clientele trust.  In any case, trusting an organization called "Your Money" is worth it.  Even on the official page it is indicated that to get a loan you are able to either go to the office or resort to a very dubious step - the use of the Internet.  The choice is yours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jet mani" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1259597.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  What conditions does the company ‚ÄúYour Money‚Äù offer for granting loans to its customers?  As many claim - profitable.  And even very much.  It can be said to some extent they are seductive.  This is both pleasing and alarming at the same time.  After all, few people in the modern world trust microloans and loans.  Someone already "fell for the bait" of such organizations, some are simply based on extraneous errors.  So the conditions for the provision of services are given great attention.  What does our today's corporation offer? </p><p>  The main thing is that you will definitely be guaranteed a double invoice.  No unnecessary paperwork, a long wait, or anything like that.  A quick loan with an organization called "Your Money" is a reality.  The borrower must be 18 years old.  Perhaps this is the only essential condition. </p><p>  You only need a passport to receive services.  And no more third-party documents.  If you are a pensioner, you can also show a pension certificate, but this is not necessary.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter how exactly you make the registration - via the Internet or in person.  One passport is enough. </p><p>  You have the right to take a loan for a month or any other short term.  However, during registration you will be asked about the availability of a constant source of profit, and they will also clarify what interest on loans is paid in "Your money".  At the moment, the rate is about 2% per day.  The maximum you can "lend" 25,000. And nothing more.  So the organization has limitations.  And this also pleases - no one will deceive you, everything is explained in detail. </p><h2>  Speed </h2><p>  Special attention deserves such a factor as the speed of customer service.  Indeed, many people ‚Äústare‚Äù at her too.  The loan "Your money" can be taken, as you will be promised, in just 5 minutes.  That is instantly.  The approval takes place right on the spot in the office.  And the issuance of cash - too. </p><p>  If we are talking about an online application, then a loan or a loan will come to your bank card.  All this (including design) takes about 10 minutes.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter whether it is day or night.  The speed of customer service at our organization today is quite high.  This approach pleases visitors.  Now, if you urgently need money, you can solve this problem in very favorable conditions in just a few minutes.  So pay attention to "Your money" is worth it. </p><p>  True, sometimes online applications are processed for a long time (about a day).  This is extremely rare, you should not panic.  Users recommend waiting just a while.  Most importantly, do not try to re-apply for a loan.  "Your money" will take such a decision as a second loan.  And after a while you will receive two approved loans at once.  Not the best option, because returning the excess amount just like that, without interest, will not work.  So, if the application is processed more than 10 minutes, do not panic anyway.  And certainly do not create a new one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loan your money" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1259596.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Service with a personal presence at "Your money" receives only positive reviews.  Indeed, fast and well-coordinated work.  Just what you need.  As a rule, there are no queues in offices.  And if they occur, then they disperse very quickly - citizens get approval for loans and borrowings, then they simply leave.  There is nothing special about this.  So ‚ÄúYour money‚Äù (you can look at the telephone number and the exact address of the branches on the official page of the organization specifically for your city) is a corporation that really deserves attention.  You can trust her. </p><h2>  Communication for debts </h2><p>  Separate attention in our today's issue requires a topic such as debt repayment.  Or rather, the organization‚Äôs communication with debtors.  This moment is extremely important, and many consumers pay attention to it.  The thing is that the microloan ‚ÄúYour money‚Äù offers to repay, albeit on favorable, but at the same time very costly conditions.  Yes, most customers are satisfied - they just try to take small amounts for a short period of time.  And there will be no special overpayments.  But there are still problems in this area. </p><p>  Which ones?  If you owe debt, most likely you will very quickly regret contacting an organization called "Your Money".  Why?  After all, this company transfers almost all of its business to collectors.  That is, it‚Äôs enough to simply delay the payment once (especially if the amount is large), how the collection companies will begin to operate. </p><p>  Pay attention to the fact that you will be asked to pay debts.  If you do not, threats will go.  Moreover, as many customers say "Your money", even if you have already paid off the debt, they will not stop bothering you.  In other words, they will choose all means by all means.  Not the best case scenario, but it does. </p><p>  With all this, "Your Money" denies the illegality of its actions.  In principle, they have already tried to ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù this organization for appealing to collection companies.  But it did not give any results.  Why?  Firstly, microfinance organizations are dubious places.  And the court rarely takes the side of the borrower in such matters.  Secondly, it is very difficult to prove the illegality of actions.  Only in exceptional cases will justice be achieved. </p><p>  For all this, "Your Money" reviews receive no better content.  In fact, we are being deceived.  At first they lure with favorable conditions, and then they begin to actively beat out debts and loans that have already been closed.  This is far from the rarest case.  Therefore, be careful.  Most customers simply advise keeping all receipts and receipts for long-term payment.  Indeed, sometimes even a few years after talking with the organization ‚ÄúYour Money‚Äù, collectors may disturb you.  You will have to prove that you paid all debts to the organization on time and a long time ago.  Only payments will help with this.  If they get lost, you can wait for a long trial.  And, accordingly, monetary losses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="your money addresses" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1259595.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Paperwork </h2><p>  The main advantage that "Your money" gives is that this organization does not have any extra paperwork.  That is, with one passport and several minutes of waiting (although some customers say that applications are considered for about 3 days), you have the right to quickly take a loan.  And only short-term, with certain restrictions, but on favorable terms.  No evidence of your solvency, no paperwork!  Exactly what is needed!  For this, the company earns positive reviews about its activities. </p><p>  But only some do not particularly like this solution.  Yes, a loan or a loan is now easier to arrange.  But there are no guarantees that the data (contacts) indicated in the corresponding fields will belong to the borrower.  Why is this fact alarming? </p><p>  Some clients emphasized that they were worried by collectors about delinquencies or large debts for loans taken at Your Money.  Only there is one small but - no one took a loan there.  In other words, someone redirected the collectors to innocent citizens.  Most likely, in court you will have to prove that you did not take loans and are not actually clients of the organization ‚ÄúYour Money‚Äù.  If you do not do this, you will be constantly disturbed.  Moreover, you cannot prove your case - you will have to pay the money.  Moreover, with all interest, penalties and other charges.  Such troubles can await citizens. </p><p>  What does the organization "Your Money" say about this?  Nothing.  After all, no one checks the data specified when filling out an application for the issuance of funds!  That is, they simply offer you a loan on favorable terms.  And here it is important to consider the speed of service.  Otherwise, the organization would not issue microloans.  But I could check the correctness and accuracy of the entered contacts. </p><p>  Therefore, "Your Money" is a rather dubious organization.  There are those who really remain dissatisfied after communicating with them.  This is especially true for "framed" borrowers.  Consider this factor.  And if collectors suddenly started calling you, act immediately, prove your innocence!  Otherwise, you can get huge debts that have to be paid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="company your money" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1259593.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  No money left </h2><p>  And here is one more thing encountered in relation to our corporation today.  It pops up not so often, but it does.  Often, users try to make a microloan in "Your money" via the Internet, by electronic application.  Such an opportunity takes place.  But is it worth it to use? </p><p>  Sometimes you risk being left without money, but with debt.  Many customers have already complained about such incidents.  That is, you take a loan, you are approved, but you do not receive any money.  But the debt that is accrued daily - this is what will appear after you fill out an application in electronic form. </p><p>  The most interesting thing is that it is useless to prove your innocence.  Either you repay the debt, or you begin to communicate with collectors and sue for a long, long time.  In any case, the incident is unpleasant.  Thus, "your money" has a somewhat mixed popularity. </p><h2>  Fake </h2><p>  Then where on the Internet can you find so many enthusiastic reviews about our organization today?  What does she really mean?  Why are customers generally not completely satisfied with the work of the corporation, but leave positive opinions about it? </p><p>  ‚ÄúYour money‚Äù (Moscow and other cities), if you look closely, uses a very interesting scheme of work on the Internet.  She buys positive opinions for the most part.  In other words, all the flattery for the organization is a fake.  Moreover, it is used to attract customers.  Believe these words or not, everyone decides for himself.  So, blaming "Your money" for fraud is useless.  No one forces you to believe in the truth of publications.  You make the final decision yourself. </p><p>  Thus, ‚ÄúYour Money‚Äù is an MFI that has been living and prospering in Russia for a long time.  With all this, she uses the well-known corporation promotion schemes.  And you have to consider this fact.  Otherwise, you can stay with debt, but without money in principle. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What conclusions can be drawn from all of the above?  To be honest, "Your Money" is a really working company.  She gives short-term loans, as well as loans.  The interest rate is slightly overestimated, but in general terms are favorable. </p><p>  Do you trust this corporation?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Frankly, it is worth skepticizing about her. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Your money" is not much different from competitors - there is both deception and your own tricks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some recommend becoming clients of this company only in extreme cases. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then and only then will many problems be avoided.</font></font></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="  " class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1259594.jpg"></div>
