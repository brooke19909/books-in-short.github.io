And this happens both on issues of compulsory and voluntary insurance. </p><p>  At the same time, people faced with similar problems threaten to sue and deal with negligent UK.  But do not forget that such a development of events will require not only money, but also time, and, unfortunately, nerves.  Therefore, we consider where to complain about the insurance company without bringing the matter to court. </p>

    <h2>  First steps </h2><p>  Sometimes it‚Äôs very easy to deal with the situation.  After all, the insurance company consists of employees.  And if the unlawful actions of any of them led to a violation of the rights of the car owner, then the IC itself is the first instance where to complain about the insurance company.  Rosgosstrakh, Reso-guarantee or any other insurance company is obliged to give a written response.  If you have been refused or not answered at all, then you need to complain further.  It‚Äôs better if you still have a notification about sending a complaint to the insurance company. </p><h2>  TSB RF </h2><p>  Currently, the only government agency that oversees the activities of car insurers is responsible for this.  She also owns the function of issuing licenses to insurance companies.  This organization is the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  His responsibilities also include setting OSAGO tariffs and spare parts manuals.  The Central Bank checks the financial viability of insurance companies.  If necessary, he can suspend the license, or even revoke it.  Moreover, in recent years, the Central Bank has often appointed temporary management to those companies that it considers problematic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How does it help policyholders? </h2><p>  It turns out that Russian insurers are completely dependent on the Central Bank.  Thus, the main authority to complain about the insurance company in case of need is he. </p><p>  If you accurately and correctly formulate and submit a written claim, you will soon receive a response and you will see the measures taken in relation to the insurance company.  Among the sanctions, the IC can expect a considerable fine. </p><h2>  FAS </h2><p>  The Federal Antimonopoly Service is another institution that has the responsibility to control insurers and another authority to complain about the insurance company.  The FAS often punishes motor insurers if the latter violate the law, including those concerning OSAGO. </p>

    <p>  Probably, most, if not all car owners, are familiar with the imposition of additional motor third party liability services.  It is worth looking through the sites about insurance, and you can find substantial <span>penalties</span> imposed on insurers in this regard.  A significant amount will have to be paid to the company that will be caught selling diagnostic cards or imposing life insurance upon purchasing an insurance policy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, usually in the UK they do not agree to pay a fine and try to appeal the decision in court.  But in most cases, such cases are obviously losing for them.  Therefore, you still have to pay.  Thus, insurance companies have a powerful incentive to provide the most profitable service quality than to constantly take risks and be caught in illegal actions. </p><p>  Thus, the FAS is another option where to complain about the <span>insurance company under compulsory motor third-party liability insurance</span> if problems arise in acquiring or prolonging the contract.  Moreover, it is in this state institution that you should contact if you are imposed additional services when applying for a car loan.  At the same time, do not forget that here, as, incidentally, for other instances, evidence should be found in order to bring the IC to justice. </p>

    <h2>  PCA </h2><p>  <span>The Russian Union of Auto Insurers</span> is a professional association of <span>insurance companies.</span>  The main goal of creating this non-profit organization was to monitor the activities of its participants and the implementation of insurance legislation.  However, in practice, its activities turned out to be somewhat different.  PCA <span>pays compensation</span> for those insurance companies whose licenses have been revoked.  This is a very effective help for many car owners.  But at the same time, it should be borne in mind that the management of the organization consists of the main persons of the largest insurance companies.  Therefore, complaints can be dealt with by the same companies at which they are submitted. </p><h2>  BCC </h2><p>  Another organization, called the All-Russian Union of Insurers, has similar problems with the previous one.  Based on the main tasks that are declared by these organizations, it becomes clear where you can complain about the work of the insurance company.  At the same time, the question arises of how objective the complaints will be considered. </p>

    <p>  Of course, they will accept them.  However, there is every reason to doubt the effectiveness of such measures of influence on insurance companies.  Having studied the practice, we can conclude that complaints to state authorities will be much more effective than written appeals to associations of insurance companies. </p><h2>  But something help? </h2><p>  Nevertheless, one cannot fail to indicate the assistance that car owners receive from professional associations of insurers.  Although the main support is informational, even it can be very effective.  The site, for example, lists all the laws and other regulations related to the auto insurance industry.  Here you can find other useful information. </p><p>  You can calculate how much the future <span>compulsory insurance policy</span> will cost <span>.</span>  Also on the site there are directories where the cost of spare parts is indicated.  This will allow you to calculate most accurately the amount of money for all the parts necessary for the restoration work that the car needs after the accident. </p><p>  But it is obvious that this is not the authority to complain about the VHI insurance company or life insurance if these services are imposed upon the purchase of the policy. </p>

    <h2>  Rospotrebnadzor </h2><p>  Can one count on the help of Rospotrebnadzor if disputes arise between the insurer and the insured?  Based on the essence of the policy, the car owner is a consumer.  That is why the authority has the right to help them.  And such facts were when the organization stood up for the rights of car owners. </p><p>  The Ministry of Finance, in turn, in case of problems with compulsory motor third-party liability insurance or the imposition of additional insurance, has its own recommendations on where to complain about the work of the insurance company.  Complaints based on these recommendations should only be submitted to the Central Bank.  At the same time, car owners can contact Rospotrebnadzor. </p><h2>  If nothing helps </h2><p>  In addition, there is another powerful authority.  This is the prosecutor‚Äôs office.  Its employees are required to respond to violations of the rights and freedoms of car owners.  This is the authority where you can complain about the insurance company for CASCO or CTP.  But only if there is no evidence of guilt of the company, then contacting it is useless.  Evidence may be, for example, testimony of witnesses of violations.  In addition to complaints about hull and motor third party liability insurance, here you can complain about incorrect behavior of employees of the insurance company, for example, if there was a rough treatment to customers.  In this case, a serious administrative fine may be expected of the offenders. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, it turns out that despite the official recommendation to file complaints with car insurers only with the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, there are many instances where car owners can complain in case of violation of their rights. </p><p>  When choosing where to go, proceed from the kind of violation that has been recorded against you.  It is also advisable that the complaint be supported by evidence.  Then the insurance company will not be able to get out. </p>
