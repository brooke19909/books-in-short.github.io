    <h2>  In which rooms is emergency lighting mounted </h2><p>  Regulations require owners of premises for various purposes to install LED emergency lighting.  In order to avoid the occurrence of human casualties during various threats (fire, flooding, gas leak, etc.), such light sources should be installed in the following rooms: </p><ul><li>  Hospitals. </li><li>  Airports </li><li>  Office buildings. </li><li>  Trading objects. </li><li>  Industrial enterprises. </li><li>  Schools. </li><li>  Train stations. </li><li>  Kindergartens. </li><li>  Sports complexes, etc. </li></ul><h2>  Types of emergency lighting </h2><ul><li>  Evacuation.  An emergency LED lamp in such a system serves to ensure safe conditions during the evacuation of people.  As a rule, it is installed at fire exits and near rooms where fire protection equipment is stored. </li><li>  Reserve.  In this system, an emergency lamp with an LED battery is mounted.  It creates an opportunity for <span>the lighting system</span> to work in normal mode <span>for a</span> long time. </li><li>  Production.  Emergency lighting installed in hazardous areas.  It is used in rooms where serious types of work are carried out.  Provides correct lighting performance under all conditions. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED emergency light" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14919/1694776.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Required Installation Points </h2><p>  Emergency light emitting diode (LED) in emergency lighting and the light source in the emergency lighting system are two different things.  The first serve only to indicate the escape route.  With emergency devices, everything is much more complicated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order for emergency lighting to meet a set of regulations and rules, it is necessary to highlight especially important points for its installation: </p><ul><li>  Evacuation path (‚Äúexit‚Äù plate above a street door or to another room where the direction of movement must be indicated). </li><li>  Premises exceeding sixty square meters (hotel, hospital halls, the central premises of the airport or train station, etc.). </li><li>  Premises of increased risk (public or industrial, where especially dangerous types of work are carried out). </li><li>  Important rooms (elevator, stairs, transformer, technical, escalators). </li><li>  Premises without windows, the size of which does not exceed eight square meters (toilets, etc.). </li><li>  Dangerous places (intersections of corridors, steps, flights of stairs, turns in corridors). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="led emergency lights" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/1694563.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Varieties of emergency lighting </h2><p>  Any emergency LED lamp is used for human safety when the main light is turned off.  It is used for safe evacuation, to quickly eliminate the causes of breakdowns of the main power source and to safely complete the work process. </p><p>  There are five types of emergency lighting fixtures. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Permanent (the name speaks for itself). </li><li>  Non-constant (included only in the event of a malfunction in the central lighting system). </li><li>  Combined (equipped with two lamps for various purposes. The first lamp is responsible for emergency light, the second - for the working). </li><li>  Centralized (powered by a central system). </li><li>  Autonomous (emergency lamp with LED battery). </li></ul><h2>  Battery Devices </h2><p>  Emergency light sources that are equipped with a battery are considered preferred.  The advantage is that their operation is completely independent of the state of the central lighting system.  And if the main line is damaged during a fire or any other emergency, the emergency LED lamp with a battery can give the necessary light. </p><p>  The second significant advantage of such devices is their quick and easy installation.  Installation can be carried out by people who do not have the proper experience and knowledge of the issue.  When choosing battery devices, it is very important to pay attention to the quality of the battery.  Also a very important point is timely recharging.  The staff must be a person who would be responsible for the condition of the batteries of emergency light sources.  Otherwise, in case of emergency and dangerous, the devices will simply be inactive due to the lack of a central current, from which they can be recharged. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED emergency light" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14919/1694775.jpg" width="425"></div>
