    <h2>  Automation </h2><p>  For a large number of settlement operations, not only the speed of each of them is important, but also the absence of gaps between them in which human participation is required.  Many <span>famous inventors</span> have tried to solve this problem.  It was necessary that the operations go sequentially one after another without stopping. </p><h2>  Introducing the program on the go </h2><p>  The history of computer technology knows many prominent scientists who have contributed to the development of automation.  So, in the early 80's.  The 19th century suggested that punch cards be used to pre-record a program and enter it into a device.  Their developer was Herman Hollerith.  In computer science, this scientist made a real revolution.  Let us consider in more detail his inventions. </p><h2>  Herman Hollerith: biography </h2><p>  A scientist was born on February 29, 1860 in Buffalo.  He was the seventh child.  His father emigrated from Germany to the USA in 1848.  After moving, Hollerith went to school, from which he was expelled pretty quickly.  As a rule, Herman left the class before spelling.  Master once closed the door, and the boy jumped out of the second floor.  After that, he was expelled from school.  Herman Hollerith received further education from a Lutheran teacher.  With him he took courses in secondary and higher schools.  At 16, he entered college specializing in mining.  However, the young man was interested not so much in the profession as in technology.  Studying at Colombian college, he met Trowbridge, who after some time made him his assistant.  So Herman Hollerith got into the Statistical Office of the Census of America. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="german choleritis tab" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1044962.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Career </h2><p>  At the age of 19, Herman Hollerith went to Washington, where he began his work.  He became actively involved in Georgetown's public circles.  After some time, Hollerith met Billings.  The latter was an authoritative expert in the field of analysis of statistical information, so he worked as director of the census office.  Billings informed Hollerith about his idea to create a machine that would use punch cards to form tables based on the data received.  Different authors point out two versions of the influence of the director of management on further activities to design the device.  According to the first, Billings suggested using punched cards with a description of the person using marks on their edges and a device for sorting.  According to the second version, he simply offered to come up with some kind of device. </p><h2>  First experience </h2><p>  In 1882, Herman Hollerith was invited to the Massachusetts Institute as a teacher.  He worked in an educational institution for a year.  During this time, Hollerith improved his ideas and was developing the first equipment for recording census information and compiling tables.  In 1883, he returned to Washington, where he began work at the patent office.  The knowledge gained there was useful to him as an inventor, and he used it over the following decades.  In 1884, he put forward the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãimproving the brake system of railway transport.  It should be said about the financial condition in which Herman Hollerith was.  He could also design a tabulator in the early 80s, but he had no money for it.  At the same time, he could not borrow from anyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of computer technology" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1044963.jpg" width="600"></div>

The event presented systems operating on the principle of vacuum and using compressed air.  The electric brake was recognized as the best of five.  However, there were doubts about the practicality of its use due to the thunderstorm threat.  In this regard, the system was rejected, and patents for the brakes remained inactive until their expiration.  The next invention was the apparatus of corrugation of pipes made of metal.  He also did not find his application at first, but later he was used by General Motors in the manufacture of flexible joints. </p><h2>  Herman Hollerith: Tab </h2><p>  The new patent, registered September 23, 1884, became the most important of all.  Herman Hollerith‚Äôs machine was used to compile tables of statistics on mortality in Baltimore in 1887.  Data from 1889 in New York was also processed using this device.  Using all his experience, Herman Hollerith proved that punch cards are an essential element in the process of creating tables.  In 1887, he introduced a correction to the patent.  Because of this, many industrialists had to conclude a license agreement with Hollerith for its device.  During the census in 1890, information about each citizen was transferred to 73/8 √ó 33/4 inch cards.  Next, perforation was made along the edges for each characteristic.  Diagonally, one corner was cut for convenience in the process of recounting and sorting.  The last operation was carried out visually, since other methods were not developed then.  The Hollerite machine independently perforated in accordance with the sample.  The device facilitated the work of the operator and reduced the number of errors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="famous inventors" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1044964.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The essence of the apparatus </h2><p>  For his device, Herman Hollerith designed a press with a hard rubber plate and a guide stop.  Recesses were present in the plate.  They corresponded to the location of the perforations on the map.  Partially, they were filled with mercury and connected with terminals to the back of the case.  A box with projection contact points was located above the plate.  They were driven by springs.  When the card was placed in the press, the contact point touched the mercury, and the circuit was closed.  This, in turn, activated the counter.  Its dial could register numbers up to 10 thousand.  He moved with the help of a magnet, which received a signal through mercury recesses, by 1 division.  From time to time, data from the counter was read, and the total result was transferred to the final card manually. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="german hollerite machine" class="if" height="472" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1044967.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Precision control </h2><p>  A number of measures were taken to ensure it: </p><ol><li>  If summing up was carried out simultaneously on several characteristics, the dial registered each passing card.  So it was possible to verify the result by adding the intermediate indicators. </li><li>  When correctly registered, the device made a call.  If he was absent, it was necessary to find and correct the error. </li><li>  The press only processed cards with a specific code for which it was programmed. </li><li>  Punched cards that belonged to the same group had a common hole.  Using a wire rod, the presence of "alien" cards was detected. </li></ol>

    <h2>  World famous </h2><p>  The masses knew Hollerith, but in 1890 he achieved completely unforeseen success.  He managed to conclude a contract for 11 census procedures after winning the competition in 4 districts of St. Louis, in which more than 10 thousand people lived.  The method developed by Herman Hollerith was not only the highest speed, but also the highest accuracy.  According to estimates, the designer saved the state almost 600 thousand dollars.  In 1890, the scientist turned 30. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.  Hollerith made an important deal with the US Census Bureau.  In mid-September 1890, he married the daughter of his doctor from Washington.  Almost immediately after the wedding, Hollerith entered into an agreement with the Austrian government to use his device at the Central Bureau of Statistics.  From that moment began the international career of a scientist.  By 1895, his devices worked not only in Austria, but also in Canada.  At the same time, negotiations were held on the supply of equipment to Russia and Italy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="german hollerite biography" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1044966.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  last years of life </h2><p>  Herman Hollerith was very fond of spending time with his family, engaged in agricultural activities, purchased cars and built houses.  In marriage, he had three daughters and as many sons.  This outstanding man, who made a huge contribution to statistics, died in his home from a heart attack on November 17, 1929.  He ended his life in abundance, surrounded by loving people, in happiness, not regretting any missed opportunities.  Until his very last days, he hated all spelling rules and allowed himself to write as he wanted. </p>
