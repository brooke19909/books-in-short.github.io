From childhood, his hobby was reading books about traveling to distant lands.  As a child, he read almost all publications about travels beyond the Arctic Circle, which he managed to get.  Secretly from his mother, Amundsen in the early years began to prepare for expeditions: he was tempered, did physical exercises, and also played football, believing that this game helps strengthen the muscles of the legs. </p>

    <h2>  The youth of the great polar explorer </h2><p>  When Amundsen entered the Faculty of Medicine in Oslo, he devoted most of his time to studying foreign languages, being sure that their knowledge was necessary for travel.  What Roald Amundsen discovered in geography is largely due to his long-term training throughout his youth. </p>

    <p>  In the years 1897-1899, young Amundsen took part in the Antarctic expedition of the Belgian polar explorers.  In the same team with him was the <span>famous traveler</span> Frederick Cook, who in 10 years will fight in the struggle for the right to be the discoverer of the North Pole with Robert Peary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Outstanding polar explorers: the struggle for primacy </h2><p>  The North Pole was the goal that Roald Amundsen set himself.  What did he discover in the future if other travelers were already fighting for him at the extreme point of the planet?  Officially, it was long believed that <span>Robert Peary was the</span> first to reach the North Pole on April 6, 1909 <span>.</span>  Frederick Cook claimed to have been here on April 21, 1908.  Since the evidence presented by Cook was in doubt, they decided to give the palm to Piri.  But his achievements were in doubt. </p>

    <p>  The fact is that the equipment of that time has not yet reached the level of development at which it would be safe to assert the truth of a perfect discovery.  The next to try to conquer the inexorable North Pole was Fridtjof Nansen.  But he could not achieve his goal, and the baton was taken from him by Roald Amundsen.  What he discovered and when, forever left in the history of geographical research.  But Amundsen's main discovery was preceded by many trials.  After the death of his mother, Amundsen decided to become a long-range navigation navigator.  However, in order to successfully pass the exams, it was necessary to work for at least three years as a sailor on a schooner. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Roald Amundsen: what he discovered before becoming a great navigator </h2><p>  The future polar explorer goes to the shores of Svalbard on an industrial ship.  Then he switches to another ship and sets off for the Canadian coast.  Before <span>becoming a great</span> traveler, Amundsen serves as a sailor on several ships and visits many countries: Spain, Mexico, England and America. </p><p>  In 1896, Amundsen took exams and received a diploma, which made him a long-distance navigation navigator.  After graduation, Antarctica finally becomes the place where Roald Amundsen goes.  What did he discover during his first journey?  Only the fact that in Antarctica the main goal is to stay alive.  The expedition, which was intended to study terrestrial magnetism, almost became the last for the entire crew.  The strongest blizzards, scorching frost and a long hungry wintering - all this almost ruined the team.  They were saved only thanks to the energy of a brave traveler who constantly hunted seals to feed a crew dying of hunger. </p>

    <h2>  Change goals </h2><p>  Roald Amundsen: what did he discover and what is his role in modern geographical knowledge?  In 1909, when Cook and Peary officially declared their rights to open the North Pole, Amundsen decided to radically change his task.  Indeed, in this race he could be only the second, if not the third.  Therefore, the polar explorer decided to conquer another goal - the South Pole.  However, there were already those who wanted to achieve this goal faster. </p><h2>  Scott English Expedition </h2><p>  In 1901, an expedition led by officer Robert Scott was organized by Great Britain.  He did not consider geographical discoveries a matter of his whole life, but he approached the preparation for a harsh journey with all responsibility.  Roald Amundsen, <span>Robert Scott:</span> what did the polar explorers discover in their travels, did they do it together?  Rather, it was a desperate competition for the right to reach the South Pole first.  In June 1910, Scott began an expedition to Antarctica.  He knew that he had a competitor, but did not attach much importance to the Amundsen expedition, considering him inexperienced.  But the main <span>discovery of the South Pole</span> in 1910-1912 belonged to the Norwegian. </p>

    <h2>  Roald Amundsen: what did he discover?  Summary of the South Pole Expedition </h2><p>  Scott made the main bet on the use of equipment - motor sledges.  Amundsen, applying the experience of the Norwegians, took with him a large team of dogs for riding in teams.  In addition, the Amundsen team consisted of excellent skiers, and Scott's crew did not pay enough attention to ski training. </p><p>  On February 4, Scott's team, reaching Whale Bay, suddenly saw their competitors.  The British, although they lost their fighting spirit, decided to continue the journey.  In addition to the fact that the team was shocked by the advent of the Amundsen expedition, insufficient preparation also played a role.  Their horses began to die, because for a long time they could not acclimatize.  Some of the snowmobiles crashed.  Scott realized that Amundsen‚Äôs bet on dogs was the best solution.  Despite the fact that Amundsen also suffered losses, on December 14, 1911 his team reached the South Pole. </p>
