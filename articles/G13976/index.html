    <h2>  Terminology </h2><p>  It‚Äôs worth starting with a consideration of the concept of cryonics.  It came from the Greek word Œ∫œÅœçŒøœÇ, which translates as "frost" or "cold."  This is a technology due to which the preservation of animals and people in a state of deep cooling is possible.  This is done in the hope that in the future they will be able to revive and even cure. </p><p>  However, to date, cryogenic freezing of people, as well as large animals, cannot be reversible.  This means that once ‚Äúpreserving‚Äù them, it will not be possible to revive in the future.  The same goes for the frozen brain and head.  Why?  Because the cryogenic freezing of a person occurs only after his legally recorded death.  Otherwise, it would be considered a murder. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But why then all this?  The fact is that some scientists believe that <span>brain death is</span> theoretically not final.  And they hope that one day the technology will reach a level of development that will revive such frozen people. </p><p>  Many actively support this idea.  In 2016, an open letter was written to support cryonics, and it was signed by 69 scientists from around the world.  But the very hypothesis regarding the possible recovery of information contained in the brain after death is considered unprovable. </p><h2>  Evidence of probability </h2><p>  Of course, no one would argue that cryogenic freezing of a person is possible without significant evidence. </p><p>  In 1966, for example, it was possible to prove that the brain restores electrical activity after freezing to -20 ¬∞ C.  In 1974, an experiment was conducted in which gray matter partially restored its activity after 7 years of storage under appropriate conditions. </p><p>  In 1984, it was proved that large organs are not exposed to structural damage during freezing.  And in 1986, scientists found out: large mammals can be brought back to life if they stay for three hours in a state of clinical death at a temperature of -3 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  In 2002, an experiment was conducted during which it turned out that the brain retains memory, even if it is cooled to -10 ¬∞ C.  In 2004, doctors successfully transplanted kidneys after they were frozen at -45 ¬∞ C and then warmed up. </p><p>  The next experiment, conducted in 2006, proved that complex neural connections maintain their vital activity even during vitrification (transition of a liquid into a glassy state). </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 2015, the world learned that an animal subjected to freezing and rebirth did not lose its memory.  In the same year, an experiment was conducted on the cryonization and restoration of the whole brain of a mammal.  Researchers assured: everything went perfectly. </p>

    <h2>  What do they think in our country? </h2><p>  The cryogenic <span>freezing of a person</span> in Russia is perceived by many as fraud.  This was repeatedly stated by the chairman of the commission of the Russian Academy of Sciences, dealing with the falsification of research and pseudoscience.  Many people consider freezing to be a commercial undertaking that has no scientific justification, as well as a fantasy that speculates on people's hopes and dreams of eternal life. </p><p>  But at the same time, there are supporters.  They say that now, of course, there are doubts about this, but in 30-50 years such opportunities may open up, thanks to which it will really be possible to restore a person from a frozen state.  And by the way, about 15% of Russians wouldn‚Äôt mind cryonizing themselves or their relatives - this was found out thanks to a survey conducted by the Levada Center. </p><h2>  KrioRus </h2><p>  12 years ago, a company called KrioRus was formed in Russia.  Their activity is cryogenic freezing.  That is, the storage of the bodies of their dead "patients" in liquid nitrogen.  Moreover, the company offers freezing of both the whole body and only the head. </p><p>  By the way, KrioRus is the only organization in Russia engaged in the freezing of pets.  To date, three birds (including a goldfinch and a titmouse), 2 cats, 6 cats, 7 dogs and 1 chinchilla are waiting for their future in their storehouse.  You need to really love your pet to decide on this.  Because the cryogenic freezing of an ordinary cat costs $ 12,000. </p><p>  The same price is set for the preservation of the human brain.  Freezing the whole body costs $ 36,000.  Also available is the so-called VIP-freezing in a <span>cryogenic chamber.</span>  The price of the issue is from $ 150,000.  Of the benefits - a cryo-bracelet, thanks to which a person's vital activity can be monitored.  When death occurs, a quick response team leaves the place.  There are still some ‚Äúadvantages‚Äù (if it is appropriate to speak in this context), but you can get acquainted with them individually. </p>

    <h2>  Training </h2><p>  Cryogenic freezing of the body is very complex, which is logical.  Therefore, preparation, involving the manufacture of special solutions, is extremely important.  If there is already a ready-made concentrate, then it will make 32 liters necessary for cryonizing the head. </p><p>  When the solution is ready, it is passed through vacuum sterilization, which is carried out using special filters.  Since cryogenic freezing is not very popular in Russia so far, all liquid substances are frozen until they need to be used.  When the ‚Äúpatient‚Äù appears, the solution is thawed and the procedure is started. </p><h2>  Next stage </h2><p>  The first thing that is done with the human body after death is to cool it to 0 ¬∞ C.  It is so important that if the ‚Äúclient‚Äù turned to specialists in advance, they recommend that he prepare ice packs.  After all, immediately after a person‚Äôs heart stops, the destruction of his body begins.  All processes previously responsible for maintaining life cease to work.  And to stop the destruction of the body is capable of either ice or a cooler of chemical origin. </p><p>  After that, specialists gain access to the circulatory system.  This is usually done either by a pathologist or a surgeon.  Or an expert of a company that provides a service such as cryogenic freezing. </p><p>  Photos that are publicly available today show that the procedure is very similar to a conventional therapeutic operation.  During its course, specialists gain access to the <span>jugular vein</span> and carotid artery.  On this, the second stage ends and the last begins - the most important. </p>

    <h2>  Connection system for perfusion </h2><p>  After all the previously described steps, special tubes are inserted into the arteries and veins of the body.  With their help, blood is removed from the body.  And the body is filled with a solution.  To control the process, use a device such as a refractometer.  With its help, it is possible to identify the percentage of concentration of the solution in the tank (which in this case is the body). </p><p>  60% - this is the degree of saturation established by specialists.  Once this indicator is reached, the procedure is completed.  Blood is completely replaced by solutions.  It is impossible to allow even its smallest part to remain in the body.  Because in this case, the processes of change will accelerate. </p><p>  Here, however, is the whole answer to the question of how cryogenic freezing occurs.  Then the body is placed in storage.  The operation itself lasts about 4 hours, 6 specialists work on the patient, including 2 surgeons and 4 assistants. </p><h2>  Procedure alive </h2><p>  Many are keenly interested in the question: "Is cryogenic freezing of a living person, not a dead one, possible?"  Well, one thing can be stated with certainty: at the moment this is not practiced.  At the beginning of the article it was already said that such a procedure is equivalent to murder.  But there is still more information. </p><p>  Many may think, they say, yes, revitalization seems possible if a living person were frozen.  However, this procedure is carried out with a dead body!  Doesn't that seem strange? </p><p>  Specialists have an answer.  They assure that there is no fundamental difference between the living and the dead in this context.  At the initial stage, for sure.  Because any person within 15 minutes after death is considered, in principle, alive - with the help of modern technologies he can be brought back to life.  And the claim that irreversible changes are beginning to occur in the brain is a myth.  In any case, specialists at cryocenters cite refutations in the form of complex scientific theories.  But all the same, while freezing a living person is impossible. </p><h2>  The youngest "patient" </h2><p>  In 2015, probably the most unusual cryogenic freezing of man was carried out.  A photo of the ‚Äúpatient‚Äù is provided below.  This is a 2 year old girl from Thailand named Mamin Naovaratpong.  She is the youngest person to have ever undergone such a specific ‚Äúpreservation‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="human cryogenic freezing in Russia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/1580070.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Baby died two years ago, 01/08/2015.  The cause was a brain tumor.  12 operations, 40 sessions of chemical and radiation therapy did not help.  But her parents, having frozen the girl‚Äôs body and brain (80% of the left hemisphere of which she had lost at the time of her death), strongly believe that Mother will ever be able to bring back to life.  The whole procedure cost her parents $ 280,000 + $ 700 annually for storage. </p><h2>  Non-standard fraud </h2><p>  In 2009, a very interesting case occurred.  Although the news sounded quite common: a fraudster from New York deceived investors in the amount of $ 5 million. </p><p>  But the point is this.  This man, whose name is Vileon Whose, somehow managed to convince investors that the money allocated to him, he invests in profitable foreign exchange funds, precious metals and oil.  However, he spent $ 150,000 to freeze the body of his wife, who also died in 2009, and everything else - to hide.  He was never found. </p><h2>  An example of startling enthusiasm </h2><p>  The photo below shows a 23-year-old neurological student named Kim Suozzi.  In the early 2010s, she was diagnosed with a terrible brain cancer.  What did the girl do?  I turned to social networks for help.  After telling her story, she began to raise money in order to freeze herself - until a cure for cancer or methods of 100% treatment of this disease were found. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cryogenic freezing of the body" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/1580071.jpg" width="459"></div>

    <p>  The campaign was a success.  The girl was helped to raise a huge amount - many futurists and even the Venturizm community participated in this.  On January 17, 2013, Kim fell into a state of clinical death.  On the same day, her body was cryopreserved. </p><h2>  Mass Cryonics Project </h2><p>  He exists.  But for now, this project only concerns animals.  What is the point?  In the implementation of prospects for the conservation of many animal species.  Even the store created specifically for this, it was decided to call the "Frozen Ark."  There are DNA of those animals that have already become extinct or are on the verge.  Scientists believe that thanks to genetic material and modern technology, it will be possible to clone non-existent species.  And this seems real, since a successful experiment was conducted in 2009. </p><p>  Spanish scientists have organized a very difficult experiment, as a result of which a cub of the Pyrenean mountain goat was born!  But this species completely disappeared in 2000.  The DNA of the last dead mammal was preserved - it was transferred to the egg of a domestic goat, devoid of its own genetic material.  Then the embryo was transplanted into the female of another subspecies of the Spanish Capricorn.  Such procedures were performed 439. Of these, only 7 ended in pregnancy, and one - in childbirth.  But the kid was sick and died due to breathing problems after 7 minutes.  Nevertheless, scientists do not lose hope and continue to improve their approaches and technologies. </p>

    <h2>  What are the prospects? </h2><p>  Specialists who know how cryogenic freezing occurs and continue to develop this area love to share their assumptions regarding the role of this procedure in the near future. </p><p>  They are sure: in order to restore a person as a person, only his brain will be needed.  Since it is a repository of memories, skills and knowledge.  As for modeling the body, it is a matter of technology and the wishes of the person himself.  And in order to find out what the ‚Äúclient‚Äù looked like, only one DNA cell taken from the brain would be enough.  Experts analyze it, reveal the appearance of a person, clone organs and bring the person back to life.  But all this is just an assumption of a probable future.  So far, a contract for 100 years has been preliminarily concluded with frozen patients.  But if until that moment no way of revitalization has been invented, the contract will automatically be extended to the time when it will be possible. </p><p>  In general, cryotechnologists are sure: there are prospects.  Perhaps this procedure is a step towards probable immortality.  But how everything will be in reality - time will tell. </p>
