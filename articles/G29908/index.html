  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Consumer value - as the main indicator of the capitalist system</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every day we all face the problem of choosing <span>goods and services,</span> preferring certain groups of goods to others.  Each person proceeds from their specific preferences to have this or that product, and also to use certain services.  As a result, we are all consumers of certain products, thanks to which we are able to satisfy our needs for food, clothing, various services and so on.  The usefulness of the product for society, as well as its ability to most fully satisfy a certain human need, is called consumer value, which is a red line through the entire economic doctrine of the capitalist system. </p><p>  Each product or service has its own price, because for its production a person spends certain resources in the form of labor, time and the realization of his abilities to benefit society.  That is why the world around us is a multitude of values, the amount of which is growing in direct proportion to the number of emerging services and goods.  In the economy, consumer value includes two main groups: </p><ol><li>  The cost of tangible goods. </li><li>  The cost of any service. </li></ol><p>  The last group, in which the cost of services is presented, has its own specifics, since its indicator just characterizes the degree of transition of society to post-industrial development.  It is today that consumer value is expanding and complemented by newer and more modern services, which distinguishes a highly developed state from lagging states.  Citizens of developed countries have more developed needs, as they are complemented by such new and interesting areas as tourism, outdoor activities, sports, travel and cultural activities.  Being at a high step in their development, citizens of Western Europe, the USA and Canada can afford to take a vacation several times a year and go on vacation, because their standard of living, as well as material security, fully satisfies all their basic needs.  Thus, with an increase in the level of development of the country, the consumer value of services also increases in direct proportion. </p><p>  It should also be noted that with the advent and active introduction of the latest computer technologies, completely new society needs in this area appear.  Examples of such intensive development are the growth of online stores, as well as computer games, without which many even adults simply cannot do.  The convenience of using remote access to your accounts in the banking sector has increased the consumer value of this segment of the financial market. </p><p>  Thus, consumer value is the ability of a certain product or group of goods to satisfy the needs of society to the fullest extent, and such a need necessarily includes a wide range of services.  Today, tens of thousands of marketers around the world are working to <span>identify the needs of</span> modern society, introducing new ideas in this regard.  Today we live in a global era of universal consumption, and supermarkets in which the <span>range of goods</span> can reach several tens of thousands of items serve as simple proof of this.  The consumer value of the goods directly depends on the degree of costs of its manufacture, therefore, mass conveyor production plays a positive role here, since it allows reducing the cost of production by an order of magnitude.  On the other hand, many exclusive items made by hand are of much greater value, since the cost of resources for its manufacture is quite large. </p>
