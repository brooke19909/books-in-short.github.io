You will find out what services the hotel provides and what tourists say about it. </p><h2>  Sahel and its ‚Äúpearl" (instead of entry) </h2><p>  Let's plunge a little into history.  The northern coast of Africa is a kingdom of eternal silence and endless sands.  However, on the narrow edge of the Mediterranean, the Sahara gives way to noisy oases and green lagoons.  They attracted mariners from distant lands.  For example, in the geographic region of the Sahel (where the Sahara comes into the savannah) there are bays converted by the Phoenicians and Greeks into colonies.  Their descendants formed the state of Carthage at the turn of the era.  The most picturesque part of it was located in the Hammamet Bay.  Now these are 2 Tunisian cities - Monastir and Sousse.  The latter is called the "pearl of the Sahel."  The hallmark of this place is the 4-star hotel-city SENSIMAR Scheherazade.  Hotel rating (according to professional critics) - 4.1. </p>

    <h2>  Tunisia's tourist charm </h2><p>  The ancient city-country was destroyed by the Romans almost to the foundation ... What remains of it is an item of high historical value. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, modern Tunisia (the "son" of Carthage) is also known to tourists for its climate.  The weather on the convenient outskirts of the desert is temperate, but it is surrounded by the heat of the southern subtropics.  Rains are rare even in winter, but in autumn the ratio of sea and air temperature is ideal ... </p><p>  Here the wild rose, hibiscus and bougainvillea are blooming.  Jerboas and eared foxes in the savannah frolic quite loudly ... Date palms and dazzling white sand of beaches are everywhere pleasing to the eye.  Therefore, this region has been looked after by Magic Life Corporation for its establishments - one of them is dedicated to an article - a truly fabulous Scheherazade Sensimar 4 *. </p><h2>  Comfort is Magic Life </h2><p>  The Magic Life hotels are distinguished by a high standard of service.  The German network is known for offering a combination of serene relaxation and active leisure.  Experienced tourists note that the maintenance of Magic Life hotels is delighted not only by unpretentious Sahel researchers.  It fully meets the needs of citizens who have arrived with children, newlyweds, students, pensioners ... </p><p>  Magic Life is a group of high-class club hotels that make holidays in Turkey, Egypt and Tunisia unforgettable.  This is due to the chic infrastructure, oriental atmosphere and the increased attentiveness of the staff: administrators, maids, waiters.  The cultural program is also of great importance ... </p><p>  Accommodation in the Magic Life hotels is easy to book on the corporate website or other online travel portals.  And now it's time to talk directly about Scheherazade Sensimar 4 *. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Location and History </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Scheherazade Sensimar 4 *</span> occupies a section of the northern half of Las Vegas Beach - the resort part of Sousse.  This sector is located almost in the middle of the agglomeration of the same name - on the first line.  The spacious territory of the hotel complex is adjacent to the buildings of ‚ÄúMarhab Salem‚Äù.  In the west, it borders on the busy Janvier Avenue, which separates fashionable shelters from the territory of the Olivier Clinic, as well as olive plantations to the north of it (by the way, the hotel is building No. 14 on this avenue). </p><p>  <span>Monastir Airport is</span> only 28 km from here, and 150 km from the center of the Tunisian capital.  At a distance of 40 km is the historic city of Enfida with antique ruins.  It also has an international airport. </p><p>  Apartments, successfully entered into the "pseudo-Moorish" buildings, appeared here as early as 1968. In 2013, after the buildings were acquired by Magic Life, a global renovation took place here.  The reconstruction of the premises (associated with the introduction of modern design elements and new technical amenities), however, did not affect the eastern image of Scheherazade.  She only attracted thousands of new customers here.  Until March 2015, the hotel was called Scheherazade Hotel Sousse. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  The architectural and landscape advantages of the hotel </h2><p>  In terms of territory, it resembles a semicircular masterpiece of park art.  High-rise buildings are like walls for low-rise buildings with luxury apartments.  Several buildings form an atrium.  Its central part is a large pool.  It is separated from the rest of the space by arched spans arranged in the Moorish style.  The pool has several branches, the ‚Äúbanks‚Äù of which are steps to the rooms of the highest class (they are connected with open verandas).  The external environment of the described ensemble is a well-groomed lawn with palm trees and many sidewalks leading to various local infrastructure facilities.  Separate buildings have their own baths. </p>

    <h2>  Description of rooms </h2><p>  Accommodation at the Sensimar Scheherazade <span data-mce-mark="1">ex Thomson Couples Sousse</span> 4 * hotel is divided into two categories - Standart and Lux ‚Äã‚ÄãSwim Up. </p><p>  The first type (there are options for single, double and family accommodation) is represented by rooms in high-rise buildings. </p><p>  In addition to standard amenities, Swim Up-rooms can have several rooms, additional Oriental-style furniture, a safe, a bar and a jacuzzi.  However, their main feature, as many guests note, is different.  They are located at the level of the main basin (or its ‚Äúchannels‚Äù).  Each of them becomes like an artificial lagoon - the steps of the open veranda lead directly into the water.  The lucky people living in the "paradise" side of the complex, right from here begin their journey through the territory of the "Scheherazade", using kayaks or canoes ... </p><p>  Regardless of the class of accommodation, the guest of Scheherazade Sensimar 4 * (Tunisia, Sousse) can count on: </p><ul><li>  an isolated bathroom with a shower; </li><li>  bed; </li><li>  stand; </li><li>  cupboard; </li><li>  TV with cable TV; </li><li>  free Internet; </li><li>  air conditioning; </li><li>  towels and toiletries; </li><li>  hair dryer. </li></ul><p>  Room cleaning is daily.  As many guests note, an additional visit to the maid is possible.  You just need to inform about your desire at the reception. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition Overview </h2><p>  Already at the entrance - at the reception - employees of the main restaurant L'Olivier treat customers with a glass of wine.  This fact most often appears in reviews ... </p><p>  The institution, located in a room decorated with a quaint oriental arcade, offers both a continental breakfast and a full board (three meals a day on the basis of a buffet).  In the second case, a ticket will cost a little more.  By the way, former guests claim that a package tour, including accommodation in S <span data-mce-mark="1">ensimar Scheherazade Couples 4 *</span> , is not so expensive ... For lunch and dinner, they often serve dishes of beef, lamb and chicken.  It is possible to order a diet menu.  People remembered a lot of oriental sweets (including those based on fresh fruits), as well as cakes and pastries ... In general, there is always something to eat here.  The products are all fresh, the prepared dishes are very tasty. </p><p>  In addition to this restaurant, the complex includes: </p><ul><li>  snack cafe (salads, desserts, fruits, sandwiches); </li><li>  snack bar "Culinary" (sweets and pizza); </li><li>  steak house (fried meat dishes); </li><li>  lobby bar in the main building (rich wine list, dozens of varieties of tea and coffee). </li></ul><p>  In the bars at the main pool, working around the clock, you can order any soft, strong or alcoholic drink. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Scheherazade Sensimar 4 * reviews receive often even enthusiastic.  Everything is thought out to the smallest detail.  They say that the hotel has its own beach area with a safe entry into the sea (this is very important for guests with small children).  Sun loungers and sun umbrellas are lined up in the early morning rows by the sea (unlike sunbeds by the pools, they are plastic, not wicker).  From some of the local "palaces" to go to the water no more than 100 meters.  The shore is constantly cleaned. </p><p>  In addition to countless pools, the Sensimar Scheherazade 4 * complex (Sousse) has two sports and a children's playground, a mini-golf course, ample free parking, an exchange office and a tour desk.  His employees book a trip to the desert with the Bedouins, an excursion to the ruins of Carthage or a transfer to any airport.  From the main hall you can easily go to: </p><ul><li>  a hairdresser; </li><li>  Laundry </li><li>  gym; </li><li>  massage room; </li><li>  bath (Turkish hammam); </li><li>  billiard room. </li></ul><p>  The staff providing most of the services speaks good Russian.  And this, as many tourists say, is a huge advantage, since there is no barrier to communication. </p><p>  A little aside you can even find a cinema and a mooring for kayaking and canoeing (actually ride through a system of communicating pools, imagining yourself somewhere in Venice). </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment in the complex </h2><p>  Music around the large pool (in the atrium) sounds 24 hours a day.  In this part of the fashionable shelter accommodate those who come without children and crave fun.  Around there are several bar counters supplying any alcohol at night.  In the afternoon, they give juices, mineral water and low alcohol beer.  Adults and children‚Äôs animators work on a spectacular cultural program in the sunlight. </p><p>  You came to rest with children and do not know where to go from your children?  At Scheherazade Sensimar Hotel Sousse 4 * they will not be bored.  After all, there are special clubs for children: ‚ÄúMini‚Äù (for kids up to 3 years old), ‚ÄúMagic Mungo‚Äù (for tomboys up to 6 years old), ‚ÄúClub Magic‚Äù (representatives of primary school age ‚Äúcome off‚Äù here) and ‚ÄúTeenage‚Äù.  Young guests are under the watchful eye of a responsible educator from the first day of your accommodation.  They are offered entertainment and sports programs, picnics on the seashore. </p><p>  During all the entertainment events the photographer works.  For a fee, you can buy joyful moments captured in the frame from him. <strong></strong></p><h2>  Sousse Attractions </h2><p>  Those who are tired of the Las Vegas hotel and beach in a few days can go outside the fence, take the local bus and come to the center of Susa.  For a walk, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe bazaar and the local mosque (Medina Susa with a kasbah and ribat), as well as the quarter near the Khalifa Tower (in the old city you can see the remains of the fortress wall and walk along the narrow streets) are perfect.  You need to drive only 2 kilometers, enjoying well-groomed roads, palm alleys, a noisy port and large transport interchanges. </p><p>  Sousse grew up on the site of the <span>Phoenician colony of</span> Gadrumet.  In the city center, artifacts from the Dar Essid exposition, exhibits of the Bordeaux Museum and the column remind of it. </p><h2>  Modern tales of Scheherazade (instead of conclusion) </h2><p>  Sensimar <span>Scheherazade Couples</span> <span>4 *</span> hotel offers special conditions for a family, cultural, educational and romantic getaway.  Judging by the numerous reviews of guests, it is quite suitable for organizing any large-scale event - from a business meeting to a wedding for one hundred people (open areas near the water, banquet and conference rooms are quite suitable for this).  It remains only to add that a vacation, holiday and even an ordinary business trip will bear the imprint of sunny bliss and Moorish luxury here.  They turn into another tale of Scheherazade ... </p>
