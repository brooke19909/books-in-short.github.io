This is due to the lack of sources affecting the very first period of the life of an outstanding commander. </p><h2>  Origin </h2><p>  According to the official biography, which appears in most textbooks and reference books, Mikhail Bogdanovich was born on December 16, 1761.  This happened on a small Lithuanian estate Pamusis.  This territory belonged to the Duchy of Courland, which was sub-vassal in relation to the Commonwealth.  In 1795, this region of Lithuania, together with the estate, became part of Russia, according to the third section of Poland. </p><p>  But long before this, the father took the child to be raised with relatives in <span>St. Petersburg.</span>  <span>Barclay de Tolly,</span> whose nationality can be interpreted in different ways, had Norman-German roots.  His ancestors moved to Riga from Germany.  Grandfather Michael was even the burgomaster of this city.  The father of the future commander served in the Russian army and retired with the rank of lieutenant and received noble status.  The boy‚Äôs family was called in the German manner - Michael Anders. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="barclay de tolly brief biography" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/1000632.jpg" width="345"></div>

    <h2>  The beginning of a military career </h2><p>  Barclay de Tolly, whose nationality did not prevent him from living in the Russian capital, received an excellent education, knew several European languages.  From childhood, he became interested in military theory.  This is not surprising, because the child was brought up in the house of his uncle, Colonel of the Novotroitsky cuirassier regiment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1776, the Pskov Carabinieri Regiment accepted new cadets into its ranks.  Among them was the young Barclay de Tolly.  A brief biography of him says that the promotion of a young man at a rapid pace.  In the Finnish J√§ger Corps, the newly minted captain became adjutant to General Victor Amadeus of Anhalt-Bernburg.  It was a distant relative of Empress Catherine II. </p><p>  In 1787, another war broke out with the Ottoman Empire, in which Barclay de Tolly took part.  A brief biography of him included information about the assault on Ochakov, where the officer received a real battle hardening.  For participation in it, M. B. Barclay de Tolly was awarded his first orders. </p><p>  In 1789, the major took part in fierce battles with the Turks.  Then the prince of Anhalt-Bernubrsky, together with his adjutant, was transferred to the Finnish army.  She already fought against the Swedes with might and main (war of 1788-1790).  In one of the assaults, Victor Amadeus was mortally wounded, after which M. B. Barclay de Tolly was transferred to the capital. </p><p>  Then, in 1791, the officer married his cousin Elena.  Their family had several children, but only one son did not die in infancy (Ernst). </p><h2>  Service under Alexander I </h2><p>  Barclay de Tolly, whose brief biography tells of numerous transfers, continued to faithfully serve the Russian army.  In the 90s of the 18th century, he participated in the suppression of Polish uprisings led by Kosciuszko.  At the end of the <span>reign of Paul I,</span> he became a major general. </p><p>  At this time, the Napoleonic Wars began.  The young emperor <span>Alexander I</span> joined the next <span>anti-French coalition.</span>  The 1805 campaign found Mikhail Bogdanovich in the army of General Leonty Bennigsen.  This formation did not manage to come to the rescue of the main parts of Kutuzov near Austerlitz.  Therefore, Michael Barclay de Tolly returned to Russia, without having seen the crushing defeat of the Allied army. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Failure did not break Alexander's desire to defeat Napoleon.  Literally a year later, the war of the fourth coalition began, when Prussia attacked France, and eventually Berlin fell.  Russian units went to the rescue of the Germans. </p><p>  In February 1807, Barclay de Tolly participated in the Battle of Preisis Eilau.  Together with Bagration, he led the rearguard of the Russian army, which was hit by the corps of Sult and Murat.  Mikhail Bogdanovich was wounded in the right leg, after which he went to Memel for treatment. </p><p>  Here in April of that year, he met with Alexander I, who at that time was trying to diplomatically mitigate the defeat from Napoleon.  The officer first proposed to the emperor to use scorched earth tactics.  With her, the enemy cut himself off from his own rear with provisions and resources.  At the same time, the enemy had to act on the territory plundered and devoid of infrastructure.  As it turned out in the future, it was precisely this tactic that yielded results in the Patriotic War of 1812. </p><h2>  Finnish war </h2><p>  According to the <span>Tilsit world,</span> Russia divided Europe with France into zones of influence.  This allowed Alexander to send an army to Finland to take it away from Sweden.  Barclay de Tolly, whose brief biography already included many campaigns, was sent to Cupio.  His corps took this city and held an important point in spite of several assaults of the enemy. </p><p>  After that, the officer with his Vasky corps walked along the ice of the Kvarken Strait and took the defenseless Swedish Umea.  This confirmed the final victory of Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Michael Barclay de Tolly" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/1000635.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Thanks to his successes, Barclay de Tolly became the Governor-General of Finland and then Minister of War.  His quick take-off could not please the envious who saw only an upstart in the opponent.  Moreover, Michael had German roots, which did not benefit him in the future. </p><h2>  Patriotic War of 1812 </h2><p>  When Napoleon attacked Russia in 1812, Mikhail Bogdanovich commanded the First Western Army.  He had to retreat in order to lead the enemy inland, where he would be weakened and cut off from his homeland.  In Smolensk, he teamed up with the army of Bagration, who soon began to accuse Barclay de Tolly of inability to lead the army. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Barclay de Tolly Monument" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/1000640.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  As a result, the general command was transferred to Mikhail Kutuzov.  In the Battle of Borodino, the officer led the right wing of the army.  When the fate of the capital was decided, Barclay de Tolly was among those who voted to leave Moscow. </p><p>  When a turning point occurred and the Russian army launched a counterattack, the commander received leave, including due to the fact that in the Winter Palace many of his colleagues undeservedly scolded the "German". </p><h2>  Last years </h2><p>  After World War II, Barclay de Tolly participated in a foreign campaign.  He visited many battles, including the ‚Äúbattle of the peoples‚Äù near Leipzig.  For success and loyal service, he became count and field marshal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="barclay de tolly nationality" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/1000633.jpg" width="371"></div>

    <p>  In 1818, the hero of our story asked for a vacation in German mineral waters in order to heal.  However, he did not manage to reach the goal and died on the road to <span>East Prussia</span> on May 14 (26).  The field marshal was buried with all honors, and his ashes buried in a family estate in the Baltic.  The first monument to Barclay de Tolly appeared already in 1823.  At the expense of his widow, a mausoleum was erected, which was plundered during the Second World War. </p>
