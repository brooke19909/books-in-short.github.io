A beautiful metropolis with centuries of history harmoniously combines modern buildings with <span>cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãthat have</span> survived to this day. </p><p>  A huge number of tourists dreaming of a memorable vacation visit the capital of the country of cruel bullfighting and passionate flamenco, the gentle sun and the azure sea. </p><h2>  The history of the ancient city </h2><p>  The city, founded in 858, at first was a huge fortress, over the construction of which the Moors worked.  The historical roots of the name of the capital of Spain originate from the small river Manzanares, which the builders in their own way called Al-Majrit (in translation - "source of water").  During the <span>Crusades, the</span> defenses were conquered by the Castilians.  Over time, Madrid becomes a transit point for hunting-loving kings. </p><p>  In the settlement, which was granted many privileges, about five thousand people lived in the 15th century.  In 1561, the royal court was transferred to Madrid, since that time the capital is considered the main city of the country. </p><h2>  Golden age </h2><p>  After receiving a new status, migrants rush here, and the population grows to 60 thousand people.  During the reign of Philip III and Philip IV, Spain is experiencing a real golden age.  Madrid, bathed in luxury, is famous for outstanding results in the field of theater, painting and literature.  Cervantes, Velazquez, Rubens, <span>Lope de Vega</span> lived and worked in the city <span>,</span> leaving their descendants a huge cultural heritage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain Madrid" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1194664.jpg" width="600"></div>

Travelers are equally friendly welcomed by the country of kings - Spain.

Reviews of tourists about the park, which is an object of cultural heritage, are only enthusiastic. </p><p>  About 150 years ago, the vast territory on which the kings built new pavilions and broke flower beds was nationalized.  Green alleys of the park are decorated with <span>unusual fountains.</span>  One of them - ‚ÄúFallen Angel‚Äù - is dedicated to the expulsion of the devil from paradise, and this is the only monument to Lucifer in the whole world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in madrid" class="if" height="226" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1194671.jpg" width="600"></div>
