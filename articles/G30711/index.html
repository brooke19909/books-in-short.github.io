    <p>  By rail from <span>Moscow to Anapa, the</span> distance is 1600-1900 kilometers.  This significant variation is due to the fact that there are several existing routes.  Of course, all vacationers are concerned about how much to travel by train from Moscow to Anapa.  The minimum travel time is 1 day and 4 hours.  Try to figure out what to do on a long journey in advance.  A lot of vacationers come to the Krasnodar Territory from the Northern capital.  From St. Petersburg to Anapa, the distance by rail is about 2500 km.  Accordingly, the travel time will be about 2 days, the minimum trip duration is 1 day 20 hours.  The train overcomes the Anapa-Petersburg route in such a time, taking into account the short parking at the stations.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to travel by train from Moscow to Anapa" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/876806.jpg"></div>  There is no railway station in the resort town.  It is believed that the station was specially moved outside Anapa for the sake of calm tourists.  The nearest platform is in the village of <span>Upper Dzhemete.</span>  Trains from 250 cities of our country come here.  If for some reason you cannot get tickets for the required date, try to book a seat on the train to the Tunnel railway station.  It is still 35 kilometers from Anapa, but there is regular public transport, you can take a taxi.  Do not be afraid of possible difficulties - a huge number of tourists travel this route annually.  There will be no problems with luggage - there are always movers at the station, and all types of transport that goes to Anapa are equipped with luggage compartments.  If it seems to you that the train to Anapa takes a long time, try to consider other options.  You can also go on vacation by bus or plane.  And some vacationers even prefer to go on vacation in their own car.

    <p>  Anapa train station is located 6 kilometers from the city itself, in the village of <span>Verkhnee Dzhemete.</span>  Attention: this is a dead end transport terminal that operates only during the holiday season.  In winter, you can get to Anapa by train on the Novorossiysk branch - to the Tunnel station.  Today, the station in Verkhny Dzhemet is a modern two-story complex.  On its territory there are recreation areas, cafeterias and shops.  This terminal was included in the project of the Russian Railways ‚ÄúSmart Station‚Äù.  And this means that it uses all the most modern life support and security systems.  It has a central control station, and modern energy saving technologies are also applied here - solar panels are installed, LED lighting.  In addition to the standard waiting room and lounges for passengers, the territory has comfortable rooms.  Anapa station will delight all vacationers with its southern flavor.  Here you will be met by porters, taxi drivers and local residents who rent out housing.  At the same time, life at the station does not freeze even for a second at any time of the day. </p><h2>  Useful tips for tourists </h2><p>  Passenger trains consist of two types of cars: reserved seats and coupes.  In the first case, on the way, all passengers are located in a common space without additional partitions.  The compartment car is more comfortable, it is divided into "rooms", each of which accommodates 4 people.  Of course, tickets of the second type are much more expensive.  But it is incredibly convenient.  For example, if you go on vacation with your whole family or company, you can purchase tickets in one compartment and enjoy the company of your closest people all the way. </p>
