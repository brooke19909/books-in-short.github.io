    <p>  From the beginning of the ninth century, the Great Moravian Empire began its development and increased influence in Europe.  Thanks to Charles 4, under whose rule Bohemia was in the second half of the 14th century, the Czech Republic significantly strengthened its political position.  Karl himself became not only the king of Bohemia, but also the emperor of the Great Roman Empire.  During his reign significant cultural changes took place.  Founded by King Charles, the university is the oldest in Central Europe. </p><p>  In 1918, the independent Czechoslovak Republic was proclaimed, which lasted until 1990, in which it was divided into the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic.  Already in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia became independent states. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Purpose of the trip </h2><p>  Cultural and historical sights, many of which have been preserved in their original form, attract hundreds of millions of tourists annually to this amazing country.
