    <h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  In a broad sense, the concept of communication is associated with the implementation of changes, the impact on activities to achieve the prosperity of the company.  In a narrow sense, its purpose is to achieve an accurate understanding by the receiving party of the message sent to it.  Means, forms of communication are very diverse.  Together, they form a fairly complex and multi-level system. </p><h2>  Classification of Communications </h2><p>  It is carried out according to various criteria.  Types of communication are distinguished by the composition of the participants.  So it can be mass, group and interpersonal.  Types of communication distinguish depending on: </p><ol><li>  The method of establishing and maintaining contact.  According to this criterion, direct (immediate) and distance (indirect) communications are distinguished. </li><li>  The initiative of the participants.  On this basis, passive and active interactions are distinguished. </li><li>  The degree of organization of the exchange of information.  This criterion makes it possible to distinguish between organized and random communications. </li><li>  Used sign systems.  On this basis, non-verbal and verbal interactions are distinguished. </li></ol><p>  In addition, there are <span>forms of communication.</span>  <span>Interaction</span> can be carried out in the form of discussions, negotiations, briefings, meetings, meetings, <span>discussions, business</span> correspondence, receptions on personal issues, press conferences, telephone conversations, presentations, and so on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="main forms of communication" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1415262.jpg" width="433"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Interpersonal Information Exchange </h2><p>  A prerequisite for successful communication of this type is the creation by the participants of a common reality, beyond which the interaction cannot take place at all.  This premise is called by researchers the contractual aspect of exchange.  The main forms of communication and their effectiveness are determined by the parameters of individuals.  The key ones are functional, motivational and cognitive signs.  The latter includes various characteristics through which the inner world of the personality is formed during the accumulation of cognitive experience.  It is, in particular, knowledge of communicative codes, self-awareness, self-observation, metacommunicative skills, the ability to adequately assess the capabilities of a partner.  These characteristics should also include prejudices and myths, beliefs and stereotypes. </p><p>  The motivational parameter is determined by the needs of individuals.  If they are absent, then, accordingly, there is no interaction or pseudo-communication is present.  The functional indicator includes 3 characteristics.  They determine the competence of the individual.  Such characteristics are the practical possession of verbal and non-verbal communicative means, the ability to build discourse in accordance with the rules of etiquette and code norms. </p><h2>  Group interaction </h2><p>  It arises in the process of direct communication of a small number of entities that know each other well and constantly exchange information.  The lower limit of such communication is usually a dyad or triad.  The first involves the interaction of two, and the second - three individuals.  The upper limit will depend on the nature of the group.  All forms of communication in the group, except informative, realize other functions.  For example, in interactions, consent is formed, unity of action is ensured, a certain culture is formed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="means of communication" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1415263.jpg" width="378"></div>

They can be centralized or decentralized.  In the first case, the subject spreads information important for the group around him.  Centralized networks are divided into: </p><ol><li>  Frontal.  Within the framework of such a system, the participants do not come into contact, however, they are within sight of each other. </li><li>  Radial.  In such a system, information is transmitted to group members through a central entity. </li><li>  Hierarchical.  These structures involve two or more levels of subordination of participants. </li></ol><p>  In decentralized networks, group members are equal.  Each participant can receive, process and transmit data, communicate directly with other subjects.  Such a system can be in the form of: </p><ol><li>  Chains.  Within this structure, information is distributed sequentially from participant to participant. </li><li>  Circle.  Under such a system, all group members have the same opportunities.  Information can be circulated endlessly between participants, updated, supplemented. </li></ol><p>  A decentralized data exchange system can be complete.  In this case, there are no obstacles to free interaction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ways of communication" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1415264.jpg" width="431"></div>

    <h2>  Specificity </h2><p>  The choice of one or another network will depend on the form of communication, the goals of data exchange.  It is advisable to transmit information through centralized systems when information should be conveyed to all people, it is necessary to rally participants organizationally, and stimulate leadership development.  Meanwhile, it is worth noting that in the framework of centralized networks, the implementation of creative and complex tasks is significantly more difficult.  Frequent use of such systems can help reduce the satisfaction of subjects from participation in the group.  To solve creative and complex problems, decentralized networks are used in practice.  They are also effective for increasing the satisfaction of participants, the development of interpersonal relationships. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Exchange of information in the organization </h2><p>  The process of interaction in the company can be divided into planned (formal) dissemination of information and informal (unplanned) data transfer.  In the first case, standard forms (forms) are used.  Communications in this case will take relatively little time.  The use of standard forms provides a number of advantages for the recipient of information.  In particular, the subject can clarify the category of information that he needs in his work.  A key disadvantage of this form of communication is the lack of flexibility. </p><h2>  Informal interaction </h2><p>  Often, information on indirect channels is transmitted at a very high speed.  Informal communication networks are also called rumor channels.  At the same time, the confidence of the participants in the interaction in informal sources is often higher than in official ones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="communication as a form of communication" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1415265.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Areas of data exchange </h2><p>  Communication processes can be divided into two large areas: internal and external.  The first involves interaction within the enterprise.  External communication is a system of relations of the structure with third parties.  In both areas, different data exchange channels can be used. </p><h2>  Information Flow Directions </h2><p>  On this basis, communications are divided into vertical and horizontal.  The first, in turn, include upward and downward flows of information.  In the latter case, the information flow moves from one level to another, lower.  An example is the interaction of a manager with subordinates.  The upward direction of the transfer of information is used to provide feedback to employees with the boss.  Such communication methods are used to bring tasks to subordinates, informing management about work results and current problems.  The horizontal direction involves the interaction of participants of equal rank, as well as equivalent groups. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="communication features" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1415266.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Mass information exchange </h2><p>  It is carried out using technical means.  Information is distributed to dispersed and large in number of audiences.  <span>Mass communications</span> are also characterized by: </p><ol><li>  The social significance of the information. </li><li>  The possibility of choice and multi-channel communication. </li></ol><p>  The participants in this interaction are not individuals, but collective entities.  For example, it can be an army, people, government.  The social significance of such an exchange of information is in accordance with specific social expectations and requests. </p><p>  Mass interaction, especially in modern times, is characterized by multichannelism.  In particular, audio, visual, audio-visual, written, oral forms of communication are used.  The sender of the data is a social institution or a mythologized subject.  Target groups act as recipients, which are united according to a number of socially significant signs. </p><h2>  Mass Interaction Functions </h2><p>  The following <span>communication tasks are distinguished</span> : </p><ol><li>  Informational.  This function consists in providing the mass listener, viewer, and reader with relevant data on various fields of activity. </li><li>  Regulatory.  Mass data exchange influences the formation of consciousness of an individual and a group, public opinion, the creation of stereotypes.  This allows you to control <span>social behavior.</span>  People usually accept the ethical requirements, norms, principles that are promoted in the media as a positive stereotype of clothing style, lifestyle, communication, etc. This is how a person socializes in accordance with the standards that are preferred at this historical stage. </li><li>  Cultural  This function involves acquainting society with the achievements of art and culture.  It contributes to the awareness of the need for continuity of values ‚Äã‚Äãand the preservation of traditions. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="classification of communications" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1415267.jpg" width="400"></div></li></ol><h2>  QMS </h2><p>  In mass communication, special means are used, which are channels and transmitters through which information spreads over large areas.  The modern system includes several links.  In particular, the QMS includes the media, computer science and telecommunications.  The first include the press, audiovisual channels (radio, teletexts, etc.), information services.  Media consist of technical means of recording, replication, copying, storing data, as well as the constant, systematic distribution of large volumes of musical, verbal, figurative information. </p>
