The term ‚Äúcredit history‚Äù was first heard by Russians only at the end of 2004.  It was in December of this year that the relevant law entered into force.  Each bank, giving you a loan, wants to make sure that in the past you faithfully fulfilled all your obligations.  How to get a loan if the credit history is bad? </p><h2>  What is a credit history? </h2><p>  Now all the information about the loans you have ever taken is stored in one place - the Central Bureau of Credit Histories. </p><p>  Even the lack of a credit history can serve as a basis for the bank to refuse you.  True, in this case, the bank will take into account other criteria.  And if in the past you allowed late payments, then getting a loan on acceptable terms becomes almost impossible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tengrinews.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="banks take a loan with bad credit history" class="if uuid-2639090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/2639090.jpg"></div><p>  How to get a loan if the credit history is bad?  In reality, few people have it perfect.  There are different situations: they made a mistake with the details, the bank delayed the transfer, later they paid out their salaries, they simply forgot to make the payment on time. </p><p>  Some banks are ready to turn a blind eye to such violations if the delay has not exceeded two weeks and they have happened occasionally. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, with more serious violations, you are most likely to be blacklisted.  And even get a loan to buy some product does not work. </p><h2>  Why check your credit history annually? </h2><p>  Imagine the following situation.  You go to the bank, and for no reason you are denied a loan.  You do not know what is going on.  It seems that the income is suitable, and for other parameters you formally go through, but the bank refuses you. </p><p>  How to get a loan if the credit history is bad, but not your fault? </p><p>  Checking your own credit history is the first thing you need to do in this situation.  It happens that about 5 years ago you already took a loan and delayed the next payment, but just forgot about it.  And the bank then blacklisted you. </p><p>  However, it happens in a different way.  All people are wrong.  It is possible that incorrect information was entered into <span>the credit bureau</span> by mistake.  In this case, the situation is easy to correct - for this you only need to provide supporting documents from the bank. </p><h2>  How to check your credit history? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gobankingrates.com" data-author=": Jacob Lundl, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Check your credit history online" class="if uuid-2618922" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2618922.jpg"></div><p>  The main reason for poor credit history is delinquency.  How to get a loan in this case?  At the end of the article you will find the only legal way to rectify the situation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, the first step is to get a report on your credit history.  You can do this in the following ways: </p><ul><li><p>  online (about 10 services are presented on the Internet, for a small fee, they send requests to all the main BKIs within a few minutes); </p></li><li><p>  to the Bureau of Credit Histories (every citizen 1 time per year has the right to personally contact the Bureau of Credit Histories for free, you will have to pay for repeated consultations). </p></li></ul><p>  Remember, it is almost impossible to take a loan if the credit history is bad - both through your fault and as a result of an error.  Therefore, you need to at least know about this.  And then think what to do. </p><h2>  Banks: you can try to get a loan with bad credit history </h2><p>  If your story is imperfect, it is still possible to get a loan from a bank, but only on bail or for certain purposes.  With small delays, you can still count on: </p><ul><li><p>  mortgage loan secured by acquired property; </p></li><li><p>  car loan secured by the purchased car; </p></li><li><p>  consumer credit secured by real estate or car; </p></li><li><p>  purchase on credit of some goods in the store. </p></li></ul><p>  And another way to get a loan with bad credit history is to take the credit card that the bank offers you.  Often, Sberbank offers such products to its payroll clients. </p><h2>  Mortgage loan secured by acquired property </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dnaindia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Real estate loan" class="if uuid-2618912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2618912.jpg"></div><p>  Everything is clear here.  You make a down payment, the bank gives you a mortgage loan for the remainder of the amount.  Moreover, the apartment will be confiscated in its entirety if you violate your obligations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The first installment in this case is unlikely to be lower than 30%, and you should not count on the minimum interest rate.  After all, the bank assumes a certain risk: since in the past you have already violated the agreement, it is highly likely that this will happen again. </p><p>  In this case, the bank sells your property at auction.  Moreover, significantly lower than the market price.  Here is your down payment and will serve as the discount that will allow the bank in any case not to stay on the loser. </p><p>  Get cash does not work.  After all, real estate during the entire duration of the loan agreement will be pledged to the bank. </p><h2>  Car loan secured by the purchased car </h2><p>  Another program that will allow you to get money, even if your credit history is imperfect.  In general, it is similar to the previous one, but here the purchased car acts as the object of the pledge. </p><p>  However, in this way you will not be able to receive cash, as in the previous case.  Nevertheless, the car can be leased with the right to purchase for the duration of the loan agreement. </p><p>  The main thing is to make monthly payments on time.  Otherwise, you may find yourself in a situation where you are left without money, without a car, and even in debt. </p><p>  The easiest way to get a loan with bad credit history in Moscow is that the income level of the population is much higher than in the regions. </p><h2>  A loan secured by your property or car </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.makaan.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Secured loan" class="if uuid-2618925" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2618925.jpg"></div><p>  This is the easiest way to take a cash loan with a bad credit history.  However, it has a significant drawback - you must already own a car or real estate. </p><p>  If you violate your obligations, the pledged item will be sold by the bank at the auction.  Moreover, you can still have to stay as a result.  Therefore, it is important to soberly assess the possible risks and your ability to pay the loan in advance. </p><h2>  Credit for the purchase of a product in a store </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.loansolutions.ph" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="MFI loan" class="if uuid-2618916" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2618916.jpg"></div><p>  Urgently taking a loan with bad credit history will help a regular store purchase.  The scheme is simple.  You buy a product by making a down payment.  The remaining amount to the store is paid for by the partner bank, providing a loan.  And the intermediary immediately buys from you this product for cash.  True, with a discount of 20-30%.  But you get the money. </p><p>  Not only will you lose about 30% of the cost, but also the interest on such a loan will be the highest (up to 50-60% per annum) - because the bank in this case assumes the maximum risks.  But there are situations when such a loan is the only way out. </p><h2>  Overview of banks, conditions and interest rates </h2><p>  Secured by property, a loan can be obtained in almost every bank, even with small delays in the past.  In this case, the bank risks almost nothing - it will return its money in any situation (except for force majeure related to damage or destruction of the collateral, but there is insurance in this case).  However, the interest rate on such loans is low - 12 - 20% per annum). </p><p>  But to get a commodity loan is already more difficult.  Here the bank risks significantly - the risk is about 20% (according to the official statistics of the National Bureau of Credit Histories).  In other words, every fifth borrower has problems with repaying such a loan.  But you can earn much more on this - up to 60% per annum. </p><p>  Which banks go for it?  The three leaders of express lending: </p><ul><li><p>  "OTP Bank". </p></li><li><p>  Home Credit. </p></li><li><p>  "Renaissance Credit". </p></li></ul><h2>  What conditions will be offered to the borrower? </h2><p>  Most likely, you will be offered several lending programs to choose from. </p><p>  Requirements for the borrower: </p><ul><li><p>  citizenship of the Russian Federation; </p></li><li><p>  age from 21 years to 69 years; </p></li><li><p>  availability of permanent registration. </p></li></ul><p>  The conditions will be approximately as follows: </p><ul><li><p>  amount - from 2,000 to 300,000 rubles; </p></li><li><p>  term - from 3 to 36 months; </p></li><li><p>  down payment - from 0 to 80%; </p></li><li><p>  interest rate - from 20 to 60% per annum; </p></li><li><p>  document - passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation. </p></li></ul><p>  Yes, this is not a mistake.  Today, such a loan can really be obtained with a passport, no additional documents will be required.  In particular, OTP Bank allows taking a loan with bad credit history in Novosibirsk. </p><p>  However, not all so simple.  When filling out a loan application, be prepared to provide: </p><ul><li><p>  landline phone number at the place of residence; </p></li><li><p>  landline phone number at the place of work; </p></li><li><p>  3 valid mobile phone numbers of colleagues; </p></li><li><p>  mobile phone numbers and addresses of immediate relatives. </p></li></ul><p>  According to these numbers, employees of the bank's call center will call and verify the information that you have indicated about yourself.  In addition, the bank security service will look for you at the indicated addresses and phone numbers if you violate your obligations.  Also, all this data can be transferred to employees of a collection agency if your debt is sold. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.0564.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="take a bad credit loan urgently" class="if uuid-2639067" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/2639067.jpg"></div><h2>  Alternative ways to get a loan </h2><p>  Sometimes the <span>credit history is</span> so <span>damaged</span> that it is not even possible to get an express loan from a bank.  This usually happens when banks blacklist you.  This means that your credit rating is below the lowest possible level.  This happens when you do not pay a loan for several months. </p><p>  How to be in this case?  There are organizations that are not so scrupulous about deadlines as banks.  These are MFIs (microfinance organizations) and private investors. </p><p>  This is a good and often the only way to urgently take a loan with bad credit history.  In this situation, lenders take substantially greater risks.  They don‚Äôt care about your credit history.  The main thing is that there are no open delinquencies.  However, you will not get a significant amount here, except on bail. </p><h2>  Microfinance Organizations (MFIs) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.realdetroitweekly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Payment of the money" class="if uuid-2618909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2618909.jpg"></div><p>  As a rule, such organizations are ready to offer up to 30,000 rubles without collateral.  And the first time you are unlikely to approve more than 5,000 rubles.  If you return them on time, the credit limit will increase. </p><p>  Such companies neutralize their risks with a high interest rate - up to 2% per day.  On the Internet, you can even find MFIs offering loans at 3-4% per day.  But this is more an exception than a rule.  On average, such companies are ready to offer you money for 0.5-1% per day. </p><p>  And late fines are predatory at all.  Previously, it was worth delaying payments for a month, and it was almost impossible to pay.  Today the situation has changed for the better, but this money is still very expensive. </p><p>  The state has tried to legislatively limit the appetites of MFIs.  Thus, from January 1, 2017, MFIs cannot accrue interest if they are 3 times higher than the ‚Äúbody‚Äù of the loan.  Simply put, having a loan of 10,000 rubles, you will not pay an MFI more than 40,000 rubles, no matter what the interest rate was originally set.  Fines have also been imposed.  Now they can not exceed twice the amount of overdue debt. </p><p>  However, <span>they wanted the best, but it turned out as always.</span>  Now MFIs simply will not give you a loan for a period of more than 3 months.  Moreover, if you do not make a single payment, the amount for these 3 months will increase 5 times. </p><p>  Yes, she will not be able to grow indefinitely, as before.  But even 500% in 3 months will give modern moneylenders quite ‚Äúnot sour‚Äù 2,000% per annum, and even more when reinvesting the income received. </p><p>  Here you need to be as careful and soberly assess the risks.  They took 10,000, and you can pay up to 50,000 rubles.  Here is the math. </p><h2>  Private lending </h2><p>  There are also individuals who are ready to offer you money on loan.  Similar ads can be easily found on the Internet.  There is no state regulation in this market.  Interest rates, amounts and terms are unlimited.  As the parties agree, so be it. </p><p>  Moreover, the terms of the transaction are often dictated by the lender.  Indeed, such proposals are used only as a last resort, when all other options have been exhausted. </p><p>  Paying off such loans is often even more difficult than repaying debts to microfinance companies.  However, most likely, no one will check your credit history. </p><h2>  How to fix a credit history </h2><div class="photo" data-original="studentloans.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to fix a credit history?" class="if uuid-2618918" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72621/2618918.jpg"></div><p>  If you are offered to change information about your credit history in the BKI for money, be aware that you are fraudsters.  To do this is even theoretically impossible.  Think for yourself: can one person have access to the database of the bank, BKI and TsBKI at the same time?  But what about those people who check and double-check this data, comparing it with each other? </p><p>  It is very difficult, but theoretically it is possible to crack the database of a bank or a specific BKI.  Or bribe a specific employee.  But even theoretically it is impossible to hack or bribe the whole system.  Therefore, the fraudster will simply take your prepayment from you and disappear. </p><p>  Nevertheless, it is quite possible to correct CI (credit history), moreover, by legal means.  This works even if you are blacklisted.  Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do this: </p><ol><li><p>  Redeem all current arrears and fines. </p></li><li><p>  Undergo rehabilitation - there are special programs of banks that can improve credit rating.  The most famous is the ‚ÄúCredit Doctor" of Sovcombank. </p></li><li><p>  Buy on credit some inexpensive goods. </p></li></ol><p>  Naturally, no more violations of one‚Äôs obligations can be allowed.  The second chance is given only 1 time.  If everything goes smoothly, in about 2 years your credit history will improve significantly, and you can count on a new loan. </p>
