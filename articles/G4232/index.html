    <h2>  Landscapes of Koktebel </h2><p>  Exclusive only for guests of the Lex Hotel (Koktebel), excursions to <span>the Kara-Dag nature reserve,</span> closed to other vacationers, are conducted.  This is one of the most picturesque places of Crimea with a unique fauna and flora.  One hundred twenty-five representatives of the fauna are listed in the Red Book.  On Kara-Dag you can see European roe deer, wild boars, black neck, <span>stone marten</span> and many other animals.  Guests visit a research biostation with a guided tour.  Flora especially rejoices in these places.  The hills are dressed in eight types of feather grass, as if covered with the fur of some fairy-tale beast, on which are a mass of flowers and relict trees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The only volcano of the Jurassic period, which has survived almost the whole, is worth such a not too easy walk.  <span>Hotel "Lex" (Koktebel)</span> provides such an opportunity to its visitors.  This is an ideal place for lovers of hiking, for yoga, as there are more and more ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù ones, and they claim that Koktebel is full of ‚Äúplaces of power‚Äù.  Tourists "Lex" (Koktebel) consider the most incredible place in the beauty of nature from all the most famous corners of the Crimea: amazingly beautiful bay, slopes twined with vine, centuries-old pine trees.  Not far from the hotel is a factory of cognacs and vintage wines, shining with a golden light in the sunset rays.  And although the Lex Hotel instills a healthy lifestyle for visitors, Koktebel and Golden Gate are among the drinks that are worth trying. </p>

    <h2>  For adults </h2><p>  How to explain that Lex is a club?  Koktebel has hotels of various orientations, but such a well-thought-out program of rest is not everywhere.  This hotel has an active leisure club, and this is horseback riding around Koktebel, in its most beautiful places, it‚Äôs access to the sea under real scarlet sails, like in a favorite fairy tale, and the most daring adventurers and adrenaline lovers ride mountain bikes and paraglide and gliders. </p><p>  From seven in the morning until eleven in the evening you can relax in the pool.  Nearby is a bar, a summer terrace of the restaurant, from where only atmospheric music flows.  Vacationers especially like the separate hydromassage zone, because there you can truly relax and recharge your batteries.  The decision to open this unique club-hotel "Lex" (Koktebel) came to the creators here not by chance.  Three climatic zones intersect at this point - mountain, steppe and sea, so the most different types of outdoor activities can be combined during one vacation.  They do not just devote time to their hobbies, they acquire new ones here.  Professionals in the process of mastering beginners oversee and instruct, as well as support, the accomplished athletes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel lex cocktail reviews" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1408239.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Earth, sky and seabed </h2><p>  This region seems to be created specifically for all types of outdoor activities.  Riding ATVs is one sheer pleasure: fields and mountains, moist valleys and dry steppes, ravines and forests.  Impressions are unforgettable!  Routes are made of any complexity and range - depending on experience.  You can come with your ATVs, they will be taken care of here.  There is a parking lot and a service workshop. </p><p>  Of course, aeronautics occupies a special place in the club-hotel.

The famous <span>Klementyev Mountain</span> is in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, which allows you to closely engage in hang gliding and paragliding with visiting guests - beginners and experienced people. </p><p>  Ballooning is also popular.  For the most daring - parachute jumps, for this there are specialist instructors.  And how rich and interesting the underwater world of the Black Sea is!  This is especially true of Koktebel and Koktebel Bay.  Divers here are trained from scratch, while already advanced ones dive with and without an instructor. </p>

    <h2>  Bicycles and motorcycles, boats and yachts </h2><p>  Biking is no longer just a sport, it is a lifestyle.  In Crimea, the conditions for bike rides can be said to be ideal.  The terrain is mountainous, multilevel, which is suitable for all types of training, plus incredible beauty of the scenery.  This also applies to motorsport.  Guests arriving with their motorbikes and bicycles receive parking spaces.  Those who come light will also rent any unit here. </p><p>  Places of inaccessible reserved bays (this region of Crimea) - this is open space and delight for all types of yachting.  Here, in the club of outdoor activities, you can rent any boat to experience the Crimean beauty from the sea.  Vacationers with their own small boats and other means of transportation by water can accommodate them using hotel services.  The Lex Hotel &amp; Spa has a large Yurkaffa service center for water and motor equipment.  They will be happy to provide help with service. </p><h2>  Fishing and travel in the saddle </h2><p>  Fishing for many people is an integral part of life.  The hotel's leisure club has professionals who know exactly where the fish are.  For those who wish, an unforgettable pastime is organized - both for the company and the individual.  They will prompt and give advice, help you choose a place, which without fail will benefit, and the catch will be good. </p><p>  Who would not want to ride on the charming corners of Crimea?  Many of the local beauties are almost inaccessible to the main means of transportation.  Amazing animals such as well-trained horses will help tourists reach these places.  Before the trip, instructors instruct in detail those who wish to travel in the saddle, calculate the route, and provide the necessary trip. </p>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The choice of excursions is truly enormous, because in Crimea there are so many famous historical and natural places that it‚Äôs a shame not to visit during the holidays.  About Kara-Dag was said above, and it is nearby, within walking distance.  Unique sightseeing objects are as follows: palaces of the Southern Coast of Crimea (Vorontsov, Massandra, Livadia), the Khan's Palace of Bakhchisarai, Red and Marble Caves, unique parks - Paradise, Nikitsky, Khersones Reserve, museums Aivazovsky, Chekhov, Green, the beautiful Voloshinsky House of the Poet (right in Koktebel!), It‚Äôs even impossible to list everything.  The Lex Hotel organizes any excursion within the peninsula.  In addition, near the hotel there is a dolphinarium, water park, diving center.  Koktebel hosts various festivals, exhibitions, concerts, creative evenings and the like.  No one will be bored! </p>
