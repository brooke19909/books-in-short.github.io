However, in Russia, a special commission engaged in the fight against pseudoscience and the falsification of scientific research under the <span>Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences</span> does not recognize the ‚Äúscientific nature‚Äù of ufology.  The thing is that this field of knowledge and research does not possess a number of features that any science should possess.

    <p>  The term "ufology" appeared in the middle of the last century in the USA.  It was at that time in this state that a large-scale study of UFO (Unidentified Flying Object - Unidentified Flying Objects) began.  From this reduction the word "ufology" appeared. </p><p>  Today, ufologists have different statuses in different countries of the world.  But still more often than these researchers are not recognized by scientists.  Any science should have a clearly defined subject of study.  In ufology, eyewitness accounts of UFO sightings and material objects are investigated, presumably as evidence of the appearance of these same objects.  Moreover, over the years of hard work, the very fact of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and visits by their representatives of our planet has not been proved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Science should have a number of methods that are regularly used to study what is being studied.  Ufologists also do not comply with this rule - each of them uses its own technology to verify the testimony of witnesses of inexplicable phenomena and determine the authenticity of the evidence.  Theories that explain the origin and essence of UFOs, official science recognizes as pseudoscientific.  The reason for this definition is the inability to prove <span>unexplained phenomena</span> and to study them carefully.  Accordingly, the correct definition of the term ‚Äúufology‚Äù is an activity aimed at collecting information and studying the UFO phenomenon. </p><h2>  The first mention of "flying saucers" </h2>

As evidence, the followers of this theory mention the paleokant - surviving drawings made at the dawn of human civilization, illustrating contacts with representatives of unearthly races.  Ancient Egyptian papyrus dating from the 16th century BC is considered the oldest ‚Äúevidence‚Äù of encounters with aliens from outer space.  e.  (era of the reign of Pharaoh Thutmose III).  The founder of the theory of the historical connection of human civilizations with extraterrestrial is considered the Soviet scientist K. E. Tsiolkovsky.  Curiously, the tales of UFOs and aliens from outer space are found in the stories of various peoples dating from different times.  This is one of the arguments of those who believe that ufology is a serious science, which today simply does not have enough evidence.

There were so many appeals from the population that very soon the Air Force became interested in this problem, and then other state bodies.  It was at that time that the terms ‚Äúufology‚Äù, UFOs appeared, and even whole centers were opened that study the phenomenon.

    <p>  The studies were conducted for about two decades, and then were officially discontinued at the federal level.  However, a significant number of reports of UFO sightings have not been reviewed and studied appropriately.  Some reports of unusual flying objects were explained as such that arose on the basis of well-known natural phenomena and human activities. </p><p>  In 1969, all UFO research conducted by government organizations was terminated in the United States.  Since then, ufology is an activity which is exclusively carried out by independent "lovers". </p><h2>  What is ufology doing today? </h2><p>  Official science today does not give an exact answer to the question: ‚ÄúAre there intellectually developed extraterrestrial civilizations?‚Äù  Most experts agree that outer space is too large and little studied by humanity in order to confidently deny the existence of life on other planets.  However, no evidence or traces of an alien mind were also found. </p><p>  What is ufology studying today?  The main work is carried out to collect information and new evidence of UFO sightings.  Often, ufologists study places where unidentified flying objects were observed and are looking for material evidence of their existence.  Many associations working in this field specialize in space exploration and are attempting to discover extraterrestrial civilizations and establish contacts with their representatives. </p><h2>  Related sciences </h2>

Very often, ufologists work with people who claim to have become UFO witnesses, but can only confirm this event with their own testimonies.  In this case, psychological methods are used to collect and verify information.  First of all, it is necessary to assess the mental state and health of the eyewitness.  If a person suffers from some kind of psychiatric illness, the likelihood that he really witnessed something unusual is minimal.  With sciences such as astronomy and meteorology, ufology also has a lot in common.  Eyewitnesses of rather rare meteorological or astrophysical phenomena often talk about aliens.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ufology the unknown" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1491728.jpg"></div>  Unidentified flying object - the definition is too vague and multifaceted.  What exactly is customary to designate and perceive as a UFO?  Most often, this term is used to refer to objects moving in the sky at a speed or trajectory that do not coincide with those available to modern aircraft.  Many eyewitnesses also describe unusual forms of UFOs or the bright light emitted by them.  Cases of observation of aliens themselves and even contacts with them are also considered by ufology.  The unknown and the unusual are always explored with particular enthusiasm by ufologists.  Perhaps sometime ufology will indeed be recognized by science and prove the existence of the objects under study.
