    <h2>  Negative guest opinions </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the Ramada Liberty 4 * hotel in recent years began to receive more and more negative reviews.  Guests of the complex note that rest here has many shortcomings.  Their comments describe the following disadvantages of the hotel: </p><ul><li>  Tourists are provided with old and washed bedding, which smells of damp. </li><li>  The plumbing in the rooms is in terrible condition.  The taps are leaking, and it would be nice to clean the bathtub, toilet bowl and wash basin thoroughly. </li><li>  Meals do not match 4 stars.  Yesterday‚Äôs weathered bread is served.  A very small selection of dishes is offered.  Cooking is very tasteless. </li><li>  The hotel area is in poor condition, there is a lot of garbage everywhere.  Weeds grow on the lawn, a lot of dry grass. </li><li>  The staff does not speak Russian, so you should take along a phrase book or dictionary of English or French. </li></ul><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Once the Ramada Liberty 4 * hotel (Monastir) flourished, but now it is in desolation.  Tourists who visited it in 2016 note that almost no one is resting here, and the level of service is at a very low level.  They advise you to find another place to stay, which will correspond to the declared price. </p>
