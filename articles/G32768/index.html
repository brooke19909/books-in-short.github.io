  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is a home photoepilator? Product reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, rarely does any girl boast of perfectly smooth legs, on which no vegetation is naturally observed.  Therefore, all kinds of procedures and devices for removing unwanted hair from the body are in great demand.  The most popular tool for depilation is a regular razor, despite the fact that its only advantage is quick and absolutely painless hair removal.  <span>Electric epilators are a</span> little more effective, because after using them you can forget about hair for at least a week or two, but their minus is pain and <span>ingrown hairs,</span> which are even more difficult to get rid of.  Therefore, many prefer salon care, which involves procedures such as laser and photo hair removal. </p><p>  Of course, this is quite an expensive pleasure, but what can‚Äôt you do for the sake of beauty?  In addition, these types of vegetation removal are quite effective, because after a certain number of sessions there is a chance to get rid of unwanted hair forever.  But, again, there is not always time and money for such procedures, so women often seek out more affordable methods.  And one of them appeared on the market just a couple of years ago.  This is a home photoepilator.  Reviews about this device are very ambiguous, as, indeed, about any other device: someone likes, someone not really.  What kind of thing is this and how effective is it? </p><p>  According to the manufacturers of this product, it allows you to get rid of hair not only on the legs, but also on other parts of the body (except the face).  The hair bulb (follicle) is destroyed, the skin itself is not injured, and the result remains for a sufficiently long time.  Painful sensations do not occur.  In addition, some models have special sensors that determine the <span>color of the skin,</span> so if in some part of the body it is darker than normal, then the device in this place will not work for safety reasons.  After all, it is known that photoepilation can not be done to people with too dark or tanned skin. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A home photoepilator, reviews about which are quite contradictory, is quite expensive, but if you add up all the money spent on several similar salon procedures, it will be much cheaper.  As for efficiency, everything here is also purely individual.  Some note that when using this device, no special changes are observed.  Other ladies who have tested themselves on a photoepilator leave positive reviews.  They note that the hair begins to fall out, though not immediately, but after some time.  In those areas of the skin affected by the flash, ‚Äúbald spots‚Äù appear after a short period of time.  And if at first the use of the device is made every three to four weeks, then in the future its use will be required less and less. </p><p>  Of course, different companies produce this device, respectively, and the pricing policy is different.  The cost of the photoepilator directly depends on its power and the number of flashes.  It may happen that one lamp inserted into the device is not enough to get the final ‚Äúbald‚Äù effect.  You don‚Äôt have to worry about this, because you can insert a new lamp in any photoepilator (reviews about specific models can be found on the Internet).  In addition, an additional lamp is included with some fixtures. </p><p>  Of course, if you want to look perfect on the beach and not care about how much the ‚Äústubble‚Äù has grown on your feet and in other places, a photoepilator, reviews of which are mostly positive, is best acquired in the fall.  Until the summer, there will just be enough time to get rid, if not all the vegetation, then most of it.  And no need to worry anymore that after hair removal, the skin will remain irritated in the form of small red dots, like after shaving or an electroepilator.  This will not happen, as well as ingrown hair.  Your skin will remain even and smooth. </p>
