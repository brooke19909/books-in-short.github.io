Antiviruses, firewalls, and other virus protection software.  But all this will help little with power surges or a sudden power outage.  And such things are very detrimental to computer components.  However, there is a way out of this situation. </p><p>  In order for the named device to remain safe and sound, <span>uninterruptible power supplies</span> were invented <span>.</span>  They are able not only to equalize the voltage during its surges, but also provide the computer with a complete power outage exactly for the time that is necessary for its proper shutdown. </p><p>  Further in the article we will consider the budget APC Back-UPS ES 525 UPS. What are its technical characteristics?  What is this device?  The answers to such questions are contained in this material. </p><h2>  A little about the manufacturer </h2><p>  The ARS company has long been known in the domestic market.  It was formed in 1981 and successfully engaged in the manufacture of devices to protect PCs from voltage surges.  In 2007, the manufacturer was acquired by Schneider Electric.  This marked a new milestone in the development of the company, and it continued to shockly produce uninterruptible power supplies. </p><p>  The named manufacturer is well known in the domestic market due to quality products and affordable prices.  APC produces devices of various classes for protecting PCs of various categories: from weak office computers to powerful server machines.  The APC Back-UPS ES 525 UPS is designed specifically for low-power office machines and weak home computers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  During its existence, the company ARS has released many noteworthy devices.  Every second computer in Russia and other CIS countries is equipped with uninterruptible power supply from APC.  This alone speaks volumes.  Budget devices are especially popular among our compatriots, and the APC Back-UPS ES 525, the characteristics of which we will analyze a little later, including.  In the meantime, let's move on to the packaging, appearance and design of the device. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  Uninterrupted APC Back-UPS ES 525 appears before the user in a huge cardboard box with color printing.  The packaging shows the UPS, its specifications and the necessary information. </p><p>  Inside - the device itself, a set of necessary wires, a closed-type rechargeable battery, an instruction manual in different languages ‚Äã‚Äã(including Russian) and a warranty card.  This package is standard for a budget device.  There is nothing unusual about this. </p>

    <p>  But there is, nevertheless, one feature.  Devices of this level are usually delivered in completely casual cardboard boxes.  And here is a whole artistic masterpiece.  This alone indicates the high status of the manufacturer, which cares about its reputation and tries to do everything in the highest rank, even despite the fact that the APC Back-UPS ES 525 belongs to devices of a low price segment.  This attitude very clearly describes the general policy of the company.  And it cannot but satisfy users. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Externally, the APC Back-UPS ES 525 resembles the usual surge protectors that are used to connect a computer and various peripherals.  Only the size of the uninterruptible is much larger.  On the top panel there is a power button, LED indicators and connectors for connecting power plugs.  Below is a compartment for installing the battery.  In general, the design of this device is pretty standard.  Only the shape is unusual.  And so - nothing extraordinary. </p>

    <p>  More importantly, the APC Back-UPS ES 525 is made of thick and high-quality plastic.  This protects the inside of the device from various mechanical damage.  However, the developers did not forget about the cooling system. </p><p>  The ventilation grilles in this uninterruptible power supply are enough.  This is due to the fact that it has a huge load, as a result of which a fair amount of heat is released, which needs to be somehow removed, otherwise the device will overheat and burn. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Well, we got to the most interesting in the material about the uninterruptible from APC.  The figures, of course, can say a lot, but they can not be compared with real reviews.  However, this is not the case now. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  So, the declared power of the uninterruptible power supply is 300 watts.  Is it a lot or a little?  Let's just say this is enough for an office computer.  But no more than that.  Battery life at full load is 4 minutes.  At half load - 15 minutes.  Not much, of course, but in order to turn off the computer correctly, time is enough. </p>

    <p>  What are the other specifications of the APC Back-UPS ES 525?  The battery, for example, is fully charged in five hours (despite the fact that it discharges in a matter of minutes), it has all types of protection.  There is even Phone Line protection, which is necessary for those who use the appropriate connection. </p><p>  This UPS weighs almost eight kilograms with a battery.  This is a great result.  Most of his ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù are much harder. </p><h2>  Programs bundled with the device </h2><p>  Like any company that respects its customers, APC put a software disc in a box with an uninterrupted service.  This step allows you to programmatically control the operation of the APC Back-UPS ES 525. </p><p>  The program makes it possible to adjust many settings of the device.  For example, you can determine which component of the computer to give preference to during a sudden power outage, and without which a PC can do perfectly.  This allows you to slightly increase the operating time of the device from an uninterruptible power supply.  Naturally, we are talking about battery life. </p><p>  In addition, the software has a very informative monitor, which displays the current status of the uninterruptible power supply (temperature, voltage, and so on). </p>

    <h2>  Known Issues </h2><p>  Uninterruptible power supply is also a technique.  And every technique, as you know, tends to break at the most inopportune moment.  It is good that in this case the problems are of the same type and can be easily diagnosed.  For example, UPS assembled in India has a weak point - the battery.  It often fails (gives a leak). </p><p>  Also known is the problem that the APC Back-UPS ES 525 does not squeak when switching to stand-alone power.  Although, this can not be called a serious problem.  You can enable the sound signal on the device using a set of programs that come with the device. </p><p>  Another problem is the fragility of the battery.  She is able to serve three years.  On this her resource ends.  Unfortunately, of course, but replacing it is not difficult. </p>

    <h2>  Positive feedback from owners </h2><p>  Reviews help a lot when choosing a device of one type or another.  Especially when it comes to computer components.  They are capable of telling everything about how the device behaves in real conditions, and whether its real characteristics correspond to those that were declared by the manufacturer. </p><p>  In the case of the APC Back-UPS ES 525, all is well.  The forecasts of the developers regarding the battery life are quite true.  Moreover, many owners note that the computer is able to work on the <span>battery of an uninterruptible power supply</span> much longer than stated in the specifications.  So, for some, the battery life in half load reached 20 minutes. </p><p>  Owners also note the excellent build, materials and overall quality of the product.  I was also pleased with the software that is able to configure the UPS and display comprehensive information about its status at the moment.  For the most part, all users are happy with their purchase. </p>

    <h2>  Negative owner reviews </h2><p>  Well, where are we without the "haters"?  Do not feed these comrades with bread - just let me leave a negative review about the product.  But among them there are also very adequate people who pose constructive criticism.  The most common complaint addressed to the APC Back-UPS ES 525 is that the battery is very "flimsy."  And there is some truth to this. </p><p>  Many more complain about the poor shape of the case.  They say the uninterruptible power supply is too bulky.  Its installation is fraught with some difficulties.  And this, in principle, is true.  But claims to the battery life, the number of outlets or the lack of an LCD screen can hardly be called constructive.  After all, this is a budget device!  Such options are the prerogative of mid-range devices and premium uninterruptible power supplies. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Uninterruptible power supply APC Back-UPS ES 525 is a cheap device with all the ensuing consequences.  It is perfect for protection against power surges and sudden blackouts of low-power office computers.  Home appliances of comparable power can also be used with this UPS.  But there is no reason to hope for more.  Powerful UPS and costs more. </p>
