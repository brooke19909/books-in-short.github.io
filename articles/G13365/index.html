"Oh, Hotel Riagor 3 * (Bulgaria, <span>Sunny Beach)</span> is a great place to relax!"  - say the most positive of them.  People living here describe the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  Spacious and clean rooms with new furniture.  The design is also modern.  The hotel does not resemble a Soviet sanatorium, like many other complexes in Bulgaria. </li><li>  Friendly and understanding staff.  Check-in starts at 14:00, but the administrator will necessarily make concessions and give the keys earlier if there are free numbers. </li><li>  A variety of dishes in the restaurant.  There are a lot of fruits, and they are replenished regularly.  Delicious ground coffee is served. </li><li>  The hotel has families with children of preschool age, so already at 22:00 there is complete silence. </li><li>  The sea in summer is very warm and clean.  The entrance is convenient, but it is very shallow.  Suitable for tourists with small children, but not for diving enthusiasts. </li><li>  The complex is not fenced, so you can walk around the neighboring hotels.  Parents love to take their children to their playground. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Guest opinions: negative </h2><p>  Travelers who rested in the Riagor 3 * hotel (Sunny Beach) leave negative reviews.  In them they talk about the following disadvantages of the hotel: </p><ul><li>  There is no shower on the beach, toilets are paid, and changing cabins are very cramped and uncomfortable.  Umbrellas and sunbeds are more expensive than in Europe. </li><li>  Go to the sea much longer than stated in the description.  We have to go around other hotels, cafes and restaurants.  On average, a one-way trip takes 15 minutes. </li><li>  Terrible soy sausages, which are simply impossible to eat, are served for breakfast.  The restaurant constantly smells something unpleasant. </li><li>  Hot drinks (tea, coffee) are served only for breakfast. </li><li>  The hotel is very far from the central promenade, which houses all the tourist attractions. </li></ul><h2>  Should I stop at this place? </h2><p>  The new tourist complex Riagor ("Riagor") 3 * (Sunny Beach, Bulgaria) can be advised for family vacations.  It differs significantly from other three-star resort hotels with new and clean rooms, as well as high standards of service.  It is suitable for the elderly, who will be easy every day to go to the beach. </p>
