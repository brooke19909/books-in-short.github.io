From it to the city center - 2 kilometers.  Even among the resorts of the Mediterranean Sea, these places are distinguished by their picturesqueness.  In type, they are closer to the European climate.  The temperature of this region is always 5-7 <sup>¬∞</sup> C cooler than in Antalya.  <span>The Aegean Sea</span> has not a turquoise like the Mediterranean, but a bright blue hue.  In addition to the sea, mountains contribute to the formation of a unique microclimate. </p>

    <h2>  Aesthetics of the coast </h2><p>  Sun Bay Hotel 4 * is located 200 meters from the coast of the bay of Marmaris, one of the largest bays in the world.  It is also picturesque thanks to yachts sailing under multi-colored stylish sails.  There are always a lot of them at Marmaris, the largest yacht center in the world after all.  Here they are - expanse: the island at the entrance to the bay like a breakwater protects the water area from excessive unrest of the sea.  Why are we talking about this?  Yes, because the windows of half of the rooms of the Sun Bay Hotel 4 * overlook the sea and mountains!  Agree that a similar view from the windows is worth a lot.  A kind of aesthetics therapy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel territory is visible from the windows of the other half of the rooms, however it is so perfectly maintained (we will talk about it below) that some holidaymakers book rooms with its view from year to year. </p><p>  Perhaps this is why this hotel complex was chosen by the prim British.  Among the guests, they are most of all - about 70%. </p><h2>  Building and Territory </h2><p>  The territory is relatively small - 4.1 thousand m <sup>2</sup> .  The dominant position in it belongs to the central pool (the facade of the building of the Sun Bay Hotel 4 * is directly directed towards it), which is spacious enough for playing polo and swimming.  Around it is equipped a relaxation area: stylish sun loungers with umbrellas are arranged.  There is a bar selling drinks and pizza, shawarma, nuggets, fries, burgers.  Some lovers of a relaxing lounge and reading enjoyed the poolside so much that they simply did not reach the sea, gaining extra pounds during the holidays ... </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunbay hotel 4 marmaris" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/502886.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Here, to the pool, there is a terrace, where the open part of the restaurant is located.  The area around this public area is decorated with professional landscape design: low, but lush palm trees on neat English lawns are adjacent to decorative bush plants that are given geometric shapes (a separate respect for the gardener SunBay Hotel, he knows a lot about his business).  It feels true aesthetics that contribute to relaxation and meditation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the evenings, the hotel grounds are washed, cleaned and vacuum cleaned. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The only six-story building of the hotel complex was modernized last year.  Its number of rooms, consisting of double and triple apartments, is able to accommodate 225 guests. </p><p>  Among them - 85 compact Standard Rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã20 m <sup>2</sup> , 10 Family Rooms, consisting of two rooms without a door between them, equipped with one 2-double bed or two 1-bedroom, 36 m <sup>2</sup> .  The staff at Sun Bay Hotel maintains a friendly family atmosphere, is attentive, smiling.  Vacationers do not have a sense of fluidity, that they are on the service conveyor.  On the contrary, everything is culturally, individually, hotel employees are attentive to your requests.  Behind all this, of course, is high-quality hotel management and a very professional manager. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Everyone walks to the beach here (even the British).  <span>You must</span> admit that it is simply stupid for a guest <span>at the Sunbay Hotel</span> 4 * (Marmaris) to deprive himself of the pleasure of walking these two hundred meters to deprive himself of aesthetic pleasure - the opportunity to see some of the most picturesque landscapes of the Mediterranean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sun bay hotel 4 marmaris" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/502887.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Some holidaymakers prefer perfect sandy beaches with large golden or white sand, perfectly flat, stretching in an endless strip with a slight slope to the water.  However, other types of beaches are also demanded by gourmets from a beach holiday - quite spacious, but sectoral, sand and pebble, overlooking a convenient bay and located among picturesque cliffs.  Such, but, of course, which has become comfortable, the coast belongs to the Sun Bay Hotel 4 * (Marmaris).  Dear readers, just look at the photos of this beach, and you will understand why some Britons choose this tour for five or six seasons in a row!  Here, it is both idyllic and chic precisely because of the combination of natural features and comfort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The all inclusive customer service system also includes free entertainment - Turkish and <span>Finnish baths,</span> a gym.  Lovers to keep their body in good shape have this opportunity. </p><p>  A separate respect for the hammam of the Sun Bay <span>4 *</span> hotel <span>(Marmaris).</span>  We write about this because some hotels are introducing into their infrastructure a Turkish bath "for show", for a fad in the list of their services.  Fortunately, the hotel complex described by us adheres to other principles: not to seem, but to be.  The hamam here is beyond praise!  Everything in it is balanced: temperature, humidity, selection (at the request of customers) of aromatic products.  Recommended, very useful for cleansing and skin care. </p><p>  The gym at Sun Bay Hotel is also professional.  The equipment was purchased high-quality, functional.  Everything is matched to different types of athletic training. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Vacationers in this hotel complex often post positive reviews on the organization of catering on the Internet.  The restaurant is dynamic and systematic.  You can eat for four days, never having tasted twice consumed dishes.  Moreover, everything is cooked with high quality and delicious.  And why?  In Turkey - a special approach to nutrition.  Residents of the Land of Stars and Crescent do not eat ‚Äúin between‚Äù, in the bustle.  Therefore, chicken, and turkey, and fish, and shrimp are prepared in a variety of ways, each time pleasantly surprising with unexpected nuances of taste, emphasized by selected spices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sun bay 4 marmaris" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/502888.jpg" width="500"></div>  By the way, it is believed that <span>Turkish cuisine</span> is one of the three most popular in the world.  The main meat dishes in Sun Bay 4 * are prepared from chicken, turkey, and liver.  The home-cooked grill and dishes in small pots are especially popular.  Separately, the presence of fish dishes in the menu (in assortment) should be noted.  Shrimps with cheese are very tasty.

    <p>  In a Muslim country, traditionally a lot of side dishes are prepared.  In the menu of the restaurant "San Bay" (Turkey) they are made from vegetables, potatoes, rice.  We recommend tasting eggplant.  The assortment is always about ten salads. </p><p>  Of the fruits, vacationers are offered watermelons, melons, grapes, strawberries, cherries, baby bananas, grapefruits. </p><h2>  Leisure </h2><p>  For bathers, water rides on specific beach inflatable devices such as ‚Äúbanana‚Äù and ‚Äúcheesecake‚Äù will be interesting.  We recommend that at the very beginning of your stay at the hostel choose an excursion program for yourself to familiarize yourself with the bay of Marmaris. </p><p>  Dynamic and interesting outdoor activities are water skiing and parasailing (flying with a special parachute after the boat towing it).  Such an active vacation is provided to beach goers by local entrepreneurs with special licenses. </p><p>  For those who are in the beach area, diving courses are offered.  It will be interesting for both beginners and professional divers.  The former will patiently be taught to dive correctly, to breathe under water.  They will show you how to avoid unpleasant situations under water, teach you how to take pictures of the underwater world.  Experienced divers will be able to dive from a boat in the open sea.  Together with instructors, they will follow special routes, exploring water caves, and see the underwater world of the Mediterranean. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2>

Of course, you can, without putting extra effort, buy tours from your guides.  Moreover, they colorfully offer you their assortment.  True, at the same time you will overpay twice.  Guides from the "Sanbey" (Marmaris) have nothing to do with it.  This is the policy of travel agencies where they work.

    <p>  Therefore, it is much more reasonable to buy permits at specialized tour agencies, choosing the best one from them - according to reviews. </p><h2>  Pamukkale </h2><p>  This amazing natural phenomenon is visible to tourists from afar.  It‚Äôs hard not to notice in advance from the bus a pearly rock complex of travertine, decorated with centuries-old salt deposits of mineral thermal springs.  Healing geysers from underground cured even the ancient Romans.  The resulting cascade of small and large pools with water level differences is very picturesque.  The most famous pond of Pamukkale is the Cleopatra pool, heated by a geyser.  There tourists are allowed to swim. </p><h2>  Cappadocia </h2><p>  The unique creations of nature are also the rocks of Cappadocia, drained for thousands and thousands of years from rocks to a uniform harmonious oblique mushroom-shaped with conical "caps".  However, in addition to natural creations, the land of Cappadocia is decorated with creations of human hands.  The locals here are almost connected with nature, literally "leaving the rocks."  We are talking about underground churches of the early Christians cut down in the rocks, and about dwellings - apartments, also equipped in the rocks. </p><h2>  Grotto Dalmatash </h2><p>  An unforgettable experience for tourists can be an excursion to one of the most magnificent and famous grottoes in the world.  He is called Dalmatash.  It was opened by accident.  The mining company produced industrial explosions.  The laid dynamite opened an underground passage leading to a rocky cavity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sun bay 4" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/502889.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  However, cavers who arrived at the call found that the stalactite and stalagmitic cave, located below sea level, at different times served as a shelter.  At first, corsairs hid from the persecution of the sultans here. </p><p>  During World War II, a special German intelligence unit was hiding here. </p><p>  Now the grotto is a popular tourist attraction.  Majestic <span>stalactites and stalagmites are</span> specially highlighted.  Classical music constantly sounds.  Here, all year round, the temperature is +22 <sup>0</sup>  and humidity is 98%.  Such a microclimate also has a therapeutic effect.  Therefore, some tourists visit this cave not only for an aesthetic impression, but also with health benefits. </p><h2>  Ich Kale </h2><p>  The fortress of a power that no longer exists, the country that served as the cradle of the Orthodox faith.  The Byzantines knew how to build defenses.  It was they who gave Russia the Orthodox faith and handed it the historical baton, which later crystallized in the common name Third Rome.  The fortress is huge, to visit it, tourists will need all day. </p><h2>  Discovery Park </h2><p>  Family tourists always go with their children to a place that immerses their viewers in a prehistoric atmosphere, when, shaking the earth's surface, huge monsters - dinosaurs - moved around it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sun bay turkey" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/502892.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Replicas of these giants created by designers and placed in Discovery Park reflect their ancient prototypes with anatomical accuracy.  Special automation built into their layouts responds to the approach of tourists and makes these huge mechanical toys move and make sounds.  This is really impressive.  In addition, the park has a large terrarium, an aquarium with exotic fish. </p><h2>  East market </h2><p>  A real tourist, having arrived in Turkey, feels his duty to visit the eastern market, as well as to bargain for some goods on it.  Here you can profitably buy a leather product.  Good and Turkish textiles produced by local factories.  Tourists are attracted by the products of local artisans - piece, handmade. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up the above, we can say the following.  The Sunbay Hotel 4 * hotel invariably enjoys success among tourists.  Reviews indicate that the Marmaris region is preferable for the rest of the inhabitants of the middle zone due to its climatic features.  The climate here is milder than in Antalya.  There is no heat uncomfortable for people prone to heart disease and instability of blood pressure. </p>

    <p>  Reviews of tourists indicate that the level of service of the hotel exceeds four stars.  A quality guesthouse, a cozy pool area, spa and, most importantly, a wonderful beach is beyond praise.  The hallmark of this region are picturesque landscapes, clean ecology, fresh mountain air. </p>
