Built from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba, Petra was built a very long time ago.  The city was founded, according to some scholars, by the Nabataean Arabs.  The main feature of this ancient settlement, attracting here simply a huge number of tourists, is that it is almost completely cut down in the rocks. </p>

    <p>  Once upon a time, ancient Petra guarded busy trade routes along which caravans with spices, ivory and silk went north from India and Africa.  It was then that this unusual city became rich and became one of the most beautiful settlements on the coast of the Dead Sea. </p><p>  Buying a trip to Petra in Jordan is also worth it because it is currently on the list of seven famous wonders of the world.  In addition to ordinary tourists, this city is, of course, extremely popular with archaeologists and historians around the world.  All kinds of scientific research is carried out quite often. </p><h2>  Desert castles </h2><p>  This attraction in Jordan is also visited by many travelers.  Once the caliph deserts of the desert served as trade centers, forts, places of rest for caravans, etc. All of these ancient structures that were well preserved to our days were built during the Umeyyad dynasty.  In total, travelers have the opportunity to explore 30 such residences in Jordan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The Dead Sea </h2><p>  This tourist attraction of Jordan, of course, is also worth a visit.  The Dead Sea is not only a unique natural monument, but also a natural sanatorium.  It represents the largest and <span>most saline lake in the world.</span>  The dense water of the Dead Sea does not even resemble water, but a thick, oily brine.  It is simply impossible to drown in this salt lake.  Water easily pushes the body up. </p><p>  Life in the Dead Sea, of course, is completely absent.  There is not only fish, but not even any aquatic vegetation.  But the local mud is famous as one of the most effective natural healing agents. </p>

    <p>  Once upon a time on the shores of the Dead Sea, five biblical cities flourished and rustled.  It was near this reservoir in ancient times that the famous Gomorrah and Sodom were built.  Also here were the cities of Bela, Zeboim and Adma.  Today, a huge number of modern hotels of various categories have been built along the shores of the Dead Sea.  Excursions in Jordan to the Dead Sea are usually also offered and not particularly expensive. </p><h2>  Trips to other countries in the region </h2><p>  Jordan is a small country.  Therefore, tourists resting here can quickly reach the states located next to it, which also have a rich history.  For example, vacationers who came to rest in Jordan have the opportunity to visit all kinds of cult holy places in Israel.  Also, tourists who decide to spend a vacation in this country, at any time can explore some of the sights located in Egypt. </p><h2>  Excursions to Jerusalem </h2><p>  The border between Jordan and Israel is only 12 hours a day.  This time, of course, is usually not enough for tourists to explore all the sights of Jerusalem.  Therefore, excursions in Jordan to this city are usually organized for many days. </p><p>  Tourists can see the following attractions in Jerusalem: </p><ul><li><p>  Church of the Holy Sepulcher; </p></li><li><p>  5 stops of the Sorrowful Way; </p></li><li><p>  Wailing wall, etc. </p></li></ul><p>  Of course, travelers have the opportunity to just walk along the colorful narrow streets of one of the oldest cities in the world. </p>

    <p>  Tourists vacationing in Jordan cost, excursions to Jerusalem, unfortunately, are usually quite expensive.  A transfer to the border, for example, costs here about 20-30 dollars (depending on the resort) one way.  The excursion itself and guide services usually cost tourists $ 500-600. </p><h2>  Excursions in Bethlehem </h2><p>  Many tourists make complex excursions from Jordan to Israel.  For example, <span>trips to Jerusalem</span> and Bethlehem are very popular among vacationers.  In this case, after visiting the holy city, tourists are taken to the Church of the Nativity of Christ.  The latter, as you know, <span>is located in Bethlehem.</span>  In addition to the temple, in this city you can also see the cave in which Christ was supposedly born, pray in front of the miraculous icon of the Mother of God of Bethlehem, look at the Milk Grotto, and visit the famous underground church. </p><p>  Excursions in Jordan to Jerusalem among domestic tourists are popular for one more reason.  Russian citizens can enter Israel for sightseeing without visas.  On the border of Jordan with this state, they need to present only one passport. </p>
