    <h2>  Device delivery set </h2><p>  Expect something unusual and supernova in picking a budget gadget is not necessary.  This statement is true for the ‚ÄúTornado Express‚Äù.  Overview <strong> </strong>  the list of complete accessories indicates the presence of these: </p><ul><li><p>  Actually, the smart phone itself. </p></li><li><p>  Interface cord. </p></li><li><p>  1550 mAh battery </p></li><li><p>  Charger with 0.7A current output. </p></li></ul><p>  It is immediately worth noting that even a simple stereo headset is not included in the package and without it it is impossible to listen to the radio on this device.  Also on this list is clearly not enough external flash drive, protective film and case.  The owners of this device will definitely need all this; these accessories will have to be bought separately at an additional cost.  The list of documentation is also not entirely complete.  There is only a manufacturer‚Äôs business card and a separate warranty card.  But the user manual can be studied on the smartphone itself.  It is located in the device settings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design and usability </h2><p>  As noted earlier, Explay Tornado has a bright and unusual design.  Display <strong> </strong>  located in front of the gadget.  A fairly thin strip separates it to the right and left of the edge of the device.  Under it are three familiar touch-sensitive control buttons.  And even lower is a thin strip.  It usually has the same color as the back cover.  Above the screen are the earpiece, front camera and several sensors.  On the left side of the device, physical control buttons are grouped: power and volume swing.  Similarly, on the upper edge of the smartphone made 3.5 mm audio port and MicroUSB.  Only the conversational microphone is displayed on the lower side.  On the back cover, the main camera along with the backlight is located on top, and a loud speaker is at the bottom.  It seems like nothing unusual in the previously described and not, but the back cover is painted in bright color, it has a special corrugated matte finish.  Such a constructive solution almost completely eliminates the likelihood of accidental loss of the device from the hands. </p>

    <h2>  CPU and what is it for </h2><p>  Phone "Tornado Express" <strong> </strong>  equipped with a 4-core MT6582 fairly efficient central processing unit.  Each of its modules operates at a frequency of 1.3 GHz in peak computing mode and is based on an energy-efficient architecture with the code designation ‚ÄúA7‚Äù.  The level of performance close to the flagship devices, he can not boast.  Now almost all game applications are launched on this gadget, but not at maximum settings.  In the foreseeable future, those toys that will already be impossible to launch on it will necessarily appear.  But for most everyday tasks (watching videos, surfing Internet resources, reading books), its computing power will be quite a long time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Graphics subsystem and display </h2><p>  Phone ‚ÄúTornado Express‚Äù is equipped with an entry-level graphics accelerator - ‚ÄúMali-400MP‚Äù.  Its computing resources are still enough to run most modern applications.  But, again, in the foreseeable future there will be new toys that he will be too tough for. </p><p>  A sufficiently high-quality and large screen is used in Explay Tornado.  The display is based on the IPS-matrix, its diagonal is an impressive 4.5 inches, can process up to 5 touches to its surface at the same time.  At viewing angles close to 180 degrees, image distortion does not occur.  The color rendition, brightness and contrast are at an acceptable level and do not cause any complaints. </p><h2>  Photos &amp; Videos </h2><p>  Smartphone "Tornado Play" <strong> </strong>  although it belongs to the segment of entry-level devices, it is equipped with 2 cameras.  The main one is displayed on the back of the gadget.  It is based on a 5 megapixel sensor element.  She has a modest LED backlight, but there is no autofocus system.  The quality of the photos obtained with its help is very mediocre.  It is best to photograph on it in good light. </p>

    <h2>  Memory and its quantity </h2><p>  A small amount of RAM is one of the main disadvantages of the ‚ÄúTornado Explay‚Äù.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  highlight this nuance.  Indeed, just 512 MB is not enough as of today.  Most of it (approximately 300 MB) will be occupied by system processes.  Everything else, as expected, is allocated to the user to solve his tasks.  The capacity of the internal drive is 4 GB.  Of these, about 1.5 GB is occupied by system software.  The rest of the user can use to install applications.  But personal photos, videos and documents should be stored on an external flash drive (it will have to be purchased separately) or a cloud service (for example, Mail.ru Cloud).  The maximum capacity of a flash card that can be used in this gadget is 32 GB. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Gadget <span>Battery Capacity</span> and Autonomy </h2><p>  Another weak point is the battery for the Explay Tornado. <strong> </strong>  Its rated capacity is 1550 mAh.  This is very small for a device with a 4-core processor (albeit energy efficient) and 3 slots for SIM cards.  The situation is aggravated by a 4.5-inch screen.  Even if this gadget will operate in the maximum battery saving mode, then one of its charge is enough for 12 hours.  If you run some demanding toy on it, then we get 5 hours altogether. </p>

    <h2>  System software </h2><p>  The ‚ÄúTornado Explay‚Äù smartphone operates under the control of the most popular software platform for smart phones - the Android OS.  By default, the device is installed with a serial number of 4.4.  Given the fact that sales of this gadget started in October 2014, updates to later versions, at least official ones, should not be expected.  Therefore, you will have to be content with what has already been installed on Explay Tornado.  The firmware can not boast of something unusual in terms of equipment.  There is a familiar Evernote for text messaging, a simple calculator, a familiar calendar and an alarm clock.  Also, developers have not forgotten about social networks.  Clients of international social services are integrated into the system software, this allows you to start using them right away from the box.  But our analogues will have to be additionally installed from the official application store.  And finally, it is worth noting a set of software from the search giant Google.  All of his applications are also preinstalled and they can also be used immediately after purchase. </p><h2>  What is this smartphone capable of in games? </h2><p>  Now about the possibilities of the ‚ÄúTornado Express‚Äù.  His characteristics are very modest.  But even on such software and hardware you can run Asphalt 8.  Even if not at maximum settings, but it is possible.  And this already says a lot.  On this device, at the moment you can run any, even the most demanding, program.  But in the foreseeable future there will be software that will not already run on Explay Tornado.  Firmware with an outdated version of the OS and far from fresh hardware are the factors that will prevent the launch of new software on this smartphone. </p>

    <h2>  Interfaces and Information Exchange </h2><p>  A very extensive set of communications in the ‚ÄúTornado Express‚Äù.  Specifications <strong> </strong>  he has in this regard: </p><ul><li><p>  A key feature of this device is the presence of three slots for installing SIM cards at once.  Such a constructive solution allows you to significantly save on calls and choose exactly those tariff plans that are most optimally suited to the requests of the owner of a smart phone.  Also, the device is equipped with transmitters "2zh" and "3zh".  The maximum speed of information transfer using data from wireless interfaces is several megabits per second.  This is enough to watch online video from YouTube or make a video call. </p></li><li><p>  Another high-speed interface for transmitting information is Wi-Fi.  In this case, the device can exchange data at speeds up to 150 Mbps.  You can even upload high quality movies to your smartphone for later viewing. </p></li><li><p>  There is also a Bluetooth on this device.  This is an ideal solution for those cases when you need to connect a wireless headset to the gadget or exchange information with a similar mobile device. </p></li><li><p>  For navigation, the ZhPS module is integrated into the device.  Also there is a system "A-ZHPS".  All this in total allows you to determine your location as accurately and as quickly as possible. </p></li><li><p>  It is difficult to imagine a smart phone today without such a wired interface as MicroUSB.  In our case, it is used to charge the battery or connect to any modern computer. </p></li><li><p>  The last 3.5-mm wired port is designed to output audio from this smart phone to external speakers (speakers or headphones). </p></li></ul><h2>  Device price </h2><p>  A very modest cost, like for a budget-class smartphone, is at the ‚ÄúTornado Express‚Äù.  Price <strong> </strong>  its currently about 5000 rubles.  Now, considering all its other advantages (a powerful, efficient processor, a relatively large screen diagonal of 4.5 inches, an unusual and well-thought-out design, support for 3 SIM cards at once), it becomes obvious that this is one of the best smart phones in its segment.  Yes, there are drawbacks (small battery capacity, a modest amount of RAM) at the ‚ÄúTornado Express‚Äù.  The price compensates all these disadvantages.  It turns out a fairly balanced device for only 5000 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Positive and negative sides of this device </h2><p>  From a technical point of view, the ‚ÄúTornado Express‚Äù turned out to be rather ambiguous.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  this is clearly indicated.  Its positive aspects are: support for 3 SIM cards, a bright and unusual design, a powerful and productive processor that can easily cope with most applications and tasks.  But the disadvantages of this model are: the small capacity of the complete battery (hence the autonomy of the device is very modest), only 512 MB of RAM and 4 GB of integrated memory.  But all the flaws of the phone fade after the cost of a smart phone begins to be taken into account.  Today it is only 5,000 rubles, for this indicator this gadget simply has no competitors. </p>

    <h2>  Total </h2><p>  Three slots for installing SIM cards are the main advantage compared to competitors of the ‚ÄúTornado Express‚Äù.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  this is clearly indicated.  Well, at the end of the review, it is necessary to highlight the fact that the hardware of the smartphone is quite productive.  Against the background of these advantages, all the disadvantages of this device are not so serious anymore, they can be ignored.  Moreover, any of the shortcomings of the gadget can be easily solved.  Autonomy can be increased by an external battery, the built-in drive is supplemented by an external flash card, and RAM can be cleaned using special utilities (for example, <span>Clean Master).</span> </p>
