    <p>  Rhodes is rich in sights, relaxing on the island, you should pay attention to visiting the most interesting places such as the Lindos Acropolis, Rhodes Fortress, Mandraki Harbor, the Palace of the Grand Masters, Butterfly Valley, Suleiman Mosque, Rodini Park and much more. </p><h2>  Blue Sea Beach Resort 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, I would like to refer to the reviews of vacationers who visited this hotel.  Blue Sea Beach Resort (Faliraki) 4 *, according to tourists, this is a beautiful complex on the very shore of the Aegean Sea.  It is very conveniently located and is perfect for those people who want to live on the coast, closer to the sea.  From the hotel it is quite easy to get to any point of the island by bus to explore local attractions. </p><p>  The hotel complex has nice spacious rooms equipped with everything necessary.  The furniture in the apartments is not new, but in very good condition, the plumbing and air conditioning are in good condition.  All apartments have a beautiful view of the sea or the mountains.  Among the television channels, there are two Russian.  The main building is located on the shore, and the other two are across the road. </p><p>  The hotel staff is very efficient, it serves quickly and efficiently.  The rooms are cleaned daily and of high quality.  Most of the hotel guests are representatives of European countries, there are not so many Russians.  The hotel has many children, which is understandable, since the complex is focused on family vacations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue sea beach resort hotel" class="if" height="246" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1498365.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Separate praise deserves food.  Local chefs pamper guests with a large assortment of varied dishes.  Tourists themselves choose the right type of food, however, as a rule, All Inclusive is an unchanging leader preferred by vacationers.  In addition, this system makes it possible to get free sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach.  All-day snacks and refreshing drinks are offered in the bars.  The waiters in restaurants serve quickly and efficiently.  For children, you can choose dishes from a separate menu. </p><p>  The hotel is organized at a high level animation.  Throughout the day, vacationers are offered all kinds of sporting events in which they are gently and unobtrusively involved in their work.  There is a mini club for children.  And in the evenings for kids, animators organize a mini-disco, after which the show program for adults begins.  Vacationers are very pleased with the animation team. </p><p>  The indisputable advantage of the hotel is the beach.  The entire coast has a sand cover, including the sea.  Entry into the water is very smooth and you need to go to the depths.  Children always swarm in the water, for them such a shore is very convenient. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue sea beach resort faliraki 4" class="if" height="246" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1498366.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Experienced tourists are advised to definitely visit the most interesting places in Rhodes and try out the fun in Faliraki.  Local guides offer numerous sightseeing tours.  However, you can visit the sights on your own by renting a car or using buses.  The resort has several diving centers offering tourists their services.  As a rule, they all work with groups of beginners, but there are also experts who profess an individual approach, offering a long underwater excursion with a trainer.  Other water activities on the coast are no less interesting. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Based on the above reviews, we can conclude that the Blue Sea Beach Resort can be recommended to all lovers of beach holidays on the sea coast.  Good service, wonderful varied food, a wide range of entertainment, spacious rooms - all this is the key to a carefree vacation. </p>
