    <h2>  Meaning of the word ‚Äúcharioter‚Äù </h2><p>  To begin with, in the 3rd millennium BC, the Sumerians invented the first wheel.  It was this discovery that enabled them to create the world's first wagon designed to transport goods and people.  With the growing popularity of this invention, a need arose for specialists who could build and manage them.  They were called chariots. </p><p>  Soon, military tactics realized that the chariot could be used not only for peaceful purposes, but also on the battlefield.  Therefore, soon after the opening of the wheel, the Sumerians also had their first <span>combat vehicles.</span>  They were controlled by two chariots: one watched the horses, and the second threw spears or darts at opponents. </p><h2>  The Power of Ancient Egypt </h2><p>  What is the "charioter" and what is its role in the battles, the Egyptians understood well.  According to historical chronicles, it was their troops that contained the largest number of military vehicles.  So, 2.5 thousand years ago, the Battle of Kadesh took place, in which about 7 thousand chariots participated. </p><p>  Despite the full force of such weapons, they were soon removed from the regular forces.  The reason for this was the high cost of building carts.  It was much easier to use ordinary cavalry, not burdened with excess weight. </p>

    <h2>  <span>What is a "chariot"</span> in Ancient Rome </h2><p>  Roman troops also tried to use these machines in their military campaigns.  However, they were expected to be very disappointed, forcing them to abandon this venture.  Unlike the Sumerian and Egyptian lands, where the battles took place on a flat surface, the Romans fought mostly on mixed terrain.  And this interfered with the maneuverability of the wagon and nullified the entire combat advantage. </p><p>  However, despite this, chariots were often used within the walls of Rome itself.  In addition to the main transport vehicles, they were often used at games in the Coliseum.  In this regard, both a simple cabman and a seasoned gladiator could be a Roman chariot. </p>
