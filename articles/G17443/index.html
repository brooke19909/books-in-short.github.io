Cavaliers of the Order of Alexander Nevsky</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Among the many state awards of Russia throughout its history, the Order of Alexander Nevsky occupies a special and largely unique place.  His story is unusual.  The order appeared in the eighteenth century, in 1917 it was abolished, then reintroduced during the <span>Great Patriotic War.</span>  In 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist, but the heroic deeds of the new Russia‚Äôs heroes were noted with a high reward that survived the Russian Empire and the USSR.  This continuity is deeply symbolic.  Cavaliers of the Order of Alexander Nevsky are people serving the country, people, and not political regimes.  Holy Russia stood, stands and will stand firmly on such. </p><h2>  Who was Alexander Nevsky </h2><p>  Born in 1420, the prince at the age of 22 became famous for his brilliant victory over the Teutonic knights.  The defeat of the knight dogs was not an accidental success.  From a young age, Alexander was distinguished by righteousness and devotion to his native land.  In addition to his general talents, the prince possessed no less important personal qualities, including high intelligence, courage and the undoubted gift of a diplomat.  He also managed to repulse the attacks on Russia after the Battle of Ice, but he skillfully combined military feats, strategic ideas and tactical decisions with the conclusion of foreign policy treaties and alliances favorable to the country, reinforcing the weight of Novgorod on the political map of Eurasia. </p>

    <p>  The worship and veneration of Alexander began almost immediately after his righteous death in 1263.  Immediately before his death, he managed to take the monastic rank and gave his soul to the Lord, bearing the monastic name Alexy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The fact that this holy man became a symbol of the valor of the sons of Russia during the time of Catherine the Great and remained so until 1917 is not surprising.  About what metamorphoses occurred to him during the time of the atheism, the story will go below.  No less interesting is the fate of the award today. </p><h2>  How and by whom the order was conceived </h2><p>  The idea to establish the Order of Alexander Nevsky appeared even in the first Russian emperor Peter the Great, but the monarch did not manage to realize it.  Nevertheless, during the years of his reign, much was done to ensure that the heroic image of the savior of the fatherland was established in the popular consciousness.  And after his death, the prince continued to inspire the Russian army with his feat.  Before the start of the Battle of Kulikovo (1380), the imperishable relics of Alexander were presented to the defenders of their native land.  In 1721, Tsar Peter decided to transfer them from the city of Vladimir to the new capital.  This process was somewhat delayed, and this happened due to the highest degree of reverence for the remains of the Prince-Liberator.  The relics visited Klin, Tver, Vyshny Volochyok, and then, after making their way along Ilmen Lake, they stopped for a long time in Novgorod.  There were many pilgrims, but, according to the decree of the emperor, the silver crayfish was transported to Shlisselburg, where it remained until 1724.  Finally, Archbishop Theodosius received the order of Peter I to organize the delivery of relics to St. Petersburg until the end of August of the same year, which was done.  The emperor died before he could establish the Order of Alexander Nevsky.  Russia remembered its hero. </p>

    <h2>  Order under Catherine I </h2><p>  Catherine I, the widow of the emperor reformer, carefully treated many of his ideas and undertakings.  She did not disregard the design of the new award.  They became the newly established Order of Alexander Nevsky.  The list of recipients was opened by eighteen people, both military and state, in this matter the empress somewhat distorted the general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãher late husband, who believed that only those who crowned themselves with military glory should be cavaliers.  The ceremony was timed to the wedding of the daughter of Peter Anna and the Duke Karl-Friedrich (the marriage took place in 1725), and this was the reason to present the Order of Alexander Nevsky to four foreign Holsteiners, which, obviously, was done for diplomatic reasons.  At the same time, a statute was formed, according to which the representatives of the highest military command, beginning with Major General, were honored.  The same applied to the authorities of the state ranking table.  In the same 1725, Catherine I considered it possible to award herself with this order.  In general, the empress had this foundation.  In her reign, the total number of cavaliers reached 64 people (including herself). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  From Catherine to Catherine </h2><p>  Before the start of the ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù of Catherine II, about three hundred distinguished figures of the empire received the Order of Alexander Nevsky.  Among them are A.S. Pushkin‚Äôs grandfather, General-General Hannibal (known as Peter's Arap), V.I. Suvorov, father of the Generalissimo, academician K.G. Razumovsky, the first curator of Moscow University, and many other prominent people.  Foreign monarchs (including King of Prussia Frederick II, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony August III, Georgian king Kartli and princes George and Balkar) considered it a great honor to wear this order.  He was awarded the Ukrainian hetman. </p>

    <h2>  Awarded by Catherine the Great </h2><p>  Two and a half hundred awarded were during the reign of Catherine the Great.  Time itself, the turbulent events that led to the growth of Russia's power and the growth of its territory, and victorious wars contributed to this.  A.V. Suvorov, M.I. Kutuzov, F.F. Ushakov - these names speak a lot to every Russian heart.  The tradition laid down by Catherine I was continued, according to which scientists, historians and writers also proved worthy of such an award as the Order of Alexander Nevsky.  Russia has always been rich in talented people, and in a sense, their merits contributed to the country's glory no less than the actions of naval commanders and commanders.  Among the recipients, one can mention the secret adviser A. I. Musin-Pushkin, who opened to his contemporaries and descendants the ‚ÄúWord about Igor's Regiment‚Äù.  Alas, among the gentlemen there was also the notorious Moscow police chief Arkharov, in whom the arbitrariness of the executive branch flourished.  Well, everyone has mistakes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Order of Paul </h2><p>  Paul I undertook to change and unify the reward system, introducing a single order, differing in "classes", but the innovation did not take root.  It so happened that the <span>Order of St. Andrew the First-Called</span> became the highest order of the Russian Empire <span>,</span> followed by St. Catherine, and St. Alexander Nevsky in third place.  The symbol of the award was a ribbon worn over the shoulder.  Color - red, with <span>double-headed eagles,</span> national emblem.  The order was a silver star with a princely crown and the name of Alexander in the form of a monogram, as well as the circular motto ‚ÄúFor Works and Fatherland‚Äù.  Cavaliers were supposed to wear a special costume, worn on special occasions when visiting the court.  Under Paul there were only eight dozen awarded, which indicates the high status of the order. </p><h2>  Special conditions of the order </h2><p>  Interestingly, the very process of obtaining the order in the Russian Empire was accompanied by monetary relations between the court and the gentlemen.  Awarding was made subject to a contribution (200, and then 600 rubles), but on the other hand, it gave the right to an annual income or pension in excess of this amount.  This order was maintained until 1917, and the proceeds went to the maintenance of homes for the disabled and charity events.  The control of the justice of expenditures was carried out by the cavaliers themselves through a special council, in which the most worthy were elected. </p><p>  The order had only one degree, but differences were still possible.  An additional award was considered swords, diamond signs, and even diamond swords worn with the main star.  With special status lines, it was specified with what kind of uniform or suit it is appropriate to wear the Order of Alexander Nevsky, with what other awards it is combined, and with which not. </p><p>  After the October Revolution, all the royal rewards were abolished. </p>

    <h2>  Stalin's ‚ÄúAlexander Nevsky‚Äù </h2><p>  1942 year.  The situation at the front is difficult, and at some moments just critical.  A significant part of the European territory of the USSR is captured by the enemy.  It's time to remind the people of the glorious past and military prowess of their ancestors.  The orders and medals of the Second World War, approved in the first war years, symbolize patriotism and historical memory.  Mention of internationalism and the worldwide brotherhood of workers temporarily ceases in the press, and in newsreels, and in works of art.  The German proletarians trample our land under Nazi banners.  They need to be defeated and expelled, and only then, perhaps, they should talk about the world revolution. </p><p>  JV Stalin gives the order to develop sketches of orders named after the great commanders - Kutuzov, Suvorov and Alexander Nevsky.  The technical committee of the logistics service is embarking on an important government task.  The artistic side of the matter was entrusted to I. S. Telyatnikov, a twenty-six-year-old artist (educated as an architect). </p><h2>  Film artist on the order </h2><p>  The task assigned to Telyatnikov was not easy, stylistically all three orders should be kept in a similar manner, involving an image in the central part of the character, in whose honor the award is named.  The artists had portraits of Suvorov and Kutuzov.  And whose face will bear the order of Alexander Nevsky?  The USSR was a great cinematic power.  In 1938, <span>Sergei Eisenstein</span> made a film about the Battle of the Ice.  Igor Sergeyevich Telyatnikov considered it possible to use the prince‚Äôs image created by <span>actor Nikolai Cherkasov</span> in heraldry <span>.</span>  Viewers are accustomed to the fact that Alexander Nevsky looks that way, although the appearance of the national hero remains unknown to this day due to the lack of intravital images. </p>

    <h2>  Quality and quantity </h2><p>  The order turned out to be beautiful.  To the proposal of the Mint representatives to simplify the manufacturing technology (it was easier to make it whole-stamped) Igor Telyatnikov stubbornly replied that the award should be made of several parts assembled together.  JV Stalin, after listening to both sides, accepted the position of the author.  However, soon due to the manifestation of mass heroism by the soldiers of the Red Army, it was nevertheless necessary to go to some simplification of the technology.  The main manufacturing materials are silver (925th test) and enamel.  In total, over the years of the war, more than forty-two thousand of these awards were issued.  Many orders and medals of the Second World War were produced in smaller editions, but sometimes they were preserved more.  The thing is that they were honored to carry on their chest the image of the defender of the Russian land only desperate daredevils, who appreciated the future Victory above their own lives.  Heroes died, their rewards were not always able to be saved ... </p><p>  Who were the gentlemen of the Order of Alexander Nevsky?  The list was opened in November 42nd by the brave commanders of the Red Army, Captain S.P. Tsybulin and Lieutenant I.N. Ruban.  It should be noted that initially it was assumed that the order would become a truly national award, and junior military leaders, including regiment commanders, would receive it, but later the circle of worthy was expanded to include commanders and brigades.  The main requirement was that their decisions show the skill, courage and determination, qualities inherent in Prince Alexander.  The ratio of forces at the time of a successful offensive also mattered.  If the enemy was quantitatively superior to our unit, which rushed to the attack, and was thus defeated or took to flight, then this was an occasion to present the hero for a reward.  Then, according to the standard army procedure, the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Council followed.  There were not frequent cases when those awarded the Order of Alexander Nevsky were awarded this award repeatedly (a little more than a hundred) and it was completely unique if there were three on their chests (only three such brave warriors are known). </p><p>  So, the commander of a rifle company Ivan Mikhailovich Sedoy, together with the unit entrusted to him, in June 1944 impudently attacked the superior forces of the enemy, fearlessly approached his positions and destroyed fifty German Nazis with fire.  A hundred Soviet soldiers were entrenched in the captured defenses, they repulsed six counterattacks.  The next day, the company forced the river and went to the rear of the enemy, which made it possible for the main forces of the advancing Soviet troops to pass.  So comrades Sedoy became a knight of the Order of Alexander Nevsky.  But the hero did not stop there.  The regiment was advancing, and already in July the company of I.M.Sedogo, showing heroism, resisted the Nazi battalion, and then turned the enemy into a stampede.  The second order was a worthy reward. </p><p>  In the war years, there were situations when the units were commanded by foremen and sergeants.  The Order of Alexander Nevsky is an officer‚Äôs award, but in these situations the rank and file employees were worthy of him.  The deeds of several women who fought on the fronts are also highly praised.  The officers of the Normandy-Niemen squadron, the French Leon Cafo, Pierre Puyad and Joseph Risso, received an order for their heroism in the sky. </p><p>  After the <span>Victory, the Order of</span> Alexander Nevsky was not awarded to anyone for more than ten years.  During the Hungarian rebellion, several Soviet officers, acting decisively and courageously, were able to succeed by leading small forces.  They were awarded a high award. </p><p>  Until 2005, the presentation of orders to those who could not receive them during the war continued.  Sometimes the heroes did not even know about their awards. </p>

    <h2>  New old order </h2><p>  After the collapse of the USSR, the Soviet insignia of the military and civilians was no longer awarded.  They were replaced by new medals and orders of the Russian Federation, in their form expressing the continuity of the Russian State.  In addition to the Golden Star of the Hero, only a few awards have retained their name.  The appearance of the insignia was also significantly changed, the symbols of the Soviet state gave way to a new (or old) coat of arms, a two-headed eagle.  In 2010, the Order of Alexander Nevsky of the Russian Federation was established, which retained the high meaning of its predecessors. </p><p>  According to the statute, civil servants and other citizens are worthy of the award, who, through their labor or valor, contributed to the prosperity of the motherland and the increase of its authority.  It does not matter if efforts have been made in the field of military affairs, science, culture, health, education or other activities.  The Order of Alexander Nevsky of the Russian Federation can be awarded only to holders of other highest awards of the fatherland.  Foreign citizens or citizens can be awarded with it, if they contributed to fruitful interstate cooperation.  In addition to the main sign, sockets and miniature copies are issued that can be worn on uniforms or civilian clothes on the left side of the chest.  The old glorious motto ‚ÄúFor Works and Fatherland‚Äù, which is now written on the reverse, was also recalled.  If the previously awarded person was awarded the Order of St. Catherine, then the ribbon symbolizing the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky should be worn below. </p>

    <h2>  New Knights of the Russian Order </h2><p>  The revived Order of the Russian Empire is outwardly stylized as a cross, it does not have the image of actor Cherkasov, but in the round medallion, in the central part of the composition, there is an equestrian figure reminiscent of a warrior prince who has become a saint. </p><p> The order according to which the Order of Alexander Nevsky is awarded is also slightly changed.  Photos of cavaliers provided by the press are not always accompanied by the publication of relevant decrees, although the fact of the award itself is not a secret, any of them are known from public sources.  Over the past four years, over seventy have passed.  Among those honored are actors (V. S. Lanova and V. A. Etush), and Orthodox priests, including the Primate of the Russian and Ukrainian Churches, Father Cyril and Father Vladimir, and government figures, and representatives of the business world (for example, About . V. Deripaska).  The Belarusian Order of Alexander Nevsky also has the Belarusian President Lukashenko.  Those who have strengthened the sports honor of our homeland with their works are not forgotten, among them <span>Tatyana Pokrovskaya</span> is the coach of the synchronized swimming team.  State Duma deputies Chaika and Zyuganov also earned the honor of wearing the image of St. Alexander on their chests. </p><p>  However, awards do not happen often.  This order must be earned by hard work for the benefit of Russia for many years, and sometimes decades. </p>
