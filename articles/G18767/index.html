However, it is different in nature.  A product made with a single cloth does not always have a simple manufacturing technique.  Today, products assembled from individual elements are becoming increasingly popular among knitting lovers.  Such things can be made from yarn of various colors, but always the same texture.  They are often fascinated by a variety of elements and bizarre patterns.  But the main feature of such products is that it is almost impossible to repeat them, even perfectly mastering the knitting technique. </p>

    <h2>  The popularity of products made from individual elements is growing </h2><p>  Each work made from individual motives can be safely considered unique.  Since, even using the recommended materials and adhering to the description of the work, it is not possible to accurately reproduce the product.  Even taking into account the fact that there are universal ways by which flowers and leaflets are crocheted.  The schemes for their implementation are quite diverse, but built on the same principles. </p><p>  Each craftswoman has her own distinctive feature.  This may be a certain density of knitting, a preference for one color gamut over another.  And besides, in the process of joining separately made elements, unique moments always arise that are caused by the features of the product pattern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Variety of elements </h2><p>  To create different types of products, in most cases a fairly standard set of elements is performed.  It can be circles, flagella, flowers of various shapes, as well as leaves, rhombuses.  Today it‚Äôs quite simple to crochet a variety of leaflets.  Patterns can be found in knitting magazines.  Leaflets are made by craftsmen both according to standard descriptions, and using their own best practices.  Any elements can be supplemented by something of their own.  Their size can vary depending on the purpose that is being pursued, as well as on the volume of yarn at the disposal of the needlewoman. </p><h2>  We knit a leaf.  Method one </h2><p>  Let's look at how to <span>crochet a piece of paper.</span>  The schemes for its implementation use the simplest.  To get started, you need to make a chain of air loops.  Their number will depend on the thickness of the yarn and the desired size of the leaf.  No exact recommendations are given here.  The decision on its length is made by the knitter herself. </p>

    <p>  Next, several single crochet stitches are knitted.  The length of the resulting track will correspond to half the width of the future leaflet.  However, since we begin to knit it from the bottom, it must be borne in mind that the base should be wider.  Consequently, to the top it will narrow.  In order to crochet such a leaf, a scheme is not needed.  Work is done on an intuitive level. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When knitting, it is necessary to take into account the fact that leaflets, as in nature, can have the most diverse and bizarre shapes.  To perform such elements, you often just need to repeat the basic model several times without tearing the threads and attaching the parts to each other. </p>

    <p>  However, for the manufacture of the author‚Äôs model, such a simple, generally accepted leaf shape is sometimes not enough.  Then you have to look for a more original way to complete the crochet pattern.  Schemes can be found quite diverse.  Moreover, the leaflet does not have to have a traditional look.  It can be bizarre, sometimes even fantastic forms.  However, in the general canvas they will look quite harmonious. </p><h2>  Second way </h2><p>  Let's consider how a more complex leaf is crocheted.  The scheme suggests first to pay closer attention to the element, which serves as an addition, plays the role of the base of the leaf. </p>

    <p>  The process of performing such a leaf begins with a set of several air loops closed in a ring.  Next, create the base - a tight circle.  To complete it, you need to knit several rows with single crochet columns.  However, so that the future element does not deform, in each next row it is necessary to add loops.  You can do this according to the following scheme. </p><p>  In the first row we knit so many columns so that they fill the ring of air loops.  On average, this can be the number of air loops multiplied by two.  It is important that the product does not turn out too dense, because with a further expansion of the diameter, the circle may fold.  And this is undesirable. </p><p>  In the next row you need to double every second loop.  Then - every third, and so on, until the desired size of the base. </p><p>  When the circle of the required size is ready, continue to knit the base.  Having carefully studied the scheme, we see that further work will not be carried out in a completely familiar way.  Next, we will knit a flagella from groups of <span>double crochet posts,</span> while attaching it to the surface of the circle.  You need to attach a connecting loop through the same number of loops.  It is important to pay attention to the fact that after knitting 6 double crochet columns and 3 air loops, and then attaching them to the surface of the circle, you need to expand the work on the wrong side and continue.  Now the order is as follows: 3 air loops, 6 double crochets, 5 air loops.  Then again, expand the work and knit until the whole circle is enclosed in a frame made of a flagellum. </p><p>  When the whole circle is tied in this way, you can proceed to the execution of the body of the leaf.  Carefully following the knitting pattern, you need to remember about attaching the knit element to an already finished mug-base. </p><h2>  Third way </h2>

    <p>  You can also perform a completely different crochet of leaflets.  Schemes for this can be used in a variety of ways.  For example, a leaflet may be openwork in the middle, as in the photo above.  The implementation of such an element is also a creative process.  Having carefully studied the scheme, we will notice that the work was done by connecting the tracks from the double crochets.  And its openwork part is knitted with a simple sirloin net, which serves as a basis for the leaf. </p><h2>  Other use of elements </h2><p>  Such crocheting of leaflets, the patterns of which we have just examined, can be used both for joining and for decorating finished products.  Depending on which canvas will be decorated, you need to perform the required number of individual elements.  In this case, the color scheme of the product, the texture of the yarn, the shape of the elements should be thought out.  Otherwise, instead of creating a harmonious composition, you can only spoil the overall impression of the work.  In order for such a composition to be quite complete, you can diversify the set of elements and <span>crochet flowers</span> in addition <span>.</span>  Schemes, leaflets, yarn, a sewing needle and threads in tone will become indispensable assistants in its preparation. </p>

    <h2>  Important points </h2><p>  As you already understood, when an intricate leaflet is crocheted, the scheme should always be at hand.  Since separately manufactured elements must be made clearly and correctly.  Otherwise, they will be lost, and visual failures form on the general background of the canvas.  A similar leaflet can be made of yarn of various colors.  This gives an additional decorative effect to both a single element and the entire product as a whole. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  From the above methods, everyone will be able to choose one for themselves and decide which crochet piece of paper.  The scheme can be used as any of the proposed, as well as found or invented by you.  Inspired by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a thing, it is important to constantly keep it in the imagination so that it does not lose the integrity of the image.  This often leads to the fact that with great enthusiasm the connected individual elements gather dust in the far corner of the cabinet.  Remember, the main thing is that the process of creating an author‚Äôs thing is pleasing, and the products made are in demand and delighted their owners. </p>
