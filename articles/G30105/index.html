  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The recreation center "Ranch" in Pyatigorsk: description and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The recreation center "Ranch" in Pyatigorsk is one of the main places for spending free time in this region.  The administration advertises this place as the best place for companies of people.  You can read about the infrastructure and feedback from visitors about the base right in this article. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The recreation center "Ranch" in Pyatigorsk is located on the shores of a small lake.  For visitors are provided gazebos for a different number of guests.  Visitors can spend the night in a bungalow, which is located directly on the water off the coast of a water body.  Travelers can book a sauna or rooms with a wood-fired sauna.  Fishing enthusiasts have the opportunity to rent fishing rods for sports or trophy entertainment.  The administration recommends its institution as a place where you can arrange corporate feasts or relax with your family in nature.  Water and the surrounding area contribute to relaxation, plus quality advertising calls visitors here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pokurortam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center ranch pyatigorsk" class="if uuid-2417113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2417113.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  In the Rancho recreation center in Pyatigorsk, visitors can enjoy the quality of tables and chairs in the gazebos.  They are new and nice to host large companies.  Two small ponds will delight the eye during relaxation.  At the entrance to this tourist site there are signs that will direct straight to the entrance.  The infrastructure offers a variety of entertainment for visitors.  Around the lake there is a highway strewn with rubble.  In the gazebos there are places for up to four tables with long benches.  The administration claims that there is enough space for celebrations with seventy guests.  Near each gazebo there is a barbecue, where you can cook on wood.  There is a special platform near the lake, where fishermen can go about their business, and people jump into the lake for swimming.  The water is pleasant in the warm season, digestion problems after using the reservoir were not found.  The houses have wood saunas, which also help to relax. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pokurortam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center ranch g pyatigorsk" class="if uuid-2417121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2417121.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative sides </h2><p>  The recreation center "Ranch" in Pyatigorsk is not as beautiful as it might seem from the description on the official resource.  The car access is too inconvenient and movement along the waterfront also leaves much to be desired.  The arbours are too dusty, visitors had to remove the cobwebs before proceeding with cooking.  Lanterns are placed around the perimeter of the pond, and there are refrigerators in the gazebos, but there is no electricity.  Even in the holiday season at the Ranch base in Pyatigorsk, such problems are observed.  Because of this, travelers are faced with not the most pleasant aroma from the refrigerator.  The local toilet is far from the most comfortable, there is no desire to enter it.  Infrastructure for children is poorly developed.  A small playground with a couple of slides, and this is the end for the younger visitors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="plus.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center ranch pyatigorsk prices" class="if uuid-2417123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2417123.jpg"></div><h2>  Prices and totals </h2><p>  The prices at the Rancho recreation center in Pyatigorsk may not suit all visitors.  To rent a gazebo for 10-12 people with a pier will cost three thousand rubles, without it - two.  The cost increases with the number of people and subject to the availability of sofas.  Lease of fishing rods - five hundred rubles, fishing for free - up to three kilograms, and for each next you have to pay extra.  If you rent a bathhouse for eight people, it will cost one and a half thousand rubles.  Room rates - from two and a half thousand.  If to summarize all the facts, then you can come to the Rancho recreation center subject to the proximity of the place of residence.  Residents who have the opportunity to go further to the best places are encouraged to do so.  You can come here for a day with the company, but the service can upset. </p>
