This resort of the Azov coast is suitable for treatment, beach holidays, as well as for relaxing with young children.  Just 60 km from the city is the legendary Salt Lake, which gave the resort the status of a local health resort.  Back in the Soviet years, several sanatoriums and boarding houses were built here, where every year thousands of vacationers improved their health.  On two sides, Yeysk is washed by the waters of the <span>Taganrog Bay,</span> and due to the shallow water inherent in the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, the water here warms up in May. </p>

    <p>  All guests of the recreation center should clearly understand that smoking is prohibited on its territory.  Only cash is accepted, therefore it is necessary to withdraw a certain amount of money from your account or bank card in advance. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  The issue of checking in rooms worries many tourists who come to Yeysk.  The recreation center "Sail" is trying to speed up and simplify the process of settlement.  Some vacationers note that they receive their room keys within 5-10 minutes, sometimes even earlier than the set time.  Nobody will leave tourists on the street if they arrive late in the evening or late at night - the reception is open around the clock. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The hotel rooms are not distinguished by elegance and sophistication, but equipped with everything necessary for relaxation.  Each room has air conditioning, providing coolness and freshness.  A TV with satellite channels helps organize leisure activities in the evening.  The weather in Yeysk is unpredictable, sometimes storms and rain can meet tourists, so the opportunity to have a good time in the room will please many.  The interior is simple, concise, designed in calm colors.  A family with young children, of course, may lack space, but vacationers are likely to spend only night in the apartments. </p>

    <p>  Each room has a private bathroom with all necessary bath amenities.  Towels are changed just a few times a week.  A huge drawback is the lack of a hairdryer in the bathroom and an electric kettle. </p><p>  Vacationers are not advised to take rooms with a view of the peninsula, as the noise and roar of cars will constantly come from the street.  If you go on vacation with young children, be sure to pay attention to this item.  On vacation, few people spend time in the room - most often they come here only to spend the night and take the necessary water procedures.  So, some vacationers complain about sleeping places, or rather, not the most comfortable mattresses and pillows. </p><p>  In rooms where there is no balcony, there may be a problem with drying things.  But if necessary, you can put the dryer on the outdoor terrace. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  "Sail" is a tourist recreation center in Yeysk, impressive for its infrastructure.  All tourists who come here by personal transport will be able to use the free 24-hour parking. </p>

    <p>  On the territory of the recreation center there are two good pools equipped with sunbeds.  Pools are oriented not only for adults, but for children.  By the way, a good playground with swings, slides and a sandbox is equipped for kids. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The recreation center "Parus" (Yeysk) offers accommodation, the price of which includes breakfasts organized in your own cafe.  Vacationers note that breakfasts are really good: porridge is always served, a second course of your choice, pastries, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãtoasts, tea and coffee juices.  The menu is varied, so during the holidays you will definitely not get bored. </p><p>  For an additional fee in the same cafe you can have lunch and dinner.  Vacationers are offered a good menu to choose from, the average cost of a full meal for an adult is 250-300 rubles, dinner - 350-400 rubles.  It is unlikely that you will find more affordable prices in local cafes and restaurants.  The food is delicious, the menu is varied, but many tourists complain about the carelessness of the waiters and staff of the cafe.  When calculating, it is necessary to carefully check the invoice, quite often you can find an error.  Some tourists complain about dirty <span>cutlery</span> and dishes, which, of course, is unacceptable for a cafe. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  If you are looking for a modern place for your vacation with excellent service, you will definitely like Parus (a tourist recreation center in Yeysk).  Reviews of tourists emphasize that throughout the territory you can use wireless high-speed Internet.  The speed is enough to not deny yourself the usual joys, whether it is communication on social networks or watching your favorite shows and movies. </p>
