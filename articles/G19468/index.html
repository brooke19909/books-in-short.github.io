    <h2>  Parents </h2><p>  The future emperor Peter II is the last representative of the Romanov clan in a direct male line.  His parents were Tsarevich <span>Alexei Petrovich</span> and the German Princess Braunschweig-Wolfenb√ºttel Charlotte.  His father was an unloved child, whom the great father constantly tormented.  Alexey‚Äôs marriage was dynastic and he married on the orders of Peter I. Princess Charlotte was also not enthusiastic about the prospect of going to Muscovy as the wife of a strange, clumsy young man who did not pay attention to her. </p><p>  Be that as it may, the wedding took place in 1711.  The marriage lasted only four years, ending with the death of his wife after the birth of a boy named in honor of his grandfather Peter. </p>

    <h2>  Biography: childhood </h2><p>  At the time of birth (October 12, 1715), the future emperor Peter II was the third contender for the Russian throne.  However, this situation did not last very long.  The fact is that a few days later his uncle was born.  The baby was also named Peter, contrary to all customs, and in February 1718 he was declared the heir bypassing his brother - Alexei.  Thus, the childhood of the emperor‚Äôs grandson was bleak and orphaned, since he did not have a mother, and his father, who initially did not show special interest in him, was executed.  Even after the death of Pyotr Petrovich, he was not brought closer to the court, since his grandfather, who decided to examine the tsarevich, discovered his complete ignorance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Question of succession </h2><p>  According to all dynastic laws, after the death of Peter I, his only male heir was to take the throne.  However, many representatives of the great boyar clans, who signed the death sentence to Tsarevich Alexei or related to her, rightly feared for their lives if his son ascended the throne. </p>

    <p>  Thus, two parties were formed at the court: supporting the minor Peter and consisting of his opponents.  The latter received the strongest support of the emperor, who signed a decree on the abolition of previous laws, which allowed the appointment of the heir of anyone whom the monarch deems worthy to take the throne.  Since Peter the Great did not manage to do this during his lifetime, his closest comrade-in-arms, Menshikov, managed to put Empress Catherine on the throne.  However, the omnipotent prince understood that she would not rule for long, and he had the idea to marry the only male Romanov to his daughter Maria.  Thus, over time, he could become the grandfather of the heir to the throne and rule the country at his discretion. </p><p>  To do this, he even upset the engagement of Maria Menshikova and achieved recognition of the proposed son-in-law as a successor to the throne. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Accession to the throne </h2><p>  Catherine I died on May 6, 1727.  When the will was announced, it turned out that she not only appointed her husband‚Äôs grandson as heir, but also ordered everyone to contribute to the conclusion of a marriage between him and the daughter of Alexander Menshikov.  The last will of the empress was fulfilled, however, since Peter II did not reach marriageable age, they confined themselves to the announcement of the engagement.  At the same time, the Supreme Council began to rule the country, which was manipulated by the Most Serene Highness Prince, who was about to become the emperor‚Äôs father-in-law over time. </p>

    <h2>  Peter II: reign </h2><p>  The teenage emperor, due to his age and abilities, was not able to rule on his own.  As a result, power was initially almost entirely in the hands of his alleged father-in-law.  As under Catherine I, the country was controlled by inertia.  Although many courtiers tried to follow the precepts of Peter I, however, the political system he created could not operate effectively without his presence. </p><p>  Nevertheless, Menshikov tried in every possible way to increase the popularity of the young tsar among the people.  For this, he composed two manifestos on his behalf.  According to the first of them, those exiled to hard labor for tax evasion were pardoned, and long-term debts to the treasury were canceled by serfs.  In addition, punishments were significantly eased.  For example, it was forbidden to publicize the bodies of the executed. </p><p>  In the field of foreign trade, the need has also long been ripe for radical reform.  Peter II, or rather Alexander Menshikov, who ruled for him more precisely, reduced the duty on hemp and yarn sold abroad in order to increase treasury income, and Siberian fur trading was generally exempted from paying the state interest on income. </p><p>  Menshikov's other concern was the prevention of palace intrigues in order to overthrow his power.  To do this, he, as he could, tried to caress his long-time associates.  In particular, on behalf of the emperor, he awarded the rank of Field Marshal to Princes Dolgorukov and Trubetskoy, as well as Burkhard Minikh.  Menshikov bestowed upon himself the rank of commander in chief and generalissimo of the Russian army. </p>

    <h2>  Change of power </h2><p>  With age, the young emperor began to cool to the Menshikovs.  In this matter, Osterman played an important role, who was his educator and tried in every possible way to wrest his disciple from the claws of the Most Holy Prince.  He was helped by <span>Ivan Dolgoruky,</span> who wanted to marry Peter II to his sister, Princess Catherine. </p><p>  When Menshikov fell ill in the summer of 1727, his opponents showed the young emperor investigation materials in the <span>case of Tsarevich Alexei.</span>  Of these, he learned about the role of the father of his bride in the matter of conviction and execution of the son of Peter I. </p><p>  When Menshikov returned to work, it turned out that the future son-in-law left his palace and now he discusses all issues only with Osterman and Dolgoruky. </p><p>  Soon the <span>Most High Prince</span> was accused of embezzlement and treason, and his family was exiled to the Tobolsk Territory. </p><p>  Peter II himself moved to Moscow and announced his engagement to Catherine Dolgoruky.  Now he indulged in entertainment, and the state was ruled by the relatives of his bride. </p><h2>  Death </h2><p>  On January 6, 1730, after water lighting on the Moscow River, Peter II took a military parade and became very cold.  On arrival home, it turned out that he had smallpox.  According to witnesses, in delirium he was eager to go to see his sister Natalya, who had died several years before.  The emperor died 12 days later and became the last Russian ruler to be buried in the Kremlin's Archangel Cathedral. </p>

    <h2>  Personality of Peter II </h2><p>  According to the memoirs of contemporaries, the teenage emperor was not distinguished by either intelligence or hard work.  In addition, he was poorly educated, which is not surprising when you consider that he was never properly supervised by adults.  His whims and bad manners often puzzled the ambassadors and foreigners who came to Russia and were presented to the court.  Even if he could survive to adulthood, it is unlikely that his rule would be successful for the country. </p>
