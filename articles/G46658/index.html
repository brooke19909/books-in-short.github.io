Culture of medieval japan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The features of Japan and its historical development are clearly visible today.  Over the centuries, this distinctive country has been able to carry almost unchanged a special culture, in many respects different even from the one that originated in the territory of its closest neighbors.  The main features of the traditions characteristic of Japan appeared in the early Middle Ages.  Even then, the art of the developing people was marked by a desire to approach nature, an understanding of its beauty and harmony. </p><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  Medieval Japan, located on the islands, was protected from intrusion by nature itself.  The influence of the outside world on the country was mainly expressed in the process of interaction of residents with Koreans and Chinese.  Moreover, the Japanese often fought with the former, while the latter adopted a lot. </p><p>  The internal development of the country was inextricably linked to <span>natural conditions.</span>  On relatively small islands, there is practically nowhere to go from formidable typhoons and earthquakes.  Therefore, on the one hand, the Japanese tried not to burden themselves with unnecessary things, so that at any moment it was easy to collect all the essentials and escape from the raging elements. </p><p>  On the other hand, it was thanks to such conditions that the culture of medieval Japan acquired its own characteristics.  The inhabitants of the islands were aware of the power of the elements and their inability to oppose it to anything, they felt the strength and at the same time harmony of nature.  And sought not to violate it.  <span>The art of medieval</span> Japan developed against the background of Shintoism, which was based on worship of the spirits of the elements, and then Buddhism, welcoming the contemplative comprehension of the inner and outer world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First state </h2><p>  On the <span>island of Honshu</span> in the III-V centuries.  Yamato tribal federation formed.  By the 4th century, the first Japanese state was formed on its basis, headed by Tenno (emperor).  Medieval Japan of that period is revealed to scientists in the process of studying the contents of burial mounds.  In their very structure, the connection between the country's architecture and nature is felt: the mound resembles an island covered with trees, surrounded by a moat with water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medieval japan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/666348.jpg"></div>  Various household items were placed in the burial, and the rest of the deceased ruler was guarded by the hollow ceramic figures of the khaniva, located on the surface of the mound.  These small figurines show how observant Japanese masters were: they depicted people and animals, noting the slightest features, and were able to convey mood and character traits.

    <p>  The first religion of Japan, Shintoism, deified all nature, inhabiting the spirits of every tree or pond.  The temples were built in mountainous and wooded areas of wood ("living" material).  The architecture was very simple and as much as possible fit into the surrounding nature.  The temples had no decorations, the buildings seemed to flow smoothly into the landscape.  The culture of medieval Japan sought to combine nature and man-made structures.  And the temples clearly demonstrate this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The formation of feudalism </h2><p>  Japan in the Middle Ages borrowed a lot in China and Korea: features of legislation and land administration, writing and statehood.  Through neighbors, Buddhism also entered the country, which played a large role in its development.  He helped to overcome the internal disunity of the country, to unite the tribes into which Japan was divided.  The periods of Asuka (552-645) and Nara (645-794) were characterized by the formation of feudalism, the development of a distinctive culture based on borrowed elements. </p><p>  The art of that time was inextricably linked with the construction of buildings that had sacred significance.  A magnificent example of a Buddhist temple of this period is Khoruji, a monastery built near Nara, the first capital of Japan.  Everything in it is striking: magnificent interior decoration, the bulk of the five-tiered pagoda, the massive roof of the main structure, supported by intricate brackets.  The architecture of the complex is noticeable as the influence of the traditions of Chinese construction, and the distinctive features that distinguished Japan in the Middle Ages.  There is no scope typical for shrines built on the expanses of the Middle Kingdom.  <span>Japanese temples</span> were more compact, even miniature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Japan in the Middle Ages" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/666345.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The most impressive <span>Buddhist temples</span> began to be erected in the VIII century, when a centralized medieval state was formed.  Japan needed a capital, and it became Nara, built on the Chinese model.  The temples here were built to match the scale of the city. </p><h2>  Sculpture </h2><p>  Fine art developed in the same way as architecture - from imitation of Chinese masters towards the acquisition of an ever-greater identity.  Initially detached from the earthly statue of deities, they began to be filled with expression and emotionality, characteristic of ordinary people rather than celestials. </p><p>  A peculiar result of the development of the sculpture of this time is a 16-meter-high Buddha statue located in the Todaiji Monastery.  It is the result of the merger of many techniques used during the Nara period: casting, the finest engraving, chasing, forging.  Huge and bright, she deserves the title of a wonder of the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="culture of medieval japan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/666349.jpg"></div>

    <p>  At the same time, sculptural portraits of people appear, mainly church servants.  The buildings were decorated with paintings depicting paradise worlds. </p><h2>  New round </h2><p>  Changes in the culture of Japan, which began in the 9th century, are associated with the political processes of this time.  The country's capital was moved to Heian, known today under the name Kyoto.  By the middle of the century, a policy of isolation had developed, medieval Japan was fenced off from its neighbors, and ceased to accept ambassadors.  Culture has become increasingly estranged from the Chinese. </p><p>  The Heian period (IX-XII centuries) - the heyday of the famous Japanese poetry.  Tanka (five-hundredth) was accompanied by the Japanese constantly.  It is no coincidence that this period is called the golden age of Japanese poetry.  It, perhaps, most fully expressed the attitude of the inhabitants of the Land of the Rising Sun to the world, his understanding of the deep connection of man with nature, the ability to notice beauty even in insignificant.  Psychology and a special philosophy of poetry permeate all the art of the Heian period: architecture, painting, prose. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="features of japan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/666346.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Temples and secular buildings </h2><p>  The features of Japan of that time were largely associated with the emergence of Buddhist sects, combining the teachings of the Buddha and the traditions of Shintoism.  Monasteries and temples again began to be located outside the city walls - in forests and on the mountains.  They did not have a clear plan, as if by chance appeared among trees or hills.  Nature itself served as a decoration, the buildings looked as simple as possible.  The landscape seemed to be a continuation of architectural structures.  The monasteries did not oppose nature, but harmoniously fit into it. </p><p>  Secular buildings were created by the same principle.  Shinden, the main pavilion of the estate, was a single space, if necessary divided by screens.  Each building was necessarily accompanied by a garden, often quite small, and sometimes, as in the emperor’s palace, equipped with ponds, bridges and gazebos.  All medieval Asia could not boast of such gardens.  Japan, having processed styles and elements borrowed from China, created its own architecture, inextricably linked with nature. </p><h2>  Painting </h2><p>  The sculpture has changed: new images have appeared, plastic has become more sophisticated and multi-colored.  However, most notably national features manifested themselves in painting.  In the XI-XII centuries, a new style emerged - Yamato-e.  Water paints were used for it.  First of all, Yamato-e was used to illustrate various texts.  At this time, prose was actively developing, scrolls-tales, or emakimonos appeared, which embodied a poetic worldview and reverence for nature, characteristic of medieval Japanese.  As a rule, such texts were accompanied by illustrations.  Yamato-e masters were able to convey the greatness of nature and the emotional experiences of people, using various colors, achieving the effect of flicker and translucency. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medieval asia japan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/666344.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A poetic understanding of the world is also noticeable in the lacquerware of that time - literally luminous caskets and bowls, smooth musical instruments, and gilded chests. </p><h2>  Minamoto Dynasty </h2><p>  At the end of the XII century, due to the feudal war, the <span>capital of Japan was</span> again moved.  The victorious Minamoto clan made Kamakura the main city of the country.  All medieval Japan was subordinate to the new ruler.  Briefly, the Kamakura period can be described as the time of the shogunate - military rule.  It lasted several centuries.  The state became controlled by special warriors - samurai.  In Japan, with their coming to power, new cultural characteristics began to take shape.  The tank poetry was replaced by the hunks - heroic epics, praising the courage of warriors.  In religion, Zen Buddhism began to play a significant role, learning to achieve salvation on earth through physical training, volitional effort and deep self-knowledge.  The external gloss did not matter, the ritual side of religion faded into the background. </p><p>  Samurai in Japan laid a special culture of spirit, honor and devotion.  The masculinity and strength inherent in them permeated all art from architecture to painting.  Monasteries began to be built without pagodas, the sophistication of the Heian period disappeared from them.  The temples resembled simple huts, which only strengthened their unity with nature.  A large number of sculptural portraits appeared.  Masters learned new techniques that allowed them to create images that seemed alive.  At the same time, in poses, forms and compositions, all the same masculinity and severity came through. </p><p>  The emakimonos of this time are characterized not by the emotionality of the characters, but by the dynamism of the stories telling about the bloody wars between the clans. </p><h2>  Garden - continuation of the house </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="art of medieval japan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/666343.jpg"></div></h2><p>  In 1333, the capital was returned to Heian.  New rulers began to patronize art.  The architecture of this period is characterized by an even closer unity with nature.  Strictness and simplicity began to coexist with poetry and beauty.  The teachings of the Zen sect came to the fore, which sang spiritual exaltation through contemplation of nature, harmonization with it. </p><p>  During this period, the art of ikebana developed, and houses began to be built in such a way that in different parts of the home one could admire the garden from a slightly different angle.  A small piece of nature often did not separate from the house even by a threshold; it was a continuation of it.  This is most clearly seen in the Ginkakuji building, where a veranda was built, flowing smoothly into the garden and hanging over the pond.  The man who was in the house created the illusion that there was no border between the living room and the water and the garden, that these were two parts of a single whole. </p><h2>  Tea as a philosophy </h2><p>  In the XV-XVI centuries, tea houses began to appear in Japan.  Slow enjoyment of a drink brought from China has become a ritual.  Tea houses looked like hermitage huts.  They were equipped in such a way that the ceremony participants could feel separated from the outside world.  The small size of the room and paper-covered windows created a special atmosphere and mood.  Everything - from the cobblestone path leading to the door, to simple pottery and the sound of boiling water - was filled with poetry and a philosophy of peace. </p><h2>  Monochrome painting </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medieval japan briefly" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/666342.jpg"></div></h2><p>  In parallel with the art of gardening and the tea ceremony, painting also developed.  The history of medieval Japan and its culture in the XIV-XV centuries.  marked by the appearance of suiboku-ha - ink painting.  The paintings of the new genre were monochrome landscape sketches placed on scrolls.  Masters of suiboku-ha, having adopted the features of painting from the Chinese, quickly brought <span>Japanese</span> originality to the <span>painting</span> .  They learned to convey the beauty of nature, its mood, grandeur and mystery.  At the beginning of the XVI century, the techniques of suiboku-ha organically merged with the techniques of Yamato-e, giving rise to a new style in painting. </p><h2>  Late middle ages </h2><p>  The map of medieval Japan by the end of the 16th century ceased to be a “patchwork quilt” from the possessions of various clans.  The unification of the country began.  Began to establish contacts with Western states.  Secular architecture now played a significant role.  The terrible shogun castles during the period of peace became palaces with solemnly decorated chambers.  The halls were delimited by sliding partitions, decorated with paintings and scattering light in a special way, creating a festive atmosphere. </p><p>  The painting by masters of the Kano school, which developed at that time, covered not only screens, but also the walls of the palaces.  Picturesque paintings were distinguished by rich colors that convey the splendor and solemnity of nature.  New plots appeared - images of everyday life of ordinary people.  Present in the palaces and monochrome painting, which acquired a special expressiveness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of medieval japan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25738/666347.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Most often, monochrome painting adorned tea houses, where the atmosphere of tranquility was preserved, alien to the solemnity of the castle chambers.  The combination of simplicity and splendor pervades the entire culture of the Edo period (XVII-XIX centuries).  At this time, medieval Japan again pursued a policy of isolation.  New forms of art appeared expressing a particular attitude of the Japanese: the Kabuki theater, woodcut, short stories. </p><p>  The Edo period is characterized by the proximity of magnificent decoration of castles and modest tea houses, the traditions of Yamato-e and painting techniques of the late 16th century.  The combination of different artistic movements and crafts is clearly visible in engravings.  Masters of different directions often worked together, moreover, sometimes the same artist painted both fans and screens, and prints and boxes. </p><p>  The late Middle Ages is characterized by increased attention to the subject content of everyday life: new fabrics appear, porcelain is used, the costume is changed.  The latter is associated with the emergence of netsuke, which are small peculiar buttons or key chains.  They became a definite result of the development of the sculpture of the Land of the Rising Sun. </p><p>  The culture of Japan is difficult to confuse with the results of the work of creative thought of other peoples.  Her identity developed in special natural conditions.  The constant proximity to the inexorable element gave rise to a special philosophy of striving for harmony, which manifested itself in all areas of art and craft. </p>
