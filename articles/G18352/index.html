  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crochet patterns: original ideas, description with photos, tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A high-quality scheme, an understandable and accessible description and the golden hands of a craftswoman are all that is needed to create an exclusive, original product made by one's own hands.  The crochet technique is quite simple and it‚Äôs not difficult for beginners to figure it out. </p><h2>  Crochet Techniques: Pattern Features </h2><p>  Many crochet work is done in several of the most common techniques.  And, accordingly, the schemes are also compiled and read in different ways.  Below are the most popular crochet techniques. </p><ol><li>  Crochet loin technique.  Its peculiarity is that its basis is the alternation in a given order of only two simple elements: an air loop and a single crochet column.  Therefore, crochet patterns here are very simple and read no more complicated than cross-stitch patterns. </li><li>  Openwork crochet technique.  This species is the most common and variable.  Almost all garments of stunning beauty, lace tablecloths and napkins, shawls and wraps are connected exactly with the technique of openwork knitting.  Patterns of openwork crochet can be either simple or complex, they often contain all the elements of crochet. </li><li>  Technique "Irish lace".  A distinctive feature is that the products made in this technique consist of separately connected elements that are connected together using a mesh of air loops.  Knitting patterns for these elements are very similar to <span>openwork knitting</span> patterns <span>.</span> </li><li>  The Bargello technique.  A very interesting look that imitates Florentine embroidery with its patterns and color combinations.  Used to create various <span>plaids, bedspreads</span> and some items of clothing.  It is distinguished by the monotony of patterns, so knitting patterns are very simple and understandable. </li><li>  Freeform.  It is very similar to the technique of Irish lace, however, the name itself (in translation ‚Äúfree form‚Äù) indicates that all the elements - scrambles, which make up a single product, are made in a free manner, from yarn of different textures and using various techniques.  The main difference is that the elements are stitched or joined together during the knitting process, and are not fastened with a net.  The schemes in this technique are also not specific and can be adjusted by knitters independently. </li></ol><h2>  Symbols of elements in diagrams </h2><p>  Patterns for crocheting patterns differ from other types of needlework in a rather extensive set of elements and symbols for them.  All of them are fairly standardized and rarely differ.  Most often, each specific scheme is accompanied by its own table of symbols for the elements, so the one presented below is one of the approximate options. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Legend" class="if uuid-2688643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100271/2688643.jpg"></div><h2>  How to read them correctly </h2><p>  There are some rules for reading patterns that can help you master any crochet technique, even if you're still a beginner. </p><ol><li>  Understand the conventions of all the elements in the diagram.  See in advance how unfamiliar elements are performed. </li><li>  Crochet patterns are always read from the bottom up.  If it is a circle, then reading starts from the center. </li><li>  Remember that the rows are read by the "snake" in turn: first from right to left, and then from left to right. </li><li>  A section of the circuit, bounded on both sides by arrows or lines, is called "rapport."  It means that it must be repeated as many times as necessary. </li></ol><h2>  Fillet knitting: products with a photo </h2><p>  The technique of fillet crocheting (the diagram and description are presented below) is very similar to cross-stitch.  The pattern is formed due to the alternation of empty cells (single crochet, two air stitches, single crochet) and filled (four single crochet).  With sufficient dexterity, you can easily turn your favorite two-color cross-stitch patterns into a crocheted pattern. </p><p>  Tablecloths, napkins, wall paintings, tops and sundresses, and much more are performed in fillet binding. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order to decorate the interior of your home, you can associate a beautiful snow-white napkin with a pattern of roses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bianzhirensheng.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Napkin made using sirloin technique" class="if uuid-2688358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100271/2688358.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting pattern is read from bottom to top.  The diagram shows very clearly which of the cells are crocheted from columns with a crochet, and which remain empty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bianzhirensheng.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting pattern for napkins" class="if uuid-2688360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100271/2688360.jpg"></div><p>  A product made with a sirloin crochet, the scheme of which is presented above, is original and easy to perform.  The finished napkin can be starched or steamed with an iron so that it keeps its shape well. </p><h2>  Openwork crochet: patterns of patterns with photos </h2><div class="photo" data-original="yourcrochet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Children's openwork plaid with a fan pattern" class="if uuid-2688408" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100271/2688408.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most common and embossed crochet patterns is the fan.  They can knit warm shawls and light capes, baby rugs and bedspreads on the bed.  If you create a fan with swivel rows in a straight line, then you can decorate the hem of a skirt or sundress. </p><div class="photo" data-original="551991.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fan pattern" class="if uuid-2688417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100271/2688417.jpg"></div><p>  Above is a knitting pattern for shawls with a fan pattern.  The triangular shawl is knitted in rotary rows (they are indicated in the diagram in different colors).  Knitting begins with a chain of 6 air loops, closed in a ring.  Make three lifting loops, two single crochet stitches, an air loop, three double crochet stitches, and then follow the pattern. </p><p>  To get a square, knitting must be done in a circle.  The colors of the rows of fans can be alternated - so the plaid or shawl will turn out more vivid and interesting. </p><h2>  Bargello technique </h2><p>  Knitwear made in this technique, with its color combination and wavy pattern, resembles the famous Florentine embroidery "bargello".  Below are the methods of crocheting with patterns. </p><p>  The plaids, bedspreads, pillows, as well as sundresses and skirts created in this style look very harmonious.  At the same time, schemes of such patterns are simple in execution; a successful color combination plays a decisive role in products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.woman7.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wave pattern" class="if uuid-2688580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100271/2688580.jpg"></div><p>  The photo shows the crochet pattern of the braid with a "wave" pattern.  In order to use it in knitting a summer sundress, you just need to continue the rows with columns with one vertex above.  Do not forget to pre-make a pattern if you decide to choose a piece of clothing to create. </p><h2>  Original ideas for combining techniques in one product </h2><p>  Do you want to create an original gift with your own hands, but do not know what to come up with?  If you are fluent in knitting techniques, you can take crochet patterns in several techniques and combine them into one product.  For example, using sirloin, you can tie a name or a favorite saying, pick up an openwork border and get a very unusual present.  For example, you can use the schemes of the crocheted alphabet, and based on them create your own words.  And a lacy pattern can serve as a fan pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsystudio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alphabet in the technique of sirloin knitting" class="if uuid-2688305" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100271/2688305.jpg"></div><p>  Such words or just the initial letters of the name can be placed on the pillows - it turns out a beautiful and useful gift.  Knitting is carried out from the bottom up by rotary rows, separately the front and back sides.  Details are then simply stitched together in the form of a pillowcase. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="On such pillows you can add a lace border" class="if uuid-2688300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100271/2688300.jpg"></div><h2>  Useful tips for needlewomen </h2><p>  In order to avoid mistakes in the knitting process, it is necessary to adhere to the following rules: </p><ol><li>  Choose yarn and crochet correctly before starting needlework.  If you find a ready-made description of the product, please note that before the description of the knitting technique it is always indicated which types of yarn and which hook number is suitable for the product you have chosen. </li><li>  Always keep an eye on how many lifting loops or pivoting loops you make at the beginning of each new row.  If their number does not match, the knitting fabric is skewed and the product will lose its appearance, so study the crochet patterns very carefully. </li><li>  If the size of the future product is very important to you, then before proceeding with it, knit a sample.  So you can estimate the density of knitting and make the necessary calculations. </li><li>  It is not necessary to iron the finished product with an iron, it is better to simply sprinkle it with water and steam through gauze.  And those with a relief pattern are best steamed on a pillow. </li><li>  When making calculations, remember that the finished product is almost always stretched when washing or steaming.  Therefore, it is better to make it shorter by 1-2 centimeters. </li></ol><p>  Use your skill and imagination, do not be afraid of experimentation, and do-it-yourself things will delight you and your loved ones for a long time. </p>
