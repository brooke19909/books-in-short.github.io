    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  Perhaps the first thing that many people have mentioned about this hotel is its proximity to the airport.  So, according to them, after arrival at the hotel you will be in 20 minutes.  This is very convenient if you have a night flight or if you are traveling with small children. </p><p>  As for the rooms, our compatriots claim that they were satisfied in this regard.  So, the apartments here are quite spacious, clean, with a fresh repair, new furniture and modern appliances.  Guests note that maids carried out cleaning and changing towels and bed linen every day.  Some guests, however, mentioned that sometimes they forgot to bring water, but this trifle, of course, could not spoil the rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sarp hotels belek 4 turkey belek" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/923595.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Opinions of our compatriots on the territory and location of the hotel </h2><p>  The territory of Sarp Hotels Belek, according to tourists, is small.  However, it is very clean and well maintained.  Also, guests were satisfied with the location of the hotel.  After all, it is located in the very center of the city, surrounded by a mass of shops, retail outlets, souvenir shops, restaurants, bars and other infrastructure.  So, if you forget at home, for example, flip flops or a panama hat, then you can purchase these and other things here at a very attractive price. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  On this issue, the opinions of guests of Sarp Hotels Belek 4 * (Turkey, Belek), oddly enough, agree in many respects.  So, most of the guests considered the <span>food in the hotel</span> not diverse enough.  In addition, some guests claim that they lacked meat dishes.  However, of course, all tourists recognize that the food was prepared very high quality and delicious.  In addition, guests celebrate a large selection of sweets and fruits.  But they still advise the administration to pay more attention to the variety of dishes.  As for drinks, there were no complaints from guests here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel sarp hotel 4 belek belek" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/923594.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment Comments </h2><p>  Due to the fact that almost all travelers traveling to Turkey in the summer expect to spend unforgettable days swimming in the warm sea, the opinion of other tourists about the beach is of great importance.  As for the Sarp Hotels Belek 4 *, the reviews we are reviewing, it is located a short distance from the coast.  However, according to the guests, there is a shuttle service to the hotel‚Äôs own beach on a comfortable bus.  It is only five minutes to go to the shore, but experienced travelers do not recommend walking, since it is very hot in the summer and, it would seem, a short road can be difficult. </p><p>  The beach itself is clean, sandy.  Sunset at sea gentle.  Guests note that, despite the large influx of people, there were always enough sunbeds for everyone. </p><p>  As for entertainment on site, you can have a great time by the pool.  According to the guests, the water is always clean, comfortable temperature.  There are water slides on which both adult vacationers and children enjoy riding.  There are sun loungers on the sun terrace.  True, in the midst of the season, everyone may not have enough sun loungers.  There is also a bar where you can order a soft or alcoholic drink. </p><p>  Animations as such the Sarp Hotels <span>Belek 4 *</span> hotel (Belek, Turkey) does not offer.  Music plays here day and night, so everyone can dance or even have a party.  You can play volleyball on the beach or enjoy water sports (for an additional fee). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sarp hotels belek 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/923593.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Guest opinion about staff </h2><p>  About the staff of the Sarp Hotels Belek 4 * hotel reviews, for the most part, guests leave positive.  So, many Russian tourists say that the staff here is very friendly, helpful, always ready to help.  If, for example, you don‚Äôt like something about the room offered to you, you can always ask to be relocated.  As a rule, there are no problems with this.  In addition, tourists try to check in the room as soon as possible after arrival, despite the fact that, according to the rules of the hotel, entry is expected only after two in the afternoon.  Also, reception administrators do their best to solve any problems that guests may have. </p>
