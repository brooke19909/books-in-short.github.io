A brief overview of water activities in the resort</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Water parks today will not surprise anyone.  They are in any more or less large city.  But, you must admit, when the slides are indoors - this is one thing, and when in the middle of the magnificent southern nature, in the fresh air - this is completely different.  In the seaside resorts, water parks are especially in demand.  After all, the sea can be stormy, and it’s boring to lie on crowded beaches without much entertainment.  Arkhipo-Osipovka is a resort in the Krasnodar Territory of Russia, which is famous for the largest number of sunny days a year on the entire Black Sea coast.  Many travelers prefer beach vacations at the water park.  Arkhipo-Osipovka offers a choice of several such water sports towns.  Which one to choose?  In this article you will find a brief overview of all the water parks of the resort.  Prices are for summer 2017. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arkhipo Osipovka water park coconut paradise reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2186500.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Coconut Paradise </h2><p>  We begin our review with a central water park.  Indeed, you must admit that I want to ride a water slide near the sea.  Waterpark "Coconut Paradise" in Arkhipo-Osipovka in the reviews, visitors are very praised.  Especially a lot of mention of its good location.  It is located in the Malibu Amusement Park, very close to the central beach.  True, "Coconut Paradise" - this is just part of the rides - water.  Most reviews praise Malibu.  This park has a large Ferris wheel, and attractions for children and adults, and a 5D cinema, as well as restaurants, nightclubs and discos.  And in “Coconut Paradise” there are only three slides (two straight and one spiral) and three pools.  But this water park visitors do not praise for the rides.  Coconut Paradise is a luxurious alternative to a beach holiday.  There is a whole zone for relaxation.  There are many sun loungers, umbrellas, a cafe.  And the kids are entertained at the playground by a team of animators.  In this water park Arkhipo-Osipovka there are three pools, one of them is for children.  Water is not chlorinated, but has undergone a modern treatment system.  At night, the water park hosts parties for adults. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arkhipo Osipovka water park emerald city" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2186482.jpg"></div>

It pleases holidaymakers since 2012.  Its location is also very favorable - almost the center of the resort village.  The Emerald City operates from June to September inclusive.  Unlike Coconut Paradise, which is positioning itself rather as a place for a relaxing beach holiday in the afternoon and discos in the evening, this is a real water park.  That is, if you miss the adrenaline rush, then you should come here, because in Coconut Paradise with its three slides it will be boring.  What does the Emerald City water park in Arkhipo-Osipovka offer visitors?  There are 21 slides for children and 13 runs for adults.  It is worth coming here with the whole family and for the whole day.  The infrastructure of the Emerald City is well developed.  There is a restaurant, a cafe with set meals, and a snack bar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterpark Arkhipo Osipovka" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2186449.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What do the reviews about the Emerald City say? </h2><p>  Just look at the photo of the water park Arkhipo-Osipovka to understand: you are provided with adrenaline.  Not every adult dares to descend from some slides.  “Draghero”, “Space Funnel”, bright orange “Navigator”, blue-green fully closed pipe “Darkness”: those who love extreme sports will definitely like it here.  Vacationers in reviews recommend families with children to ride down the Multislide.  On some attractions only teenagers are allowed.  But for little children there are fun slides.  And a whole, almost real, pirate ship.  By the way, the work of the animators here is no worse than in Coconut Paradise.  In addition to water activities, this water kingdom has sports grounds, yoga and aqua aerobics classes.  Kids up to 4 years old go to this Arkhipo-Osipovka water park for free.  For children from 5 to 14, admission for the whole day costs 700 rubles, and after 13:00 - one hundred rubles cheaper.  The price of an adult ticket is 1000 and 900 rubles.  respectively. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterpark Arkhipo Osipovka photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2186453.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels with water park </h2><p>  If you come to the sea with a restless teenager who needs a roller coaster every day, then the best solution for finding accommodation would be a hotel that offers its residents water activities.  The best of such places, vacationers consider the hotel complex "Albatross".  It is located very close to the beaches of Arkhipo-Osipovka.  The water park of the hotel consists of extreme attractions for adults and low slides for children.  All these slopes go to different pools.  And at the hotel you can soak in the spacious bath with hydromassage, sunbathe in the two-story solarium and enjoy the fountains.  For hotel guests use the water park for free. </p>
