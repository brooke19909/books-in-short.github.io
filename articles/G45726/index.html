    <p>  Often leave negative reviews about “Just borrow” debtors.  Employees threaten them, are rude, say false information.  Clients say that people working in the company make phone calls, introduce themselves as law enforcement officers, and invite them to the police station to sign documents drawn up after an alleged court hearing.  In the police, no one could clarify the situation.  Nobody knew about any court or documents.  After such cases, some clients write a statement to the prosecutor. </p><p>  Negative reviews about the MFI “Take it Easy” are also written by the <span>contact persons of the</span> borrowers.  They claim that they began to be tormented by constant calls and messages when a debt occurred to their friend, relative or friend who applied for a loan.  Employees of the microfinance organization demanded the return of the debt, threatened that the departure of employees was planned.  When asked to stop calling and sending messages, they talked about the impossibility of removing the contact number from the database. </p><h2>  Tips for users of the online service </h2><p>  Before applying for a loan, consider whether you can pay the amount taken with accrued interest.  So that in the future there are no problems, you must have a constant source of income, you should not have open court proceedings for the recovery of existing debts. </p>

    <p>  If you find yourself in a difficult financial situation, contact a microfinance institution employee by phone and extend the loan by paying only interest.  If you ignore this, then ruin your credit history.  In the future, you will have problems with obtaining loans and credits from other companies and banks.  You will also increase the total amount to be returned in connection with the calculation of interest and penalties.  Remember that you can renew a microloan agreement only 5 times. </p><p>  Provide reliable information about yourself if you are only going to apply for a microloan in “Take it Easy.”  Testimonials from people indicate that all data is checked by employees of a microfinance organization.  By indicating lies you can only ruin the situation.  Deceptive beginners, as a rule, are refused a loan after sending an application and talking on the phone. </p>
