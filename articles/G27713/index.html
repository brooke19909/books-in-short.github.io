There are so many options, and each subscriber is able to choose the solution that seems to him the most simple and attractive.  Please note that not all methods are in great demand.  Some of the proposed methods of tariff changes have a place to be, but in practice they are rarely used.  Nevertheless, you need to know about them.  How can I <span>change the tariff for Beeline?</span>  Internet, telephone and communications - no matter what is at stake.  The main thing is that there is far from one solution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="change the tariff on the beeline" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1136598.jpg" width="542"></div>

    <h2>  Call operator </h2><p>  Firstly, you can simply choose a tariff plan and call the company in order to change the plan on the SIM card.  To do this, dial 0611 and wait for an answer.  Next, communicate your intentions.  If the tariff has not yet been selected, you will be offered assistance.  Agree or not - decide for yourself. </p><p>  In any case, as soon as the tariff is selected, say that you can connect it.  An application will be drawn up for you.  After that, a few minutes later you will receive an alert in the form of SMS with the result.  Usually two letters come: the first - about the successful execution of the application, the second - about the direct change of tariff.  Nothing difficult or supernatural. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now we know how to change the tariff on Beeline.  But, as already mentioned, this is not the best solution.  Sometimes it makes sense to go some other way to solve the problem. </p><h2>  Room purchase </h2><p>  You can change the Beeline tariff (Kazakhstan or any locality) by purchasing a new SIM card.  In this case, you will not only change your plan, but also your phone number.  Sometimes such actions are very useful. </p><p>  To purchase a SIM card, just contact any Beeline office or operator‚Äôs outlet.  After that, make a deal.  You may need a passport for her.  Insert the SIM card into your mobile device and enjoy the result.  This option is relevant in some cases, for example, when there is a tariff, but you can‚Äôt switch to it.  This rule usually applies to the latest news from the company. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="change the tariff for Beeline Internet" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1136599.jpg" width="589"></div>

    <h2>  Personal visit </h2><p>  Well, since we will find out all the existing methods that help to change the tariff on Beeline, it is worth considering one more not the most popular trick.  A personal visit to the operator‚Äôs office is another tip that deserves attention. </p><p>  To change your tariff on your mobile phone, you just need to go to the nearest mobile office of our current operator and communicate your desire.  They will help you to choose a plan and bring the idea to life.  Maybe, as already mentioned, you will have to purchase a new SIM card.  But if this is not your case, then the office staff will simply fill out an application for connection to the selected tariff.  And all, you can expect the result.  Believe me, he will not keep you waiting.  This technique is somewhat reminiscent of a call to the operator.  But a personal visit is in great demand.  After all, you can always chat in parallel with a Beeline employee who will answer all your questions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Combinations </h2><p>  Now a little about self-service methods.  Just they are the most popular among subscribers.  You can change the tariff on a Beeline modem or phone using special combinations.  They are usually called USSD commands.  The implementation technique is extremely simple: you type on the mobile request (or on the computer using a special Internet assistant), and then send it for processing.  By the way, all this is free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="change the tariff on a beeline modem" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1136600.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The main problem is finding out the USSD combination.  Each tariff or operator services has it.  You can find all information from the Beeline operator.  He will be able to tell you in detail about all the offers of the company.  Usually USSD commands are processed within 2-5 minutes.  This is a modern and effective way to solve the task set before us today. </p><h2>  Inquiries </h2><p>  Another solution is to send an SMS request to Beeline.  Change the tariff on the phone?  Easy!  If you did not like the previous methods, you can well formulate a specific message and send it to a short number.  Each offer has its own SMS request.  In principle, if you choose between the USSD command and the message, it is better to choose the first.  SMS requests are processed for a long time, and sometimes minor network failures do not allow operations to undergo processing.  All this will interfere with the tariff change on the phone and on the modem. </p>

    <h2>  Internet to help </h2><p>  Change the tariff for Beeline?  Easy!  The most recent option that you can offer is to use the services of the company‚Äôs website.  It is here that there is the so-called "My Account".  He is needed there! </p><p>  Register on the Beeline Corporation website.  If you did this earlier, then it will be enough to log in using your username and password.  You will be in the "My Account".  Find the "Rates" item in the "Services" section.  Now you need to carefully review all the offers and choose a plan for yourself.  Ready? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline to change the tariff on the phone" class="if" height="246" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1136602.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Then we open the page with the description of the offer.  At the very bottom will be the inscription "Connect".  Click on it and confirm your actions.  To do this, you will receive a security secret code in an SMS message.  Once it is entered and confirmed, we can talk about a successful solution to the problem.  This method is relevant for all services, and this is how you can easily and simply change the tariff on a modem or router.  The main thing is to know what exactly you want to connect to your SIM card.  From now on, you can change the tariff on "Beeline" by any method that seems to you the best.  This is very convenient, because most of them do not require outside help.  So, you can use them at any time. </p>
