  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Start of typography</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The invention of printing is undoubtedly associated with the creation of a <span>printing press.</span>  This event is considered revolutionary in the history of book business.  The start of typography has given a tremendous boost to literacy.  This was due to the rapid spread of human wisdom, accumulated over the centuries, cultural creations.  Among the world's population, craving for reading increased sharply, which contributed to the development of the cult of knowledge. </p><p>  It should be noted that the invention of the printing press was not a spontaneous event.  All its elements were formed gradually.  In different eras, the functional parts of the machine acquired various forms. </p><p>  There is various information about who initiated printing.  History describes the first book publishing experiments in Korea, Mongolia, Japan, and China in the 10-11 centuries.  But, unfortunately, the really created books, so many times described, have not reached our days.  That is why it is believed that the beginning of typography was laid by Johann Guttenberg (1399-1468).  Combining the various technologies that existed then in production, he invented the then perfect way to publish a book.  First, Guttenberg became the founder of the new font.  Instead of individual letters, metal stamps cast in a mirror image began to be used.  They were pressed into a <span>copper plate, the</span> recesses were poured with a special alloy, which contained antimony, lead and tin.  Thus, it became possible to cast words and letters in large volumes. </p><p>  Guttenberg in 1450 began to publish the full version of the Bible (the first in Europe).  Between 1452 and 1454 (according to various sources) he managed to print a 42-line edition.  The Bible was called so due to the fact that on each page (total pages were 1282) there were 42 lines in two columns. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Guttenberg's students (Pannartzt and Svengame) began to spread the invention of publishing technology in Europe.  Thus, the beginning of printing contributed to the creation of a new branch of culture and production at the same time - printing.  Due to the fact that the concept of "publishing" was absent in those days, the new specialty involved the complete perception of the case, including the sale of publications in shops at printing houses. </p><p>  In the history of publishing, 1500 is considered a landmark year.  By this time, the production of books has become widespread, despite the relatively high cost.  At the same time, publications printed before 1500 were called ‚Äúincunabula‚Äù - produced in the ‚Äúcradle‚Äù of the book industry, later than this year, called ‚Äúpaleotypes‚Äù - ‚Äúold books‚Äù. </p><p>  The beginning of printing in Russia dates back to 1550.  At that time, <span>Ivan the Terrible</span> was the ruler <span>,</span> who provided significant support for the development of printing.  But, unfortunately, the <span>first books</span> were released ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù (did not contain any output).  Therefore, the history does not record data on the first printing house. </p><p>  It is believed that Ivan Fedorov became the first printer in Russia.  The Apostle issued by him on March 1, 1564 became a model of printing art of that time.  This book was published with the assistance and at the direction of Metropolitan Macarius.  The publication was a classic interpretation of Christian doctrine by the followers of Christ.  The book was intended for religious figures. </p><p>  In 1565, Fedorov in place with an assistant <span>Pyotr Mstislavets</span> released the more popular book Chapel.  Thus, the beginning of the Russian printing business was laid.  The followers of Fedorov later released the Psalter.  In total, in the 16th century, nineteen books were published in the Moscow printing house.  Subsequently, the staff of the publishing house was expanded.  Proofreaders, editors and other specialists began to work in it. </p>
