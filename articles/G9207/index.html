Its only feature is miniature.  Today, the phone is considered one of the smallest and cheapest options for mobile devices.  Also worth noting is the original design of the Lexand Mini LPH1. </p><h2>  Feature Overview </h2><p>  The weight of the device is only 75 grams, despite the fact that its body is completely made of metal.  The dimensions for the phone are amazing - 93 by 39 mm.  Thickness is only 15 mm.  Despite its miniature dimensions, the phone Lexand Mini LPH1 has a TFT-screen with a diagonal of 1.44 inches. <br><br>  The device has an integrated SpreadTrum processor 6531 series. The phone supports memory expansion up to 32 GB and 2 standard SIM-cards.  Of the integrated interfaces can distinguish USB and Bluetooth.  It is worth noting that the device does not support any Internet standard, whether it is 3G or Wi-Fi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lexand mini lph1" class="if" height="485" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/681538.jpg" width="600"></div>  From 900 to 1050 rubles - the average cost of the Lexand Mini LPH1.

    <h2>  Design Overview </h2><p>  The device captivates with its rational volume.  The SIM card slots and the slot for additional SD memory are located under the battery.  The case is made of a solid metal layer, as is the lid above the battery.  This gives the phone extra strength.  The thickness of the metal coating is 0.5 mm, which is suitable for generally accepted standards.  A reliable mechanism for fixing the back cover captivates. <br><br>  In addition, the Lexand LPH1 Mini mobile phone has a 2.5 mm jack for charging.  Therefore, the usual plug from Nokia is quite suitable.  On the upper edge of the apparatus is an eyelet for the lace.  There is no protection against water and dust.  There are not even standard rubberized inserts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  At the moment, Lexand Mini LPH1 comes in three colors: red, black and white.  Despite the metal cladding, the case looks like a plastic one.  The design is simple but stylish.  There are no extra inserts, stickers, drawings, nests.  Everything is concise and rational. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lexand mini lph1 review" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/681539.jpg" width="600"></div>  The phone is framed by a polished metal border.  The sides are slightly concave so that the device rests comfortably on your fingers.  Lexand Mini does not slip out of hands, does not overwrite.  It is worth noting a slight decorative ledge on the bottom.  This is a special idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmanufacturers, so that users can touch to find the bottom and top of the device.

    <h2>  Display specifications </h2><p>  For such a <span>budget phone, the</span> screen is really good.  Lexand Mini has excellent display quality.  It is worth highlighting the relatively large size of the display - 3.66 cm diagonally.  The screen supports image resolution 176 by 144 ppi.  When creating the component, the QCIF matrix was used.  Such a display is comparable to the HD of modern smartphones.  Full color rendering, two-dimensional image.  When you rotate the phone horizontally, the display does not distort the picture.  When tilted vertically, there is minimal color inversion.  The brightness level is in excess.  In the sun does not shine.  The text is displayed clearly and smoothly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camera specifications </h2><p>  In this component, Lexand Mini LPH1, of course, loses to many analogues.  If the camera on the device was good, then he would not have a price.  Naturally, LPH1 is primarily a telephone, that is, a means of communication, but today it is extremely important to be able to capture some interesting moment or information.  This Lexand Mini is clearly not an assistant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone lexand mini lph1" class="if" height="458" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/681540.jpg" width="600"></div>  The camera is already very weak.  And although the settings have the ability to shoot in the format of 1280x960, in fact, the quality will deteriorate even more.  However, the camera fully justifies the requirements described in the <span>technical passport</span> - 0.3 MP.  In this case, the shooting resolution can only be VGA format. <br><br>  The camera has several modes at once.  One of them is ‚Äúclose shooting‚Äù.  This is the main advantage of the camera.  The mode makes it possible to photograph objects with increased clarity at a distance of up to 1.5 m.

    <h2>  Multimedia features </h2><p>  The operating system of the Lexand Mini LPH1 is standard.  Like all similar models, the engine includes a menu, screen saver and clock, as well as indicators of charge and signal.  The operating system looks beautiful due to the relatively high resolution of the display. <br><br>  The menu is structured, but linear.  Broken into several logical partitions.  It is noteworthy that the developers decided to abandon the familiar icons, giving priority to the text.  In general, the multimedia engine of the phone is simplified to a minimum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone lexand lph1 mini" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/681541.jpg" width="600"></div>  Of the additional features allocate a good voice recorder, FM-radio and a convenient file manager.  The functionality of the device is not trimmed, like many similar models.  By the way, even an e-reader application is built into the Lexand Mini interface.  From games there is only a standard "Snake". <br><br>  If you wish, you can use the built-in video player, which reads many popular formats.  True, on a screen with a diagonal of 1.44 inches, even a short movie is difficult to see.

    <h2>  Battery specifications </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that the battery case is made of fairly durable metal.  The battery itself can be inserted upside down, but it will not work in this case. <br><br>  In a phone, battery life is an extremely important component.  Unfortunately, the LPH1 battery has only 400 mAh.  The fact is that because of the miniature dimensions, the developers could not accommodate a more powerful package.  There are technologies to solve this problem, but they are extremely expensive and inappropriate in this project. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lexand mini lph1 reviews" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/681542.jpg" width="600"></div>  The battery charge is designed for 4 hours in full activity mode.  Otherwise, it calmly lasts for three days.

    <h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  After careful testing, every phone can always find a number of shortcomings, even with such a tiny Lexand Mini LPH1.  Customer reviews show that the device has fewer minuses than pluses, but still they are.  Among the shortcomings are the terrible camera, poor tightness of the case and the lack of access to the Internet. <br><br>  The main advantages of the device, users consider low cost, bright screen, small dimensions, speed, low weight, stylish design, loud speaker.  Despite its small size, Lexand Mini has a very comfortable keyboard. </p>
