    <h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  As in most hotels around the world, check-in at Irene Palace 4 * begins after 14:00.  However, in the event that vacationers arrive at the hotel earlier than this time, the administration tries to do everything possible to accommodate them immediately upon arrival.  Unfortunately, in the midst of the tourist season, when the hotel is 100% full, this is not always possible, since it is necessary to wait until the previous guests have vacated the room and the maids will properly prepare it.  In such cases, travelers are offered to leave things in the luggage storage room and go for lunch, take a stroll through the beautiful hotel grounds, take a dip in the pool or go straight to the beach.  As for the day of departure, you should release your room before noon.  Then it is necessary to make payment.  You can pay both in cash and with credit cards of the VISA, MasterCard, Diners Club and American Express systems.  If you have already pre-paid your tour operator the full cost of the permit, then upon departure you will only have to pay for additional services, if you have used them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel complex Irene Palace (Rhodes): reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Since it is very important for most of our compatriots when choosing a place to stay to know the opinions of travelers who have already been here, we offer you generalized comments of people who have recently stayed at Irene Palace 4 * (Greece).  It should be noted right away that the vast majority of reviews are positive.  But we offer to understand everything in more detail. </p><p>  As for the rooms, tourists note that the furniture and appliances in them are far from new.  However, everything is very neat, clean and working properly, which is important.  The only minus of our compatriots considered very good audibility in the rooms.  However, this problem is very common in most hotels, not only in Greece.  As for cleaning, the hotel maids conducted it regularly.  Also, there were no problems with the timely change of bed linen and towels. </p><p>  All tourists, without exception, were delighted with the territory of the Irene Palace Hotel and the paths to the beach.  So, almost all of our compatriots noted a beautiful fountain, huge eucalyptus trees that give a cool shadow, and a picturesque banana grove.  As for the beach itself, it is really very clean.  Small pebbles here both on the shore and when entering the water.  It‚Äôs impossible to get hurt.  Those who came to rest with their children were very pleased that they could safely let their children swim. </p><p>  As a rule, the issue of food in many hotels in different countries becomes very controversial.  Perhaps, Irene Palace is an exception to this rule, since the vast majority of our compatriots were quite satisfied with the food.  They noted that the dishes are quite tasty and varied.  In addition, many, especially those who had previously rested in Turkey, were very pleased with the fact that local chefs do not abuse hot spices.  Therefore, even children could easily eat from an adult table. </p><p>  As for the staff, there were no complaints from tourists as well.  Perhaps the only minor inconvenience was that the hotel staff, with rare exceptions (girls in the kids club), did not speak Russian.  This is due to the fact that mainly Europeans rest here, there are few of our compatriots.  However, if you have not forgotten the school curriculum of English or German, it will not be difficult for you to communicate with the staff.  In general, the hotel staff is always friendly, friendly and willing to help. </p><p>  Thus, we can conclude that the rest in the Irene Palace 4 * hotel (Rhodes island, Greece) left tourists mostly positive impressions.  Many of our compatriots do not exclude the possibility that they will return here again.  Also, many tourists are ready to recommend this hotel complex to their relatives and friends. </p>
