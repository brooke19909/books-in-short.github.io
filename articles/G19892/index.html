In general, origami is called the art of folding a variety of paper figures.  Today it is a fairly common <span>form of art,</span> in addition, it is quite popular.  The craftsmanship of this type of art is taught almost everywhere: in kindergarten, at school, in youth centers, in camps and sanatoriums - there are origami circles everywhere.  There are even exhibitions and origami competitions for which worthy prizes are awarded.  You can learn such art even thanks to the Internet, because now there are many sites on which you can find special schemes, photos and training videos.  Those who are engaged in origami know how to fold any animal or how to make a fighter out of paper. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a fighter out of paper that flies well" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20362/414582.jpg" width="600"></div>  Origami story </h2><p>  As you know, paper was discovered in China.  From there it takes its roots in an entertaining hobby.  Of course, then they did not even think about how to make a fighter out of paper.  At the very beginning, origami was used exclusively for various rituals.  An interesting fact is that this type of art was available only to the upper classes, since mastering the technique of this hobby indicated a good tone.  This art got to Europe and America only after the Second World War.  And later - to Russia.  Over time, origami replenished with new figures and schemes, and popularity grew.  In general, in the history of origami there are many Japanese names, but Akira Yizizawa is considered one of the main ones.  This Japanese master made a very large contribution to the art of origami. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Origami Art Rules </h2><p>  There are several types of folding figures in origami today.  If you pay attention to the classic version of this art, then the figures should be made up of a square sheet of paper.  At the same time, there is a certain set of conventional signs, with the help of which a pattern of folding a particular figure is drawn.  As for these signs, most of them were introduced by a famous Japanese master in the mid-twentieth century.  In addition, the sheet for origami should be uniformly colored, and the process itself eliminates the use of glue and scissors.  Some masters translate the word ‚Äúorigami‚Äù as ‚Äúpaper and hands‚Äù, that is, folding paper shapes with hands, and therefore categorically refuse to use any improvised materials (scissors, glue, pins). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a paper fighter" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20362/414583.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to make a fighter? </h2><p>  Almost everyone knows the simplest paper folding scheme for a regular airplane.  And not everyone knows how to make a fighter out of paper.  As a rule, there are various schemes for folding planes, but such an airplane does not always fly well, which often causes children to be upset.  There is a correct scheme with which you can accurately show your child how to make a fighter out of paper that flies well. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__use"></div><div class="vn-player" style="box-sizing: border-box; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; z-index: 0; margin: auto;"><div style="position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; text-align: center;"></div></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

There are different schemes, but, as a rule, they are not much different from each other.  So, first you need to lay the sheet vertically, and outline the middle of the sheet by folding it in half.  Then you should fold the upper corners of the sheet to this middle and fix it with the help of smoothing movements with your hands.  Next you need to bend the resulting acute angle down (so that it becomes lower by about 3-4 cm).  After this, the resulting wings should be bent again to the middle.  Then you need to turn the plane towards you ‚Äúface‚Äù and bend its ‚Äúnose‚Äù up.  If you performed everything correctly, then this ‚Äúnose‚Äù should bend very easily.  After that, it should be noted about 2-3 cm in different directions from the middle of the fighter and bend the wings at the received marks.  In conclusion, you need to bend the so-called stabilizers, which are located on the edge of the aircraft.  This is where your origami paper craft is ready.  The fighter can be decorated with a variety of icons.  For example, it may be red stars.  So you got a decent answer to the question of how to make a fighter out of paper.
