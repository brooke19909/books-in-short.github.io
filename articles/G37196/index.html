And before, Detroit was called the world automobile capital.  The largest vehicle production on the planet was concentrated here.  But life is so arranged that you have to pay for everything, and after rapt glory, sooner or later an eclipse comes.  So it happened with this city: having survived an extraordinary rise, today it is turning into ruins and becoming a hangout for drug addicts and bandits. </p>

    <h2>  The great past of a withering city </h2><p>  Detroit, Michigan, was founded on July 24, 1701.  Its founder was the French officer Antoine Lome de La Mothe Cadillac.  The future metropolis is located on a trade route, so the village where fur dealers lived has turned into an industrial center in a matter of years.  One well-known American brand in its name immortalized the name of the ‚Äúparent‚Äù of Detroit. </p><p>  At the end of the 19th century, a car factory was built near the city.  And in 1903, its owner Henry Ford founded the Ford Motor Company brand, and from that moment the real boom of immigrants begins.  After that, some more world leaders in the automotive industry opened their headquarters in the metropolis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Detroit (Michigan) quickly gained the title of world automobile capital.  At the state level, a program of public machines was implemented here.  But since the 1970s, the sunset of the auto center has begun.  Chrysler, General Motors and Ford are developing a financial crisis.  Car magnates had to close their plants in Detroit and transfer them to those countries where labor was several times cheaper.  During the 1970-1980s, the number of jobs in the city was reduced by more than 200 thousand.  Over the past half century, the population of the metropolis has halved. </p><p>  But Detroit does not give up, attracting tourists every year to explore local attractions and arrange car shows. </p>
