But in Turkey there are other interesting places, and one of them is Mahmutlar.  Although it is considered a city of ancient ruins, it is a completely modern and beautiful resort with developed infrastructure.  The choice of hotels here is quite wide - from chic five-star giants to modest apartments.  Galaxy <span>Beach Hotel 4 *</span> occupies approximately the average position.  It has a fairly wide range of services, but at the same time quite reasonable prices that allow tourists of all categories to enjoy their holidays in Turkey. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Galaxy Beach Hotel" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1040916.jpg" width="583"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The town of Mahmutlar administratively belongs to Alanya and is only 8 km away from its center.  This is a pretty beautiful place, on the one hand surrounded by the majestic Taurus Mountains, on the other hand washed by the Mediterranean Sea.  The neighbors of Mahmutlar are the villages of Kargicak and Kestel, which can be reached by public minibuses.  Galaxy Beach Hotel is located in the city, but on the outskirts of it is on the opposite side of Alanya.  The center of Mahmutlar is about 2 km from here, or 20 minutes on foot along the well-maintained city streets.  Near the hotel there is an excellent asphalt road connecting this village with Alanya, Antalya and running further along the Mediterranean coast.  The airport closest to the hotel is only 37 km from Alanya, but direct flights from Russia go there only during the peak season, and even then there are only a couple of them.  You can get to this air harbor only with a change in Istanbul.  The bulk of tourists arrive at <span>Antalya Airport,</span> from which the hotel is about 3.5 hours away, or 135 km. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Galaxy Beach Hotel 4" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1040871.jpg" width="579"></div>

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Galaxy <span>Beach Hotel 4 * (Alanya)</span> is an international hotel.  In addition to the Russians, residents of Ukraine, Moldova, the Baltic states, and Turkey are resting here.  Check-in is mainly carried out from 14:00.  You need to free the room before 12:00. </p><p>  As you may have noticed, the hotel is aimed at picky tourists who value outdoor activities.  Its location allows you to use the objects of urban infrastructure, make many interesting excursions, and touch the ancient history of the country without unnecessary effort and money spent on the road. </p><p>  Holidays at sea in this region of Turkey can be associated with some difficulties: Mahmutlar is not located in a closed, cozy bay, so winds and waves are not rare here, and the sea is cooler, but it is crystal clear.  The rocky coastline can also make swimming difficult.  Safety shoes are needed here. </p><h2>  Galaxy Beach Hotel 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  The rating of this hotel for different tour operators is gaining from 3 to 4 out of 5 possible points.  Some tourists give a lower rating. </p><p>  Noted advantages: </p><ul><li>  close to the sea; </li><li>  hotel within the city; </li><li>  close to Alanya, where there is a lot of entertainment; </li><li>  beautiful views from the restaurant, it's nice to be there and have a meal; </li><li>  working elevators, no problems with lifting to the upper floors; </li><li>  good SPA salon. </li></ul><p>  Noted disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  unprofessional work of maintenance personnel, especially registration employees; </li><li>  the rooms have old furniture, plumbing, bedding, mattresses (hard, bumpy), pillows; </li><li>  room cleaning is not high-quality and not daily; </li><li>  from many of the rooms the windows open to the neighboring city buildings, which are located fairly close; </li><li>  very expensive internet, which also works poorly; </li><li>  too little choice of dishes in the restaurant, especially meat, tasteless desserts; </li><li>  portioned selection of meat and drinks; </li><li>  very long road from Antalya airport; </li><li>  very bad entry into the sea, the stones are such that you can easily hurt your legs, and when the waves do not swim at all; </li><li>  not too suitable for families with small children - there is no children's furniture, a special menu and, most importantly, a nanny, which means it‚Äôs unlikely to go anywhere or go on an excursion; </li><li>  no compliments from the hotel. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, there are more negative aspects than positive ones, and judging by the reviews, the hotel hardly pulls even by 3 *.  However, as already mentioned, it is designed for unassuming tourists.  People who are accustomed to relax in a big way, will rather choose a five-star complex. </p>
