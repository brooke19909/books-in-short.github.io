  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social differentiation: what is its meaning for modern society?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the XIX century, such views on the <span>social structure of</span> society were widespread, according to which, the main criterion for determining social differentiation was the attitude to the means of production.  In particular, on this point of view was Marxism.  However, his theorists distinguished not only classes, but also layers within each class (for example, the petty, middle and big bourgeoisie), thereby emphasizing that inequality and exclusion are characteristic of any groups of people.  Nevertheless, they believed that they should be overcome, and such a class as the proletariat plays precisely this mission in history. </p><p>  In contrast to class theory, a concept has developed that is also based on social differentiation.  The author of this theory of stratification was Pitirim Sorokin.  He developed a whole system of signs and criteria of social stratification that form the structure of a social organism.  Sorokin distinguished between one-dimensional and multi-dimensional stratification, that is, the division of society into such groups as ‚Äústrata‚Äù on one basis and on the whole of them.  He divided these strata according to such characteristics as employment, income, living conditions, education, psychological traits, religious beliefs, style of behavior, and many others.  Many modern sociologists consider strata to be the basic and ‚Äúfinal‚Äù element of the social structure. </p><p>  Scientists were also interested in how much the fate of the individual and the social differentiation of society are determined by the division into strata.  They calculated the possibility of moving from one group to another (horizontal mobility), as well as within classes (vertical), for one, two or more generations, highlighting regular and random mobility among them.  In the study of the problem of stratification, a major role was played by Max Weber's theory.  He believed that the difference between groups of people is due not only to access to social wealth, power and law, but also to social indicators - status and prestige.  According to Weber, each group has its own lifestyle - habits, stereotypes, values. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The study of the norms that determine the behavior of people in the social system, as well as how social differentiation affects their status, was carried out by philosophers and sociologists such as Lyndon and Mead.  Components of a <span>social role,</span> such as stereotype and prestige, force a person to appropriately share their group or appraisal of a person or phenomenon (for example, what brand of clothing to buy, whether to send children to study at Yale University, is it mandatory to have a roll-royce or a Mercedes )  If a person wants to get rid of the role imposed on him, as a rule, it is considered that he has lost his prestige, and <span>social sanctions</span> can be applied to him <span>.</span> </p><p>  In such cases, social differentiation results in a reaction of a group, or even of a whole society, to the behavior of an individual who ‚Äúshies away‚Äù from fulfilling expectations and conforming to generally accepted norms and values.  Such sanctions may be prescribed by law, and sometimes they are based on customs, morality or religion.  This is especially characteristic of <span>traditional society,</span> when even physical actions are used - beating, death penalty, lynching or lynching, imprisonment.  In other cases, economic sanctions such as fines or <span>confiscation of property</span> apply <span>.</span>  But in most modern countries, they are mostly limited to showing signs of disrespect. </p><p>  The interaction between social roles, status, sanctions, prestige and other similar mechanisms is studied by a special discipline, interactionism.  Each such group, scientists say, creates its own "world", where the "life scenario", certain actions, certain clothes are painted.  There is even a social differentiation of language, generated by differences between large groups of people in the professional or corporate field.  But such worlds are unstable.  These or other social events, especially on a large scale, force people to rethink their roles and sometimes make completely unexpected actions.  So there is a change in the familiar world in which roles are redistributed. </p>
