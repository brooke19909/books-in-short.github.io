This is a noisy place for youth parties, nightclubs and discos.  But if you are looking for peace and quiet, if you come to the sea with a child, then it is better to find a quieter resort.  Mui-ne is just what you need.  The former fishing village six kilometers northeast of Phan Thiet has been rapidly transformed in recent years. Today it is a solid resort area with luxurious new hotels that stretch along a wonderful sandy beach. </p><p>  One of these hotels - Aroma Beach Resort &amp; Spa Muine 4 * (Vietnam) - this article will be devoted.  Real photos of the hotel will also be presented.  What do tourists say in reviews of this hotel?  It should be said that the rating of “Aroma Beach Resort” in Mui Ne, according to the estimates of the authoritative “Tripadvisor”, is 4.5 points out of five possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vneconomictimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aroma Beach Resort, Vietnam - " class="if uuid-3211450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3211450.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  Climatic conditions in this part of Vietnam allow you to relax here almost all year round.  Mui Ne was chosen not only by travelers seeking tranquility and measured relaxation, but also various surfers.  But these two categories of tourists do not intersect.  Athletes on boards, sailing or parachuting frolic on huge waves in the eastern part of the beach, at the cape.  There is no wind in the center of Mui Ne Bay, and especially on its western outskirts.  Storms in the sea are reliably suppressed by breakwaters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, the described hotel Aroma Beach Resort (Vietnam) is located just in the western part of the beach, on the front page.  But the second line still needs to be searched, because Mui-ne is a new resort, which has just begun to be built, occupies a space near the sea.  Even affordable hostels here boast direct beach access.  But with nightly entertainment in Mui Ne tight.  The resort is designed for calm, family vacationers or athletes who, after swimming in the water all day, go to sleep with roosters.  To have fun in nightclubs, you need to go by bus or taxi to Phan Thiet. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="10.9364959" data-lng="108.17165090000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/2/1/7/17217.png"></div><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Aroma Beach Resort &amp; Spa Muine 4 * is located in the fashionable western part of the resort.  Tourists regard its location ambiguously in reviews.  One does not like that the hotel is, as it were, on the outskirts, a kilometer from the main street.  This area, they say, is very quiet, if not sleepy.  And for others, this location of the hotel is very impressive.  After all, the main street is a cluster of shops, retail stores, restaurants and cafes.  The area is quite noisy. </p><p>  If you came to Vietnam over the sea and the sun, then the “Arma Beach Resort” is exactly what you need.  The hotel has its own beach, and its developed tourist infrastructure allows you not to go outside the hotel throughout the vacation.  But if you do not sit still, then you do not need to restrain yourself.  A five-minute drive from the hotel are the ancient towers of Tap Pochanu - all that remains of the once majestic Shiva Temple.  In the vicinity of Mui Ne there are many natural attractions - White and Red Dunes, canyon, lotus lake. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  In the new resort, there are simply no old hotels.  Aroma Beach Resort &amp; Spa Muine 4 * was erected in 2011, and the last renovation took place in 2016.  So the case shine with novelty.  The territory of the hotel is not too large, and given the fact that it consists of 28 one- and two-story bungalows, 16 villas and four more buildings.  But space is used wisely. </p><p>  The whole territory is a continuous garden with flowers, palm trees, exotic trees.  The restaurant is located on the beach, so you can enjoy Asian dishes right to the sound of the waves.  The hotel has a pool, if you believe the reviews of tourists, very spacious and clean.  No mosquitoes were observed on the territory.  At the reception there is a currency exchange.  According to tourists, the course in it is better than in the city, and they do not charge a commission there.  Nearby, 50 meters from the entrance to the hotel, there is a rental scooter and a couple of inexpensive cafes and shops.  It will be interesting for family tourists to find out that there is a playground on the territory of the hotel, and the pool has a shallow area for bathing babies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aroma Beach Resort (Vietnam)" class="if uuid-3211433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3211433.jpg"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  As already mentioned, guests at the Aroma Beach Resort &amp; Spa Muine 4 * hotel are accommodated either in villas or in bungalows.  There are four more buildings, but they are also low, which creates an additional atmosphere of relaxation.  No roof peeks out from behind the palm trees.  The hotel rooms are divided into the following categories: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Villa (50 square meters).  These houses are located far from the sea.  Each villa has 8 rooms. </li><li>  Bungalow (55 sq. M.).  There are rooms with a view of both the garden and the sea.  Each bungalow has 4 rooms, each with a separate entrance from the street. </li><li>  Aroma Triple (85 sq. M.).  In reviews of this room category, tourists mention a huge balcony and a jacuzzi. </li><li>  “Suite” (98 sq. M.).  These rooms consist of a bedroom and a living room.  There is also a jacuzzi and a huge balcony with sea views. </li><li>  “Aroma Laksheri” (119 sq. M.).  These suites are located on the ground floor, and therefore they are not adjacent to a balcony, but to a spacious terrace.  There is also a jacuzzi. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelocity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aroma Beach Resort &amp; Spa Muine 4 *" class="if uuid-3211437" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3211437.jpg"></div><h2>  And what about the rooms? </h2><p>  The section will describe the most budget accommodation at the Aroma Beach Resort hotel.  The first thing that catches your eye is a mega bed.  An orthopedic mattress is laid on it, and therefore sleeps there very comfortably.  Tourists say that the rooms are decorated very stylishly, with light hints of orientality.  They will appeal to those who do not like monotonous hotel rooms.  Furniture and plumbing are new, everything is functioning properly.  A flat-screen TV, among others, broadcasts on the Russian channel. </p><p>  There is a minibar, the filling of which, in addition to drinking water, is paid.  Tourists note that instead of cabinets there are niches with shelves, they are pulled by curtains.  Is there a safe in the room.  In the spacious bedroom there was a place for the living area - a sofa with pillows and a coffee table.  But in this honey barrel there is, nevertheless, a tar spoon: the air conditioner is installed opposite the bed.  Many tourists were forced to turn it off at night so that they were not blew. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aromabeachresort.com.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aroma Beach Resort, Vietnam - rooms" class="if uuid-3211447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3211447.jpg"></div><h2>  Free Room Service </h2><p>  In reviews of Aroma Beach Resort &amp; Spa Muine 4 *, tourists say that you can use the safe for free.  Also in the rooms (and throughout the hotel) there is free Wi-Fi.  There were no complaints about its speed; tourists talked with friends on Skype.  As befits a hotel with a 4-star status, drinking water is put into the minibar daily, and cosmetics are put into the bathroom.  But the latter are not only a standard set of soap, shampoo and shower gel.  Here you will be offered a toothbrush with paste, a comb and hair balm. </p><p>  The bathroom itself is a small apartment.  Separate toilet.  There is both a bathtub and a shower cabin, both finished with stone.  Each room has an electric kettle, and housekeepers put bags for preparing drinks when cleaning.  In a niche, guests will find a straw beach bag, rain umbrella, white bathrobes and slippers. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Most Russian tourists coming to Aroma Beach Resort &amp; Spa Muine 4 * book the BB concept.  But if you do not plan to leave Mui Ne somewhere, then it is better to pay half board or three meals a day.  The food in the restaurant is excellent.  The fame of the skill of cooks has spread far beyond Mui Ne.  The Vietnamese order weddings and other special occasions here, for which the hotel has a banquet hall.  It should be said that full board is not "all inclusive", so the services of bars in the hotel are paid.  There are two such establishments in Aroma Beach Resort.  One, the Pool Bar, runs from 10am until sunset.  There you can order soft drinks, ice cream, cocktails.  The second bar, with the eloquent name "Sky" (Sky), is located on the roof of one of the hotel buildings.  There you can order various dishes. </p><p>  Most tourists had lunch and dinner outside the hotel.  The most attractive for the price they called the institution "Madame Lan."  The cafe serves Asian dishes.  In the restaurant "Deja Vu" prices are higher, but the choice is more diverse.  In addition, in the evenings there is an entertainment program.  The downside of Vietnamese catering is that 90 percent of establishments close at 22:00.  In the vicinity of the hotel, only Joe's Cafe is open until late. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gites.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aroma Beach Resort, Vietnam" class="if uuid-3211442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3211442.jpg"></div><h2>  Aroma Beach Resort &amp; Spa 4 *: breakfast reviews </h2><p>  How do tourists characterize a morning meal?  The time allotted for breakfast is humane - from 7 to 10 hours, so they have time to eat both “larks” and “owls”.  The hotel itself is small, so there were no flecks in the restaurant, even when the hotel was completely full.  The terrace where meals are served is perfectly shaded, there are no flies, and the tablecloths, dishes and cutlery are clean.  The waiters are very quick.  They quickly clean the tables, bring full trays of food to replace the empty ones.  As for the choice of dishes, then all the tourists, even the most picky, were satisfied. </p><p>  Typically, hotels serve instant coffee.  But not at Aroma Beach Resort!  There is coffee beans, freshly ground, prepared by a skilled barista.  The breakfast buffet has always been divided into three zones: European cuisine (for tourists who are nostalgic for their homeland), Chinese cuisine (for numerous guests from China) and Vietnamese.  So it was possible to have a meal with both familiar dishes and get acquainted with the culinary traditions of Southeast Asia.  In the reviews, tourists recall that at breakfast there were always at least six kinds of fruits.  All dishes were very fresh and deliciously prepared.  Tourists recommend trying Pho soup - Vietnamese eat it for breakfast. </p><h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  The Aroma Beach Resort Hotel (Vietnam) in Mui Ne has a small portion of the coast.  Before it, from the farthest buildings from the sea, go about 50 meters.  What about the hotel beach?  The coastline is narrower than that of neighboring hotels.  But the sand is cleaner.  All garbage caused by the sea or left by vacationers is immediately removed by the servants.  Even in a season not very favorable for swimming, the waves here are small, not higher than a meter.  But since Mui Ne is known as a resort for surfers, here you can meet people on boards and kites. </p><p>  Anyone can stay on the beach, but sun loungers and umbrellas are reserved only for hotel guests.  Since the hotel is on the edge, there are very few traders here.  Beach towels are provided free of charge by the pool.  Low tides are observed, but they are not noticeable.  The sea recedes just a couple of meters.  Entering the water is not quite suitable for bathing babies due to the rough surf.  But it is worth overcoming, and you can enjoy swimming in a calm sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aroma Beach Resort &amp; Spa Muine 4 * (Vietnam)" class="if uuid-3211431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3211431.jpg"></div><h2>  Pool </h2><p>  What do tourists say about this artificial pond at Aroma Beach Resort (Vietnam)?  It is quite spacious, with an adjacent children's area, very clean, without slippery surfaces.  On one of the shores of the pool are four Bali Bed tents, but their use is paid.  But sunbeds are represented in large numbers and they are enough for everyone. </p><p>  Nearby there is a bar, it plays soft and unobtrusive music.  In general, the hotel has done everything possible to provide its guests with complete relaxation.  Another thing is that vacationers, especially from China, do not quite understand why this should not be yelled by the pool, jump into the water and spray on everyone around. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelocity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aroma Beach Resort &amp; Spa 4 *: reviews" class="if uuid-3211439" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3211439.jpg"></div><h2>  Free services </h2><p>  For those tourists who rented a scooter or car, the Aroma Beach Resort 4 * hotel provides a parking place for a vehicle.  Parents can bring their child to play on the playground.  It is perfectly shaded by greens and provided with a soft coating.  The restaurant for the youngest guests has high chairs, and upon your request a cot will be put in the room.  Of the free services, fast Wi-Fi has already been mentioned. </p><p>  Those who can not live a day without training can pump up biceps in the gym.  You can also play billiards, darts, beach volleyball and table tennis for free.  Want to watch TV in a big company?  For this, the hotel has a salon.  There is also a small library with books in different languages.  If you leave Mui Ne late, then you can put things in the locker at the reception upon eviction from the room. </p><h2>  Paid services </h2><p>  The hotel Aroma Beach Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (Vietnam) has a tour desk where you can book a tour of the region with a guide.  The hotel can also provide transfers to Ho Chi Minh or Nha Trang Airport.  If you want to spend a romantic evening with your spouse, you can delegate the care of a small child to a registered nanny.  Here you can also rent a scooter or car directly at the hotel.  True, the services of an office located nearby will cost you less. </p><p>  The waters off the coast of Mui Ne are not very suitable for diving and snorkeling due to the turbidity of the water.  But the "right" winds create ideal waves here for various kinds of surfing, both classic and its wind and kite varieties.  Want to join this sport?  Report your desire at the reception and you will be provided with equipment and lessons from the instructor. </p><h2>  SPA-center </h2><p>  The full name of the hotel is Aroma Beach Resort &amp; Spa 4 *.  Therefore, the center of bath pleasures should be told especially.  Alas, the services in it are paid.  The spa is located in the main building of the hotel.  In addition to a sauna and a jacuzzi with a small pool, there are also massage rooms.  Graduates can conduct not only a relaxing full-body session.  At your request, you will be given Thai, aromatic, oil, massage using heated stones and other similar procedures.  The spa also offers a treatment course.  For example, deep muscle massage of the lumbar or cervico-shoulder region.  There are also anti-aging and anti-cellulite programs. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Tourists urge guests not to stay at the hotel, but to actively travel around the Mui Ne (Vietnam).  Reviews of Aroma Beach Resort mention that the hotel has a tour desk.  His employee will kindly tell you where you can go on a trip and what sights to see.  As a bonus to the purchased excursion, a free trip to Phan Thiet is attached. </p><p>  From expensive tours, you can choose a two-day visit to Hanoi.  But this, travelers say, is very tiring.  Better to go to Ho Chi Minh City, this big city is closer.  If you want to have fun with the whole family, go to Nha Trang, to the Vinpearl attraction island.  You can also visit nature attractions around Mui Ne with a guide.  But to the Cham towers of Tap Poshan it is better to go on their own. </p><h2>  Life hacks </h2><p>  Tourists are advised not to buy the free offer to go to Phan Thiet.  This is a waste of time.  You will be transported to pearl jewelry workshops, souvenir shops and other commercial points where the guide gives a percentage of your purchases.  It's much cheaper to shop on your own.  Getting to Phan Thiet from Aroma Beach Resort Hotel (Vietnam) is very easy.  The hotel is located closest to the rest in Mui Ne from this city.  A special access road even leads to it. </p><p> So, you need to leave the hotel and immediately turn right.  After a couple of minutes, you will reach the main highway connecting Mui Ne to Phan Thiet.  Cross the road and wait for the red bus number 1 and 9. These routes go along different streets of Phan Thiet, but you will get to the city for sure.  The ticket is bought from the conductor on the bus.  But public transport runs only until 17:30, so fans of evening walks will have to fork out for a taxi. </p><h2>  General reviews of Aroma Beach Resort (Vietnam) </h2><p>  The lion's share of tourists who visited the hotel liked the rest.  Many travelers leave enthusiastic reviews about the hotel and admit that they would happily return here again.  Literally every response contains a mention of the hospitality and hospitality of the staff.  Alas, the reception staff do not know the Russian language, but they can be perfectly explained in English. </p><p>  Lots of praise earned breakfast at the hotel.  You can eat well and not be hungry until dinner.  The rooms are very spacious, stylishly decorated, comfortable.  Cleaning maids conduct immaculately.  Despite the fact that spa services are more expensive than in massage parlors on the street, you need to definitely visit it at least once.  Many tourists praise the beach.  They say that you need not be too lazy to get up at 5:30 at least once to meet the dawn.  The spectacle is breathtaking! </p>
