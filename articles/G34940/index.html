  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Keila Yola - an ancient castle and sparkling waterfall</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Very close to the capital of Estonia, majestic Tallinn, is one of the most beautiful places in the territory of this small state.  It will be about the small picturesque village of Keila Joa, known for its waterfall of the same name. </p><p>  This is a popular tourist destination; getting to the village is not at all difficult, just an hour's drive from Tallinn. </p><p>  Outside the village there is a well-groomed park, along which a river flows with crystal clear water. </p><h2>  The history of the park </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.devisu.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fall castle today" class="if uuid-2659456" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2659456.jpg"></div><p>  In ancient times, a water mill worked on the Keila River.  It was with its construction in 1555 that the official history of the village of Keila-Joa begins.  In those centuries, the lands around the river were owned by the Order of the Knights-Swordsmen. </p><p>  Around the 17th century, a noble estate appeared on these lands, replacing several owners.  The heyday can be considered the time starting from 1827.  Then the estate was acquired by Alexander Benckendorf (his daughter married Grigory Volkonsky).  The new owners demolished the old dilapidated manor and built the Fall castle.  This elegant building in neo-Gothic style, fits perfectly into the surrounding landscape, was created by architect Andrei Stackenschneider.  Then the park was laid, which since then has been constantly growing and decorating. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The descendants of Benckendorf lived there until the 1917 revolution, after which all of their property, including the castle and the park, were nationalized in favor of the state. </p><p>  Today, this pretty well-kept village with its restored buildings, a park and a waterfall is often visited by tourists.  Excursion agencies offer an interesting three-day tour from St. Petersburg to Tallinn, with a visit to three large waterfalls in Estonia, including the one described. </p><h2>  Walk in the shady park </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.baltcoming.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park alley" class="if uuid-2659468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2659468.jpg"></div><p>  A well-groomed path along which you need to walk about three kilometers to the waterfall starts right from the highway.  A nature trail passes by the river bed.  On the river for the convenience of walkers, three suspension bridges are installed.  The road to the waterfall passes through two of them, the bridges creak a little on chains when tourists pass on them. </p><p>  Historians believe that the first suspension bridge over the Keila-Joa River was built in 1836.  The beginning was to the taste, and the residents erected several more bridges.  One of them, resembling a violin bow in its form, existed until the beginning of our century and then collapsed under excessively fallen snow. </p><p>  The path fancifully winds between centuries-old trees.  In the park for the convenience of guests there are many places of relaxation, various benches.  The territory of the park is open for visits at any time, and absolutely free of charge. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Near the waterfall is a functioning hydroelectric power station.  Interestingly, a water mill used to work in the same place.  An observation deck is equipped above the hydroelectric power station, from which a wonderful view of the waterfall opens. </p><h2>  The most beautiful waterfall in Estonia </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaley Yola Waterfall" class="if uuid-2659476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2659476.jpg"></div><p>  Keila-Joa waterfall is not the largest in Estonia, its height of water fall is about 6 meters, but it is very beautiful.  Its bed is quite wide, 70 meters, and the waterfall breaks down several separate cascades. </p><p>  On a sunny day, this is a very beautiful sight, every drop of flying water sparkles and shimmers.  The most full-flowing waterfall becomes with the beginning of spring and the period of snowmelt.  Then the water breaks down not in separate parts, but in a single powerful stream.  This is accompanied by the rumble of falling water and a cloud of minute spray. </p><p>  Locals claim that Keila-joa Falls is very beautiful in winter, when under the influence of frost, water flows turn into bizarre ice sculptures.  And around there is a mysterious snowy forest, a slowly flowing river with ice-bound shores and sparkling suspension bridges.  Winter Baltic tale! </p><h2>  Bridge lovers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.postimees.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lovers Bridge on Keila River" class="if uuid-2659479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2659479.jpg"></div><p>  Not far from the waterfall, a suspension bridge, which is considered the bridge of lovers, is thrown across the river.  As on many bridges in the world, there is a tradition here to hang a padlock on a railing.  And this will serve as a guarantee of eternal love! </p><p>  To prevent this tradition of increasing the weight of the bridge, a metal heart sculpture was installed, authored by sculptor Mati Carmine.  This adorned the park, but the locks continue to hang. </p><p>  This bridge and the waterfall, visible behind it, are one of the favorite places for the newlyweds photo shoot.  Many couples in love come from St. Petersburg to Tallinn to take pictures on the background of a waterfall and a bridge of lovers. </p><h2>  Gulf of Finland coast </h2><p>  Very close to the beginning of the path leading to the waterfall, there is another forest path.  In order not to get lost, the trees along the trail are marked with white and blue stripes. </p><p>  This path leads to the smooth and beautiful coast of the Gulf of Finland.  The seacoast is deserted and quiet, tourists rarely look here.  Huge stone boulders are lying on the sandy shore; it seems that they have been lying here since the beginning of time.  It is very nice to walk along the shore of the bay and breathe in the fresh sea breeze. </p><p>  It is not surprising that the small village of Keila-Joa in Estonia is so popular among visitors to the country.  Here you can stroll through the shady park, admire the beautiful cascade of falling water and go to the sandy sea coast. </p>
