Best real estate agencies in St. Petersburg: list, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Everyone has come across buying and renting real estate at least once in their life.  However, finding the right housing on your own is not always easy.  It is much more convenient to turn to specialists so that they take on all the difficulties of choosing an apartment or house for themselves.  Below is a rating of St. Petersburg real estate agencies that are most popular among the population. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="rating of real estate agencies spb" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/1944134.jpg" width="600"></p><h2>  Admiral </h2><p>  AN appeared a long time ago (in 1997).  Over the years, the company has carried out a huge number of transactions for the rental, purchase and sale of housing.  Today Admiral ranks first in the rating of real estate agencies in St. Petersburg.  This is not surprising, because in the largest <span>Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg,</span> more than fifty specialists are working, perfectly coping with their duties. </p><p>  If we talk about reviews about this company, then almost all of them are positive.  The agency has an impeccable reputation. </p><h2>  Activities of AN "Admiral" </h2><p>  In addition to assisting in the selection of better housing, company employees provide mortgage services.  This became possible when AN began to cooperate with the largest credit offices, including Delta Credit and TurboBank. </p><p>  In addition, the Admiral firm, which tops the reliability rating of real estate agencies in St. Petersburg, works directly with the Swiss company Alart Swiss AG, which is a member of the CAP (European Union of Entrepreneurs). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p><img itemprop="image" alt="real estate agencies spb reliability rating" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/1944139.jpg" width="600"></p><p>  If we talk about the services provided, then in the "Admiral" citizens can pick up housing in the primary or secondary market, purchase an elite cottage in the Russian Federation or abroad, rent office or residential premises.  In addition, the company's specialists <span>evaluate real estate</span> and help solve privatization issues. </p><h2>  "Trinity House" </h2><p>  Continuing the rating of the St. Petersburg real estate agency for reliability, we move on to the second line of the list.  It housed the company "Trinity House", which began its activities in 1996.  During this time, the Academy of Sciences has evolved from a small office with two employees into a full-fledged organization, which today employs more than 1000 specialists. </p><h2>  Agency Features </h2><p>  According to consumer reviews, the Trinity House Academy of Sciences is a conscientious organization that employs truly qualified and honest professionals who try to find the best real estate options for customers. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="real estate agencies spb list rating" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/1944142.jpg" width="600"></p><p>  The main office of the company is located in St. Petersburg, but several branches are located in Moscow.  At the same time, the Academy of Sciences is actively establishing contacts with foreign partners, which also positively affects its position in the ranking. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If we talk about the services of the company, which ranks second in the rating of St. Petersburg real estate agencies, then the organization‚Äôs clients can count not only on the selection of apartments in the primary and secondary market, but also on the provision of mortgages.  The company's specialists also assist in the <span>privatization of housing</span> and its redemption. </p><p>  Another advantage of the agency is that, if necessary, clients can get advice online. </p><h2>  Advex </h2><p>  Today in St. Petersburg there are more than a hundred different companies searching for apartments and houses.  In our rating of reliability of real estate agencies, St. Petersburg Advex confidently occupies the third position. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="best real estate agencies spb rating" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33726/1944572.jpg"></p><p>  The company appeared in 1993.  From the first days, Adveks began to show itself as an absolutely ‚Äútransparent‚Äù office, which assists citizens in finding housing.  Thanks to a decent and honest attitude towards clients, AN has been enjoying great popularity for more than 17 years. </p><h2>  Agency Features </h2><p>  Starting from the first day, the Adveks management paid special attention to the qualifications, professionalism and experience of its employees.  Thanks to this, AS quickly grew from a small office into a full-fledged company, the name of which is constantly being heard today. </p><p>  If you get to know the opinions of customers of the company included in the rating of real estate agencies of St. Petersburg, the reviews will be mostly positive.  At the same time, the company‚Äôs offices are located not only in the northern capital, but also in Tyumen, Voronezh and Nizhny Novgorod. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that AN Adveks is part of the Russian Guild of Realtors, which once again confirms the status of the company.  According to these results, the company, which occupies the third place in the rating of real estate agencies in St. Petersburg, is obliged to the director general of the organization, Alexander Yurievich Romanenko.  Numerous employees also made a great contribution to the formation of the company, whose competence is confirmed by the fact that almost all of them are members of the Gold Team. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="rating real estate agencies spb reviews" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/1944152.jpg" width="600"></p><p>  If we talk about the field of activity of the organization, then, as in other ANs, Advex customers can receive the full range of services.  In addition, the agency has specialized Departments in which the most complex issues are solved privately.  "Adveks" specializes in <span>shared construction,</span> sale of commercial and residential facilities both in Russia and abroad.  At the same time, even the most complex types of transactions are within the power of the company's specialists. </p><h2>  "Option" </h2><p>  Speaking about the <span>best real estate agencies in</span> St. Petersburg, the rating should include this AN.  Compared to its predecessors, it is quite young.  Variant opened in 2004, but this does not mean that the organization is not trustworthy.  Quite the contrary, today it is only gaining momentum.  The company employs a huge number of specialists who know their job.  Thanks to the efficient work and experience of specialists, Variant has established itself as an agency that really deserves a place among the best. </p><h2>  Agency Features </h2><p>  Since the consultants of the company quickly find solutions even from the most seemingly hopeless situations, you can safely contact Variant when moving, exchanging, renting, selling and acquiring housing. </p><p>  At the same time, the client does not need to think about anything.  Preparation and verification of documents, registration of transactions, organization of mutual settlements and other legal support falls on the shoulders of qualified specialists of the agency.  At the same time, throughout the entire time that is spent on the transaction, the client can get comprehensive advice. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="real estate agencies spb reliability rating adveks" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/1944159.jpg" width="600"></p><p>  In addition, the agency has a specialized department dealing with mortgage loans.  Only the best employees with vast experience in housing lending work in it.  It is worth saying that only graduates of the real estate institute and certified consultants are allowed to work in this department. </p><p>  If we talk about reviews, then the agency‚Äôs clients note an individual approach to each individual situation.  At the same time, communication takes place in a friendly atmosphere.  If the client has any questions, he can always count on an exhaustive answer.  At the same time, the cost of services in Variant is somewhat democratic, so almost anyone can contact here. </p><p>  The article presents a list of real estate agencies in St. Petersburg - a rating of the best companies that provide assistance in real estate transactions.  Turning to any of these organizations, the client can be sure that the transaction will be "clean" and no one will deceive him.  Experts of the Academy of Sciences always check all the data on residential properties, including information about the owners and those who were registered on the living space.  Thanks to this, the chance to be deceived is eliminated.  This is very important, since today there are a large number of "black" realtors and other scammers. </p>
