What do tourists write about her?  Reviews present us with a pretty attractive picture.  All tourists agree that if the distance of eight hundred meters to the beach is not a problem for you, then you will enjoy your stay in Nilams See Glitz 4 *.  This hotel, until recently, had only three stars on its sign.  But after a recent reconstruction, she raised her status to four.  Hotel management is part of the Nilams Hotels group.  Those tourists who are familiar with the services of this network, say that the representation in North Goa is quite high. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Neelams the glitz 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1086328.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel located and what is it </h2><p>  <span>Dabolim International Airport is</span> separated from Neelams The Glitz 4 * forty-five kilometers.  So you will have the opportunity to compare those hotels where your companions drop off on a flight with the hotel where you will spend your unforgettable vacation.  The specificity of North Goa is that in this part of the Indian state there are a lot of cheap guesthouses without any stars.  In most cases, these hotels are a few modest bungalows in a private garden.  The four-star hotel "Nilams The Glitz" is small.  It consists of a three-story building with an adjacent garden.  It is interesting that the swimming pool in the hotel is unusual: not on the ground, in front of the building, but on the wide terrace of the second floor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to settle </h2><p>  One hundred and fifty rooms of the Neelams The Glitz 4 * hotel are divided into categories: Club Plaza, Select Room, Premier Suite and Elite Suite.  Most guest rooms have their own small balcony overlooking the garden.  Tourists claim: despite the fact that the hotel is located next to the road, no noise is heard in the rooms.  The air conditioning the bedrooms are equipped with is also very quiet.  It is possible to use the control panel to set the appropriate room temperature.  Reviews note the presence of a spacious safe where you can put your laptop.  The furnishings are complemented by a flat-screen TV, a small refrigerator, a set for self-preparation of hot drinks.  The bathroom has a wonderful hairdryer, and the maids put jars of wonderful cosmetics on a shelf in front of the mirror every day.  The suites have a dedicated seating area.  Filling a minibar and Wi-Fi in the room are paid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Neelams the glitz 4 north goa calangute" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1086326.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to feed </h2><p>  The cost of living in the Neelams The Glitz 4 * hotel includes breakfast.  They are served every morning in the restaurant of the See Global Hotel.  Breakfast is buffet style.  The hotel chefs are trying to please everyone: both guests from India who like to come to Goa for the weekend, and foreign tourists.  Therefore, lovers of European breakfasts will find on the table sausages, scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs, sausage and cheese slices, granola and yogurt.  And those who want to try <span>Indian dishes</span> can also do this.  The hotel often hosts weddings and other celebrations for which a banquet hall is provided.  At The Ty Bar, you can have a bite to eat, quench your thirst with a cold drink, or sit out with an alcoholic cocktail.  Vacation packages in Goa, the prices of which are low (especially in the Northern part of the state), include accommodation in a hotel with breakfast.  However, do not worry about nutrition.  On Calangute Beach, 800 meters from the hotel, there is the Mapusa Market, and the entire promenade is a continuous chain of catering establishments.  Reviews are advised by Bella Chao (located at the Calypso Hotel), Susa Lobo Beach Cafe, and Mirabai Goan Village Indian Restaurant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Neelams the glitz 4 hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1086327.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  North Goa </h2><p>  This state has nothing in common with the rest of India.  In Goa, the Portuguese, and then the British, ruled for too long to leave a European gloss and many Catholic churches for a long time.  At the end of the 60s of the last century, hippies overwhelmed the local coast.  It was they, and then the Rastamans and other freaks, who created Goa the glory of an earthly paradise, where parties and parties never stop.  Over time, the southern part of the state was recaptured from hippies by hoteliers.  A respectable audience (mainly pensioners from Western Europe) drove the Flower Children to the north.  Calangute Beach has become a kind of hippie capital.  Gradually, a small settlement of freaks grew here.  But high-star hotels penetrate here.  If you like noisy youth parties, communication with non-standard audiences and trance-style music, then you will have a wonderful vacation in Goa. </p><h2>  Hotel pool.  Calangute Beach </h2><p>  Remoteness from the sea at 800 meters - assure reviews - not at all a minus, but a plus of the hotel.  You can choose the coast, and not be "sharpened" on one, as is often the case with hotel guests on the first line.  Calangute, by virtue of its world-wide fame as the hippie capital, is rarely uninhabited.  But the Neelams The Glitz 4 * hotel is located not far from other coasts.  Look for solitude is on Baga Beach (two kilometers), Candolim (3.5 km), Anjuna (4.5 km), Singuerium (5 km).  There is not only deserted, but also much cleaner.  And you can overcome kilometers by taxi, tuk-tuk or a rented scooter.  The swimming pool in the hotel, as we have already indicated, is located on the wide terrace of the second floor.  Sun loungers and beach towels are provided free of charge.  The pool is small, but it‚Äôs nice to relax near it, especially since free Wi-Fi is excellent in its area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Calangute Beach" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1086334.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services </h2><p>  Hotel "Nilams The Glitz" guarantees its guests an unforgettable wonderful vacation in Goa.  The hotel has a fully equipped conference room, and a business center provides the necessary copies, sends a fax or orders an interpreter.  Hotel security guarantees the safety of your car in free parking.  For disabled guests, a room is equipped in the living room.  Reviews say that for breakfast you could easily find dishes for diabetics.  And even in the rooms along with sugar bags there is always a substitute for it.  Especially warm words are written by tourists about the Ayurvedic center of the hotel.  His services are paid, but reviews highly recommend visiting him at least once.  Tourists were incredibly happy that the hotel did not have any discos.  There is so much nightly fun around Calangute that I would like to have at least some oasis of calm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays at Goa" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1086331.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  For children </h2><p>  The policy of the Neelams The Glitz 4 * hotel is that a child under the age of five can stay and eat at the hotel absolutely free.  The kids liked the abundance of sweet pastries and exotic fruits for breakfast.  You can feed the most capricious little one a habitual meal for lunch at the KFC fast-food restaurant.  For children, a small part of the pool is highlighted.  Reviews open one nuance that hoteliers are silent.  Next to the Nilams See Glitz is the See Grand Hotel.  You can use all its infrastructure, including a swimming pool.  In the "Grand" it is more, and more comfortable for children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holiday packages goa prices" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1086332.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Russian travel agencies offer completely different in terms of the cost of trips to Goa.  Prices in the southern part of the state start at $ 750 per person for seven nights.  But North Goa is somewhat cheaper.  A similar time tour to a four-star hotel with breakfast will cost $ 770 - like a three-ruble note in the southern part of the state.  The prices for food at local cafes are also approximately different.  For example, <span>chicken curry</span> will cost only 160 rupees.  Money saved on accommodation can be spent on excursions.  Reviews are not advised to contact our operators.  Many agents of local travel agencies roam the beach, whose quality of excursions is better and the prices are lower.  You can go on a sea voyage.  Reviews recommend a guided tour of Goa.  It costs 33 US dollars. </p>
