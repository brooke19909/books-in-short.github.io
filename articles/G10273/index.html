Those tourists who have already visited this country have much to say the word ‚ÄúWinperl‚Äù in the name of the hotel.  And for those who are traveling to Vietnam for the first time, we will specifically explain.  In the beautiful bay of Nha Trang, the large island of Hong Che is located, which means ‚ÄúBamboo‚Äù.  It is connected to the resort by a cable car, the longest in the world, as they say.  It is on this island that Winperl is located - a huge entertainment town, the Vietnamese analogue of Disneyland.  There are attractions, a water park, a 3D cinema, singing fountains, and pristine beaches.  The island is quite spacious.  There was a place on it for a couple of hotels.  Among them, the Winperl Resort Hotel we are describing is the most luxurious.  It is considered to be another attraction of the island of Hong Che. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vinpearl resort nha trang 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1072303.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What You Need to Know About Winperl Amusement Park </h2><p>  First of all, the <span>Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang</span> 5 * <span>hotel</span> is the owner of the amusement town.  And if the public, arriving independently from Nha Trang, pays 320 thousand dong for an All-inclusive day ticket, then the guests of the Winperl Resort Hotel use all the attractions absolutely free of charge.  But you should not behave as if you are the master of the island.  On the hillock is a Buddhist monastery.  This is a holy monastery, and not another attraction.  It is possible and even necessary to visit here.  At least in order to look at the merry-go-round from a height and understand that all this is vanity.  You also need to know that on the island there are several hotels with similar names.  At the very pier is the hotel Vinpearl Nha Trang Bay Resort Villas 5 *.  Look, do not confuse: our hotel is located on the opposite side of the island from Nha Trang.  As is often practiced in entertainment towns, food and drinks cannot be brought with you to the island.  Of course, no one will search your suitcases ... </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vinpearl nha trang bay resort villas 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1072335.jpg" width="600"></div>

Then you need to cross to Bamboo Island.  This can be done by two modes of transport: in the cabin of the world's longest cableway (3320 meters) or on a high-speed boat.  Unfortunately, both the cable car station and the pier are located on the outskirts of Nha Trang.  Therefore, you will need to take a taxi from the city center.  But for tourists who check into the Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang 5 * hotel, travel by water and by air will be free.  The registration procedure is already taking place on the continent.  You make a deposit (you need to pick it up at the reception on the island), after which they take your luggage and issue an electronic key to the room.  You apply it to the turnstile at the <span>cableway station</span> or at the pier when boarding the boat.  The key is your free ticket, valid for the duration of your stay at the hotel.  The boat dock on the island is located at the Winpearl Nha Trang Bay Resort Villas Hotel, and the cable car station is located directly in the amusement park.  You sit on a tuk-tuk and transported to the hotel.  Suitcases are already waiting in the room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vinpearl resort nha trang 5 vietnam" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1072304.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang 5 * (Vietnam) consists of two five-story buildings in the shape of a crescent.  They are surrounded by a large well-kept park with lawns.  The territory is very nicely decorated.  Thoughtful landscaping allowed to create a lagoon with waterfalls here.  Separately, tourists mention the aviary for peacocks.  There were no complaints about insects in the reviews.  One of the buildings also has several villas.  True, there are not so many of them as in the neighboring hotel Vinpearl Nha Trang Bay Resort Villas 5 *.  There is one building and many cottages designed for families (with two or three bedrooms).  Despite the fact that the two hotels have a similar name, their management is different.  That is, guests of the Resort can‚Äôt use the infrastructure of Bay Villas.  But, of course, within the hotel swimming pools and restaurants, which are their own in every building, are available to all guests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What do you find in the rooms </h2><p>  In the chic Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang 5 * hotel, all guest rooms are classified as deluxe.  They are divided into "Grand" (more expensive) and "Twin".  Balconies with rattan furniture adjoin the rooms.  The view from the windows opens either to the sea, or to the garden and mountains.  Even in standard deluxe suite there is a desk, a minibar, where two bottles of mineral water are placed every day, a coffee table, a safe, a TV with 30 channels, a DVD player, individually controlled air conditioning.  An iron with an ironing board, bathrobes, beach slippers, a hairdryer are a constant attribute of every bathroom.  By the way, the bathroom is amazing guests.  It is spacious, and in addition to the bathtub, it also has a shower cabin.  An electric kettle with tea bags and a welcome fruit basket show the hospitality that the hotel staff show to the guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Vinpearl resort nha trang 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1072305.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pools and the sea </h2><p>  Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang 5 * hotel is located on the front page of its own beach.  Unlike the Winerl Villas, the Resort is turned towards the open sea, and not toward the strait, so the water here is always clean.  Nearby there are no moorings or other boats pouring fuel oil and adversely affecting the environment.  True, there is no animation on the beach either.  But, given that there is a free water park and an amusement park near by, there is no need for it.  The hotel has two pools.  One of them is considered the largest in Southeast Asia.  It stretches throughout the hotel.  This pool is divided into sections, depending on its depth (from 0.5 to 1.8 m).  The second small pool is located at one of the buildings.  Sun beds, umbrellas, beach towels - all this is free for hotel guests.  The sandy coast is carefully cleaned from possible shells, corals and algae.  Lifeguards are on duty at the beach from dawn to dusk.  Sunset at sea gentle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vinpearl resort nha trang 5 nha trang" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1072306.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Many tourists who have visited the Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang 5 * hotel recommend taking <span>full board.</span>  Although the hotel itself does not limit its guests in choosing a food system.  You can live without it, you can order only breakfast or half board.  But, based on the fact that you can‚Äôt bring your own products from the mainland to the Bamboo Island, the issue of nutrition will be a problem.  It will be unprofitable to eat in restaurants and cafes in the territory of the entertainment town, and it will take a long time to ride to Nha Trang for lunch or dinner.  Reviews say a lot about nutrition.  Especially enthusiastic lovers of Asian cuisine.  There are always several rice dishes, meat, poultry, fish, vegetables.  For breakfast, which is served in the Orchid and Lotus restaurants (in both cases), they provide natural juices, yogurts, cereals, sausages, crepes, pastries, a huge selection of tropical fruits.  Lunches and dinners for those who choose the guesthouse are served in buffet style.  Grill is served in the evening.  There are other restaurants that serve √† la carte for a fee - the panoramic ‚ÄúAsiana‚Äù on the cliff and ‚ÄúBeachcomber‚Äù on the beach.  Both buildings have lounge bars and a poolside snack bar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vinpearl resort nha trang 5 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1072307.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Services and Facilities </h2><p>  In the evening, live music is played at the main restaurants of the Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang 5 * hotel (Nha Trang) at dinner.  Almost throughout the hotel there is high-speed Internet.  Since the island is large, it is best to visit its attractions on a bicycle that can be rented.  On the territory itself, you can use the tennis court.  In both buildings there are gyms, entrance to which is free for guests.  Winperl Resort is positioning itself as a spa hotel.  The local rejuvenation center offers various services.  This massage, and wax or laser hair removal, and procedures for body shaping.  Viet-Spa has a hairdresser and a nail salon.  The Executive Building building has its own shopping center, where you can satisfy your craziest shopaholic passions.  One of the bars offers to sing along with karaoke. </p><h2>  Services for the smallest </h2><p>  The very presence of numerous attractions, a dolphinarium, an aquarium, an aqua park makes the hotel ‚ÄúWinterper Resort‚Äù a paradise for children.  To the little guests here is the most reverent attitude.  Every employee, starting with a maid and ending with a gardener, smiles at them, many say compliments and, if their parents don‚Äôt mind, pat their heads.  This attitude towards children is famous throughout Vietnam.  Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang 5 * hotel offers its youngest guests to visit the Fairy Garden game room.  It is located on the seventh floor of one of the buildings.  There, kids can not only play with dolls, but also ride on cars, scooters, bicycles.  There are always cartoons on TV.  On the street there is also a playground with carousels for those who have not yet reached the real attractions, and a sandbox.  A baby cot will be delivered to your room upon request, and restaurants always have high chairs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vinpearl resort nha trang 5 vietnam nha trang" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1072308.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Vinpearl Resort Nha Trang 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists compare services and accommodation at the Resort and Villas.  Prices in the first hotel are higher, but the conditions are better.  Tourists like the vast territory of the Resort, the largest pool in Southeast Asia.  "Villas" is more suitable for a quiet holiday.  In addition, this hotel is located at the very boat pier.  Its guests are also free to use all the attractions of the amusement park on the island.  Tourists respond positively to the nutrition at Villas: a large selection of dishes, tasty and high-quality food.  However, the service in the restaurants of the Resort is beyond any competition.  There you can enjoy exotic dishes such as frog legs or <span>ostrich meat.</span>  Two Russian girls work at the reception, so tourists who do not know English will not have a language barrier. </p>
