    <p>  After the rest, you can visit the Petrovskoye-Knyazhishchevo estate.  This attraction is located near the station in the village of Alabino.  It is known that this estate once belonged to the famous industrialists Demidov, and from the mid-nineteenth century to the princes Meshchersky.  Four outbuildings, a dilapidated main house and a church have remained intact to our times.  During the years of the Russian Empire, the estate often passed into the hands of different owners.  During the Soviet period it was practically destroyed.  Since the beginning of the nineties, a descendant of the Meshchersky dynasty has been living permanently in one of the four wings.  When visiting this attraction, it is possible to plunge into those time periods that the estate has experienced. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  In the conditions of city bustle, a trip to Alabino (Moscow region) for tank biathlon or an unhurried walk through the unique historical places of this area will be a good escape.  A charge of positive emotions is provided.  Have a nice rest! </p>
