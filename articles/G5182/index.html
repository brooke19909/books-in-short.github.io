    <p>  What is remarkable for this area?  Why is the square called ‚Äúswamp‚Äù and what is its history?  Today it is a green area planted with park trees, landscaped with benches, fountains, flower beds, playgrounds for children.  After the reconstruction of the square in the late forties of the last century, a large light and music fountain appeared, the jets of which rise from the drainage channel.  Walking along the promenade, you can see the monument to I.E.  Repin, established here in 1958.  Already in our century, in 2001, the attention was attracted by the sculptural composition ‚ÄúChildren - Victims of Adult Vices,‚Äù by M. Shemyakina, which still amazes with openness.  Young people also did not stand aside.  On the <span>Luzhkov bridge</span> , "trees of love" are installed, on which a huge number of padlocks are hung.  <span>This attraction</span> does not leave indifferent representatives of the young generation and guests of the city.  Bolotnaya Square, photo <strong>&nbsp;</strong>  which is in any tourist avenue, is very popular among city guests. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

The name of the square comes from the features of the natural landscape.  For a long time, the lowland on the other side of the Kremlin was flooded in spring with floods, and then a swamp formed.  In winter, the place of the flooded meadow was covered with ice, and the inhabitants of Moscow arranged a large market.  After the construction of the <span>Drainage Canal</span> and the drainage of the swamp in the fifteenth century, Ivan the Terrible ordered the establishment of a huge <span>orchard</span> here <span>,</span> which lasted until the beginning of the eighteenth century.  The fire of 1701 destroyed the "sovereign garden".  During this period, the people there organized mass festivities, fist fights.

    <p>  In honor of the victory in the Azov campaign, Sovereign Peter the Great, Bolotnaya Square was lit up with fireworks and lights, and in the 20s of the eighteenth century there was a Russian victory in the Swedish company and the coronation of Empress Catherine the First.  It was then that this place was called Tsaritsynoy meadow. </p>

    <p>  Since the reign of Catherine the First, merchants selling grain were located here.  By the beginning of the nineteenth century, Tsaritsyn meadow, or, as merchants called it, Labaznaya Square, was an entire district with city buildings, trading shops and warehouses.  It became especially popular during the period of fasting; merchants of this market set prices for all Moscow markets.  Already at this time, the name of Bolotnaya Square was assigned to the area.  In the 60s of the last century, the name was changed to <span>Repin Square,</span> but already in the late nineties it returned to its former. </p><p>  There are bloody facts in history.  It was here that mass executions were carried out.  Such rebels as Nikita Pustosvyat, Andryushka Bezobrazov, Stepan Razin lost their lives, Emelyan Pugachev was beheaded. </p><p>  It was in the distant past.  Bolotnaya Square acquired a modern look after reconstruction in 1938.  Today it is a favorite meeting place for young people from different subcultures.  Especially popular are the performances of fireworks, street performers.  Recently, youth rallies have been held here in support of the opposition. </p><p>  Tourists wishing to visit the famous square, find out where Bolotnaya Square is located, how to get there, we advise you to go from the metro station "Tretyakovskaya" or "Polyanka".  The path along the picturesque bridges is short-lived and will give <span>aesthetic pleasure.</span> </p>
