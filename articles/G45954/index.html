Suitcases are collected, tickets are bought, it remains for small - to buy something in memory of the Czech Republic.  A tourist from Russia (however, like from any other country) will certainly want to bring home 1-2 bottles of real Czech beer or any other alcoholic drink.  This raises the logical question of how much alcohol can be exported from the Czech Republic.  It's time to get acquainted with some customs rules. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.expats.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech customs" class="if uuid-2565200" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2565200.jpg"></div><h2>  Czech customs </h2><p>  The structure works according to the general rules of the European Union with some amendments to local features.  A tourist arriving in the Czech Republic by plane may bring: </p><ul><li>  200 cigarettes, 250 grams of tobacco or 50 cigars; </li><li>  0.5 kg of coffee or 100 grams of tea; </li><li>  medicines necessary for personal use; </li><li>  no more than 50 ml of perfume (toilet water no more than 250 ml); </li><li>  foreign and Czech currency (not more than 200 000 CZK). </li></ul><p>  In the Czech Republic, as in any country of the European Union, it is forbidden to import drugs, ammunition and firearms, wild animals and birds, meat and dairy products (except for baby and diet food), as well as poisonous and explosives. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.winefrog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much alcohol can be exported from the czech republic" class="if uuid-2565226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2565226.jpg"></div><h2>  Customs regulations at Czech customs: what can be exported </h2><p>  Departing a direct flight from the Czech Republic to Russia, the following facts should be noted: </p><ul><li>  By alcoholic products is meant any liquid that contains ethyl alcohol, which implies ingestion.  According to the rules of air carriers, its strength should not exceed 70 revolutions. </li><li>  It is customary to consider ‚ÄúLiter‚Äù at customs only those products that are in the factory packaging.  Homemade wine in three-liter jars, plastic bottles and cans can simply be confiscated at the border.  This will help to find the answer to the question of how many liters of beer you can take with you from the Czech Republic. </li><li>  Any adult citizen from the Czech Republic to Russia can take no more than five liters of alcohol.  Important: 3 liters of alcohol can be smuggled in just like that;  for the remaining 2 liters you will have to pay extra.  So, every 1000 ml over the limit will cost 10 euros. </li><li>  Minors are not entitled to liters. </li><li>  Theoretically, two adults can transport six liters of alcohol products duty-free across the border.  However, alcohol loaded in one bag can lead to a misunderstanding at the border.  Therefore, it is worth calling in advance to one or another airline to clarify this point. </li><li>  Typical containers for alcohol are glass bottles of 0.5, 0.7 and 1 liter.  Each of them should be wrapped with a bubble wrap, kiss on the track and securely put in a suitcase. </li><li>  In hand luggage, a passenger can only carry an unopened bottle with a volume of not more than 100 ml.  In total, these bottles can have a liter, but all these bottles should be inside a separate bag. </li><li>  When purchasing alcohol in Duty Free, it should be remembered that on board the aircraft it must fall in a proprietary package.  Landing safely in the homeland, it should also be carried out of the plane. </li></ul><p>  Five so-called man-liters - this is the maximum cubic capacity for all baggage (for hand luggage, baggage and standard packages from the "dutik"). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.marmaristravel.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much beer can be taken out of the czech republic" class="if uuid-2565220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2565220.jpg"></div><h2>  Amount of alcohol </h2><p>  Especially "thoughtful" tourists simply do not think about how much alcohol can be exported from the Czech Republic.  They decide that alcohol can simply be mailed.  As practice shows, such a "brilliant" thought will not lead to anything good. </p><p>  Probably, the following information will be useful to someone - the total cost of duty-free goods imported from abroad should not exceed 1,500 euros. </p><p>  What can not be exported from the Czech Republic: </p><ul><li>  any items of artistic value; </li><li>  goods of historical or artistic value, as well as antiques; </li><li>  more than 1 liter of spirits or more than 2 liters of wine or beer. </li></ul><p>  There is a TaxFree system in the Czech Republic.  Thanks to it, you can return up to 20% of the cost of purchases at the border, provided that the goods are purchased in stores that support this system.  The minimum purchase amount is 100 euros. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much beer to take out of the czech republic" class="if uuid-2565213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2565213.jpg"></div><h2>  How much beer can I take out of the Czech Republic? </h2><p>  This question is asked by every tourist who has visited one of the most beautiful European countries.  The taste of real Czech beer is incomparable with any other drink.  Therefore, citizens of Russia are doing their best to bring several bottles of alcoholic beverages across the border. </p><p>  An interesting point: alcohol from the Czech Republic can be exported in unlimited quantities, but alcohol cannot be imported into Russia in barrels.  This means that one adult can bring with him a maximum of 5 liters of alcoholic beverages from the Czech Republic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.withhusbandintow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how many liters of beer" class="if uuid-2565193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2565193.jpg"></div><p>  Russian law does not see the difference between the strength of drinks.  This means that you can take out both 3 liters of beer and 3000 ml of Czech becherovka. </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  Knowing <span>how much alcohol can be exported from the Czech Republic,</span> it becomes interesting what other restrictions apply at customs.  Tourists should be warned about what moments may arise on the Czech border: </p><ul><li>  <span>Bohemian glass</span> and other fragile souvenirs from the Czech Republic should be wrapped with bubble wrap. </li><li>  Before the trip, you should charge all gadgets, as customs officers will ask you to turn on your mobile devices to check if they are a container for transporting prohibited goods. </li><li>  Security officers must check those passengers who are insecure when boarding an airplane.  To save yourself from unnecessary verification and not lose precious time, you should behave confidently, do not look around, keep your head straight and not worry. </li></ul><p>  Knowing how much alcohol can be exported from the Czech Republic, it is worth paying attention to information about other Czech products that will help preserve the memory of this amazing country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="central-eurotours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What can not be exported from the Czech Republic" class="if uuid-2565190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2565190.jpg"></div><h2>  What to bring from the Czech Republic? </h2><p>  In addition to alcoholic beverages, tourists seek to acquire special products that would keep the memory of this amazing country.  We bring to your attention a small list of goods that should be purchased as a souvenir or a memorable gift: </p><ul><li>  Trdelnik is a delicious pastry that is cooked on a wooden babin in charcoal.  By the way, bagels can only be bought in the Czech capital - on Wenceslas and Old Town squares. </li><li>  The Czech mole is a beloved and well-known cartoon character.  Products with his image is a great gift for those who love this cartoon. </li><li>  Bijouterie.  As the Czechs themselves say: "Men - beer, and women - pomegranate."  Jewelry with this stone is especially popular, so you should buy a bracelet or earrings in memory of one of the most beautiful European countries. </li><li>  Another good gift for the fair half of humanity will be natural Czech cosmetics.  Popular brands - Manufacturers, Ryor, Faon - offer ladies the widest range of their products at affordable prices. </li></ul><p>  And that's not all.  Famous <span>Czech glass,</span> T-shirts and caps with national symbols, beer accessories and even ordinary magnets - all this will store a piece of the Czech Republic. </p>
