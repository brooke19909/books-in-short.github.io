Description and photo of paper banknote</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One thousand nine hundred and sixty-first year is notable for the issuance of a Soviet banknote in denominations of 1 ruble, which operated for more than a quarter century.  Her circulation in the USSR ends in 1991.  This is how it looked exactly this year from the reverse side: </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simplification of the picture" class="if uuid-3114043" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123316/3114043.jpg"></div><p>  For thirty years of wandering bills, there have been various features of its manufacture, release.  Of particular interest to collectors is 1 ruble of 1961 type press - in perfect condition, with no signs of walking, as if it had just been made.  The reader probably wants to know how much 1 ruble in 1961 costs. </p><h2>  USSR paper money - year 1961 </h2><p>  A note in the financial market for thirty years is a long time.  In addition, banknotes are in such demanded denomination.  The printing departments took into account hundreds of nuances of the ruble banknote production for such a time.  Varieties of the ruble changed, replaced, but not immediately, but in stages, segments.  The ticket protection was modernized by the treasury of the country, fine details of the art manuscript of his drawing were finalized.  During this period, seven varieties of the described bill were issued.  The differences in issues lurked in double-digit letter series before a seven-digit serial number.  How much does a banknote cost 1 ruble of 1961 of the first issue of the ‚Äúusual‚Äù type and ‚Äúabsolute quality‚Äù, the price thresholds of its varieties - this will be discussed in this article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="with art design" class="if uuid-3113994" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123316/3113994.jpg"></div><h2>  The general format of the popular banknote of the Soviet Union </h2><p>  The banknote is a rectangular type of banknote with design criteria located on the obverse and reverse of the billionth circulation of the banknote of the country of advice.  During the circulation period, more than four billion banknotes were made.  The scale is amazing, isn't it? </p><p>  The drawing contained types and details, security features and provisions, which today determine how much paper 1 ruble in 1961 costs. </p><h2>  Banknote art design details </h2><p>  The obverse for three quarters of the rectangular format contained an art cover with a set of inscriptions and logos of those years.  The last quarter had a white background with a small denomination logo and part of the serial number.  The artistic part of the ruble on the front side looked like this: </p><ul><li>  in the center of the bill is an alphanumeric denomination; </li><li>  on top, the banknote contained a strip of artistic script with a large inscription ‚Äústate treasury ticket‚Äù; </li><li>  on the left side of the ruble below the face value is represented the emblem of the USSR; </li><li>  on the right side after the upper inscription is the logo of the Treasury of the USSR; </li><li>  the lower part of the banknote is also filled with artistic scripture, in which there is a compulsory inscription in a wavy frame, the text of which states that counterfeiting state cash tickets is prohibited and the punishment for this action is indicated; </li><li>  further on the same ligature along the edges is the numerical denomination of the banknote. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.farpost.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Banknote 1961" class="if uuid-3111375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123316/3111375.jpg"></div><p>  It is important to understand that over half a century the type of print and paper type in the banknote was modernized, complicated and reworked, but the state design of the obverse remained unchanged. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The reverse of rectangular money is also artistic in part format.  The remaining part, as on the obverse, had a figured digital logo of face value and part of serial numbers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The reverse of the ruble sample 1961" class="if uuid-3114041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123316/3114041.jpg"></div><p>  The front part of the bill differed in comparison with the back with a two-digit letter code located on top of each artistic part.  If the obverse had both capital letters or upper and lower case letters of the code, then the reverse of the banknote carried two lowercase such characters. </p><h2>  Two-digit letter code and issues of one ruble in the period from 1961 to 1991 </h2><p>  The basis of the variations of the ruble of the sixty-first year of release included seven varieties.  The division was created by two letters at the beginning of the serial number on the obverse of the banknote. </p><p>  Letters for this purpose were used consonants, after - the combination of consonants and vowels, uppercase and lowercase. </p><p>  Two types of font were used at the time of printing banknotes, while 1 type of font was valued (and today is valued) above the second.  Each of which, according to the visual states of the banknote, carries an answer to the main question of numismatists - how much is 1 ruble of the USSR in 1961. </p><h2>  Another criteria for the "main" banknote of the USSR </h2><p>  The second most important distinguishing marks were: </p><ul><li>  Type of paper - The 1961 sample had two types of pulp.  The first type of paper is matte, with a gray tint of a yellowish tint.  The second category of paper is pure white format.  The background is glossy on one side only.  The second subtype of paper was used more widely.  The naked eye will not determine on the ruble sample the variation of the paper on which it is made.  Only an experienced, inquiring glance of a collector will reveal the distinguishing features of one subspecies from another, which will become part of the answer to the question of how much 1 ruble of 1961 of one type or another costs. </li><li>  Watermark - at the time of printing, the bills had such a distinctive element in the form of a star.  It is located linearly, with an inclination on the right sector of a banknote. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water marks" class="if uuid-3111330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123316/3111330.jpg"></div><ul><li>  The print subspecies had three options - offset, metallography and Oryol printing. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="invest-collect.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="1 ruble 1961 bill of the USSR" class="if uuid-3111381" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123316/3111381.jpg"></div><p>  This seems to be the end of the listing of the distinctive print options of the 1961 sample.  Let us return to the main question of this article: how much is 1 ruble of 1961, how does the present value of a banknote depend on its current issue? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="1 ruble note" class="if uuid-3114030" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/123316/3114030.jpg"></div><h2>  Price policy bills for collectors today </h2><p>  In order not to confuse the reader with ruble denomination issues, combinations and differences, describing the collection value, a concise tabular squeeze of the price of one ruble in 1961 is given, depending on the state and issue. </p><p>  A table providing an answer to the question tormenting numismatists - how much is 1 ruble of 1961, based on the parameters and external state of the USSR state ticket: </p><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Release type </p></td><td><p>  Font view </p></td><td><p>  Two-digit code </p></td><td><p>  The real value of the condition is "ordinary", rubles </p></td><td><p>  Actual value state press, rub. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  I issue </p></td><td><p>  I view </p></td><td><p>  BB </p></td><td><p>  200-280 </p></td><td><p>  900-1200 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  II edition </p></td><td><p>  I view </p></td><td><p>  Bm </p></td><td><p>  100-180 </p></td><td><p>  800-1000 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  III edition </p></td><td><p>  I view </p></td><td><p>  mb </p></td><td><p>  110-130 </p></td><td><p>  400-700 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  IV issue </p></td><td><p>  I view </p></td><td><p>  mm </p></td><td><p>  80-100 </p></td><td><p>  300-600 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  V release </p></td><td><p>  II view </p></td><td><p>  BB </p></td><td><p>  30-50 </p></td><td><p>  70-130 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  VI issue </p></td><td><p>  II view </p></td><td><p>  Bm </p></td><td><p>  10-20 </p></td><td><p>  90-110 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  VII edition </p></td><td><p>  II view </p></td><td><p>  mb </p></td><td><p>  5-10 </p></td><td><p>  80 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  To replace </p></td><td>  Between III and IV </td><td><p>  initial "I" or "I" </p></td><td><p>  2000 </p></td><td><p>  4000 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  A small video presentation will be the final chord in the description structure of the legendary domestic banknote: </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="joHpMhJZ-aU" data-url="https://youtu.be/joHpMhJZ-aU" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/9/9/8/14998.jpg"></div><p>  It turns out that the press of the state, issued at the turn of the 3rd and 4th issues, has a worthwhile collection price as a temporary option.  But the main thing is that such an option should have a two-letter alphabetic code on the ‚Äúbody‚Äù, starting with the vowel of the capital letter or capital letter of the last Russian alphabet - ‚ÄúI‚Äù. </p><h2>  One ruble of the beginning of the seventies of the USSR: conclusion </h2><p>  So to summarize.  We hope that for the inexperienced reader of this article we managed to reveal the subject matter concisely and at the same time in detail.  We also hope that the text was able to give an answer in detail to the question of how much the 1 ruble bill of 1961 costs by current standards and requirements. </p>
