It is very honorable.  He is treated with due respect.  In this article we will talk about this military rank, as well as its most prominent representatives. </p><h2>  Features of a military rank </h2><p>  The title Marshal of France is etymologically derived from Old German words meaning "servant" and "horse".  The first marshals appeared in the Frankish tribes.  At that time, they obeyed the stableman. </p><p>  Over time, their importance has grown significantly.  Imperial marshals appeared who monitored the condition of the monarch's horses.  In 1060, King Henry I established the title of Connable, which corresponded to the main stableman.  He was helped by the marshals.  In 1185, the post of marshal was introduced in France to distinguish royal courtiers from vassals. </p><h2>  Gain influence </h2><p>  Marshals first became commanders of the French army in 1191.  Since then they have been performing administrative and disciplinary functions.  Their main task at that time was the conduct of military reviews and inspections.  They are responsible for ensuring the combat effectiveness of individual units, arranging camps, protecting civilians from robberies and violence by soldiers. </p><p>  In the XII century, under King Philip II, the Marshal of France became commander in chief of the royal troops, but only temporarily.  Actively assign this title begin in the XIII century under Louis IX. </p><p>  Royal policy with regard to them is to not appoint to this post for life, in order to prevent the strengthening of the influence of individual clans and the transfer of the post by inheritance.  At that time, the marshals themselves did not consider this position to be one of the steps in the career ladder, although many of them came from the petty nobility. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Led the army </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bertrand-malvaux.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marshal uniform" class="if uuid-3142373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3142373.jpg"></div><p>  In 1627, Louis XIII abolished the post of connable after the death of the Duke de Ledigier, who becomes the last to hold this post.  From this moment on, the rank of marshal becomes military.  They directly direct military campaigns and operations. </p><p>  Under King Henry III, the General States - the highest estate-representative institution - establishes that there should be four marshals in the country.  However, later their number increased by other monarchs.  By the beginning of the 18th century, the French army already had about 20 marshals, among them the sea appeared. </p><p>  Since 1185 in the history of France, this title has been awarded 338 times.  The vast majority of marshals lived before the French Revolution - 256. </p><h2>  Chief Marshal </h2><p>  In addition, there was a special title of chief marshal of France.  It was assigned to only one marshal, the most outstanding.  In fact, it corresponded to the Generalissimo, remaining the highest military rank at that time. </p><p>  In the entire history of the country, he was awarded only six times.  These were the commanders Biron, Ledigier, Vilar, Turenne and Moritz of Saxony.  During the July monarchy, it was received by Marshal Soult.  He became the last major marshal in the history of France. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Title in the 19th century </h2><p>  During the French Revolution, this title was abolished.  It was restored by Napoleon in 1804, when he proclaimed himself emperor.  After that, the republic ceased to exist. </p><p>  At that time, the title testified to high trust on the part of the emperor.  Marshals received in the management of the city, civilian departments, and in some cases even entire countries.  They played an important role in diplomatic missions. </p><p>  In total, during the First Empire, 26 soldiers received the title.  Marshals of Napoleonic France became one of the most famous galaxies of commanders in world history. </p><p>  Again, this title was renewed at the Restoration.  The July monarchy established that France could have 6 marshals in peacetime and up to 12 in wartime. </p><h2>  Current situation </h2><p>  In republican France, the title of Marshal was not awarded from 1870 to 1914.  It was believed that it was associated with Napoleon III, which was an odious fact for the Third Republic.  They restored it only in connection with the outbreak of the First World War.  At present, in France this title is considered to be an honorary title rather than a military title in the literal sense of the word. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that they can assign it posthumously, in contrast to the ranks.  For example, of the four people who became marshals after the Second World War, only Alfons Juan got it during his lifetime. </p><h2>  Marks of Excellence </h2><div class="photo" data-original="fr.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marshall's Wand" class="if uuid-3142372" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3142372.jpg"></div><p>  The main insignia of the marshal is the blue rod.  During royal times, it was decorated with golden bees and lilies.  When Napoleon came to power, they were replaced by imperial eagles.  Stars are currently used. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the casket and shoulder straps there is also an insignia in the form of seven stars. </p><h2>  Jean-Baptiste-Jules Bernadotte </h2><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jean Bernadotte" class="if uuid-3142371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3142371.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most famous names on the list of French marshals is Jean-Baptiste-Jules Bernadotte, a participant in the Napoleonic and revolutionary wars.  True, he became famous all over the world after all.  He became known as the founder of the royal dynasty in Sweden. </p><p>  Bernadotte was born in the town of Pau in southwestern France in 1763.  At 17, he enlisted in the infantry regiment due to the plight of the family.  The excellent fencer Jean-Baptiste was respected among his superiors, in 1788 he received the rank of sergeant.  He did not dream of an officer rank, as he came from a low class. </p><p>  Bernadotte made a career during the French Revolution.  For two years he fought in the Rhine army, having received the rank of brigadier general by 1794.  In 1797, fate brought him to Napoleon Bonaparte.  They became friends, although later quite often they clashed. </p><p>  In the marshals of France since Napoleon, he gained a reputation as one of the most prominent military leaders.  At the beginning of the 19th century, he held various government posts.  In 1804, when the empire was proclaimed, Bernadotte became a marshal.  In 1805 he participated in the battle of Ulm, in which the Austrian army was completely defeated. </p><p>  After the Peace of Tilsit, he received the post of governor of the Hanseatic cities.  As an experienced politician, he gained popularity among the local population.  At the same time, with Napoleon, his relationship became increasingly strained.  The main reason was his removal from command of large military units. </p><p>  As a result, Bernadotte became so popular in Sweden that the state council, assembled by the current monarch Charles XIII to determine the successor, unanimously offered him a crown.  The only condition was the adoption of Lutheranism.  Behind this decision was the desire of the Swedes to please Napoleon.  Bernadotte agreed, in 1810 he was dismissed from service.  Already in November, he was officially adopted by the king. </p><p>  From that moment, the former Marshal of France was regent, and in fact - the immediate ruler of Sweden.  He ascended the throne in 1818 under the name of Charles XIV Johan.  It is noteworthy that at the head of the country he was marked by anti-Napoleonic politics, breaking off relations with France in 1812 for the sake of peace with Russia. </p><p>  In 1813-1814, Bernadotte fought against his compatriots at the head of the Swedish forces on the side of the anti-Napoleonic coalition.  In domestic politics, he was remembered for reforms in agriculture and education, was engaged in restoring the country's prestige and strengthening its economic situation. </p><p>  In 1844, the king died at the age of 81.  The Bernadotte dynasty still rules in Sweden. </p><h2>  Louis Alexander Bertier </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Louis Alexander Bertier" class="if uuid-3142375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3142375.jpg"></div><p>  Bertier is another famous Napoleonic marshal.  He is from Versailles, where he was born in 1753.  He built a dizzying military career, becoming in 1799 the chief of staff of Napoleon I. </p><p>  Historians note the contribution of Marshal of France Berthier to almost all the military campaigns of the emperor until 1814.  His special merit is considered to be a march of nine giant corps from the English Channel to the Austrian plains.  Its outcome was the legendary Battle of Austerlitz.  Napoleon greatly appreciated his abilities.  Recalling the defeat at Waterloo, he argued that he would never have lost if Berthier had been the chief of staff. </p><p>  The marshal has continuously served the emperor for about 20 years.  When the monarch was deprived of the throne, Berthier did not suffer this blow.  Under unclear circumstances, he fell out of the window of the third floor.  Researchers do not rule out suicide. </p><h2>  Louis Nicolas Davout </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Louis Nicolas Davout" class="if uuid-3142370" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3142370.jpg"></div><p>  Davout went down in history under the nickname "Iron Marshal" of France.  According to official historiography, this was the only Napoleonic commander who did not lose a single battle.  He was born in Burgundy in 1770.  He was educated at a military school in Brienne.  He began to serve in the cavalry. </p><p>  During the revolution he commanded a battalion of the Northern Army under the command of General Dumurier.  When he ordered to oppose revolutionary Paris, Davout ordered the arrest of the commander and even shoot him, but the general disappeared. </p><p>  Davout was on the side of the Girondins, denying revolutionary terror.  In 1793 he resigned, abandoning the rank of brigadier general.  He returned to service after the Thermidorian coup. </p><p>  He received the title of Marshal in 1805.  He participated in the battle of Austerlitz and the Ulm operation.  During the Patriotic War of 1812, the "iron marshal" of France fought near Smolensk.  He was shell-shocked at Borodino. </p><p>  During the first Restoration, he was the only one who did not renounce Napoleon.  Marshal of France received the post of Minister of War when Bonaparte returned from Elba. </p><p>  After the defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, he put forward demands for complete amnesty for all who participated in the Napoleon Restoration.  Otherwise, he threatened to continue the resistance.  The Allies failed to convince him.  They were forced to accept his terms. </p><p>  In 1823 he died in Paris from pulmonary tuberculosis. </p><h2>  Joachim Murat </h2><div class="photo" data-original="thephraser.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Joachim Murat" class="if uuid-3142376" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3142376.jpg"></div><p>  Murat is known for having been married to Emperor Carolina Bonaparte's sister.  He himself was born in southwestern France in 1767.  For outstanding courage and military success, Napoleon granted him the Kingdom of Naples in 1808. </p><p>  During the Patriotic War of 1812, Marshal of France Murat commanded troops in Germany, at the beginning of 1813 voluntarily resigned.  In several battles of that campaign, he participated in the rank of Marshal, returning to his kingdom after losing the battle of Leipzig. </p><p>  In early 1814, unexpectedly for many, he sided with the opponents of Napoleon.  After the triumphant return of the emperor, Murat tried again to swear allegiance to him, but the monarch refused his services.  This unsuccessful attempt cost him the Neapolitan crown. </p><p>  In 1815 he was arrested.  According to investigators, he tried to regain power during the coup.  Shot by order of the court. </p><h2>  Henri Philippe Petain </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nations.wikia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Henri Philippe Petain" class="if uuid-3142374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3142374.jpg"></div><p>  P√©tain is one of the most famous French military leaders at the turn of the XIX-XX centuries.  He was born in the northwest of the country in 1856.  Peten received the title of Marshal of France in 1918 after the end of the First World War. </p><p>  Despite his venerable age (he was 62 years old), he was not going to leave the political arena.  In 1940, after the occupation of France by German troops, he advocated a truce with Hitler, becoming the prime minister of an authoritarian collaborative government.  As a result, he was proclaimed head of the French state and endowed with dictatorial powers.  His power was recognized by most world powers, including the Soviet Union and the United States.  At first, he himself led the government, but then transferred these powers, appointing Pierre Laval as prime minister. </p><p>  At the end of the summer of 1944, P√©tain, together with the government, was evacuated to Germany as the Allied forces approached.  He remained there until the spring of 1945, when he was captured and sent to Paris. </p><p>  He was convicted of war crimes and high treason, sentenced to death.  The head of the Provisional Government de Gaulle pardoned 89-year-old Petain, replacing the execution with life imprisonment.  The marshal spent the last years of his life on the island of Ye, where he was buried in 1951 at the age of 95. </p>
