It is an amazing city that is really worth a visit.  So, which transport is best to choose for the route between two cities: Yoshkar-Ola, Moscow? </p><h2>  Geographical location and history </h2><p>  The Republic of Mari El, which is sometimes half-seriously called the last refuge of the pagans, is located east of the capital, but still in the European part.  So, Yoshkar-Ola, Moscow ... The distance between these cities is not so big, it is about 860 kilometers.  This republic is interesting in that the titular nation - the Mari - is an adherent of its own traditional religion, combining polytheism and monotheism.  In addition, the capital of the subject of the federation should be visited because of its beauty. </p>

    <p>  It is believed that Yoshkar-Ola was founded in 1584 to suppress possible unrest and uprisings among the people.  It was a fortress in which all the resources necessary for this task were stored.  Later, the city began to develop as a craft and trade center, gradually losing its original purpose.  For several centuries this settlement remained a large village.  But the Great Patriotic War gave a powerful impetus to the development after some plants and factories from other cities were evacuated to Yoshkar-Ola. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, the capital of the republic is inhabited by just over 250 thousand people.  This number has been constantly growing in recent years.  So, having absorbed about 20 villages, it became a real city.  So, what is the best way to plan a round trip - Yoshkar-Ola - Moscow - Yoshkar-Ola?  What type of transport will be more convenient? </p><h2>  Bus </h2><p>  Passenger traffic on the route "Yoshkar-Ola - Moscow - Yoshkar-Ola" is carried out by several companies at once.  In the capital of Mari El, they expect travelers on the site between the railway and the bus station, departure time is standard at 18.00.  In Moscow there are several options for the final stops: Kazansky <span>Station,</span> metro stations Shchelkovskaya and Partizanskaya.  Travel time on the <span>route is</span> approximately 13-16 hours. </p>

    <p>  Bus "Moscow - Yoshkar-Ola" has several advantages compared to other modes of transport: </p><ul><li>  relative cheapness (one-way ticket will cost no more than 1500 rubles); </li><li>  rapidity; </li><li>  convenient departure time; </li><li>  no need to book or buy tickets in advance, as you can do this with <span>the bus driver.</span> </li></ul><p>  Of course, there are drawbacks: many passengers complain about the poor performance of air conditioners, cramped spaces, uncomfortable seats.  In addition, an unsuccessful fellow traveler may come across, with whom he will have to spend more than 12 hours in direct contact! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In recent years, accidents involving buses have become more frequent, and very often those that follow the Yoshkar-Ola-Moscow route and vice versa appear in news reports.  This type of transport can hardly be called safe.  However, most passengers are not afraid of this, and the intercity bus is very popular, both from Yoshkar-Ola to Moscow, and along the route "Moscow - Yoshkar-Ola." </p><h2>  A train </h2><p>  Another way to get from one capital to another is by rail.  Since 1973, there is a branded train "Mari El", which leaves every day from the Kazan <span>station in Moscow</span> at 16:40.  It is somewhat inconvenient that arrival is in the early morning, and the total travel time is longer than that of the bus.  The return route is shifted to a later time: departure at 19:26, and arrival at 9:00.  Many travelers who travel to the capital of Mari El may find the Moscow-Yoshkar-Ola railway route uncomfortable. </p>

    <p>  The train, of course, is more comfortable than the bus, but the ticket price is higher.  Depending on the category of car, you will have to pay between 2,600 and 5,500 rubles per seat.  Despite the fact that the train runs daily, it is not always possible to buy tickets for the coming dates, so you will have to plan your trip in advance. </p><h2>  Airplane </h2><p>  Finally, the fastest way to get from one capital to another is by air.  It takes only 2 hours, of course, not counting the time for the road to the airport, registration and other formalities.  In this case, urgency will be a priority, and it costs the corresponding money - for a one-way ticket you will have to pay from 5000 rubles.  UTair Airlines makes regular flights to the capital of Mari El, but the disadvantage is that they do not fly every day.  So on the route "Moscow - Yoshkar-Ola" the plane also does not always help out.  On the other hand, it is one of <span>the safest modes of transport,</span> despite the fact that most travelers think otherwise. </p>

    <h2>  Car </h2><p>  The distance allows you to get on the route "Yoshkar-Ola - Moscow" or "Moscow - Yoshkar-Ola" by personal transport, and quite quickly, in about 16 hours on the M7 highway.  The advantage of this option is a fairly free route planning: stops in Murom, Nizhny Novgorod and Cheboksary will provide an opportunity to get acquainted with these cities.  In addition, you can choose a convenient time so as not to get stuck in traffic jams, which is especially important if you go to Moscow, and not from it.  You will not be bothered by unpleasant fellow travelers, as you can make a trip at least alone.  But the profit on money is very doubtful: the cost of fuel can be very high. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Why go to the capital of the republic of Mari El?  If the popularity of the Yoshkar-Ola-Moscow route is understandable, then the desire to leave the center for the outback does not always seem logical, unless, of course, this is a business trip.  However, there is something to see in this city. </p>

    <p>  Firstly, it is an old city, where wooden buildings of the 19th century are still preserved.  Secondly, it is worth taking a look at the clock on the building of the art gallery, which is often called the Mari chimes - they are the hallmark of Yoshkar-Ola.  Of course, this is the embankment of Bruges, so named because of a certain similarity with the architecture of the Belgian city.  Monuments, museums - all this, of course, is worth seeing.  But much more valuable is the amazing nature and seemingly completely different people ... If it seems that this is not enough, it is easy to get to Kazan nearby. </p>
