    <p>  It is desirable that the combinations are harmonious.  Further preparations are carried out.  You need to take and glue the very edge of each strip.  It turns out a drop shape.  When many such ‚Äúdrops‚Äù have already been made, you can begin assembling the flower itself.  To do this, you need to glue a ‚Äúdrop‚Äù with another same part.  The work is painstaking, but the more petals stick together, the more magnificent and beautiful the finished work is obtained.  If the flower consists of different petals, you need to carefully look so that the colors alternate, then the composition will be perfect. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bright aster </h2><p>  This is a very voluminous and beautiful paper flower craft.

    <p>  The main thing is that all the cones are the same.  You can first practice by making several test copies.  If it started to work out, then you can already pick up the color scheme suitable for this wonderful magnificent flower.  Usually, asters have several shades, passing smoothly from dark to lighter.  Before starting work, it is necessary to cut out a circle from cardboard, the diameter of which is equal to the size of the flower.  It is desirable that the color matches the bottom layer of the cones.  Further assembly begins.  The first layer, the darkest, is glued along the edge of the circle with a bell of a cone from the center, like the sun.  The second layer for children's flower crafts made of paper is pasted with a retreat of 1 cm into the circle.  And so we continue to the central point, changing shades. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bulk Carnations </h2><p>  In order to perform such crafts of <span>flowers from paper, schemes</span> and description need to be studied carefully.  To start, prepare the same size wide strips of paper, you can use corrugated.  When the cut is ready, it needs to be folded several times.  For such a clove, sharp thin petals are needed.  To do this, the paper collected in several layers should be finely cut, but not to the end of the strip, but leaving about 1 cm of paper free. </p>

    <p>  When all the strips have a terry edge, you can begin to twist the layers.  In the middle, you need to tightly twist a strip of light color, as in the photo.  Then glue the edge of the dark color to the light one and continue to wind up a strip of a different shade.  The end also sticks well so that the flower holds tight.  The last step will be spreading the petals. </p><h2>  Bouquet of hyacinths </h2><p>  Such children's paper flower crafts can be presented to mom on March 8th.  This will be a real surprise.  To complete such a bouquet, you need to buy several cocktail tubes, preferably green, like stems.  Half of the flower is the petals, the other is the leaves.  To make the first part, you need to cut a strip of colored double-sided paper on one side, not completely, leaving 1 cm from the bottom for gluing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The next step is to wind each petal onto a round stick (pencil).  This will give them roundness and volume.  The even part of the strip is smeared with PVA glue and wound tightly in a spiral from the middle of the stick up to the edge.  It remains to make green leaves.  The principle of the work is the same.  A green square on one side is cut into sharp sheets.  We lubricate the even part with glue and simply wind the paper from below around the tube, only tightly pressing each turn. </p><h2>  A little about quilling technique </h2><p>  Many lovers of beautiful crafts of paper flowers tried to work with stripes using the quilling method or, in Russian, twisting.  On sale there are whole sets of already cut strips of thick paper designed for such work.  You can also buy a hook for convenience and patterns with cut out circles of different diameters.  Each quilling element is performed by twisting these strips.  Then they are pressed into any shape.  Let's look at how to make paper crafts in this way. </p><h2>  Volumetric flowers by quilling </h2><p>  The flower consists of two parts: a yellow center and colored carved leaves.  To complete this craft, you need strips from the set - thin and widest.  We take a hook for quilling and tightly twist a thin strip.  You should get a tightly wound tight circle. </p>

    <p>  The edge of the part is sealed with PVA.  A wide strip before twisting should be prepared by cutting the fringe edge to the middle.  Glue the beginning of a wide strip to the middle of the flower and begin to wind up tightly.  The last turn also needs to be glued.  All that remains is to bend the colored petals from the center to the edges with a gentle movement.  Volumetric flower is ready. </p><h2>  Sunflower </h2><p>  This is a very beautiful DIY paper craft.  Color schemes can be seen in the photograph.  It uses a combined version.  The first part is the yellow sunflower petals, which are cut from thick double-sided paper.  The second part is black ‚Äúseeds‚Äù inside, made according to the ‚Äúcones‚Äù method described earlier. </p>

    <p>  Work begins with cutting a thick cardboard circle of large diameter.  This will be the basis for our work.  Further petals are prepared.  A template is drawn by which all the same elements are cut.  The first petals are glued along the contour of the circle with sharp tips to the side from the center.  Performing the next layer is more difficult, since here the petals must be voluminous.  To achieve this effect, you need to cut the lower dull part of the petal in the middle.  The incision is small, about 1 cm. When the petal is pasted, these cut edges overlap one another, while the petal itself bends a little and becomes voluminous. </p><h2>  Black middle </h2><p>  It remains to decorate the sunflower with black ‚Äúseeds‚Äù in the center.  So that they were fluffy, and the product itself looked beautiful, you need to make several cones from black square leaflets with a sticky layer.  The last step will be gluing the middle.  Work begins on the outer edge and converges toward the center.  Such sunflowers can be made on a large sheet of size A3 and supplement the picture with stems and leaves.  You can decorate a class with such a composition in the fall or complete a picture at an exhibition.  First place guaranteed. </p><h2>  The most difficult craft is the rose </h2><p>  The most difficult object in working with paper is a rose.  This beautiful and delicate flower is loved by all women and girls.  But making such a craft is a rather complicated process.  The difficulty lies in self-drawing.  First you need to cut a circle of paper, for example, pink, as in the photo.  Then with a simple pencil you need to draw a spiral in which all the turns will be the same width.  You can train in advance, since the first time it may not work.  It's okay, you don‚Äôt need to get upset, but try again.  You can train on plain white paper. </p>

    <p>  Next, with small sharp scissors, you need to cut the resulting spiral along the contour.  Then gently twist it, the edges can be smoothly bent to the sides.  The end of the spiral is glued to the last turn.  It remains with PVA to fix the finished rose on a cardboard sheet by adding petals. </p><p>  Making paper crafts is a creative, interesting and painstaking work.  But the works will not pass in vain.  A beautiful picture will please the eye for a long time.  And paper flowers will never fade, and will decorate the room for a long time, recalling the warm days. </p>
