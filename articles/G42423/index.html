  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Metaphysics is a new unconventional approach to the treatment of diseases</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, methods of treating diseases have begun to become popular, which begin with a search for the metaphysical causes of malaise associated with a person‚Äôs behavior, his actions, his attitude to himself and the environment. </p><p>  In order to understand the principles of this approach to the source of human problems, let us try to clarify the very meaning of the word <em>metaphysics</em> .  This is the <span>branch of philosophy</span> that deals with answers to questions about the root causes of the universe.  It is based on the task of creating a more holistic picture of the world than in modern science, in which there is a place for God and the immortal human soul. </p><p>  Throughout history, the direction has either been rejected as a false doctrine, then flourished again, finding its adherents among scientists.  Aristotle believed that metaphysics is the most valuable of all sciences. </p><p>  Even Socrates argued that the diseases of the body do not exist separately from the ailments of the soul.  And his student Plato was sure that it is impossible to separate one from the other during treatment.  For a metaphysician, determining the cause of the disease is first of all finding out the internal sources of malaise, which are often psychological in nature and signal a discord between the person and the world around him. </p><p>  The search for the spiritual principle of human problems is used today in psychosomatics.  This is a modern approach to health, based on a synthesis of medicine and psychology, studying the effect of negative emotions and internal conflicts of the patient on the occurrence and course of physical malaise. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In psychosomatics, studies are conducted of the connections between the traits of an individual, his behavior style and illness.  This approach is similar to alternative medicine, which is based on the theory that the source of all ailments is experiences, stresses and negative mental images that accumulate in the subconscious. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>  We can say that the metaphysics of disease is a spiritual experience that is reflected in the human body. </p><p>  According to experts, <strong> </strong>  the cause of alcoholism is often a sense of own worthlessness and guilt.  The source of drug addiction is the loss of the meaning of life, the inability to adapt in society and the social environment.  An allergy can occur as a reaction to an unbearable situation for a person that a person cannot resolve.  The beginning provoking kidney disease is reluctance to live, thoughts of suicide, love of self-criticism and <span>disappointment in people.</span>  According to some scholars, the origin of stigmata is of a psychosomatic nature and is associated with the fact that the individual begins to identify himself with Christ and emotionally experiences his crucifixion. </p><p>  In alternative medicine, metaphysics is a broader concept than in the scientific field.  Among healers, there is a theory that a person is part of a larger body with a consciousness - the Universe - and the source of his malaise is considered as a result of wrong actions and thoughts that contradict the laws of the universe. <strong> </strong></p><p>  Such an attitude to health is consonant with Tibetan medicine, whose healers treat the body only in conjunction with the internal causes of the disease. </p><p>  In the new approach to diseases, which are based on a stressful situation, a negative pessimistic perception of reality and the inability to adapt to it, it becomes clear that the path to recovery lies through love and achieving harmony with the world.  In this sense, metaphysics is logotherapy, leading the patient to answers to eternal questions about the purpose and meaning of the individual's existence. </p><p>  Today, new methods of treatment are intensively studied by scientists, research and testing of patients is carried out, cases are classified and diagnostic methods are developed. </p>
