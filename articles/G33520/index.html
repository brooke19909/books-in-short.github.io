Most often, problems arise in the older generation.  In most cases, they are associated with the operation of bank plastic.  For example, many are interested in <span>how to find out the credit card balance of the</span> Agricultural Bank.  We will talk about this further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lentakreditov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Internet office" class="if uuid-2519560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/2519560.jpg"></div><h2>  What options for checking balance exist? </h2><p>  Since representatives of the Agricultural Bank take care of their customers, they developed several options at once to request information on the card.  The following options are currently known: </p><ul><li>  By request through an ATM. </li><li>  When using the mobile banking service. </li><li>  By phone hotline customer support. </li><li>  On the Internet (through the official website of the bank). </li><li>  At the office of a bank branch. </li></ul><p>  All these options and offers its customers Rosselkhozbank.  How to find out the card balance in a particular case, everyone decides for himself.  The main thing is to choose the most suitable option among several possible ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="open-deposit.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plastic card bank" class="if uuid-2519563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/2519563.jpg"></div><h2>  Checking information through an ATM </h2><p>  This is one of the easiest ways to find out the balance of the Russian Agricultural Bank card.  It is a standard procedure that does not require any special training and connection.  To execute it, it is enough to know your PIN code and insert the card into the corresponding window with the right side. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="znaibalans.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Check balance online" class="if uuid-2519545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/2519545.jpg"></div><h2>  How to insert a card into an ATM? </h2><p>  Typically, a card hole is indicated by an arrow, highlighted in bright color, or has a bright, luminous backlight.  Insert the card face up.  In this case, the black magnetic tape should be at the bottom.  Logos of the money system (for example, Visa) should be closer to you and further from the incoming card hole. </p><p>  If your bank plastic is inserted correctly, the card will smoothly and effortlessly enter the receiving window and hide in the ATM of the Russian Agricultural Bank.  How to find out the balance of the card by entering the secret code, we will describe further. </p><p>  The wrong approach will cause login problems.  The ATM mechanism simply will not accept it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="balanscard.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mobile banking" class="if uuid-2519565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/2519565.jpg"></div><h2>  Card inserted: what's next? </h2><p>  After the ATM accepts your card, you must enter the secret code.  If necessary, select the appropriate language for the information on the screen.  Following the prompts, select the operation you want to perform.  In this case, it will look like "Check card balance." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After choosing this option, it remains only to choose where you want to display the balance amount on the screen or on the check.  Having received information about the status of the account, you can perform a new operation, for example, cash out money or pay for any services.  This is the easiest way to find out the balance of the Rosselkhozbank card.  This can also be done via telephone.  And in two ways: by standard dialing into a special hotline or through mobile banking.  We will talk about each of them in detail. </p><h2>  How to find out the balance of a card of the Agricultural Bank by number? </h2><p>  The second simple option to search for information about the status of your card account is to call the bank customer support service.  Such numbers, as a rule, are indicated not only on the official website of the Agricultural Bank, but also on the card itself. </p><p>  Usually they start with 8 (800).  At the same time, the client has a choice between communicating with the bank manager or operator, as well as receiving answers automatically, following the voice prompts.  But in both cases, you will be asked to enter certain numbers or answer questions for preliminary identification of your personality.  For those who do not like to call, it will be interesting to find out the balance of the Rosselkhozbank card via SMS.  How to do it? </p><h2>  We learn the account by SMS </h2><p>  This service will be available only after the preliminary activation of the ‚ÄúSMS notification service‚Äù.  You can do this right away when you receive a card in any branch of the bank, using an ATM or personal account in Internet banking. </p><p>  With the active service, it is easy to find out the balance of the Rosselkhozbank card via SMS.  As in the case with the hotline, in this case it is necessary to send a request to a special bank number indicating the last numbers of your card.  In the text of the message you usually need to indicate the word "BAL" or "BAL" and the last four digits of your plastic. </p><h2>  Is it difficult to check an account online? </h2><p>  You can receive information about the status of your card account on the Internet.  This is done with access to your personal account on the official website of the bank.  To enter and work with the site you need to register, come up with a username and password.  So, you have registered on the site.  But how to find out the balance of the card of the Agricultural Bank? </p><p>  To do this, follow these steps: </p><ul><li>  Go to the bank website. </li><li>  Log in using your username and password. </li><li>  Go to the main page of the bank with current information on current accounts. </li></ul><p>  If there is no such information on the site, you will need to go to the "My Accounts and Cards" section.  Here you can see the status of all your current accounts, the operations on them and the balance sheet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="znaibalans.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Application Registration" class="if uuid-2519557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28035/2519557.jpg"></div><h2>  Account Information Using Mobile Banking </h2><p>  This option is considered a great alternative to Internet banking.  However, before that, you should register in the system with the current contact phone number.  Then it remains only to install on your device a special application called "M-Token".  Thanks to this application, you will be able to control all operations on current accounts, in whatever place or country you are located. </p><p>  At the next stage, you will need to register in the application system.  After that, it will be possible to get information about the status of your account through the ‚ÄúMy cards‚Äù tab. </p><h2>  How to check the balance in the bank office? </h2><p>  If all the previous options for checking the balance do not suit you, you just have to visit the nearest bank branch.  From the point of view of technical and virtual literacy, this is the easiest way to obtain information on the map.  For this you only need a passport. </p><p>  Further, the bank representative will gladly provide you with a paper version of the statement for all card transactions.  However, this option will be relevant only at the time of your arrival at a financial institution.  When making new card payment transactions, such an extract will no longer be relevant. </p><p>  Now you know how to check your credit card balance. </p>
