  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Representative democracy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In a <span>democratic state, the</span> people are considered the only bearer and <span>source of power</span> .  In accordance with the nature of the expression of interests and the will of society, there are two forms of democracy.  These forms include direct and representative democracy. </p><p>  The first involves the solution of state issues with the direct participation of citizens.  At the same time, meetings, referenda, rural gatherings, and so on are the manifestations of <span>the people's power</span> . </p><p>  Representative democracy provides for the realization of the will of the people through representatives.  They can be <span>public organizations,</span> elected bodies, parties and others. </p><p>  Democracy is supposed to provide a mechanism for the development of collective decisions that meet the interests of civil society to the fullest extent.  Direct and representative democracy differ from each other, of course.  However, both of these forms are aimed at the realization of popular power.  It is believed that in these conditions, when making public decisions, the same goals are achieved as in the performance of individual ones. </p><p>  Representative democracy implies the choice of responsible persons by citizens.  They, in turn, jointly solve problems, make (through voting) collective decisions.  Thus, the principle of this form of democracy is manifested. </p><p>  Representative democracy provides for a special relationship between elected representatives and voters.  Candidates tell people about the ideas and principles that will be applied at the core of their policies, and citizens choose the person whose ideas are closest to their own. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The democratic process is based on the principle of honesty.  However, as practice shows, it is not always applied.  Many candidates understand that those who tell voters what they would like to hear are more likely to win.  But this is not always what the applicants really think.  However, representative democracy provides for the removal of the chosen one in the event that he does not fulfill his obligations.  Thus, it is possible to maintain conditions close to equilibrium.  It is not always the representatives that the voters need that are elected.  But the latter can <span>correct the mistake of</span> choice in the next vote. </p><p>  Sometimes in certain situations, a significant deviation of conditions from the equilibrium state can occur.  Applicants find ways in which they fill the gap between their actions and these promises.  Candidates begin to conduct opinion polls, study public opinion, and convene meetings.  Thus, representatives find out the wishes and needs of voters and build their statements and proposals accordingly, that is, so that they meet the demands of the electorate.  As a result, a correspondence is formed between the wishes of voters and the promises of applicants.  However, often the process goes the wrong way.  Voter expectations coincide with candidates' statements.  At the same time, applicants whose ideas meet the needs of the electorate may not be selected.  As a result, voters again do not receive the representatives they need and are disappointed in the election process. </p><p>  Sometimes the electorate itself is not perfect.  It is assumed that by choosing representatives who will subsequently be guided by the true interests of society, voters sometimes try to realize their purely personal interests, putting them above the interests of society.  In turn, applicants often appeal to the same selfish needs of individual citizens.  And, due to the fact that representatives are not able to take into account absolutely all interests, they (candidates) are forced to give preference only to certain needs of voters. </p>
