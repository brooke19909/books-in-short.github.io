This is the land of the Mayans and the Aztecs, which for a long time was under the control of Spain.  More than once, its inhabitants had to fight for their independence with the help of revolutions and unification with other countries of Latin America.  What is represented on the coat of arms and flag of El Salvador?  What is the meaning of the national symbols of the country? </p><h2>  Flag of El Salvador: photo and description </h2><p>  Symbols of the state were adopted in 1912.  Throughout the history of the republic, they have repeatedly changed.  The creators of today's flag of El Salvador were inspired by the historical symbols of the country, which operated at a time when the republic was part of the United Provinces of Central America.  Then the state flag consisted of three equal horizontal stripes.  The upper and lower bands were blue.  In the middle was a strip of white, in the center of which was the emblem of the national coat of arms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="simbologyworld.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flag of el salvador" class="if uuid-2572807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2572807.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, the flag of El Salvador also consists of three stripes, only the blue tint on it has replaced the cobalt blue tint.  In heraldry, this color traditionally symbolizes the sky and purity.  For the culture of El Salvador, it is of particular importance, as it is associated with indigo - a natural dye that has long been made in the country.  The white stripe symbolizes peace and tranquility. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is an alternative flag of El Salvador, which is used as a civil and marine symbol.  It has the same stripes, but in the center of the white field is depicted not a coat of arms, but a gold inscription DIOS UNION LIBERTAD, which means "God, unity, freedom." </p><div class="photo" data-original="designlooter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alternative flag of el salvador" class="if uuid-2572801" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2572801.jpg"></div><h2>  Flag with stars </h2><p>  From 1865 to 1912, another flag existed in the history of El Salvador.  It consisted of nine horizontal stripes of blue and white, alternating between each other.  On the left is a red canton with the image of white five-pointed stars representing the provinces of the republic.  Most likely, this design was inspired by the national symbols of the United States. </p><p>  At first there were nine stars on it, but as soon as a new province appeared, another star was added to the flag.  So, by May 1877 there were 14 of them. The flag had two sides.  The reverse depicted a red canton with the national emblem of the state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": Fornax, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flag of Salvador 1865" class="if uuid-2572900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2572900.jpg"></div><h2>  Coat of arms of the republic </h2><p>  A coat of arms miniature is depicted on the flag of El Salvador.  At its center is a triangle with a golden outline framed by the green branches of the laurel.  Its leaves form 14 bunches, symbolizing 14 administrative regions of the country.  Four blue and white flags peek out from the sides of the triangle, and another is located above its top.  They represent the banners of the Federal Republic of Central America. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": Hugo Bonilla, "><img itemprop="image" alt="coat of arms of el salvador" class="if uuid-2572926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/2572926.jpg"></div><p>  Inside the triangle are five volcanoes that represent the states of the United Provinces of Central America.  They are colored green, which is associated with the region's evergreen rainforests.  Above the volcanoes rises a red <span>Phrygian cap</span> on a golden stick - an ancient symbol of freedom and independence.  Behind it lies the golden sun, in the rays of which there is an inscription with the date that the country gained independence, "September 15, 1821".  Over the sun an arch bends a rainbow as a symbol of peace. </p><p>  Under the triangle is a white ribbon with the familiar motto ‚ÄúGod, unity, freedom‚Äù.  The inscription REP√öBLICA DE EL SALVADOR EN LA AM√âRICA CENTRAL, which means ‚ÄúRepublic of El Salvador in Central America,‚Äù surrounds the entire composition of the coat of arms over the semicircle. </p>
