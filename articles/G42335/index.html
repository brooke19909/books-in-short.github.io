One of the most popular cities is Negombo, located on the west coast of the island.  This city grew out of a fishing village.  Negombo retained his specialization to this day.  Only now it is already a major fishing center.  The coast of its southern part is occupied by fishing piers.  This place is popular with tourists.  The city has a huge fish market, which is recommended to visitors to the country, even just for fun. </p><h2>  Hotel in the tourist area of ​​Negombo </h2><p>  If the southern part of the city remained at the disposal of the fishermen, then relatively clean sandy beaches extended along the northern direction, along which a tourist area was formed.  Its main streets are Lewis Place and Porutota Road, which stretch parallel to the ocean.  Along these streets and in their vicinity is the bulk of hotels, shops for tourists, <span>cafes, restaurants,</span> clubs.  Here, on Porutota Road, is the Paradise Holiday Village 3 * hotel. </p><p>  Negombo, due to its proximity to the airport, does not lack tourists.  The hotel is just 15 km from Bandaranaike Airport.  Given that the road passes through the city, the whole journey will take about half an hour. </p><h2>  Beach and ocean </h2><p>  Some tourist sites indicate that the hotel is located about 100 meters from the beach.  This can be considered true if you measure the distance on the map in a straight line.  However, not all vacationers believe that the coast in this place is equipped for a comfortable stay.  A normal sand strip 80–100 m wide begins 350–400 meters to the south and stretches for almost a kilometer.  This is the largest beach in Negombo.  In the server direction of the hotel you can also find several small sandy beaches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, it can be said that the Paradise Holiday Village 3 * hotel is located on the 1st line, with a very big stretch. </p>

    <p>  As they say, do not wait for the weather by the sea.  And by the ocean, even more so.  Of course, there are times when the ocean is distinguished by an enviable calm and clear water.

Therefore, going to Sri Lanka, it is advisable to in advance take an interest in weather conditions at this time of year. </p><h2>  Hotel rooms and services </h2><p>  Hotel Paradise Holiday Village 3 * (Sri Lanka, Negombo) is a complex of several detached one- and two-story buildings. </p>

    <p>  Seafood is a familiar and traditional food on an island washed from all sides by the ocean.  However, given the fact that tourists from all over the world come to Sri Lanka, the restaurant's menu provides many dishes familiar to Europeans.  Lunches and dinners are held according to the <span>A la carte system,</span> which implies a menu choice and waiter service.  The first usually offers several types of mashed soup, the second - several meat and fish dishes with various side dishes, the dessert is presented with fruits and ice cream.  The dishes are prepared quite varied, and the menu may not be repeated for several days.  Some tables are located in the open air, which is especially pleasant for visitors in good calm weather. </p><p>  The bar traditionally offers refreshing drinks, cocktails, light snacks. </p><h2>  What entertainment does Paradise Holiday Village 3 * offer its guests? </h2><p>  The hotel is mainly focused on a quiet relaxing holiday, so there is no noisy entertainment animation.  Directly at the hotel, you can book excursions and rent a car. </p><p>  There are not many shops in the immediate vicinity of the hotel.  Most of them are located along the main streets of the tourist area and in the city center. </p><p>  As noted earlier, part of the coast, which is directly opposite the hotel, is covered with vegetation in some places and is not very attractive for tourists in terms of a classic beach holiday.  And then the hotel owners found for this place a slightly different, but no less popular application.  Recently, private parties, wedding ceremonies and other outdoor events have been held here. </p>

    <h2>  Shopping and Attractions </h2><p>  There are plenty of small shops with goods for tourists and souvenir shops in Negombo itself.  However, if you are interested in full-fledged shopping, then it is better to go to Colombo.  The city is located only 40 km from the resort and is considered the unofficial capital of the island nation. </p><p>  The spa town itself has long been influenced by Catholics, so many Catholic churches, churches and chapels were built here.  It is worth visiting the National Museum of Negombo to get a general idea of ​​the history and culture of the island.  Other attractions include the Hamilton Canal built by the Dutch, Negombo Fort, and a Buddhist temple. </p><p>  Sri Lanka is famous for its natural wealth.  Not far from the city is the unique Muturadzhavela Nature Reserve.  More than 200 species of animals and many exotic plants await lovers of wildlife. </p>

    <p>  The longest Hamilton canal passes just two hundred meters from Paradise Holiday Village 3 * (Sri Lanka). </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  The proximity of Negombo to the international airport has made this city a real tourist base.  Someone spends their entire vacation here, but for someone this city becomes just a transit point.  Therefore, hotels are trying to have in their arsenal various categories of rooms in order to attract as many tourists as possible.  This can be seen in the variety of rooms of Paradise Holiday Village 3 *.  Reviews about this hotel have improved significantly in recent years.  Tourists note good living conditions, clean and comfortable rooms, good service. </p><p>  As in many hotels, the checkout time is 12:00.  If you have arrived earlier, and there are places in the hotel, you can check in immediately, but at the same time requiring an additional fee. </p><p>  The hotel is in its category.  Of course, if you compare it with five-star hotels in Turkey or Egypt, you can find flaws.  But those whose expectations correspond to the chosen "stardom" remain satisfied with the rest. </p>
