Those professing any religion will find like-minded people in the heart of the Southern Urals.  The city has a Roman Catholic church, a synagogue, mosques, the Protestant Church "New Life". </p><p>  Chelyabinsk is a city whose holy cloisters are known to many Russian Orthodox.

    <h2>  Chelyabinsk diocese </h2><p>  She is part of the Russian Orthodox Church.  Chelyabinsk Vicariate was established in October 1908.  It functioned within the Orenburg diocese.  The location was determined for the Makaryevsky Assumption Monastery.  The first bishop was Archimandrite Dionysius.  As an independent, the Chelyabinsk diocese began to exist only ten years later. </p><h2>  White church </h2><p>  Chelyabinsk annually receives tens of thousands of tourists.  Many, among other attractions, must visit holy places.  In the city and in the region there are more than fifty holy places.  The main <span>church of Chelyabinsk (the Cathedral of St. Simeonovsky) is</span> known not only in the Urals.  Initially, the cathedral was built as a cemetery, but at the end of the last century it was completely reconstructed.  The beauty of this church in Chelyabinsk, its decor (tiled friezes and mosaic icons) made this temple one of the main attractions of the city.  The Holy Simeon Cathedral contains valuable shrines dating from the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries.  The White Church is the second name of this temple. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Churches of Chelyabinsk" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1679792.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Holy Simeonovsky Cathedral is the only one in Chelyabinsk, within the walls of which for more than one hundred thirty years, services have not stopped for a day.  Residents of all urban areas come to the White Church.  On holidays and weekends, the walls of this church in Chelyabinsk are especially crowded. </p><p>  Over the years of its existence, St. Simeon Cathedral has been enriched by a large number of unique shrines.  It is here that there is a piece of the Life-giving Cross of the Lord, which is embedded in the holy Crucifix.  Believers pray reverently before him. </p><p>  The icons of St. Sergius of Radonezh and Seraphim of Sarov, the elders of Optina, Job Pochaevsky and others also contain particles of holy relics.  In this temple there are a lot of ancient prayed images, from which, as the parishioners say, special grace emanates.  These icons are real rarities of Orthodoxy. </p><p>  One of the revered images of the Mother of God is considered to be the icon of the ‚ÄúQuick Beginner‚Äù.  It is to her that believers turn with requests for spiritual insight, for healing from various diseases. </p><h2>  Trinity Church </h2><p>  Chelyabinsk is proud of its temples.  Trinity Orthodox Church is located in the heart of the southern Urals.  Initially, the parish erected from wood was called Nikolsky.  Until 1768, it was at the intersection of Bolshaya and Sibirskaya Streets.  Then the temple found a new location, and from that moment the church got its current name.  By 1799, there were more than five and a half thousand parishioners in the flock. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Trinity Church Chelyabinsk" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1679796.jpg" width="533"></div>

    <h2>  Most Revered Churches </h2><p>  In 1907, the temple of Alexander Nevsky was built <span>in Chelyabinsk</span> in place of the old chapel.  This beautiful one-story church was made in neo-Russian style.  It was richly decorated with red brick decor.  The temple itself was thirteen-headed.  However, in the Soviet years, the church stopped working.  In its walls, various institutions were located one after another, until in the eighties the building was transferred to the Philharmonic.  An organ was installed in the temple, and the building began to function as a chamber music chamber.  This continued until 2013.  Today the temple is included in the list of cultural heritage of Chelyabinsk. </p>
