Reviews about this suburban property indicate that the developer was able to realize the goals and make housing in demand.  Potential buyers have already appreciated the convenient location of the residential complex.  Nearby are large shopping centers: Auchan, Ikea, OBI.  In addition, the proximity to the village of sports and entertainment venues: a tennis court, ski resort, equestrian club, really captivates. </p><p>  Customers also like the quality of the <span>residential complexes being</span> built <span>.</span>  They are satisfied that foreign specialists who are reputable experts in the field of engineering and design were invited to implement the project.  Today, Russians are increasingly refusing housing built by migrant workers from neighboring countries, trusting this business to true professionals. </p>

    <p>  However, some reviews of the above village are not without a negative connotation.  In particular, customers do not like the pace of housing construction.  In their opinion, it is not being built fast enough. </p><h2>  Problems </h2><p>  Yes, there are plenty of advantages that Blizkoe (St. Petersburg) cottage community has.  However, in a barrel of honey, unfortunately, there was a fly in the ointment.  Difficulties may arise when it comes to determining the organizational and legal status of a village.  In what form of management will it exist?  As a general rule, it is necessary to <span>create an HOA.</span>  However, the law did not regulate the solution of this issue when it comes to the cottage village. </p><p>  It is very difficult to form a partnership of real estate owners, since the procedure for creating this structure is regulated immediately in several legislative acts: LCD, Civil Code and Federal Law "On Garden and Country Non-Profit Partnerships". </p><p>  So, we will consider the situation when the cottage village "Close" is built and populated.  Problems will undoubtedly arise with the holding of a general meeting.  The thing is that it is difficult to achieve a quorum, since not all owners of houses and apartments live here permanently, so the resolution of important issues can be delayed over and over again. </p><p>  Difficulties will be with the definition of common property.  Here again we can talk about a legal gap, since this issue has not been resolved at the legislative level. </p>

    <p>  There are also many questions regarding the distribution of the burden of expenses between homeowners in the KP. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  But on the whole, of course, the prospects for the residents of the cottage village "Blizkoe" open up awful.  The city dweller will not have to change the usual rhythm of life, which will be complemented by a walk through the forest or pleasant gatherings around the evening fire. </p>
