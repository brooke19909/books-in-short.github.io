    <p>  (Hotels of this class recommended to city guests by tour operators located closer to the center of Prague show prices from 1620 to 3530 rubles per night.) Then, having tickets and hotel reservations (supporting documents) on hand, a person who wants to see Prague issues a visa to the Czech Republic through the embassy.  Upon arrival, the tourist will pay a Russian-speaking guide for a transfer to any metropolitan hotel 29 ‚Ç¨. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Modern European tourism, developing, uses new tools.  In particular, seeing more and spending less will help the tourist buy a four-day Prague guest card for 33 - 65 ‚Ç¨ (students get a discount).  At the same time, the city guest will receive a free introductory 2-hour tour, free access to 50 major historical sites, discounts in museums, tours and also receive a free guide.  The card will begin to operate from the day affixed by the hand of a tourist on the card itself.  Arriving can do this settling in the hotel, taking a break, having a snack and being ready for excursions. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel is located in the eighth district of Prague - Libushe and, accordingly, bears the same name with it.  There is a good traffic intersection.  300 meters from the hotel there are stops of trams No. 17 and 10, where you can get to the center in half an hour.  The path from the hotel to the nearest metro station Kobylisy (line C, on which the Central Railway Station is located) 400 m can be reached in minutes 3. Libuse Prague 3 * (Prague Czech Republic) is located in a relatively quiet and comfortable, but still close to the center of the City spiers quarter.  For a resident of Prague, the reference point for determining the location of the hotel in question is the Vlachovka mansion located nearby. </p>

    <p>  Excursion facilities are available directly from the hotel within walking distance.  From here, 3.5 km to the capital's zoo and 2.2 km to the botanical garden.  Near the hotel there is a shopping center "Albert";  cafe and pastry shop. If a tourist is fond of sports and is used to keeping fit, then 400 meters from the hotel he will find a well-maintained public swimming pool with exercise rooms.  A tourist who has come to Prague not alone can spend an evening at the bar or enjoy <span>Czech cuisine</span> at a restaurant located very close to the hotel (260 and 80 meters, respectively). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  In the old-fashioned way, with its entrance right into the sloping corner of the old city quarter, the small hotel Libuse 3 * considered by us seems to have materialized from the century of silver, considered by us (Prague).  The reviews of its guests indicate that it is wise to perceive this hotel complex as a hotel and as part of Prague in the 19th century.  After all, the walls of the building subjected to overhaul were built without a gram of cement, in the old way, using lime.  That is why it is cool here in the hottest summers and warmer here in winter than in modern concrete boxes. </p><p>  The two-story building of the hotel was later supplemented by an attic third floor.  It has a modern, flawless water supply, Wi-Fi and other communications. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The territory of the Libuse hotel (Prague 8; 3) is quite small.  It is typical for 19th century Prague in its layout.  The hotel on the front side is devoid of fences, flower beds, alleys.  It simply goes out onto the street with its facade.  Its rear side is decorated with a small garden and a terrace for fencing off from neighboring houses. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  A similar simplified and solid economy service to its guests is provided by many <span>hotels in Prague</span> (3 stars).  Libuse offers tourists car parking, a round-the-clock working Russian-language reception, daily cleaning and towel change, twice a week - bed linen, good paid Wi-Fi, paid parking for vehicles. </p>

    <p>  Its residents use the bathroom with a modern shower, telephone, TV with Russian channels.  This room has air conditioning. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Libuse 3 * (Prague) has a restaurant decorated in a hunting style, preparing dishes of national and European cuisine, serving simultaneously up to 70 people.  There is also a snack bar for up to 46 visitors. </p><p>  In the summer, guests can eat on the cozy terrace located on the back of the hotel, overlooking the garden.  The hotel, selling tours, offers within their framework the only food option - ‚Äúbreakfast only‚Äù.  This is quite consistent with the rhythm of tourists-excursionists living in it: after all, every day, having barely a bite to eat, they rush to the metro station or to the tram stop to see the beauty of Golden Prague. </p><p>  For breakfast, guests in the hotel restaurant are treated to a buffet of cheese, ham, sausage, omelet, sausages, coffee, tea, yogurt, several different rolls, and sweet buns. </p><h2>  About Prague Tours </h2><p>  As can be seen from the reviews of the guests of Libuse 3 *, their money and (most importantly!) Travel time in Prague were saved by buying a ticket that pays for all city transport services.  The price of one ticket is 670 kroons.  You can buy it at a store located on the road from the hotel to the nearest metro station. </p>

    <p>  Let's compare two options, involving paid and free tours.  To buy excursions, a tourist for each of them will have to pay from 260 to 5000 crowns (on average, 500 crowns for a tour).  For orientation in prices, we give the euro to the kroon rate: 1 EUR = 27.02 CZK. </p><p>  Thus, when focusing on free tours according to the guidebook, with access to sightseeing facilities already paid by the guest card, the tourist really saves money.  After breakfast, guests in the mornings with joyful impatience leave the Libuse 3 * hotel (Prague) to get an aesthetic pleasure from contemplating the beauties of the city - the pearl of Europe.  Tourists follow the metro to the desired excursion object, and in the afternoon, full of impressions, returning to the hotel again, dine tightly, relax and go on another excursion voyage. </p><h2>  TOP tours of Golden Prague </h2><p>  From ancient times Prague was considered not to be a craftsman and merchant city, favored by artists and scientists, a city of aristocrats and the poor.  Prague was the capital city of Czech kings. </p><p>  A tourist of the Prague Troika hotel, who is going to get acquainted with the sights of the City of a hundred spiers in 1 - 2 weeks, naturally prepares a plan for their visit in advance.  Let's try to compile it by analyzing the reviews of guests of Libuse 3 * (Prague). </p>

    <p>  It is logical to begin your acquaintance with Golden Prague with the objects of the road, called the Royal Way.  Its length is 3.8 km.  It starts from the Republic Square, continues along Tseletnaya Street, passes along Old Town Square, and then goes along Karlovaya Street to Crusader Square and ends at St. Vitus Cathedral - one of the main relics of the Czech Republic.  Imagine: 23 Czech kings and 27 queens have walked this path at different times! </p><p>  You should also see firsthand Vysehrad (coming out at the metro stop of the same name), the first-born center of the Czech state created in the 10th century.

There is also a monument to Jan Hus, the town hall, the Church of St. Nicholas, the Gothic Church of the Virgin Mary. </p><p>  Tourists (and guests of Libuse 3 * (Prague), among them) consider it obligatory for themselves to cross the 520-meter Charles Bridge, built by the ancient Romans and operated since 1380.  e.  Until now. </p><p>  In fact, Zlata Prague is extremely rich in attractions.  It is impossible to mention all of them in this article. </p><h2>  About Currency Exchange </h2><p>  Tourists leaving for Prague do not have to worry about purchasing crowns at home.

    <p>  In addition, the whole center of Prague is literally dotted with exchangers.  However, among them should be chosen.  Do not fall for the course that you see on the nameplate of the exchanger.  In fact, it is the most profitable among those offered to customers.  Czech bankers have learned to change different amounts of currency at different rates. Therefore, before a transaction, you should definitely ask the cashier, for example, what amount in kroons he will give out when exchanging 50 ‚Ç¨.  If the rate is underestimated by 15 - 20%, look for a more profitable exchanger. <br>  According to the guests of the hotel in question, the most profitable exchanger is located on the Arabian 2nd lane near the Powder Gate. </p><h2>  About shopping in Prague </h2><p>  Hotel Libuse 3 (Prague), thanks to its brilliant transport interchange, is an ideal launching pad for shopping.

At the same time, you should go around the store and carefully search for promotional products, because Czech sellers do not flaunt them. </p><h2>  Where to buy shoes and clothes </h2><p>  Guests of Libuse 3 * (Prague) in their reviews of the hotel also share information on promising shops for shopping.
