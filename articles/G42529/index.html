It is famous for its picturesque views, beautiful buildings and attracts tourists from all over the world.  Belgians offer tourists a lot of entertainment and thematic travels.  Someone can try the famous chocolate, someone can see diamonds, and someone can visit beaches and spa resorts.  However, this is not all that this country is famous for.  A separate tourist niche is occupied by old buildings erected long before the advent of modern resorts.  In this article you can admire the photo of castles in Belgium.  But if the opportunity presents itself, be sure to take a look at them live! </p><h2>  Miranda Castle, Sel, Belgium (main photo) </h2><p>  Unfortunately, this magnificent building to see with your own eyes will not work.  The castle was demolished in 2017.  But you can not help but look at this beauty at least in the photo. </p><p>  Miranda Castle was erected in the city of Sel, in 1866.  He was later nicknamed the "noisy castle" due to the fact that once there was an orphanage.  Originally, the building functioned as a luxury hotel for French aristocrats fleeing a revolution in their home country.  The founders of Miranda Castle in Belgium were the Lidekerke De Beaufort family, who occupied a magnificent palace until the Second World War.  After the building passed to the railway company, which turned the estate into an orphanage.  It was rumored that it was one of the worst homes for orphans. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pandareviewz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Abandoned castle" class="if uuid-3229272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131608/3229272.jpg"></div><p>  The orphanage ceased to exist in 1980, and after 1991 the castle began to be considered completely abandoned.  The luxury home fell into disrepair, floor tiles were removed or stolen, vandals made holes in the walls and set off several fires.  Every corner of the castle was overgrown with mold and decomposed day after day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="desertedplaces.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Miranda Castle Inside Broken" class="if uuid-3229275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131608/3229275.jpg"></div><p>  Now the ruins of the estate are visited mainly by scholars and ghostbusters who cannot resist the attraction of a former orphanage that once belonged to French amateurs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.urbanghostsmedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Abandoned Walls of Miranda Castle" class="if uuid-3229276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131608/3229276.jpg"></div><h2>  Belem Castle </h2><p>  Look at the photo, how do you like this building? </p><div class="photo" data-original="in.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Belem Castle" class="if uuid-3229283" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131608/3229283.jpg"></div><p>  This castle of incredible beauty was nicknamed the "Belgian Versailles" because of its beauty and sophistication.  It is located in the province of Erno, 80 km from Brussels.  Unfortunately, there is no exact information about the construction of the Bel√©m castle in Belgium.  It can only be argued that earlier, until the XVII-XVIII centuries, a medieval fortress was located on this site, later reconstructed into the residence of the Lin aristocracy.  Note that they possess it in our time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The historical value of Belem Castle </h2><p>  An artificial fish pond surrounds the building from the outside, and there is also a courtyard.  Two floors are reserved for the living room.  From the lobby of the castle, roads lead to the Marshal's Hall and the Hall of Ambassadors.  The first was famous for the fact that its walls are decorated with paintings dedicated to Russia.  The second contains three valuable canvases that preserve the life of Prince Lin. </p><p>  All rooms of this castle are lined with unusual furniture and antiques.  Also preserved a large number of gifts from such distinguished guests as Catherine the Great, Voltaire, Russo and Marie Antoinette.  There is a unique library in the castle of Belei, numbering more than twenty thousand ancient books.  The bindings of many are made by eminent masters. </p><p>  The main feature of the castle is in its reservoirs.  The large pond is decorated with sculptures, the main of which is Neptune.  Belei Castle is surrounded by a park of 25 hectares.  It includes a greenhouse built in 1830.  Previously, it served as a winter garden.  Nowadays it is a wonderful place for organizing weddings, banquets and other events. </p><p>  The castle is open for tourists on weekends and holidays, and in July and August - every day.  In the spring, Belei Castle hosts an ‚Äúextravaganza of the Amaryllis.‚Äù  This means that for 10 days the estate is decorated with magnificent flower arrangements of amaryllis. </p><h2>  Castle of the Counts of Flanders </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ilpozzo.xoom.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castle of the Counts of Flanders" class="if uuid-3230236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131608/3230236.jpg"></div><p>  It was built in 1180, in the city of Ghent.  Of all the remaining castles in Belgium, this one has almost its original appearance.  But it was not always used for its intended purpose.  There was a prison in the walls, it was used as a mint and even a textile factory was equipped in it.  Of course, not all at once.  Such coups brought the castle into decline, and it was only possible to complete the reconstruction by the end of the twentieth century. </p><p>  Now the castle is used for excursions, costumed chivalrous performances for children, events and important meetings.  On the Internet you can even find a comparison of the castle with the Winterfell fortress, which appears in the fantasy series "Game of Thrones." </p><h2>  Castle Wall </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Castle Wall." class="if uuid-3230239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131608/3230239.jpg"></div><p>  This building is the oldest in the city of Antwerp.  The first mention of it was found in the twelfth century.  It got its name due to the fact that it is the largest building made of stone.  After all, ‚ÄúWall‚Äù in translation from Dutch, this means ‚Äústone‚Äù. </p><p>  For many centuries, the castle was used as a prison.  It lasted until 1823.  Separate buildings were assigned to people of various classes.  In the left wing of the fortress there were ordinary cameras without amenities and heating - they were intended for poor peasants.  The rich estates were located in the right wing and lived in rooms overlooking the river. </p><h2>  The historical value of the castle of Walls </h2><p>  In 1864, at the initiative of Peter Genrad, historian and archivist of Antwerp, the castle was restored and the archaeological museum was opened there.  From 1952 until the end of 2008, the National Maritime Museum was located in the castle, for which a new wing was added to the castle.  In 2012, it was transformed into a cultural center, where all thinkers, dreamers and creative people are invited. </p><p>  It is worth noting that in 1880, Belgium‚Äôs castles of no value fell under demolition.  Only a part of this fortress was saved, its former area was several times larger, and on its territory was the chapel of St. Walpurga.  The entire complex was surrounded by a massive defensive wall, and in 1963 a monument to Dolgovyazy Wapper was erected in front of the castle.  This is the character of Antwerp folklore, which turned into a dwarf or a giant and frightened naughty children and drunkards who had gone astray. </p><p>  Of course, these are not all the castles of Belgium, famous for their beauty and having historical value.  However, the most magnificent buildings that struck with their grandeur were presented to your attention. </p>
