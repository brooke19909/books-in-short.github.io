He hospitably opened his doors almost 40 years ago, in the already distant 1989.  During this time, reconstruction was carried out here many times.  The latter ended just recently, in 2014, so everything shines like new in the hotel.  We invite you to take a short virtual walk through it to get acquainted with the conditions of living and recreation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holiday club kemer" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1987038.jpg" width="516"></div>

    <h2>  Location, how to get there </h2><p>  Ulusoy Kemer Holiday Club 5 * HV is located in the relatively quiet resort village of Goynuk, we can say on its outskirts, from the city of Kemer.  It is a little over 7 km along an excellent asphalt highway, and 45 km to the airport in Antalya.  The place where the hotel was built was chosen to be unusually beautiful - among the tall pines that fill the air with miraculous phytoncides, and at the same time on the coast itself.  Just a few steps to the guests of the sea.  A mixture of aromas of pine needles and the sea provides passive therapeutic treatment and prevention of pulmonary diseases for each guest.  And if you add to this mixture of odors the aromas of flowers, which are unusually plentiful here, you get a unique aromatherapy.  It is able to relieve fatigue in just a few days, stabilize the nervous system, remove all anxieties, establish harmony in the soul and raise the mood. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Getting to the Ulusoy Kemer Holiday Club is easy.  It will take an air flight to Antalya.  Unexpected delays can happen only at the Turkish airport due to the long wait for the suitcases.  Then everything goes smoothly.  The transfer of the travel agency, in which the tickets were purchased, takes their passengers to the hotel in about 1 hour, and there they are met by the reception staff. </p><p>  Tourists traveling here on their own from the airport can get to Goynuk by bus (a stop literally opposite the hotel) or by taxi. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Ulusoy Kemer Holiday Club spreads over an area of ‚Äã‚Äã43 thousand square meters.  Tourists in their reviews note that this is not much, the territory of the hotel seemed rather compact to them.  However, the modest size does not in any way affect its beauty.  Century-old pines grow everywhere here, in whose branches lively pichugs chirp in every way.  There are no multi-story buildings in the hotel, only cozy cottages, which are cute two-story houses with multi-colored walls, generously twined with ivy garlands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ulusoy Kemer Holiday Club" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1987029.jpg" width="522"></div>

    <p>  The hotel‚Äôs landscape design is made in the form of a Turkish village - houses are located on the streets laid along the territory, each with its own color.  They are called so: Blue Street, Pink, Purple.  Everyone in the reviews admire how many flowers and beautiful shrubs are on these streets.  It seems as if I‚Äôm in a fairyland, and that now you will meet an elf or a gnome. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to aesthetic grace, the territory of Ulusoy Kemer Holiday Club HV has sufficient functionality.  There is a large swimming pool, many sports fields, an amphitheater, several bars, restaurants and cafes, a shop, a free parking lot and even your own tiny zoo, which is an aviary with parrots and other birds.  All objects are located close to each other, it takes tourists minutes to get to any of them from their cottage.  At the same time, infrastructure facilities are located so as not to interfere with guests enjoying their vacation. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Arriving at Ulusoy Kemer Holiday Club 5 *, all tourists first get to the reception.  Employees who know the Russian language work here.  Therefore, communication with them is not difficult.  However, according to tourists, restaurant workers (waiters and bartenders) and maids do not speak Russian well, which can cause some misunderstandings in the process of business communication.  The reception is located in the central building, in a stylishly decorated lobby, where for the convenience of guests there are soft sofas, tables, a bar nearby.  Wi-Fi is great in this lobby, and you can get the access key for free from the administrator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer Holiday Club 5" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1987030.jpg" width="517"></div>

Reviews about them are mixed.  Tourists write that on different streets the living conditions are somewhat different.  So, on Lilovaya there is a small courtyard, and cottages are not so close to each other, as, for example, on Blue Street.  In addition, there are cottages that are closer to the sea, and there are overlooking the roadway.  In order to avoid misunderstandings, all these nuances should be clarified when issuing a voucher. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ulusoy Kemer Holiday Club Turkey" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1987033.jpg" width="517"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Only with the Ultra All Inclusive type of food can you buy a tour at the Kemer Holiday Club.  Reviews about the organization of this very "ultra", which implies the free distribution of any food and any drinks, as well as plentiful feeding throughout the day, unfortunately, are not the most enthusiastic.  Especially there are many complaints from tourists who visited the hotel at the very beginning or at the end of the season, because many cafes and bars did not work during this period, there was no expected variety of dishes and drinks. </p><p>  According to the UAl food system, tourists are fed and watered for free from 10 a.m. to 12 a.m.  The menu of breakfasts, lunches and dinners is full of various dishes - dairy, vegetable, meat, fish.  There are also fresh sliced ‚Äã‚Äãvegetables, sausages, cheeses, pancakes, tortillas with and without filling, eggs, casseroles, yogurts, cereals, delicious Turkish desserts, fruits.  From drinks juices, water, coffee (instant from vending machines), teas, Turkish and imported alcohol, cocktails are offered.  Tourists are grateful to note that the hotel has refrigerators with water, which can be taken without restrictions. </p><p>  The Kemer Holiday Club infrastructure has an indoor restaurant with an outdoor terrace, the roof of which is the crown of pine trees.  The second a la carte restaurant is located right on the beach.  In addition, the hotel has two cafes and three bars - by the pool, on the beach and on site.  There is no bar in the lobby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer Holiday Club reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1987034.jpg" width="517"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure outside the hotel </h2><p>  The village of Goynuk is focused mainly on couples.  There are very few special entertainments, but not far from the village is Kemer, where many nightclubs, youth discos, and bars are concentrated.  Thirsting for noisy parties until the morning and adventures, guests of the Ulusoy Kemer Holiday Club in Kemer can find dozens of places for such a pastime.  Drive to the city in just a couple of minutes, which is quite convenient. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel offers guests dozens of excursions.  Among them: </p><p>  - hiking to waterfalls near Goynuk and its canyons; </p><p>  - climb to the famous <span>Tahtalƒ± mountain</span> with breathtaking views; </p><p>  - trips to the colorful beach of Cirali, to the ruins of ancient Phaselis, to Antalya, where the best shopping in Turkey is. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The Kemer Holiday Club has its own beach.  We can say that it is a continuation of the hotel, so some cottages are located so close to it.  The beach is sandy, with small pebbles.  There are always enough sun loungers here to be enough for everyone.  The sea on this piece of the sea coast is clean, the entrance to it is smooth, but at the bottom there are slippery stones, painfully injuring his legs.  Therefore, special shoes are needed here.  The beach is noteworthy in that a pier is built on it and chalets are installed, adding romance to the rest.  Chalets are paid, the price depends on the season. </p><p>  On the beach, you can safely lie and sunbathe, and you can actively have fun.  To do this, there are plenty of attractions - banana, jet skis, catamarans, canoes.  If you wish, you can even parachute, water ski, and if you are lucky with the weather, windsurf under the guidance of experienced trainers. </p><p>  The climatic conditions in the Goynuk area are excellent.  Since April, warm similar days have been set here, the sun shines generously, gradually warming the land and sea.  At this time, the whole village is immersed in the aromas of flowering orange gardens.  These gentle exciting smells give rest a special romantic color.  However, in the evenings at the beginning of the tourist season it is still cool, so a warm blouse or sweater will not hurt.  Hotel guests can swim in the sea only in June, when the water warms up to acceptable temperatures of + 20-22 degrees.  By August, it becomes even warmer, approximately + 24-25 degrees, and remains at these levels until mid-September, and then the sea gradually cools.  The beach season ends here in October. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Kemer Holiday Club is a pleasant experience.  The rating of this hotel among various tour operators varies from 4.2 to 4.5 points out of 5, which is an excellent result. </p><p>  It is comfortable to rest here for young people, and for older people, and couples with children. </p><p>  The hotel operates from the beginning of May to the end of September.  Its main contingent is Turks, Germans, Ukrainians and Russians. </p><p>  The advantages of the hotel, most tourists call: </p><p>  - convenient location (close to minibus stops, beach, short drive to Kemer); </p><p>  - gorgeous territory (everything is surrounded by greenery and flowers, each design element is well thought out); </p><p>  - hotel design in the form of a Turkish town (all tourists like it); </p><p>  - high-quality cleaning in the rooms; </p><p>  - varied and tasty food; </p><p>  - excellent animation; </p><p>  - refrigerators with free water at the hotel; </p><p>  - hospitable staff. </p><p>  There are also flaws in the Kemer Holiday Club.  Mostly negative reviews are caused by the individual preferences of vacationers.  Among the comments most often found in reviews, the following can be distinguished: </p><p>  - individual rooms are too small, there is no way to comfortably place their things, install a crib; </p><p>  - not all rooms were renovated with new furniture; </p><p>  - food at the beginning and at the end of the season does not correspond to the UAl concept (there is no variety of dishes, cafes are closed, and only one of the bars works); </p><p>  - uncomfortable entry into the water on the beach; </p><p>  - Hotel workers do not clean the beach well enough (debris, plastic cups, butts can get caught underfoot); </p><p>  - central air conditioning at the beginning of the season, when the weather is not stable, turn on for heating only for a limited time, which is why the rooms are damp (especially for cottages located in the thick shade of trees). </p>
