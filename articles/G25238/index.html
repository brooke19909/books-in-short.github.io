  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to sew a pillow with your own hands.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To create coziness and comfort in the house will help not only the interior design of your apartment, but also a variety of hand-made things, pleasant for looking and useful in everyday life, cute to the heart things.  Personally, I refer to them a variety of shapes and appearance, made pillows with their own hands.  They are not large in size, but very necessary for everyone, without exception, during the holidays.  In my family, everyone loves their pillow, which you can lean on, sitting in an armchair, put under your back or head, at the moment when you watch TV sitting on the couch.  Without it, it is impossible to relax after a hard day's work, because when you come home, you want to give rest to tired legs for a short while.  Nothing relaxes and helps legs recover like a rest lying on the couch with raised legs.  In this situation, underfoot, pillows are simply irreplaceable.  Moreover, each of them is individual in design.  Square, round, rectangular, in the shape of a heart and these are not all acceptable options.  On standard thoughts, I, as a rule, put on standard pillowcases, but supplement them with embroidery, and round or heart-shaped, I crocheted.  Stitched or knitted pillows with their own hands can bring a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpleasant sensations, embellish your apartment and create comfort. <br>  Pillows on a bed, sofa or chair. </p><p>  Before you sew a pillow, you need to decide on its shape, design, filling and possible design.  In this case, before you sew the pillow with your own hands, decide what function it will perform, or to whom it belongs specifically.  It is important for the pillow, first of all, what we will fill it with.  I always use a synthetic winterizer, because it has excellent properties: softness and bulkiness, and also does not settle and does not go astray when washing.  Fabric for pillows should be purchased in advance, i.e.  before stitching the pillow.  There are many options: silk, chintz, <span>cotton, cotton.</span>  If you know how to knit, then such a pillow can become a very stylish and original decoration of the interior.  For children, you can make a pillow in the form of muzzles of animals: pussy, dog, cow, etc., you just have to dream a little when designing it.  If you have a question about how to sew a pillow with your own hands for your daughter, then the heart shape will be the ideal solution.  At the same time, if you don‚Äôt fit it with fabric, but tie it with ‚ÄúGrass‚Äù threads, then, undoubtedly, it will become her favorite.  Remember that in this creative process, the question of how to sew a pillow is not the most important.  Much more important is how to arrange it. <br>  Pillows for the kitchen. </p><p>  If you are considering options for how to sew a pillow for the kitchen to put it on a stool or chair, then for a pillowcase you should stock up with a denser fabric, for example, jeans, and old rag patches are ideal for internal stuffing.  Thus, the resulting pillow will become more dense and comfortable to sit on.  The procedure for its manufacture is simple.  I acted as follows: I measured the size of the stool and cut two circles by these sizes, letting 1.5 centimeters into the seams.  I started them along the contour, but not completely, since it needs to be turned out and stuffed.  I cut a long rectangle and bent one edge per centimeter along the entire length of the strip and sewed it, getting a place for the gum insert.  The second end of the tape around the edge, round, sewn to a round seat cover.  I put a piece of foam in the cover and closed the remaining seams.  Thus, I received a pillow for a stool.  We put it on a stool: a stuffed cover will interfere with the seat, and the sewn ribbon goes down under it, being pulled from below with an elastic band.  On such a stool not only sit softly, but you can also avoid injuring others, in particular, children, in the event of an awkward fall. <br>  A beautiful and comfortable pillow will fit perfectly into your interior due to its eccentricity and beauty.  Sewing or knitting a pillow for yourself, your children or loved ones is not at all difficult, you just need to. </p>
