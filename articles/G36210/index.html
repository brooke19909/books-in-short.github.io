Dzhankoy is quite remote from the sea and has a peculiar climate and significance.  Different priorities are concentrated here - the northern gates of Crimea are open to all directions from the north, south, west and east.  It leads to railways and roads, it is a transfer city, while possessing <strong> </strong>  picturesque places. </p>

    <h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  Dzhankoy - a small town, he appeared in the days of the <span>Crimean Khanate.</span>  The T√ºrks were attracted by the climate and the countryside, surrounded by greenery, calm and measured tempo of time.  Its name has not changed in history.  Translated from the Turkic name of the city means "hospitable and nice village."  Of course, then the city was not large, but in the eighteenth century Dzhankoy was already mentioned in the annals.  By the time the city became part of the Russian Empire along with the entire peninsula, it had received the status that was assigned to it today - ‚Äúthe city of republican subordination‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The first street in the city was named Crimean, and today it is preserved under the same name.  The construction of buildings and the railway became fundamental events for the village, which was Dzhankoy, however, the trends of the culture of the peoples living here reflected on the architectural features of the city.  The gates of Crimea are opened both to industrial areas and to visitors who want to get acquainted with local attractions.  Dzhankoy is a very cozy city.  In many ways, the special climate favors this: neither sultry days, nor cold nights. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Piling open the northern gates of <span>Crimea, Dzhankoy</span> demonstrates how much the historical past is preserved within it.  The architecture of the city is preserved in the style of Khan's palace buildings, they include a Muslim mosque. </p><p>  Some of the attractions are built in the Gothic style.  For example, this is the Czech Church of the Heart of Jesus Christ.  It attracts visitors to the city with its charm, the style and beauty of the outside and inside are complemented by a legend about the fulfillment of desires.  At the beginning of the 20th century, this church was one of the most beautiful in the Crimea, it was built by Czechs and Germans who moved to the Crimea.  The organ, bells brought from the Czech Republic, crystal chandeliers, benches for parishioners from oak species, <span>Persian carpets,</span> silk, velvet, white marble - this is what it looked like in those days.  After the war, the church was only partially restored, the decision that it was unprofitable to reconstruct it was made by the European side, and today the fading luxury and beauty of the man-made attraction are still pleasing to the eye. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  No less interesting is the estate of Shatilov, reconstructed in our time.  Being a kind of historical monument, the estate is divided into several buildings, people still live in one of them. </p><p>  Religious values ‚Äã‚Äãof the city include the Orthodox Holy Intercession Cathedral, and cultural life is reflected in the museum of local lore of the city.  A rather unusual small zoo has more than a hundred strange birds; this landscape reserve is located near Dzhankoy. </p>

Places, lovingly referred to as the "Golden Gate", Crimea has several.  So what is Janka so called? </p><p>  For openness, friendliness and hospitality - the Dzhankoy cheburechnaya is still famous throughout the peninsula.
