What is it interesting about?  What is attractive about him?  What are the attractions in Fiumicino (Italy)? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelrivierafiumicino.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="italy fiumicino" class="if uuid-2641455" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2641455.jpg"></div><h2>  Italy Air Gate </h2><p>  This city has gained popularity due to the airport, which is located in it.  Like many other cities in the country, Fiumicino in Italy is rich in attractions and unique places that are worth a visit. </p><p>  One of the most important is the international airport of Leonardo Da Vinci.  From here you can go straight to the capital - they are only 30 kilometers away!  The terminal building was built in 1960 and since then has been confidently holding the title of one of the best in the whole country. </p><p>  But it all started with two runways.  But even in those years it was a great achievement and a significant advantage over other Italian airports.  Currently, Fiumicino Airport (Italy) is represented by five landing terminals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.glutenfreetravelandliving.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="italy fiumicino" class="if uuid-2641778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2641778.jpg"></div><h2>  In the airport building ... </h2><p>  ... always noisy and lively.  Tourists who come to the Italian capital arrive here.  Here you can meet travelers who are waiting for their flight to get to the Italian coast as quickly as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A special bus delivers passengers to the ladder.  You can also use the sleeve.  An electronic baggage check system operates at the airport - the introduction of this technology allows you to quickly sort your bags, as well as make the flight of tourists safe. </p><p>  One of the terminals serves local flights - flights between Schengen countries.  The second specializes in international flights and partly in Italian.  The third terminal serves flights from the CIS countries, international and some local.  Another one works exclusively with flights from the United States and Israel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobilita.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fiumicino city in italy" class="if uuid-2641773" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2641773.jpg"></div><h2>  From Fiumicino Airport (Italy) to Rome </h2><p>  To get to the capital from the main airport can even a student who is completely unfamiliar with Italy.  Due to the fact that there is such a short distance between cities, there are several ways to overcome it: </p><ol><li>  By bus.  The easiest and cheapest way.  Buses to the popular cities of Italy leave regularly from the airport building.  Fiumicino is no exception.  The cost of a ticket to Rome will be approximately 4 euros (about 300 rubles). </li><li>  Railway connection.  Another simple, reliable and cheap way.  So, for example, from the airport to Termini can be reached by train.  The train with the romantic name "Leonardo Express" will deliver its passengers to their destination in just half an hour. </li><li>  There is another train - "Orte Fara Sabina-Fiumicino" (Italy) - he makes several stops along the way.  It also provides access to the Italian capital. </li><li>  Taxi.  This option is perhaps the most comfortable, but because of this, and the most expensive.  The cost of a trip to Rome will cost about 40 euros (about 3,000 rubles).  You can find travel companions and break down this amount by the number of passengers. </li></ol><p>  The terminal building houses the largest car rental center.  Car rental is a convenient and practical way to travel in Italy with comfort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fiumicino Italy Attractions" class="if uuid-2641471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2641471.jpg"></div><h2>  Fiumicino (Italy) Attractions </h2><p>  What is worthy of the attention of tourists and those who are forced to linger a bit in this city? </p><p>  While waiting for your flight, you can stroll through the streets of the town and note that the satellite city of Rome is also attractive, like other cities in the most beautiful country in Europe.  In addition to Leonardo Da Vinci Airport, there is the largest fishing center in the entire Tyrrhenian Sea.  The main attractions of the city of Fiumicino in Italy are the ports of Claudius and Trajan, located on the Holy Island. </p><p>  It is from here that the most beautiful mosaic of ancient times opens, which in the modern world preserves that beauty, grace and splendor.  You can use the services of a guide to tell him in detail about this place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.europcar.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãfiumicino italy attractions" class="if uuid-2641477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2641477.jpg"></div><h2>  What to look at? </h2><p>  In addition to the ports, in the satellite city of Rome there is also a unique <span>museum of Roman</span> navigation and a necropolis.  He attracts tourists not only with historical exhibits.  Museum architecture is what really impresses! </p><p>  He opens his doors to sightseers at 09:30, and closes only at 18:30.  From 13:00 to 15:00 - Siesta (the museum is closed for a break).  It should be noted - it does not work every day.  So, in the summer, the museum is open from Tuesday to Sunday, in the cold season - from Friday to Sunday. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  You can‚Äôt visit Italy and not soak up one of its most beautiful beaches!  Fiumicino, contrary to popular belief, also has the facilities for the blissfully doing nothing of tourists.  If time permits, head to MOAI Beach - a great free beach.  The sea is shallow, the water is clean, the entrance to the water is shallow, so the beaches of Fiumicino are a great place to relax with children. </p><p>  There are also small restaurants where you can quench your thirst with cool lemonade, as well as taste delicious snacks and seafood dishes. </p><h2>  Neri Beach </h2><p>  This place is not suitable for families with children.  But for adults - that‚Äôs it.  It's as clean here as it is on MOAI Beach.  You can rent a sunbed for only 5 euros (about 350 rubles).  Volleyball and a night disco are popular entertainments that will make the rest a little more diverse. </p><p>  The water is crystal clear, golden sand and a gentle slope into the water - perhaps young tourists will like it here, so you can relax on this coast. </p><h2>  City Hotels </h2><p>  Fiumicino is a small town, but there are plenty of funds for accommodation here.  Among all their diversity there are hotels for undemanding tourists and options for those who are looking for comfort, convenience and coziness. </p><p>  Wealthy travelers can stay at the Del Mare Hotel.  The average price for one night is about 60 euros (about 4200 rubles).  This includes comfortable living conditions, first-class service.  The hotel is located near the airport building, right on the coast. </p><p>  Another hotel is the QC Termeroma Spa and Resort.  They do not speak of a high class service.  This is eloquently evidenced by the cost of living - some 160 euros per night (about 11,500 rubles). </p><p>  Fiumicino is an unusual city.  It is not as big as Verona or Rome.  There are not as many attractions as in Milan or Naples.  But here has its own special atmosphere, which is largely due to the ever-moving stream of tourists from different parts of the globe. </p>
