    <p>  To defeat the enemy using various <span>types of weapons.</span>  Their action is not the same.  One of the most dangerous types is biological weapons.  It represents viruses, fungi and microbes, as well as animals infected with these viruses.  The purpose of the use of this weapon is to defeat people, flora and fauna.  Biological weapons also include a means of delivering it to its destination. </p><p>  <span>This type of</span> weapon does not harm buildings, objects and materials of value.  It infects and infects animals, people, water, vegetation, etc. </p><p>  Biological weapons are divided into several types depending on the materials used. </p><p>  The first type is the use of bacteria.  These include <span>causative agents of anthrax,</span> plague, cholera and other infectious diseases. </p><p>  The next type is viruses.  Pathogens of smallpox, encephalitis, various types of fever and some other diseases are distinguished here. </p><p>  The third kind is rickettsia.  This includes the causative agents of <span>typhus, rash,</span> some types of fever, etc. </p><p>  And the last one is fungi.  They cause diseases of histoplasmosis, blastomycosis and some other diseases. </p><p>  It is the presence of a certain type of pathogen that determines the type to which biological weapons belong. </p><p>  Unlike other types of <span>weapons (nuclear</span> or chemical), this type is a source of infection, entering the body even in minimal doses.  Another feature of this weapon is its ability to spread.  That is, there is the possibility of transmission of the disease from person to person and from animal to person. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also very resistant to destruction.  Once in the soil or in another external environment, it persists for a long time.  Its action can occur after a certain period of time and cause an outbreak of infection. </p><p>  The next feature that a biological weapon of mass destruction has is its stealth.  The period from infection to the first signs of the disease can be asymptomatic, which leads to its spread.  It is only possible to detect diseases and infections at the initial stage by laboratory means.  This is a very laborious and lengthy process.  And if we talk about countering biological weapons, then measures must be taken immediately. </p><p>  To identify the use of this type of weapon, some features of its structure should be taken into account.  Typically, round fragments are found at the application sites.  At the time of the break, a dull sound is heard.  A clear sign is the formation of vapors and clouds, which disappear very quickly.  Drops of liquid on the surface in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãincidence or substances in the form of a powder may also be observed.  A sign of the use of biological weapons is also a trace from a flying airplane, the appearance of a large number of rodents or insects, which is atypical for a given time or area.  Also, a consequence of its use is the massive death of animals and a large number of simultaneously ill people. </p><p>  The usual method of spreading viruses and bacteria is the respiratory system.  In this case, aerosol products are used.  They settle on the surface of the skin, clothing, soil, plants and penetrate the human body through <span>the respiratory system</span> or cuts.  Also, carriers can be animals and livestock products.  Biological weapons are the most dangerous type of weapon of mass destruction. </p><p>  In this regard, humanity is developing means against its effects.  Protection against biological weapons must be immediate so that their proliferation does not happen.  These include vaccine and serum.  Infected animals, objects and food are also subject to immediate destruction. </p>
