    <h2>  The early history of Vasilyevsky </h2><p>  The lands belonging to the modern <span>Odintsovo district</span> belonged to the Zvenigorod principality in the XIV-XV centuries.  The village of Vasilyevskoye, near which the estate stands, was first mentioned in the annals of 1498.  Initially, it belonged to the Moscow Simon Monastery, in the XV century it is already referred to as a palace.  In 1619, the first mention of the Resurrection Church, built in this village.  The village itself becomes patrimonial possession and is divided between five Cossack chieftains.  But very soon the lands were again transferred to the disposal of the monastery, this time of Novo-Spassky.  Further, the Russian estate repeats the fate of many other estates.  For various achievements of the land, they are awarded to one of the close associates of the ruling king, but then, after a change of power, the new king takes possession and transfers it to someone from his favorites.  Thus, the village and manor lands have changed many owners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The new estate of Count Shcherbatov </h2><p>  Since 1764, the estate belongs to the <span>Yakovlevs.</span>  <span>Ivan</span> Alekseevich, the father of A.I. Herzen, is engaged in the reconstruction of the manor house and transfers it to the other side of the river, where there was a small village of Maryino.  After the death of the owner, the estate was inherited by his nephew, who quickly sold it.  In 1845, the land became the property of Nikolai Grigorievich Shcherbatov, who was a major general of the cavalry and personally participated in the battle of Borodino.  After his death, the standard Russian estate goes to his son - Alexander Grigorievich.  The new owner marries Princess Olga Alexandrovna Stroganova, and two years after the wedding begins to rebuild a new house.  The style is neo-Gothic, the main architect is Pyotr Samoilovich Boytsov, who by that time had already become famous for creating magnificent castles.  It is believed that Count Shcherbatov ordered several objects at once.  The estate, the dungeon under it, outbuildings and a landscaped park with fountains and flower beds - all this was erected. </p><h2>  Prince Shcherbatov and his family </h2><p>  After graduating from St. Petersburg University, Alexander Grigoryevich worked as an authorized representative of the Red Cross during the Russo-Turkish War, and was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir of the 4th degree for military exploits.  During the First World War, Shcherbatov joined the founders of the Russian Union of Trade and Industry.  At the same time, Alexander Grigoryevich, with the support of his wife, will organize the transportation of the wounded by launching a special ‚Äúambulance train‚Äù using exclusively personal means.  The Shcherbatovs also open a hospital and organize a shelter for children whose parents died in the name of their homeland.  The eldest son of the princely couple also participated in the hostilities (in the Russian-Japanese war) with the rank of midshipman.  In 1915, terrible news came from Petersburg: Alexander Alexandrovich Shcherbatov, the firstborn of Alexander Grigorievich, died in St. Petersburg.  Not much survived him and his father.  Olga Alexandrovna buried her relatives near the village of Maryino and rebuilt the church at the burial site, which she wanted to consecrate in honor of Alexander Nevsky, the patron saint of the deceased.  However, this plan could not be implemented due to the events of 1917.  Olga Alexandrovna managed to leave Russia forever, taking with her some of the valuable things. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The estate of Count Shcherbatov: photo and description </h2><p>  During its dawn, the manor house with turrets was richly decorated inside and surrounded around an exotic garden.  There were plants brought from India and other countries, roe deer and tame chamois freely walked through the territory.  Olga Alexandrovna Shcherbatova, before her immigration, managed to take out all the truly valuable things from the estate.  However, furniture and art were stolen during the 1917 revolution.  But at the same time, the house itself was not too badly damaged.  Many historians attribute this fact to the respectful attitude of the peasants to the princely family, which has been involved in charity all their lives.  Later in the <span>Gothic castle</span> was a rest house and a sanatorium for patients with diseases of the cardiovascular system.  Even V.I. Lenin visited him, in memory of which a memorial tablet appeared.  After the collapse of the USSR, the health care institution was abandoned and stood for several decades without major repairs and security.  But, despite this, the facade and load-bearing walls were preserved quite well. </p>

    <h2>  Gothic castle today </h2><p>  The estate of Count Shcherbatov could well add to the list of attractions that disappeared from the face of the earth and collapsed naturally.  However, the object has gained sufficient popularity among fans of non-standard tourism and visits to abandoned palaces.  And recently, tourists who decided to explore this place were amazed - the building is being restored.  New windows and frames are installed in empty window openings, the facade is painted, the roof is being repaired.  It is possible that very soon the estate of Count Shcherbatov will appear before us in his updated form and will survive the second period of prosperity.  However, there is no official information on what the restoration is for and what will be inside the renovated building. </p>
