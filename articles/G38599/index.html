The best model for babies (until the figure began to form) is an option with a high waist and a detachable fluffy skirt.  And taking into account the fact that all girls dream of being princesses, such an outfit will definitely be appreciated and will become one of the favorites in the wardrobe.  Also interesting on the girl will be a dress with a bell skirt and the sun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of elegant dresses for girls" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1204020.jpg" width="249"></div>

    <h2>  Fabric selection </h2><p>  The material is selected depending on the desired type of product.  The same pattern of an elegant dress for a girl can be used for sewing from different paintings and each time the result will be different from the previous one if you use different materials. </p><p>  For example, a skirt can be made of tulle, organza, brocade, velvet, or from simpler paintings, such as cotton, chintz, staple, silk and cambric.  Due to the different density and ability of the canvas to keep its shape, the appearance of the product will also change.  Undoubtedly, each option is good in its own way, but before you begin to work, you need to determine what result is needed. </p><p>  The pattern of an elegant dress for a girl of 10 years old can be made with the calculation of imitation of a corset, and then you need to use a sufficiently dense fabric for the top of the product or to stabilize the details with glue non-woven. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Style Options </h2><p>  A beautiful outfit must fit the child's figure.  If the child is overweight, then it is better to abandon the lush detachable skirt in favor of a dress with vertical embossed seams and a bell-shaped skirt.  Also, a model with a detachable bottom sun-flared and a wide belt tied with a bow just above the waistline will look beautiful on a large girl.  Such dresses will hide the fullness and make the silhouette more slim.  The pattern of an elegant dress for a girl with a bell skirt differs in construction from a model with a cutting bottom, and therefore the tailoring of each outfit needs to be considered in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern elegant dresses for girls 5 years" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1204022.jpg" width="339"></div>

    <h2>  Building a model template with a detachable full skirt </h2><p>  In order to make a blank, you need to take measurements from a small model.  The pattern of an elegant dress for a girl of 5 years is based on the following measurements: </p><ul><li>  volume of the neck, chest and waist; </li><li>  height of back and front; </li><li>  shoulder width; </li><li>  armhole height; </li><li>  back width and front width; </li><li>  length from waist to desired skirt level. </li></ul><p>  The construction is as follows. </p><p>  On a sheet of paper draw a horizontal equal to ¬Ω of the volume of the chest and two adjacent vertically adjacent to the edges in accordance with the height of the back to the waist.  ¬º The neck circumference is laid in the upper left corner and the shoulder width is marked from the received point at an angle of 10 degrees.  Similar actions are performed in the right corner.  Vertically descend in accordance with the height of the armhole and draw a second horizontal.  On it should be laid off ¬Ω the width of the back from the left vertical and ¬Ω the width of the front from the right.  The gap between them is the armhole zone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The pattern of an elegant dress for a baby of 5 years and older does not require the construction of tucks for the chest and waist, since the figure does not yet have pronounced bends.  So, by building an armhole through the extreme points of the shoulder seams and the auxiliary horizontal, they complete the work on the workpiece.  The only thing that will need to be tweaked is the neckline and overstatement of the part by 7 cm from the waist level. </p><p>  The skirt sheet in this model is a simple rectangular piece of fabric, which is folded along the bottom of the top. </p><h2>  Dress model dresses with a skirt sun </h2><p>  This model also consists of a top and a detachable skirt.  The top is built similarly to the first model.  The skirt is cut without first creating blanks.  The canvas should be at least 10 cm wide and at least two skirts +15 cm long. The construction is carried out so that two panels of the bottom of the product are obtained.  The length of the skirt is marked along the edge of the fabric, after which a sixth of the waist circumference recedes and another length of the skirt is postponed.  After, in the middle segment, a semicircle is drawn so that this section is its base.  Such a pattern of an elegant dress for a girl is perfect for both summer and winter models.  When using a dense canvas, the skirt will keep its shape well and make the image harmonious. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of elegant dresses for girls 10 years old" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1204008.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <p>  To design such a dress, a contrast belt at the place of accession of the bottom is perfect. </p><p>  It is best to make a zipper in this model.  To do this, you need to divide the back panel of the skirt and the back part into elements.  Moreover, the lightning can be either imperceptible (secret), or, conversely, become a decorative element (a brilliant wide tractor). </p><h2>  Create a blank with a bell skirt </h2><p>  This dress model is with a one-piece hem.  Such a pattern of an elegant dress for a girl will require an additional measurement of the circumference of the child‚Äôs hips and height from the waist to the hip line.  The construction of the top is similar to the first model.  Next, extend the vertical to the hip line and define the hem line.  On the second auxiliary horizontal, they retreat to a width equal to ¬Ω girth of the hips from each vertical.  After that, from the middle of the zone of the armhole lower the border of the side seam to these marks.  Then, directly according to the template, the location of the vertical seams is determined.  The pattern of an elegant dress for a girl of 7 years old will look beautiful with six wedges. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of elegant dress for a girl of 7 years" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1204016.jpg" width="375"></div>  This means that in the drawing you need to draw one strip on the half back and shelves.  After these wedges flare at the same level and under one degree to the bottom, depending on the desired splendor of the skirt.
