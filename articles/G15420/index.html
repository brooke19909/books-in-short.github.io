Its presence is just as important as the steering wheel, pedals or seats.  Why there is such a need for such products, we will understand in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="root-nation.com" data-author=": Vladislav Surkov, "><img itemprop="image" alt="qs3 video recorder" class="if uuid-2745795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2745795.jpg"></div><h2>  What are they needed for? </h2><p>  The number of motorists is growing every year.  But the number of parking spaces, freeways and road junctions does not increase at the same rate. </p><p>  This leads to frequent traffic jams, hours of traffic congestion and accidents.  The need to defend the rights and prove their innocence led to the emergence of a new mass culture - video surveillance. </p><p>  Many motorists acquire KARCAM QS3 video recorders in order to record the details of an accident to the smallest detail. </p><h2>  About device </h2><p>  The camera viewing angle is 140 ¬∞, and a photography mode is also provided.  Files are saved in the MOV format, the duration of each 2, 5 and 10 minutes, depending on the settings. </p><p>  According to the instructions, "QS3 CARCAM" records video in a resolution of 1920 √ó 1080 pixels with a frequency of 30 frames per second, and 1280 √ó 720 at 60 frames per second. </p><p>  There is a built-in G-sensor, GPS-module and motion sensor.  The date and time stamp in the subtitle line is superimposed on the video.  The design provides a speaker and microphone with the ability to mute. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Energy is supplied both from the cigarette lighter and from the battery.  The screen with a diagonal of 2.7 "allows you to play the footage directly on the device, as well as use the menu. The product‚Äôs own memory is 1,024 MB, the kit comes with a microSD of 32 gigabytes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ixbt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="qs3 kamk video recorder on a windshield" class="if uuid-2745810" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2745810.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  According to consumer comments, the device performed very well on the road.  I like the convenient and user-friendly interface "KARKAM QS3", the presence of an anti-sun filter.  When playing back footage, there is a smooth transition from one file to another without sudden jumps. </p><p>  It is noted that the picture is of very high quality, GPS works, the gadget itself is compact.  Invisible from the street. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The reviews that ensure a good reputation do not end there: there is also negative evidence.  I do not like the suction cup with which the device is attached to the glass - it dries and falls off due to the heat. </p><p>  If you leave the motion sensor overnight, the battery will last for about an hour of operation - a significant minus, negating the use of the function. </p><p>  It is noted that when the CAMERA QS3 screen turns off, it freezes.  Only a manual reboot helps.  It is also indicated that the numbers become visible only at a distance of 3-5 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="videoregistratori.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="karkam qs3 instruction manual" class="if uuid-2745806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2745806.jpg"></div><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the DVR is definitely good.  A lot of positive comments are evidence of this.  Most often, dissatisfaction with the mount is noted.  But such units. </p><p>  In general, the product line of this company has proved itself exclusively on the positive side, because motorists very often turn to the store for this particular product.  ‚ÄúKARKAM QS3‚Äù is generally considered to be the standard from the Karkush series, therefore it has the greatest demand in comparison with other representatives of the brand. </p><p>  In any case, the choice of a gadget should be treated responsibly so as not to buy a set of unnecessary options. </p>
