Frigola 3 * is located in Catalonia, in the wonderful resort town of Lloret de Mar.  It stands a few tens of meters from the Mediterranean Sea.  Despite the fact that the hotel is quite large, it is not only a beach hotel, but also a city one, since it is actually located in the center of the village.  Having settled here, you can not only enjoy a beach holiday on the famous Spanish coast, but also explore local attractions and easily visit Barcelona and Girona.  The hotel is very functional, comfortable and suitable for travelers of almost any age and temperament. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Frigola 3" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/476872.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Frigola 3 * is built extremely well.  This hotel is close to everything.  We can say that the location is one of the main bonuses of the hotel, which attracts Russian tourists.  Two to three minutes walk to the beach, five minutes walk to the bus station, from where you can get to the two main major Catalan cities, where the main sightseeing trips are made and where the nearest airports are - Barcelona and Girona.  From the bus station there are also small minibuses to the railway station.  In addition, immediately after the entrance to the Frigola 3 * hotel begins an endless string of bars, restaurants and eateries, a beautiful promenade and many shops where you can spend your time with pleasure.  Not too far from here to the Water World water park - just over three kilometers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To get to this hotel, you naturally need to fly to Catalonia (Spain).  As a rule, flights from Russia arrive at one of the international <span>airports in Barcelona</span> or Girona.  Fly from Moscow here for about four hours.  About eighty kilometers to the first air harbor (in Barcelona), and about forty to the second.  If you have a transfer, there is nothing to worry about.  Otherwise, you will have to take the train (in the local ‚ÄúSercanas‚Äù) and get to Blanes station.  It takes about an hour and a half from Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãand about forty minutes from Girona.  Then by bus you will reach the bus station Lloret de Mar (about a quarter of an hour), from where it is close to the Frigola 3 * hotel.  It‚Äôs best to buy a special ‚Äúbus plus cercanyas‚Äù ticket - it will be cheaper. </p>

    <h2>  Lloret de mar </h2><p>  Frigola Lloret 3 * is located in the center of one of the most rave resorts on the Costa Brava.  This is Lloret de Mar - a place where almost all the youth of Europe seek to rest.  On the local embankment you will find a very democratic and variegated audience, sometimes quite <span>unconventional.</span>  But these are the features of this resort.  It is also famous for its picturesque surroundings - cliffs of bizarre shapes that rise from the clear blue water.  If you want to go to the water park, then next to the hotel there is a stop of the free bus that goes there.  The main walking street, which is located near the hotel, is Morskoy Boulevard.  There you can not only walk along the coast and wander around the shops, but also get drunk from the Canale fountain.  Then, as the local legend says, someday you will certainly return to Lloret. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Territory and infrastructure </h2><p>  Frigola 3 * (Lloret de Mar) is a three large seven-story building in light beige color.  The hotel was opened a long time ago, in 1967, but in 2002 there was a complete update and a good repair was made.  To reach the upper levels, you can use the elevator.  The hotel has its own territory, where there is a parking lot, minimarket (there you can buy souvenirs, products, beach accessories and other trifles useful for guests).  Wi-Fi is free throughout.  In addition, hotel guests can use the territory of the neighboring Flamingo Hotel, which has practically merged with Frigola.  On the neighboring streets there are a lot of cafes and shops that you can look into on the way to the beach.  And at night, a completely different life begins there - incendiary and fun, which boils until the morning.  Five steps from the hotel there is a good supermarket where you can buy whatever your heart desires. </p>

    <h2>  Services </h2><p>  Hotel Frigola 3 * provides an opportunity for its guests to make photocopies of documents or send them by fax.  Russian tourists claim that you can also print electronic tickets.  Since the local places, especially the Costa Brava, are better to inspect on their own "on wheels", a car rental service is available at the hotel.  This is a very convenient and useful service.  At the reception you can order tickets for trains and buses.  There is a playroom for children.  You can use the parking lot, but this service needs to be ordered specially and in advance.  The hotel also provides its own transfer from the airport or other place (for a fee).  Registration of customers is carried out twenty-four hours a day.  For late check-out or early arrival, you can leave your belongings in a special room. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  What do guests in the Frigola 3 * hotel occupy in their free time?  Spain does not belong to countries where animations in hotels pay a lot of attention, but nevertheless in the evenings an incendiary disco is organized here.  In addition, almost on the same street where the hotel is located, there are the most popular nightclubs in the town, including Gala and Saint-Tropez.  For tourists who want to see the <span>sights of Catalonia, there</span> is a special bureau that arranges trips and various excursions.  Here you can organize a banquet, birthday party or wedding.  The lobby has a lounge for watching TV shows and programs.  In the evenings, guests are invited to play billiards.  But most importantly - this hotel is located in a city that has fun all day and never gets discouraged.  So without entertainment (most of which are around the corner) you certainly will not stay. </p>

    <h2>  Staff </h2><p>  The staff of the Frigola Lloret 3 * hotel speak many languages ‚Äã‚Äã- it is both English, French, and even Russian (at least the reviews of tourists are called two or three receptionists who belong to our compatriots).  Of course, the hotel staff speaks two state dialects of the area - Spanish and Catalan.  They are very friendly and adequate.  You can contact them with any request, and they will try to help you as much as possible.  All are very polite and do not make a difference between tourists from Russia and Europe, as happens in some hotels. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Cuisine is one of the special attractions that Spain is known for.  Hotel Frigola 3 * has a restaurant that specializes in Mediterranean and Catalan cuisine, as well as two bars - in the lobby and by the pool, where you can try snacks, all kinds of cocktails and very good wines.  Meals are organized as a buffet.  The restaurant is very spacious, there are enough places and food for everyone, there are no queues.  If you go on an excursion, then you can pack breakfast or lunch with you in the style of "dry ration".  If necessary - certain requests, vegetarianism, diet due to illness - you can order a special menu.  There are also vending machines for drinks and snacks on site.  Holders of Frigola guest cards can also use the restaurant of the neighboring Flamingo.  Tourists from Russia speak very well about the quality and variety of local food.  Paella, seafood, dessert cheeses, fruits, cookies, cakes - in a word, everything is very tasty and far exceeds the usual idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äútreshki‚Äù.  You can take breakfast, you can half board (with lunch or dinner to choose from). </p>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  To get to the sea, just leave the Frigola Lloret 3 * hotel and cross the road.  The hotel does not have its own beach - but this is a feature of all Spanish coastal hotels.  The whole coast where you can swim in Catalonia belongs to the municipalities.  The beaches are free and very clean, many of them can be proud of the ‚Äúblue flags‚Äù.  The local sandy beach of Playa de Lloret is typical of local resorts.  True, sunbeds and umbrellas will have to be rented, and it costs money.  The beach near the hotel is very large and well protected from the wind by cliffs overgrown with greenery.  The entrance to the water is quite smooth.  We can say that these are the best places to relax on the entire Catalan coast.  There are a lot of different kinds of water activities on the beach.  In addition, the hotel itself has a large swimming pool with a children's section, as well as a terrace with sunbeds and mattresses.  You can take sunbaths there.  Use of the Flamingo Hotel‚Äôs swimming pool is also permitted.  Both ponds are very clean, cleaned there every day. </p>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Trips to the surroundings can be booked both at the hotel and at special offices, most of which are located on Avenida de les Alegreis street.  If you want to see the surroundings, then you need to settle in the Frigola 3 * hotel.  Costa Brava is the first thing you should see.  To do this, you can go on an excursion, or you can just take a bus and ride on a picturesque serpentine.  A boat trip along the coast where you can see local grottoes is very popular.  For walking, this area is also very suitable.  A lot of trails are laid along the local rocks that lead to beautiful and comfortable bays for swimming.  Perhaps, in order to go to Barcelona and Girona, you should first use the services of a guide and go on an organized tour.  But since all the sights of these beautiful cities in this case you will see only from the window of the bus and "on the run", in order to see them better, it is worth going there again, but on your own.  In addition, this area is located just a hundred kilometers from the French border, and this can be used to visit a neighboring country. </p>

    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Tours in Frigola 3 * <span>(Lloret de Mar)</span> will cost you about nineteen to twenty thousand rubles per person for seven days.  If you arrive at the hotel on your own, then you can pay by credit cards - accept "Mastercard", "Visa" and other international payment methods.  Parking a car in the parking lot costs about fifteen euros.  Take the bus and train on your own to Barcelona (if you buy a combined ticket) - about 7 euros.  For the three most popular excursions - to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãGirona and Andorra - the bureau will take one hundred and fifty euros, but you will be satisfied.  It‚Äôs cheaper to buy beach accessories at a local store than to rent them every day.  Litter costs about three euros, and an umbrella - up to ten.  If you want to eat outside the hotel, you are unlikely to pay more than 5 or 10 euros. </p><h2>  Frigola 3 * (Spain): reviews </h2><p>  Most Russian tourists claim that this hotel is intended primarily for young people who want to "hang out" on the fabulous Costa Brava coast.  The hotel is very popular among boys and girls from Germany, Holland, Italy and Switzerland, so it is always fun there.  Russian youth can meet their peers from other countries and find friends and girlfriends.  This hotel is also praised by lovers of outdoor activities and hiking in the surrounding area.  The audience here is cheerful, not at all aggressive and very sociable.  Guests like bright and clean rooms at the Frigola 3 * hotel.  The reviews also note that, despite the motley and party guests, there are practically no cases of theft.  There are quite a lot of positive feedback about nutrition, especially that you can try a variety of fish and seafood dishes.  Travelers from Russia call the hotel very good and suitable for those who do not want to sit in the room, but have fun actively. </p>
