Thousands of tourists come to this Indian state every year.  Vacationers here are waiting not only for the gentle sea and the hot sun, but also for new acquaintances, rich leisure and exciting parties.  Many vacationers choose the quiet resort village of Calangute, located directly on the coast of the Arabian Sea, to relax in Goa.  There are fewer vacationers in this village than in Panaji and Mapusa, and the infrastructure is developed just fine.  Among other things, here you can always rent inexpensive and at the same time quite comfortable housing.  For example, the comfortable rooms are offered to guests of Calangute by the Mayflower Beach Resort 3 * hotel. </p><h2>  Location Features </h2><p>  This hotel is located in the village, on the second coastline, in a very quiet area.  Hotel guests have the opportunity to visit one of the most famous beaches in Goa - Baga.  The <span>international airport</span> is 46 km from the hotel.  To get to the Mayflower Beach Resort 3 * hotel, most tourists prefer a taxi.  If you wish, vacationers who have booked rooms at this hotel can order a transfer from the administration.  The same method will be as convenient as possible for those who prefer to travel by train.  The railway station from Calangute is also quite far away - 20 km.  A taxi ride to the hotel from the station costs about 200 rupees. </p>
