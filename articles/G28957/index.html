Of the wide range of resorts in this country, people are increasingly choosing Pattaya, and among dozens of different hotels - By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 *, a description of which we bring to your attention.  Choosing where to go to relax, each has its own goals.  For some, the main thing is the sea, especially in combination with the healing mountain air, for someone the most important is the opportunity to go diving or surfing, while someone is looking for places rich in historical and archaeological sites.  In Pattaya, all this is unlikely to be found.  People come here for exotics and impressions.  An ideal option for such a vacation would be a relatively inexpensive, but quite decent hotel By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 *.  Thailand, <span>Pattaya (Pattaya</span> in the Russian manner), of course, know how to impress our compatriots with exotic cuisine, unprecedented vegetation, a peculiar way of life of Thais.  But the industry of enchanting, and in some cases even tickling, nerves of entertainment will leave the most vivid impressions.  In this article, we will provide comprehensive arguments for and against a stay at this resort and discuss why By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 * is the most reasonable choice.  Although, perhaps, someone will read our material and decide to stay in some other hotel, since there are more than two hundred of them in Pattaya, there are even very cheap guest houses (guesthouses) with the most minimal service and dubious security. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="by dee jomtien hotel 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1404256.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Approximately 165 km from Bangkok, on the shore of the Gulf of Thailand, in the cliff-rich cliff bay, in the eastern and at the same time coastal province of Thailand called Chonburi, in its administrative district of Banglamung, is the Mecca of all foreign tourists - a crowded, noisy, but quite comfortable and beautiful city Pattaya.  By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 * is one of dozens of local hotels where your person will always be happy and will try to provide you with maximum comfort.  This hotel can be distinguished from the rest by its very good location.  Firstly, this is the urban area of ‚Äã‚ÄãJomtien, famous for its relatively calm evenings and, again, a relatively clear sea.  Secondly, from the door of the hotel literally 20 steps to the best beach in the city.  Thirdly, from the same door for less than a quarter of an hour on a tuk-tuk to the city center, which every tourist is obliged to visit.  The latter circumstance is very important, since it is in the center that you can get what, in fact, they go to Thailand for - unforgettable night and day adventures.  Here, in the center, there is a pier where lovers of white sand and turquoise blue waters should board a boat and go to the islet of Koh Lan for a beach holiday.  Many guests of By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 *, especially those who are in Thailand for the first time, seek to add a lot of excursions to the vacation schedule.  From the point of view of such tourists, the hotel is very convenient because you can visit many interesting places in Pattaya on your own, using a tuk-tuk, which costs only 10 baht here, and thus save 100-300 baht on a guided tour.  However, for those who intend to spend their holidays away from the exhausting city motley and bustle, the hotel is also suitable, because it is in Jomtien, in comparison with other areas of Pattaya, is relatively calm.  An active life freezes here at about 11 o‚Äôclock in the evening, leaving vacationers alone with the magical Thai nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 Pattaya" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1403095.jpg" width="535"></div>

Flights to this airport follow not only from Moscow, but also from a dozen other Russian cities, including <span>Novosibirsk, Irkutsk,</span> Ufa, Bratsk.  There are also flights from Kazakhstan.  Those tourists who arrive in Bangkok will have to spend about 2 hours on the road, which is not very comfortable in the heat.  Bangkok Airport is considered the largest in the country, and, of course, there are much more flights from the CIS countries, there are also from Ukraine, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan.  From here, if you are an unorganized tourist, that is, going to Thailand, bypassing travel agencies, you can get to Pattaya by bus number 389, which goes directly from the airport.  From U-Tapao you can go to the hotel by taxi (about 800 baht) or by bus (ticket costs from 250 baht).  If you are an organized tourist, you must be met by a tour operator upon arrival at any airport and delivered to the hotel without hassle. </p><h2>  By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 *: hotel overview </h2><p>  All tourists who have visited this resort place mark its territory, teeming with exotic palm trees, so far rare for us bougainvillea, beautiful cesalpinia, unique orchids.  All this beauty is maximally used by photo shoot lovers.  The territory of the hotel itself is very compact, on all sides it is limited by either expensive or other hotels.  It has two swimming pools, a massage area, a cafe, a bar, a corner for children's games, a parking lot and several buildings.  The main one, in which the front desk is located, has 14 floors.  Here in the spacious lobby you can relax in soft chairs, order a favorite drink at the bar, and ‚Äúsit‚Äù on the Internet.  Unfortunately, Wi-Fi in the hotel is paid - both in the lobby and in the rooms.  At the reception in By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 *, those who wish can donate their valuables to the safe for free and without collateral, because not every room has it.  They are given a key, for the loss of which a fine of 4,000 baht is provided, so that the key, if negligent, can become really golden.  Also, the reception staff will help to book an excursion, rent a vehicle (in Thailand it is a bike, because it is extremely difficult for our tourists to drive here by car), and they will solve the problem of delivering breakfast to your room.  One problem - it will be necessary to explain with the staff either in Thai, or in English, or even in sign language.  In addition to the skyscraper, the hotel has two buildings in three floors and several separate villas, each of which is equipped with a tiny private courtyard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1403094.jpg" width="535"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For the convenience of guests, a small shop operates in the territory, there is a press delivery and laundry service.  But there is no sauna in the hotel.  Conference rooms are not provided here, and they are not needed, because Thailand does not go to work. </p><h2>  Accommodation </h2><p>  Regarding the rooms at By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 *, the reviews are good.  The guests are satisfied with the perfectly working plumbing, high-quality furniture, high-quality maid work, reasonable prices.  The hotel rooms are different in size, which is desirable to specify when ordering a tour.  Views from the windows in a high-rise building may be at sea, city, territory and surroundings.  Of the remaining buildings and villas, the view is mainly on the territory.  All this also needs to be discussed in advance so that there are no misunderstandings when checking in.  By the way, it happens almost always immediately upon arrival.  It is very rare that staff ask them to wait a while for the maids to complete their work.  In such cases, guests are treated with welcome drinks.  Room categories are as follows: </p><p>  1. 5 economy class units with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 19 squares, very simple in equipment and design, designed for a maximum of 2 guests (there is no possibility to additionally establish a sleeping place).  The room has two narrow beds, a minimal set of furniture, air conditioning, TV with some channels in Russian. </p><p>  2. 12 rooms of the category "standard" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã20 squares.  They differ from the previous ones in the presence of a balcony with armchairs and a more welcoming design.  There are also small refrigerators here, and they have drinks and light snacks (except for water, which the hotel staff replenishes as needed, everything is paid). </p><p>  3. 15 comforts, or improved, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã24 squares.  In these rooms it is possible to install additional space for the third guest.  The equipment is the same as in the standards.  Additionally there are safes. </p><p>  4. 5 "deluxe" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã33 squares.  This room type has double beds and a soft sofa, which can be used as an extra bed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 reservation" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1403097.jpg" width="536"></div>

    <p>  5. 4 rooms of the category "deluxe superior" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 33 squares.  This apartment has a spacious terrace.  From it fascinating views open. </p><p>  In By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 * (Pattaya), as in many <span>hotels in Thailand, the</span> classical doors are not always installed in the hygiene room.  Very often they are replaced by transparent screens (with curtains) or special blinds.  With the exception of this highlight, the hygiene rooms in this hotel are ordinary, cozy and comfortable.  They are equipped with a toilet, washbasin and shower or a spacious bathtub.  Individual hygiene products (shampoo, liquid soap and bath gel) are replenished regularly; sheets, towels and pillowcases are changed each time the room is cleaned. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Almost all tours to By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 * are offered only with breakfast.  Reviews about the quality of food at the hotel are mostly enthusiastic.  Self-service breakfasts are held in the restaurant, located in the main building, on its ground floor.  It has a very cozy and spacious terrace.  It is always nice to start your day on it in good weather.  Breakfast time is from 8 to 10 in the morning.  The range of dishes is quite wide.  There are dairy products, classic granola, as well as pancakes and crepes, and more dense foods are available - pasta, potatoes, salads, sausages, several types of meat, soups, sausages and cold meats, desserts, fruits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 hotel review" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1403096.jpg" width="537"></div>

    <p>  In the second hotel restaurant, located on the territory, you can eat day and evening according to the "custom menu" system, but it is already paid. </p><p>  Tourists can buy drinks and cocktails in bars.  One of them is in the lobby, the second is near the pool.  Breakfast includes free coffee, teas, water, juice. </p><h2>  Leisure at the hotel </h2><p>  Not much entertainment awaits guests By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 *.  The photo shows the main one, namely a large outdoor pool, the depth of which increases gradually and in a separate segment reaches 1.9 meters.  There is also a children's zone in it, where it is very shallow.  Around this pool there are constantly free couches, <span>parasols.</span>  Nearby there is a place where for a fixed price Thai masseuses perform massage (except erotic).  Another highlight of this pool is the bar located on its edge.  It is convenient that the ordered drinks in it can be paid not immediately, but after bathing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 description" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1403100.jpg" width="524"></div>

    <p>  The infrastructure of By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 * has two more pools.  One is located in the villa area.  The second is on the open veranda of the fourth floor in a high-rise building.  Both of them are smaller in area than the central one, and there are only 10-12 units of sunbeds around them. </p><p>  In addition to swimming pools, the hotel has a gym with exercise machines where sports lovers can actively spend time.  Animation and other entertainment are not provided in the hotel. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  For many tourists, an important advantage in choosing is that the By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 * hotel is built a few steps from the sea and one of the best beaches in terms of cleanliness of Pattaya.  However, it also loses significantly in terms of cleanliness and infrastructure, for example, the beaches of Greece or even our Black Sea coast.  But the water here is warm all year, even in the rainy season.  The beach, although located near the hotel, is urban, so everyone can relax here, but you need to pay for sunbeds and umbrellas.  For traders of food, clothes, towels, souvenirs and anything else, the entrance here is absolutely free, so they defile along the coast all day and offer their goods. </p><p>  But most tourists with the aim of a beach holiday in Pattaya go to the neighboring island of Koh Lan.  From the hotel you need to go there first by tuk-tuk to the pier, then by boat, the ticket price for which can vary from 30 to 200 baht.  In the latter case, upon arrival to the island, you are provided with a tuk-tuk free of charge, which takes customers to the best of the island beaches, and takes them back at the agreed time.  Having bought a cheap ticket, tourists pay again for further travel.  In addition, for 30 baht you will be transported for about an hour, and for 100, especially for 150, they will be delivered four times faster. </p><p>  Fans of night swimming in the sea are probably interested to know that the beach near the hotel is not closed in the evening, so you can walk here anytime, but since there are ebbs and flows in the Gulf of Thailand, you can‚Äôt frolic in the waves at night.  Water during ebbs here goes several hundred meters, revealing wet sands, the remains of reefs and gapeous inhabitants of the sea. </p>

    <h2>  Leisure outside the hotel </h2><p>  Tourists go to Pattaya not for a beach holiday, but for exotic.  Right next to By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 * stop tuk-tuk, where you can ride for 10 baht to the famous Walking Street with its dozens of bars for all tastes, discos, nightclubs and numerous shops.  Also, hotel guests can independently reach the Pratumnak district, considered the most Russian in the city.  Here is the famous "Big Buddha".  A curious and useful fact: in this area there are small but unusually clean beaches for Pattaya.  There is no white sand, like on Koh Lana, but it‚Äôs quite possible to swim and sunbathe calmly.  Another place you can get cheaply is the huge oceanarium with an aquarium, located near the Tesco Lotus supermarket.  It is somewhat smaller than the <span>aquarium in Bangkok,</span> but also able to impress and please visitors of any age.  To visit other interesting places, it is best to take an excursion, as they are at some distance from the city.  It can be a chic zoo "Khao Kheo", where some of the animals live outside the cages (they get the most unpredictable photographs), or farms where crocodiles or elephants are bred, or a botanical garden with plants that you will not see anywhere else, or a stone park, as well as ‚ÄúMini Siam", Buddha Mountain and many other unusual and interesting. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p> By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3 * has rather high popularity.  "Tophotels" among the hotels of the category of "3 stars" in Pattaya gives it a position in the top ten, and the rating of different tour operators ranges from 4.2 to 4.5 points out of 5 possible.  The hotel focuses on active tourists.  There are few services for children, which must be taken into account by those traveling to <span>Thailand with their kids.</span>  You also need to take into account that in this country it is as comfortable as possible to relax from mid-November and somewhere until mid-March, when there is very little rainfall.  It is important that you can make a reservation online at By Dee Jomtien Hotel 3, and for most of the rooms it can be canceled without penalty.  It is also important to know in advance that in this hotel you have to pay for a baby of any age.  If he is 12 years old or less and is accommodated in a bed with his parents, payment will be 200 baht per day, and when placing an extra bed - 300 baht.  For adults or children over 12 years old, when placed on an extra bed, you will have to pay 400 baht per day.  The cost of the entire tour to Pattaya to this hotel depends on the season and room category.  In different travel agencies, prices may also vary slightly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="by dee jomtien hotel 3 traveler reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1404265.jpg" width="600"></div>
