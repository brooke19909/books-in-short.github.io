Relaxing in a hotel, getting to any point on the island is not difficult. </p><h2>  Santa Ponsa beaches </h2><p>  The beaches of Mallorca are stunningly beautiful.  In Santa Ponsa, for example, there is a huge sandy coast along which there is a promenade, and after it begins a pine forest.  In the summer, there are a lot of people on the shore, tourists come here from Palma and other resorts.  Umbrellas and sunbeds on the beaches are paid.  The swimming area of ‚Äã‚Äãvacationers is protected by a cable and is strictly guarded.  Along the coast of the Costa de la Calma, there are several rocky coves.  It‚Äôs not very convenient to reach them with children and prams, there is also another unofficial beach (‚ÄúLittle Beach‚Äù), there are usually few people on it, but there are no benefits of civilization here.

Delfin Siesta Mar 4 * (Santa Ponsa) is located almost in the city center and at the same time is removed from noise sources.  At night, extraneous sounds do not interfere with sleep at all.  The hotel is located on the coast, near the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="distance to the sea" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1515075.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The complex has nice rooms.  They are not very large, but clean and well maintained.  The furnishings of the apartments are simple, without pathos, but quite acceptable.  Air conditioners are working properly.  Room service at the hotel is up to par.  According to vacationers, maids are very careful in cleaning, and towels can be changed at any time as soon as you want. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Especially tourists praise the food.  A wide variety of dishes are served daily at the buffet, with their assortment changing daily.  Breakfast is more uniform, but also good.  In the evenings, guests can enjoy grilled dishes.  Particularly striking is the choice of pastries and desserts.  For lovers of sweets, the hotel restaurant is a true paradise.  Such a variety of desserts is hard to find. </p><p>  Tourists also note the speed and quality of service of waiters.  Although the restaurant is sometimes crowded, the staff works clearly and harmoniously.  The only small drawback of the institution can be considered the size of its hall.  The fact is that there are many visitors, and the restaurant hall is not so large.  For dinner, you can sometimes watch the queue.  But in general, food, according to guests, is above all praise.  Such unanimous reviews should definitely be taken into account, since it is precisely with regard to food that tourists always have disagreements.  And in this case, the opinions of vacationers completely coincide. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel room service" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1515082.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Most of the guests prefer All Inclusive, however, tourists have the right to choose half board as well, since active guests traveling around Mallorca simply do not have time for lunch.  There is an incredible number of cafes, bars and restaurants throughout Santa Ponsa and the rest of the island's resorts, vying with each other to offer delicious seafood dishes prepared according to the best local recipes.  It is certainly worth a visit to one of these establishments in order to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat they are and how tasty their food is. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  The hotel has its own territory, it is not small, there is a place for walking.  From the coast, the complex is separated by a promenade, passing between the beach strip and the forest. </p><p>  Special attention deserves the coast of Santa Ponsa.  The local beaches are as beautiful as the entire coast of Mallorca.  There are many small picturesque bays that attract tourists with their pristine beauty.  The hotel's beach has sand cover with a smooth shallow entry into the sea.  The water is always warm and clear, however, in the season when there are a lot of people on the coast, after lunch the sea becomes a little muddy, which is completely logical.  Santa Ponsa is an ideal place for families with children.  On the one hand, this is a city with good infrastructure, and not a small village, but on the other, it is completely noisy, but, on the contrary, a calm place.  Here, those tourists who seek peace away from noisy megacities prefer to relax.  Santa Ponsa has a good location.  From the city to get to the capital of the island is very simple.  The bus ride takes no more than ten minutes. </p><p>  It is nice that the transport network in Mallorca is very developed.  Getting to any resort is easy.  Tourists from Palma de Mallorca come to Santa Ponsa to enjoy the beauty of the local beaches and bays.  And vacationers Delfin Siesta Mar 4 * tend to get to the capital to see the sights and get to the annual sales, which begin in early July.  Mallorca is the best place for shopaholics to relax, because here you can not only have a good time on the sea coast, but also make fascinating trips to shops, shops and markets, where you can find many amazing things.  Well, annual sales are a separate topic for conversation.  Connoisseurs of this issue even guess the time of their trip to Mallorca in order to visit the local shopping centers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="delfin siesta mar 4 reviews" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1515083.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A few words I would like to say about the level of service at the hotel.  The complex has wonderful staff.  All staff are very attentive and polite.  Particularly pleased with the good room service and quality cleaning.  The cleanliness of the rooms often spoils the opinion of a good hotel.  But this does not apply to Delfin Siesta Mar 4 *.  In addition, there is absolutely no language barrier.  A Russian-speaking girl works at the reception and helps to resolve all issues.  But with the rest of the staff it is quite possible to explain gestures.  The hotel administration and ordinary workers are really happy to see tourists within the walls of the hotel, offering them a decent level of service and excellent quality food.  Tourists are very pleased with the quality of service of the restaurant waiters, who strive to quickly and efficiently serve visitors, despite their large number. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Delfin Siesta Mar 4 * - a worthy place to relax, even for picky tourists.  The hotel fully meets the ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù ratio, offering its guests a comfortable stay at affordable prices.  The complex is perfect for those people who seek to find a good place for a family vacation.  The warm azure sea and shallow water makes it possible for tourists to come here even with the smallest children.  So, when planning a vacation in Mallorca, Delfin Siesta Mar 4 * should be considered as one of the options for a budget holiday with a decent level of service. </p>
