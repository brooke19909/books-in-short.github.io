The upper part remains absolutely untouched.  You can no longer wear such socks, and sometimes it is a pity to throw them away.  So craftsmen came up with special wardrobe elements for such wardrobe elements.  For example, use for crafts.  From the sock you can do anything.  Toys are especially pretty.  For example, snowmen from socks.  They can be hung on a Christmas tree or put under it, placed on a windowsill or on a table. </p><h2>  What do you need for crafts? </h2>

    <p>  Before making a snowman out of a sock, it is necessary to find and prepare all its components.  For the manufacture of future crafts you will need: </p><ul><li>  colored and white sock (their upper part); </li><li>  beads or buttons for decoration; </li><li>  <span>black</span> beads for the eyes; </li><li>  a rod from an orange pencil or bugles of the corresponding shade; </li><li>  filler - any grits or chopped; </li><li>  thread, needle, scissors, glue. </li></ul><h2>  How to make a snowman out of a sock? </h2><p>  Having prepared everything you need, you can begin the manufacturing process.  How is a snowman made from a sock with your own hands?  To begin with, a white toe should be cut immediately above the heel, perpendicular to the main direction of knitting.  The lower part can be thrown away with a clear conscience.  Returning to the segment, tightly tie one edge of it with a thread.  Then, the future New Year's snowman is filled with cereal or chop.  You can use plastic balls used in toys, or small pebbles.  But cereal is a more affordable and inexpensive material.  It is worth filling until the workpiece acquires a round shape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  After that, the second edge is wrapped and tied in the same way as it was done with the other end - tight, with the help of a thread.  Next, you need a snowman to be dressed.  After all, winter is in the yard.  For this purpose, you need to take a colored sock and, if its sole is not erased and not damaged, cut it into three parts.  In this case, the middle segment is used.  It must be worn on the body of a snowman.  Then you should form a head.  To do this, use the fingers around the workpiece to squeeze the filler and tie it with a thread, pulling it not all the way, but leaving some distance. </p><p>  Now the New Year‚Äôs snowman has already taken shape, it remains to sew beads for him as eyes and insert a carrot nose from a rod or orange glass beads.  This element is best fixed with hot glue. </p><h2>  Make a hat </h2>
