In ancient Russia, the hryvnia was silver or gold jewelry or ingots, which were used as a means of circulation.  At a later time, so-called three- or ten-copecks coins.  The latter were made of silver.

    <p>  The first attempt to restore the hryvnia came in the short period of independence of the Ukrainian Republic - 1917-1918.  However, this financial project collapsed after the Bolsheviks seized the country.  On the territory of Ukraine, Soviet signs began to be used, and then - chervontsy and rubles. </p><p>  After the USSR collapsed, the governments of the national republics became </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ukrainian currency hryvnia" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4353/236748.jpg" width="600"></div>  gradually get rid of <span>Soviet money.</span>  In the winter of 1992, Ukrainians began to use a new currency - coupons or, as they were also called, Carbovans.  All of these banknotes are the same in size.  <span>The purchasing power of</span> one coupon was extremely small.  Moreover, this Ukrainian currency was constantly subjected to serious devaluation.  Coupon-carbovans had a very low level of protection and quickly wiped.  For these several reasons, there is a need for a new currency.  <span>The</span> 1996 <span>monetary reform</span> led to the emergence of the hryvnia.  For one unit of the new currency, one hundred thousand coupon-Carbovans were accepted.  The monetary reform was non-confiscatory, pre-thought out.  Its conduct was civilized and stimulated public confidence in the new currency.  On the very first day of the reform, prices, tariffs and salaries were converted into hryvnias.  It was held exactly two weeks, until mid-September 1996, and with maximum amenities for the population.  Initially, the dollar against the hryvnia was 1: 1.76.

However, there were also bright times for the hryvnia.  Under President Yushchenko, the policy of the government and the National Bank came down to the stabilization of the Ukrainian currency.  For a long time, the dollar against the hryvnia kept at 1: 5.05.  There was even a short period of revaluation of the national currency.  In the summer of 2008, one dollar was worth 4.6 UAH.  But on this the bright days for the hryvnia ended.  Already in the winter of that year, the dollar was sold at a price of 6.74 UAH.  Now the ratio of the American currency and the hryvnia, established by the National Bank, is stably kept at around 1: 7.99.  However, according to a number of forecasts, a decrease in <span>Ukraine‚Äôs gold reserves</span> will negatively affect its exchange rate.  It is possible that at the end of this year, the dollar will cost 9 UAH.  The exchange rate of the Ukrainian currency against the ruble is 1: 4.04 for today.  Its possible devaluation this year may affect the ratio of Russian money.
