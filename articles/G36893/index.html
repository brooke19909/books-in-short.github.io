The screen size is 4.5 inches.  The stand kit is as follows: accompanying documentation, charger, microUSB cable, headphones (there is no microphone in them), smartphone.  The box is dense, attractive and with all the brightness of the device is black.  The front panel is made of plastic.  <span>Safety glass</span> completely covers the front side.  From damage and scratches, the screen is protected by a tiny side that rises slightly above the body.  On top there is a conversational speaker and a 0.3 megapixel camera.  The perimeter is complemented by a thin edging, which is made of plastic.

    <p>  The case is unusual.  It is made of special plastic, which is a combination of glossy and matte finish.  The material resembles the one from which the toys are made.  The surface is incredibly pleasant to the touch.  It is protected from fingerprints and scratches.  The smartphone is comfortable and pleasant to hold.  On the back there is a 5 megapixel main camera lens.  There is also a flash, and at the bottom is a speaker.  The back panel is removable, as is the battery underneath. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Under the battery there is a slot for a memory card and compartments for two SIM-cards.  The buttons are located non-standard, but very convenient.  On the left side are the volume keys.  The power button is on the right. </p><p>  Now consider the top panel.  There is a connector for microUSB and charging, as well as an audio output for headphones and a headset.  For such dimensions, the smartphone is incredibly light, does not overload the hand.  The diagonal of the screen allows you to reach your finger anywhere on the display, holding the device in one hand.  It uses an IPS matrix.  The resolution is 480x854 pixels. </p><p>  The screen evokes generally positive emotions, which is also confirmed by reviews.  Viewing angles are wide.  The sensor is responsive.  The brightness in the device is implemented with a significant margin.  You can comfortably read text from the display even in bright sunshine.  Multi-touch supports two simultaneous touches. </p><p>  Now let's say a few words about the technical component.  The smartphone has a Mali-400 MP graphics accelerator, 512 megabytes of RAM, the MT6572 processor is a dual-core processor with a frequency of 1 GHz.  For the smooth operation of the phone, such characteristics are enough.  The screen is undemanding to resources, since it has a low resolution.  Supported video playback in HD-resolution.  You can also install a special player from third-party developers.  It will allow you to watch movies in FullHD format. </p><p>  Users have no complaints about the operation of the device, given their feedback.  The interface, <span>surfing the Internet</span> and applications work smoothly.  The smartphone has the operating system Android 4.2.2.  The device works in networks of the second and third generation.  There are Bluetooth and Wi-Fi modules, as well as GPS. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The battery can be attributed to the weaknesses of the smartphone.  Its capacity is 1700 mAh.  Such characteristics can be enough only for a day of active use.  Watching a movie for an hour will take up 20 percent of the charge.  Using the Internet during the same time will require 30%. </p><p>  The charging unit has a very unusual design - the company name (Vertex) is highlighted in green.  <span>The front camera is</span> ideal for video chatting.  The quality of pictures taken with the main sensor is not satisfactory.  Especially impressive are the shots taken in natural light.  Settings allow you to set sharpness, ISO, <span>white balance.</span>  Several shooting modes are supported, including panoramic.  It should be noted that we are really talking about a high-quality and affordable device.  There is a decent display, comfortable ergonomics, attractive color and design.  The disadvantages include a short battery life, which is characteristic of many modern smartphones. </p><h2>  C301 </h2>

Its diagonal is clearly not enough for comfortable work, especially on the Internet.  The phone is presented in black, its price is 1390 rubles.  The cost corresponds to the capabilities of the device, given the presence of two SIM-cards. </p><h2>  D505 </h2>
