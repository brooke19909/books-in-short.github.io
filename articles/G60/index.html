At his receiver, the political center moved to Kiev.  With the onset of fragmentation in Russia, several cities at once began to argue with each other for the right to become main in the East Slavic lands. </p><p>  This feudal period was interrupted by the invasion of the Mongol hordes and the established yoke.  In extremely difficult conditions of devastation and constant wars, Moscow became the main Russian city, which finally united Russia and made it independent.  In the XV - XVI centuries, this name is a thing of the past.  It was replaced by the word "Russia", adopted in the Byzantine manner. </p><p>  In modern historiography, there are several points of view on the question of when feudal Russia went into the past.  Most often, researchers believe that this happened in 1547, when Prince Ivan Vasilyevich took the title of king. </p>

    <h2>  The emergence of Russia </h2><p>  An ancient united Russia, the history of which began in the 9th century, appeared after when in 882 the <span>Prince of</span> Novgorod, <span>Oleg</span> captured Kiev and made this city his capital.  In this era, East Slavic tribes were divided into several tribal unions (glade, Dregovichi, Krivichi, etc.).  Some of them were at enmity with each other.  The inhabitants of the steppes also paid tribute to the hostile foreigners of the Khazars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, the first <span>Kiev princes</span> were busy trying to unite all tribal unions under their rule.  The creation of a centralized state was accompanied by wars and conflicts.  For example, <span>Prince Igor</span> Rurikovich (912-945) was killed by the Drevlyans, for whom he demanded too much tribute. </p><p>  Christian Byzantium became another rival with which pagan Russia fought.  The story of this conflict began under Oleg, who was the first of the Kiev rulers to go south on boats in order to receive tribute from the Greeks.  Such trips continued until the eleventh century.  Some of them were successful, others, on the contrary, ended in failure. </p>

    <h2>  Adoption of christianity </h2><p>  The most important event that Kievan Rus survived was the adoption of Christianity.  This happened in 988, during the reign of Vladimir Svyatoslavich.  This prince wanted to abandon the pagan faith and gain new allies.  His choice fell on Christian Byzantium, with which Russia has since developed the closest ties.  The choice of Orthodoxy influenced the entire history of the country right up to modern days.  In 1054, the universal Christian church experienced a great schism, after which the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Pope anathematized each other.  The Russian state remained Orthodox, and after the fall of Byzantium in the 15th century, it also turned out to be the world center of Orthodoxy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The beginning of fragmentation </h2><p>  Under Vladimir (978-1015), the first feuds also began.  Kievan Rus entered a period of political fragmentation.  This process was normal for all European medieval states. </p><p>  Formally, it took place due to the order of succession, in which the dying prince had to divide his power between his sons, each of whom de facto became an independent ruler.  The fragmentation also had deeper economic reasons.  The rich cities that received money from trade and local resources did not want to remain subordinate to Kiev. </p><p>  It is believed that ancient Russia experienced its heyday under the son of Vladimir Yaroslav (1015-1054).  He was the last to defeat his brothers and become the sole ruler of the country.  However, with his sons and grandchildren, the state disintegrated more and more.  The princes of Russia did not want to submit to the Kiev monarch.  New political centers appeared: Chernigov, Rostov, Polotsk, Galich, Smolensk, etc. Veliky Novgorod remained the original, in which the Veche ‚Äî the popular assembly, which often opposed princely power ‚Äî played a special role. </p>

    <h2>  12th century </h2><p>  In the XII century came the final fragmentation of Russia.  In 1136, a republican system was established in Novgorod.  From this moment, the princes received power on an elective basis, and not by inheritance, as in other lands.  A similar principle worked in Pskov.  Another important region was northeastern Russia.  The history of its development is associated with the name of Yuri Dolgoruky (he died in 1157).  Moscow was founded under him, and Rostov and Suzdal became the most important cities in the country. </p><p>  His son Andrei Bogolyubsky elevated a new center - Vladimir-on-Klyazma.  Also under him in 1168 a coalition of princes from all over the country captured Kiev, after which he finally lost his political significance.  The fragmentation of Russia was also accompanied by regular wars against the nomads who inhabited the southern steppes.  Previously, they were Pechenegs, in the XII century, their place was taken by Polovtsy.  Turkic-speaking tribes were distinguished by militancy.  The steppes often plundered Russia.  The history of this confrontation is best known due to the campaign of Novgorod-Seversky Prince Igor in 1185.  The story of this unsuccessful military campaign formed the basis of the oldest Russian-language literary monument, "Words on Igor's Campaign". </p>

    <h2>  Mongol invasion </h2><p>  The old way collapsed when the Mongol hordes came to replace the Polovtsy.  The Baikal steppes were their homeland.  The legendary Genghis Khan conquered most of Asia, including China.  His grandson Batu stood at the head of a campaign in Europe.  On his way were the princes of Russia. </p><p>  Due to the fragmentation and inconsistency of actions, the Slavic rulers could not assemble an army that could confront the Mongols.  In 1237-1240  the horde destroyed almost all the important Russian cities except Novgorod, which was too far in the north.  Since then, Slavic princes became tributaries of the Mongols.  In the Volga steppes the Golden Horde was created.  Her khans not only collected tribute, but also gave <span>labels to reign,</span> refusing the obstinate rulers who they did not like. </p><p>  At the same time, Catholic military <span>monastic orders</span> appeared in the Baltic states <span>.</span>  The pope organized crusades against pagans and Gentiles.  So the Livonian Order appeared.  Sweden became another western threat.  In both states, Russians were considered heretics.  The aggressors were opposed by the Novgorod prince Alexander.  In 1240, he won the Battle of Neva, and two years later - the <span>Battle of the Ice.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Association of Russia </h2><p>  Northeastern or great Russia became the center of the struggle against the Mongols.  This confrontation was led by the princes of small Moscow.  At first they were able to get the right to collect taxes from all Russian lands.  Thus, part of the money was deposited in the Moscow treasury.  When enough strength was gained, Dmitry Donskoy found himself in an open confrontation with the Golden Horde khans.  In 1380, his army defeated Mamaia. </p><p>  But even despite this success, for another whole century Moscow rulers periodically paid tribute.  Only after <span>standing on the Ugra</span> in 1480, the yoke was finally dropped.  At the same time, under Ivan III, almost all Russian lands, including Novgorod, were united around Moscow.  In 1547, his grandson Ivan the Terrible adopted the title of king, which was the end of the history of princely Russia and the beginning of a new tsarist Russia. </p>
