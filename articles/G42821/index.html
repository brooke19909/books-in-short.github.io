    <p>  Kuban Universal Bank has been operating in the financial market since 1994.  For 21 years of work, the number of <span>corporate clients is</span> only increasing.  Initially, an independent credit and financial institution was intended to address issues at the municipal level.  Today, the services of a financial institution are used by municipal and commercial enterprises, trading companies and small and medium-sized businesses, <span>private individuals</span> and non-profit public organizations.  Most customers say that the bank with each user of services very quickly builds productive and mutually beneficial relationships.  Specialists working for a long time in the banking sector perfectly find an approach to everyone, solving the actual problems as productively as possible. </p><h2>  Membership in government organizations </h2><p>  Kuban Universal Bank is a full member of the Visa International system, is a member of the Association of Regional Banks and the Association of Russian Banks, and is a member <span>of the Deposit Insurance System.</span>  In 2010, the financial institution became a full member of the Guarantee Fund for Support of Small Businesses.  Belonging to state-level organizations, as well as numerous positive reviews of partnership with a financial institution, indicate a high level of work and confirm a good reputation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Financial assistance to private clients </h2>

    <p>  Financial institutions that operate in the regions and have a small network are often highly trusted.  This financial institution (Krasnodar) is no exception.  ‚ÄúKuban Universal Bank‚Äù, having only two additional offices, perfectly copes with its obligations.  According to customers, all financial transactions are carried out on time, no delays or delays.  Small entrepreneurs are particularly pleased with the work of a financial institution, since any reporting and settlement transactions are carried out quickly.  Compared to the giants of the financial market, Kuban Universal Bank, reviews of which are presented in a positive way, despite its small authorized capital (669,960,000 rubles), does not experience liquidity difficulties.  Obligations to the population both were fulfilled before the crisis of 2014, and are fulfilled today. </p><h2>  Attractive deposits and quality service </h2><p>  Many investors respond well to attractive deposit programs.  New products are especially focused on: </p><ul><li>  <em>Thaw contribution.</em>  The deposit is valid for 200 days.  <span>The interest rate</span> is 16%, which is an order of magnitude higher than that offered by many other financial institutions.  The accumulated profit is paid at the end of the contract. </li><li>  <em>Contribution "Business People".</em>  The term of the deposit is 400 days.  In the first 200 days of the partnership, a deposit of 14% will be accrued on the deposit, in the second half of the term the interest on the deposit will be 16%.  Interest is paid at the end of each quarter with capitalization. </li></ul><p>  It is worth mentioning that with the onset of the crisis in Russia, at a time when the dollar began to grow at an incredibly fast pace, many bank customers began to withdraw their deposits in panic.  Despite the relatively large flow of applications, Kuban Universal Bank paid all deposits upon request.  No delay.  The work was carried out on time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Remote service </h2><p>  Like many financial institutions, the Krasnodar Bank offers its customers Internet banking services.  Without leaving your home, through your personal account you can use most of the available banking services.  <span>Individuals</span> note the convenience of paying for services, the benefits of working with online stores and the benefits of making payments online.  This significantly saves time and money. </p>

    <p>  Support is available around the clock.  Entrepreneurs and businessmen respond positively to the opportunity to pay taxes and fees, to make payments with details.  Information was received from clients of the financial institution that the service worked intermittently from the end of February until the beginning of March.  This caused not only inconvenience, but also outrage.  On the other hand, probable technical interruptions were reported on the bank‚Äôs official website.  At the moment, this problem has been completely eliminated, and the service works in a fully functional mode. </p><h2>  What do customers say about online banking? </h2><p>  After receiving the card at the bank, many customers issued their personal accounts in the online system.  According to many people, the functionality allows paying utility bills without any complications, replenishing an account on the phone and paying off payments for a landline phone and the Internet. </p>

    <p>  36 Pushkinskaya Street is the address of Kuban Universal Bank.  ATMs are located throughout Krasnodar, and there are 10 of them.  Repeatedly recorded indignation of customers caused by the inoperability of ATMs.  If you look in detail, all claims were related to the device, which is located in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãRed Square.  Numerous reviews about the inoperative state of the equipment quickly attracted the attention of employees of the financial institution.  As it turned out later, the problems were related to the provider of the security.  Instant reaction to customer signals allowed to quickly solve the problem. </p><h2>  Big commission, or How to protect yourself from losses? </h2>

    <p>  Kuban Universal Bank (Krasnodar), whose office addresses are very easy to find, like all financial institutions, charges a fee for withdrawing cash from ATMs that are not part of the bank structure and are not among the partners of the financial institution.  The minimum fee is 100 rubles.  This point is described in partnership agreements, although in very small print.  Some customers of the bank were unpleasantly surprised when, when withdrawing 100 rubles, 200 were debited from their account. This situation caused significant indignation and negativity.  On the other hand, if you pay attention and use only the partner ATMs of a financial institution, there will be no problems.  CB ‚ÄúKuban Universal Bank‚Äù (LLC) offers its customers to withdraw their money from cards directly in the branch, which completely excludes additional fees.  Although inconvenient, it will help get rid of unplanned expenses.  The commission is one of the few negative aspects that clients face and many turn a blind eye to, since the other advantages of the partnership can easily compensate for this moment. </p>
