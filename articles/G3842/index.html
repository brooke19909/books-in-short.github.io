  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Payment systems: rating, comparison, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Payments and transfers on the World Wide Web have become the norm for a good half of Internet users.  In addition, almost all services of this plan have their own or third-party cards.  Payment systems are gaining momentum due to the fact that you can pay for the service or cash out through the usual plastic cards. </p><p>  There are a lot of such services in the vastness of the Web, and every year there are even more.  And if experienced users are more or less oriented in all this variety, then beginners simply shrug their hands and study the ratings of payment systems on the Internet in the hope of choosing their best option.  The choice is further complicated by the fact that everyone has their own needs and preferences.  And if one service is good for the first user, then it is not a fact that it will meet the requirements of the second and third.  So there is something to deal with. </p><p>  Below you will find the rating of electronic payment systems, which includes the most popular and well-established services.  All the products described below can be found on the official resources of the developers, so there should be no problems with testing.  The rating of payment systems is based on the calculation of expert opinions (financial web magazines, independent analytical companies, etc.), as well as the responses of ordinary users. </p><h2>  Difficulty choosing </h2><p>  As mentioned above, there are a lot of similar services, both from domestic developers and foreign ones.  For a clearer picture, we denote the ratings of payment systems in the world and specifically for Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.uidownload.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rating of online payment systems" class="if uuid-2863498" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2863498.jpg"></div><p>  Both the former and the latter have their own specific (territorial) advantages and disadvantages, which must be taken into account.  But first things first.  Let's start with Russian services and continue with foreign ones. </p><p>  Rating of payment systems in Russia: </p><ol><li>  WebMoney. </li><li>  "Yandex money". </li><li>  "Kiwi". </li></ol><p>  Consider the participants in more detail. </p><h2>  WebMoney </h2><p>  WebMoney topped the rating of payment systems due to its popularity.  The service is used by more than half of Runet.  Almost all commercial Internet resources have the opportunity to pay or receive payment in WebMoney. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dashforcenews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rating of payment systems for an online store" class="if uuid-2863502" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2863502.jpg"></div><p>  User verification takes place through certificates.  The simplest is an alias, does not require any client data, but is very limited in operations.  With it, unless mobile communication can be paid for without problems, and everything else requires a more meticulous identification of subsequent certificates. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For the ‚Äúinitial‚Äù account, passport data in color are required, ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù needs a certified copy of these at a notary‚Äôs and a corresponding application.  But in this case, the number and quality of operations increases significantly: you can draw up payment cards, connect customers to your web resources, cash out services, etc. </p><h2>  Service Features </h2><p>  By the way, the WebMoney service leads the domestic ratings of payment systems for online stores.  After receiving a "personal" certificate, you have the opportunity to receive money from your customers through this service.  Moreover, the whole procedure is organized extremely competently and provides the highest security of preservation of both personal data of both parties and financial resources. </p><p>  The wallet itself is also impossible to crack, especially if full protection is connected, such as Enum branded keys and cross passwords.  So WebMoney rightfully takes the first place in the rating of payment systems in Russia. </p><p>  But the service also has its drawbacks, which users often complain in their reviews.  One of these is not the friendliest interface.  It is quite difficult for a newcomer to deal with him, especially if he ‚Äúmoved‚Äù from the services described below.  In addition, the identification procedure is complicated, a bit confusing, and it costs a lot of money.  Notary services alone will result in a round sum.  In all other respects, it is a reliable, time-tested and well-functioning payment system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  "Yandex money" </h2><p>  Many people call Yandex.Money a national payment system.  In principle, the way it is.  The service was made by Russians, for Russians and is used mostly by Russian-speaking users.  The system appeared much later than WebMoney, but immediately found its fans.  Moreover, there is a reason to love her. </p><div class="photo" data-original="credissimo.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rating of payment systems in Russia" class="if uuid-2863499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2863499.jpg"></div><p>  If you try to switch from WebMoney to Yandex Money, then the functionality of the latter service will seem simple, understandable and as friendly as possible.  Instead of a local client, a web interface is used here, where everything is competently categorized and no tedious searches, as well as learning instructions, are threatened.  The system is protected from scammers no worse than WebMoney, but nevertheless, there are slightly more precedents for hacking accounts at Yandex Money. </p><p>  Judging by user reviews, the service is perfectly adapted to Russian realities.  Here you will find literally everything you need: paying fines in the traffic police, utilities, paying off loans, contributions to municipal organizations and much more. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the service </h2><p>  Also, the payment system works with a large number of domestic online stores, where directly from the web interface you can familiarize yourself with current discounts, promotions and immediately participate in them. </p><p>  Users in their reviews note that Yandex.Money is quite easily ‚Äúscrewed‚Äù to commercial web resources and allows you to accept payment from customers.  But this requires identification.  The latter is organized much easier than WebMoney.  Here you can go on a difficult or simple path.  In the first case, certified copies of the passport at the notary and sending documents by mail are required. </p><p>  In the second case, it is enough to come with a passport to one of the Euroset branches and submit an appropriate application with a certain amount of money (about 100 rubles).  And in a few hours your account will be identified.  The restrictions are already removed from him and you can get yourself a plastic card and make full use of the service. </p><h2>  "Kiwi" </h2><p>  Qiwi is one of the oldest and most trusted payment systems.  Judging by user reviews, it is mostly used by beginners.  The service, like Yandex.Money, does not have a local client, you need to manage it through the web interface. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.yukle.mobi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rating of electronic payment systems" class="if uuid-2863501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2863501.jpg"></div><p>  The latter is simple, understandable and should not cause serious problems with development.  The service reliably protects the user's data and finances from hacking, but still the percentage of illegal seizure of accounts is slightly higher than the similar indicators of Yandex.Money and WebMoney. </p><p>  Users in their reviews also note that the system is very synergistic with commercial resources and without any problems allows you to set up payment acceptance or payment on your website.  Unlike the two previous services, there is no identification as such. </p><p>  For normal operation, that is, with bank cards and ordinary payments, you do not even need to send copies of your passport.  It is enough to enter data in a special field.  But for more serious operations (large amounts, connecting an online store, etc.) meticulous identification is still needed. </p><h2>  The best foreign services </h2><p>  If for some reason you do not want to trust your financial resources to domestic payment systems, then you can look in the direction of foreign services. </p><p>  The rating of foreign payment systems is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Paypal </li><li>  ePayments. </li><li>  Payeer </li></ol><p>  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><h2>  Paypal </h2><p>  This is the most popular service in the world, leading the international ratings of payment systems.  Papel is headquartered in San Jose, California, USA.  In our country, the service began to be actively used since 2011. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.justcryptocurrencies.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rating of payment systems of the world" class="if uuid-2863500" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2863500.jpg"></div><p>  The payment system allows you to create a wallet in any currency, so there are no problems with settlements in our territory.  Alas, full-fledged plastic cards for residents of the Russian Federation are not provided, but only prepaid (Prepaid).  The service reliably protects your data and funds from hacking through step-by-step authentication. </p><p>  Judging by user reviews, PayPel is perfect for those who work closely with Ebay.  With it, the service has excellent synergy and all the functionality of the latter works perfectly in tandem with the payment system.  There are also no special problems with the withdrawal of funds, but there are much more conventions for such operations than domestic services. </p><h2>  ePayments </h2><p>  This payment system is also widely known in the world, but inferior in popularity to Peypel.  Nevertheless, in Russia, the service is quite actively used.  Unlike the leader of the rating, you can draw a plastic card here, which greatly facilitates the process of cash withdrawal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cryptoanteg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="national payment system" class="if uuid-2863503" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2863503.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the service allows you to withdraw funds from the account to Russian payment systems - WebMoney, Yandex.Money and Qiwi, which can also be called a clear plus.  The ePayments interface is noticeably simpler than Peypel‚Äôs, so even a novice can easily deal with it. </p><p>  Users in their reviews note that the service will be a great help for those whose Internet business is not limited to the Russian contingent.  Here you can also ‚Äúfasten‚Äù the payment system to your site without any problems.  Your passport data and mobile phone number are sufficient for identification. </p><h2>  Payeer </h2><p>  Another foreign payment system that enjoys enviable popularity in European countries, as well as in Russia.  One of the main features of the service is anonymity.  Therefore, the payment system is most often used as a tool for the transit of money, rather than for other purposes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.rich-and-free.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="card payment systems" class="if uuid-2863505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2863505.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by user reviews, even as the first wallet, the service showed itself very well.  All data and financial flows are reliably protected and hidden from prying eyes, but for greater peace of mind, many advanced users recommend setting up a business account. </p><p>  To do this, just fill in the appropriate fields where you need to indicate your personal data (passport, rights, medical insurance, etc.), as well as pay the specified amount.  It depends on current and estimated costs. </p><p>  Users note that the service interface cannot be called complicated or confusing, so there should be no problems with the development of the functionality.  Especially on the official website of the payment system there is a detailed video instruction with Russian subtitles. </p>
