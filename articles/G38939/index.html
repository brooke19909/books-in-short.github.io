  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Legendary do-it-yourself flowers from corrugated paper</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Corrugated paper with its light and compressed structure surprisingly resembles a delicate flower petal.  Therefore, it is convenient to make flowers from it in which it is necessary to convey tenderness, imitate the grace and curvature of inflorescences.  If you try, the <span>flowers from corrugated paper</span> are amazingly similar to real ones. </p><p>  To make our crafts more beautiful, you need to know the history of each flower and the myths associated with it before starting work.  We begin the story of how to make flowers from corrugated paper, with a wonderful and magnificent peony.  One of the Greek myths tells of a student of the legendary healer Asclepius, named Peon.  Hades, the god of the underworld, was seriously wounded by Hercules, and Peon was able to cure him.  In gratitude, Hades turned the young man into a lush flower. </p><p>  To make a peony, you need pink and yellow corrugated paper, PVA glue, scissors, <span>copper wire,</span> cardboard and compasses.  We cut the pink corrugated paper into 3 strips 2.5 x 3.5 cm in size, and from the yellow we cut a piece for the stamens - 7.5 x 2.5 cm. We cut three strips into 9 small rectangles - a total of 27 corrugated paper rectangles.  Each such rectangle is folded in half along the corrugation line, carefully forming the petals, compressing the fold line and straightening the edges.  Using cardboard with a compass and scissors, we cut a circle with a diameter of 7.5 cm. Glue the first petal to the edge of the cardboard circle.  We glue each subsequent petal so that it slightly overlaps the previous one and is closer to the center of the circle - that is, we glue not in a circle, but in a spiral. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Do not stop reaching the level of the first petal, but continue to glue the second layer.  After gluing it, cut off 0.5 cm from the remaining petals and glue them with the third layer, also in a spiral.  We make stamens: we fold the yellow paper in half across the corrugation, finely chop the ends, forming a fringe, thread or glue, fix the stamens into a not very tight roll and attach in the middle of the flower.  <span>Flowers from corrugated paper</span> will turn out very stylish, if you take care of the stem.  To do this, you need to attach leaves cut from solid green paper to a wire wrapped in green paper. </p><p>  <span>Magnolia flowers are</span> just wonderful.  They say that the magnolia tree is the ancestor of all now flowering trees.  It arose more than 20 million years ago.  How to make flowers from corrugated paper so that they fully convey the elegance and fragility of magnolia?  To do this, you need soft pink corrugated paper, glue, scissors, wire, tape, cardboard.  First, we cut out 2 stencils in the shape of an ellipse from cardboard - large and small.  Using a stencil of corrugated paper, we cut 4 large and 4 small petals along the corrugation line.  We form the petals: slightly twist both edges of the ellipse, and straighten the middle.  We fill the upper end of the ellipse inward.  We form balls from the tape so that it does not unwind, you can use glue.  To this "inflorescence" we glue small petals, then large ones.  We straighten the petals so that the flowers from the corrugated paper look like they were just ripped off. </p><p>  The birthplace of a tulip is Iran.  In ancient Persia, this flower was called "tulipan" - after the headdress in the form of a turban.  And in England they believe that fairies or elves live in the cups of a tulip.  Corrugated paper flowers imitating tulips are made very simply.  For this, 6 strips of paper of any color 2.5 √ó 17 cm in size should be cut along the corrugation line. Each stripe should be folded in half, squeezed and twisted the base, and straighten the edges of both layers of paper to form petals.  Paste the wire for the stem with green paper.  Place 3 petals around the stem, and then 3 outer so as to close the holes.  Form a bud.  To keep the petals on the stem, secure them with a tape dipped in glue.  From thick green paper, make leaves, attach them to the stem and twist them slightly, like natural tulip leaves. </p>
