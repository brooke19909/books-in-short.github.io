  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Speakers for subwoofer. Selection principle</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Car audio has become an incredibly popular topic of discussion.  It is far from enough to have a good sound at home, more and more I want to feel the fullness of sounds in the car.  Let's try to figure out such an element of most systems as a subwoofer.  Why is it needed, is it needed at all, and which one to choose.  And this is not the whole list of issues that directly affect the quality of music playback in your car. </p><p>  Let's get started.  Why give extra trunk space to the ‚Äúbarrel‚Äù to play <span>low frequencies?</span>  The question does not really have a definite answer.  Many people feel the ‚Äúfreshness‚Äù of the sound of regular acoustics and successfully <span>compensate for this with the</span> purchase of an inexpensive subwoofer, while others find an alternative and buy ‚Äúpunch‚Äù, which in turn saturate the sound well.  The main question is what kind of music do you prefer to listen to.  If you like classical music, then the subwoofer in your car will become just a useless box or barrel, which simply takes up extra space.  To listen to such music does not require the selection of alternatives, but the replacement of all acoustics with high-end speakers.  This is the only way to achieve transparency in playback.  If you prefer modern music, and in absolutely different directions, then here, of course, you can‚Äôt do without a ‚Äúbarrel‚Äù.  You can argue as much as you like, but only one ride in a car with a subwoofer is enough, after which the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsound in the car interior will change forever. </p><p>  Contrary to most misconceptions, the ‚Äúgood‚Äù subwoofer is not the one from the sound of which the glass shakes and pedestrians shy.  The speaker and its sound are almost inaudible.  They are felt.  And no other way.  The subwoofer creates a ‚Äúwarm‚Äù environment with its dense bass, plus noticeable vibrations.  It seems a trifle, but the sensations are indescribable. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>High-quality acoustics</span> and the accuracy of its settings are quite simple to distinguish from fakes.  Focusing only on the sound of the speakers with the subwoofer, the source of the sound itself cannot be determined.  Well, or extremely difficult.  A subwoofer with two speakers is generally a miracle of technological progress.  The waves diverge in such a dense stream that if you mistreated such equipment, you can bring a person to incredibly severe nausea.  Not jokes, in a word. </p><p>  Absolutely at all developed auto forums, they are actively discussing the issue of self-made ‚Äúsubs‚Äù.  Notice the subwoofer is not just a barrel or box with a woofer.  And the fact that the speakers for the subwoofer are on sale does not in any way guarantee you good sound quality.  It just looks simple.  Of fundamental importance is the shape and volume of the housing.  In order not to delve into the intricacies of manufacturing, you can only take out a common denominator from all the tips on the forums. </p><p>  Most often, ‚Äúbox‚Äù cases are placed in cars, and under a powerful speaker, you need to choose a case with a volume of at least 30 liters.  The box is the most convenient, since it can easily be placed in the trunk.  It is much more compact than ‚Äúbarrels‚Äù of the same volume.  The speakers for the subwoofer can be divided not only by diameter and power, but also by resistance.  Selection directly depends on your amplifier.  Mismatch is not permissible.  The best quality today is shown by American manufacturers.  One of them is the legendary MTX brand, which produces speakers for the subwoofer.  Of the popular and affordable "Americans" it is worth highlighting Soundstream with an estimated cost of $ 100. </p><p>  Should I put <span>a subwoofer</span> with two speakers <span>in the car</span> ?  Theoretically, you can at least two ‚Äúsub‚Äù with dual speakers.  Just why?  Do not chase power.  Many watts will not bring you much pleasure.  The volume of the car interior is small, respectively, and super-powerful speakers for the subwoofer are not really needed.  But this is a personal matter for everyone. </p>
