A synthesizer is a great solution for small apartments.  It will not take up much space and will allow you to escape from pressing problems at any time.  Parents often acquire such an instrument so that their child in parallel with the main school also studies in music, and it is also perfect for self-development.  Synthesizers differ in the number of keys, sound, and additional options.  The article will describe the model of professional synthesizers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thomann.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="professional yamaha synthesizer" class="if uuid-2788588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2788588.jpg"></div><h2>  Which company to prefer? </h2><p>  If you do not want to devote much time to selecting a company, then you can pay attention to the top five.  We are talking about Casio, Akai, Korg, Yamaha, Medeli.  Models of these manufacturers differ in sound, as well as their additional functions, which is why before buying a certain one you need to not only pay attention to the characteristics, but also read reviews. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Synthesizer from China" class="if uuid-2788601" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2788601.jpg"></div><h2>  Synthesizer operation </h2><p>  Thanks to a professional synthesizer, you can play at home, in a cafe or at any events without much difficulty.  More serious models are most often acquired either by specialists or those who already have some skills and want to work hard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The dimensions of this device make it easy to carry and transport the device.  It fits quietly in the back seat.  Can be placed not only on a small stage, but also in a small room.  There is an audio output that allows you to connect to the sound amplifier, making the volume comfortable for the audience. </p><p>  Synthesizers differ in sound.  You can play the keyboard, but the sound will be like a guitar or drums.  The equipment will allow you to mix notes, turn on background sounds, and so on.  Due to this, anyone can learn complex compositions in the shortest possible time.  On an ordinary piano, such results can be achieved only after a few months (sometimes years) of training. </p><p>  Devices work incredibly simple.  When a key is pressed, a short circuit occurs, a signal is sent.  The latter processes the central processor, which will allow you to get a sound wave at the output.
