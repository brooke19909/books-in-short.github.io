Tarragona and its attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The city of Tarragona (Spain) is an old Catalan cultural center located in the north-east of the country.  Its ancient and medieval monuments, wonderful beaches of the Costa Daurada with crystal clear water and lively shopping areas attract tourists from all over the world.  The city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as it has long played a huge role in the trade and infrastructure of the Roman Empire, which included Spain.  Tarragona and its attractions are, first of all, huge antique ruins, as well as medieval architecture, which is a unique mixture of Arabic, Romanesque and Gothic art. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tarragona city spain" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/273866.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <p>  In ancient times, the city was the center of the Roman province of the same name.  In the Middle Ages, it was owned by King Jaime the First, who went from here to conquer Majorca.  In later times, the proximity to the sea, which used to be a blessing, turned into a curse: pirates plundered all coastal cities and towns.  But in the twentieth century, everything changed.  Tourism began to flourish, which Spain took advantage of.  Tarragona, with its golden beaches and antiquities, has become extremely fashionable among holidaymakers.  Among the <span>archaeological sites that</span> are examined in the first place, one can name the Forum, the tower of Scipio with two gates, as well as an amphitheater.  All these buildings have been preserved so well in their complex that they can be a kind of example of how the Romans built and planned their capital cities.  Arenas of the amphitheater are marked with a very interesting sign.  In memory of the Christians killed there, a special stele has been set up, which speaks of <span>freedom of conscience</span> and human rights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tarragona Spain" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/273873.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The locals like to repeat that Catalonia is not Spain.  Tarragona may illustrate this saying.  Unlike the baroque Spanish temples with their love for embellishing suffering, the Cathedral of the city is a strict art of Romanesque times with a Gothic touch of stained glass.  Admirable and carved altar of St. Thecla, made in the fifteenth century.  The tourist information center is located on the ground floor of the medieval town hall, and the city council itself is located on the site of the former monastery.  In his courtyard is also the mausoleum of King Jaime, which is proud of all of Spain.  Tarragona has also opened to visitors many museums of both ancient and contemporary art. </p>

They can be wide sandy and narrow pebble, spread not far from ancient ruins and hide among the rocks and cliffs covered with evergreen pine trees.  Some are easily accessible by bus, while others require a walk through the picturesque forest.  Well, after exploring antiquities and bathing, you can see more modern streets - the Rambla Nova, for example, or the Mediterranean Balcony - the square from which the whole city and the ruins of the amphitheater are visible.  Like all of Spain, Tarragona, whose map you will need in order not to miss the most famous monuments, also marks the days of national culture.  It happens in the fall.  If you get here at this particular time, then consider yourself lucky.  Foreigners (if they show a passport) are allowed to explore all the architectural and archaeological sites for free.
