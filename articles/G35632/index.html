    <h2>  The origin of the noblewoman Morozova </h2><p>  Theodosia Prokopyevna was born on May 21, 1632 in Moscow, her father - Sokovnin Prokopiy Fedorovich - was a deceased, was in kinship with the first wife of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich, Maria Ilyinichna.  The future noblewoman was one of the courtiers who accompanied the queen.  At 17, Feodosia married Gleb Ivanovich Morozov.  The husband was a representative of a noble family, was in kinship with the Romanov family, near Moscow had a magnificent estate Zyuzino, was the uncle of the prince and served as the royal sleeping bag.  Gleb‚Äôs brother, Boris Ivanovich, was very rich.  He died in 1662, and since he never got offspring, everything passed on to his closest relative. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The wealth and influence of the noblewoman </h2><p>  After the death of Gleb Ivanovich, the state of both brothers passes to the young Ivan Glebovich, the son of Gleb and Theodosius, and his mother becomes the actual manager of wealth.  The life story of the noblewoman Morozova is very interesting, because this woman had her own views on life.  Theodosia Prokopyevna took the place of the horse noblewoman, had great influence, was close to the king.  Her wealth could only be envied: the noblewoman had several estates, but she settled in the village of Zyuzino, where she equipped her house according to the Western model.  At that time it was the most luxurious estate. </p><p>  Boyar Morozova disposed of eight (!) Thousands of <span>serfs;</span> only about 300 servants lived in her house.  Theodosius had a chic carriage decorated with silver and mosaic, she often took walks, harnessing six or even twelve horses with rattling chains to her carriage.  During the trips, the noblewoman was accompanied by about 100 slaves and slaves, protecting her from attacks.  At that time, Morozova was considered almost the richest man in Moscow. </p><h2>  Believer </h2><p>  Boyar Morozova was an ardent supporter of the old faith.  She always favored the poor and holy fools, and gave them alms.  In addition, adherents of the Old Believers often gathered in her house to pray according to the Old Russian canons of <span>Old Believer icons.</span>  The woman closely communicated with Archpriest Avvakum, an apologist for the old faith, did not accept the reforms of <span>Patriarch Nikon.</span> </p><p>  She wore a hair shirt in order to "pacify the flesh."  But all the same, Avvakum was dissatisfied with Morozova, urging her to gouge out her eyes, as Mastridia did, in order to protect herself from the temptations of love.  Also, the protopop reproached the noblewoman for minor alms, because with her condition she could have benefited a much larger number of those in need.  In addition, Theodosius, although she was faithful to the old faith, attended a new rite church, which caused distrust of the Old Believers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Morozova's disobedience </h2><p>  The king knew about the beliefs of the horse noblewoman, and he did not like this behavior at all.  Theodosius avoided church and social events in every possible way; she did not even attend the wedding of Alexei Mikhailovich, saying that she was very ill.  The tsar tried in every possible way to influence the obstinate lord, sent her relatives to her so that they should think over the woman and convince them to accept the new faith, but everything was in vain: Morozova stood her ground.  Few knew what the name of the noblewoman Morozova was after the tonsure of the Old Believers.  The woman secretly received him and received a new name - Theodora, proving to her entourage that she remained faithful to the old faith. </p><p>  Tsarina Maria Ilyinichna for a long time restrained the king‚Äôs anger, and the high position of the noblewoman did not allow her to be punished so easily, but Aleksei Mikhailovich‚Äôs patience was coming to an end.  On the evening of November 16, 1671, Archimandrite Joachim came to Morozova with the duma clerk Hilarion.  In the house was the sister of the noblewoman Princess Urusova.  To show their disrespectful attitude towards the guests, Theodosius and Evdokia went to bed and lying down answered the questions of those who came.  After the interrogation, the women were shackled, leaving under house arrest.  Two days later, Morozova was first transported to Miracles, and then to the Pskov-Pechersky Monastery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="noblewoman morozova picture description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/354927.jpg?1395154893333" width="421"></div>

Morozova was carefully guarded, but nevertheless she received clothes and food from people sympathetic to her, Archpriest Avvakum wrote letters to her, and one of the priests of the old faith communed the unfortunate woman. </p><h2>  The punishment of the king </h2><p>  Boyar Morozova, Princess Urusova and Maria Danilova (wife of the Streltsy Colonel) at the end of 1674 were transferred to the Yamsky courtyard.  They tried to persuade women to persuade them to accept the new faith and abandon their beliefs, but they were unshakable.  They were about to be burned at the stake, but Tsarevna Irina Mikhailovna, sister of the tsar and patroness of the boyars, prevented such blasphemy.  Alexei Mikhailovich ordered the sisters Evdokia and Theodosius to be exiled to the Pafnutievo-Borovsky monastery and imprisoned in an earthen prison. </p>

    <h2>  The death of the noblewoman </h2><p>  In June 1675, 14 servants of the noblewoman, who supported the old faith, were burned in a log house.  On September 11, 1675, Princess Urusova died of hunger, and Morozova also foresaw her imminent demise.  Shortly before her death, she asked the guards to wash their shirts in the river to die in clean clothes.  Theodosius died of complete exhaustion on November 2, 1675. </p><h2>  Theme of Surikov‚Äôs painting </h2><p>  In 1887, after the 15th traveling exhibition for the Tretyakov Gallery, the work of the brilliant artist ‚ÄúBoyarynya Morozova‚Äù was bought for 25 thousand rubles.  Surikov's painting is a canvas measuring 304x587.5 cm, it is painted in oil.  Today it is one of the largest exhibits in the gallery.  Picture </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="author of the Frost Lady" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/354926.jpg?1395211483931" width="293"></div>  from afar, it attracts the attention of spectators, fascinates with the brightness of colors, the lively power of images and spatiality.  Vasily Ivanovich based on the theme of the <span>church schism of the</span> 17th century.  The painter wanted to show the hard life and deep faith of the Russian people.  He managed to convey the whole tragedy of the situation: the main character is humiliated, trampled, but not broken ,;  Morozova is doomed to death, but nevertheless appears in a victorious image.

    <h2>  Surikov's interest in the fate of the boyar </h2><p>  The biography of the noblewoman Morozova interested Vasily Ivanovich for the reason that he himself was from Siberia, and this region was famous for a huge number of Old Believers.  Siberians had a positive attitude towards the old faith, because in this region the manuscript "lives" that belonged to the Old Believer martyrs who suffered from the hands of representatives of the new faith were widespread.  According to some reports, his godmother introduced Surikov to the "Tale of Boyar Morozova".  Apparently, the artist was impressed by the willpower of the noblewoman, so he decided to resurrect her memory by depicting on an enormous canvas an episode where Morozova was taken to prison. </p><h2>  Images of the main characters of the picture </h2><p>  When looking at the canvas, the central character, the noblewoman Morozova, catches the eye first.  The description of the picture suggests that the artist for a long time determined with portrait sketches, he painted them separately, and then put them together.  Protopop Avvakum described Theodosius as a thin woman with a running, lightning-fast look, and Surikov for a long time could not find such a face - fanatical, bloodless, tormented, but proud and adamant.  In the end, he sketched Morozov from the Old Believers, which met Vasily Ivanovich near the <span>Rogozhsky cemetery.</span> </p><p>  The Moscow poor man who sells cucumbers became the prototype of the holy fool, but the image of the wanderer is the author himself.  ‚ÄúBoyar Morozov‚Äù is a picture saturated with ‚Äúcolor symphonies‚Äù.  Surikov attached great importance to shades, made it so that they seemed natural.  The artist watched the snow for a long time, catching all its overflows, watched how cold air affects the complexion.  That is why his characters seem alive.  To give the picture a sense of movement, Surikov drew a running boy to the sleigh. </p>

    <h2>  Assessment of the artist </h2><p>  The history of the painting ‚ÄúBoyar Morozov‚Äù is very unusual, if only because this work caused controversial assessments and high-profile debates from critics during a traveling exhibition.  Someone like <span>Surikov‚Äôs work,</span> others don‚Äôt, but everyone agreed that he was a success.  Some critics compared the canvas with a motley <span>Persian rug,</span> because bright colors still rippled in the eyes, academics discussed various flaws in the picture, such as incorrect positions of the hands, etc. But still, the most famous and inflexible critics when studying the drawing in detail should have to admit is truly a masterpiece. </p><p>  Before Vasily Surikov, none of the painters so vividly and impartially depicted people of the pre-Petrine era.  In the center of the canvas there is a pale woman, exhausted by mental torment, starving from a long post, around her are awkward, rude people in fur coats, turlos, and quilted jackets.  The crowd was divided into two parts, one sympathizing with the noblewoman, the other mocking her misfortune.  Surikov managed to revive his characters.  The viewer, standing near the canvas, feels in this crowd and, as it were, is transported in time several centuries ago. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the history of the painting" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/354923.jpg?1395211497683" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Vasily Ivanovich realistically depicted an event that took place in the history of Russia.  His work prompted people not only to learn about the fate of the noblewoman Morozova, but also to think about her act.  Someone perceives her as a fanatic, someone admires her adherence and fidelity to principles.  During the appearance of the picture, people compared the heroine with the Narodniks and Stenka Razin.  It only speaks of the fact that there are "nobles of Morozov" in every era, there will always be people who are faithful to their beliefs. </p>
