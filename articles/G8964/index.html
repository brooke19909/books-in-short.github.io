  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Nokia X6": specifications, instructions, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Living in the modern world, it is difficult to imagine yourself without such a trite thing now as a mobile phone.  We need him for work, study, communication with loved ones, and just for relaxation.  Who, for example, does not like to sit on social networks?  What phone to choose in order to keep up with progress?  After all, everyone has different tastes.  Let's try to figure out one of the Nokia gadgets. </p><h2>  The appearance of the phone </h2><p>  <span>"Nokia X6"</span> resembles a thin rectangular block.  He fits well in his hand and leaves the impression of an expensive toy.  The main material X6 is made of is plastic.  This is actually not bad at all.  The manufacturer claimed metal inserts.  Yes, they are also present.  Side strips are made of metal. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia x6" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12457/1036732.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The main problem of all without exception touch devices is the easily soiled front panel.  In the smartphone of our review, she, alas, is the same.  But here the back surface pleases.  It is made of soft velvety plastic, very pleasant to the touch. <br>  The manufacturer released this device in two color options: white and black.  The dimensions of the smartphone remained almost the same as those of the <span>Nokia 5800,</span> except that the thickness slightly decreased.  But it is almost not felt.  The dimensions of the Nokia X6 are 111.2 x 51.05 x 14.3, the weight of the device is 124 grams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The display at X6 is covered with a <span>protective glass.</span>  It does not muffle colors and reliably protects the screen.  In fact, this is not glass, but a composite material - plastic.  Scratches may appear on this layer, but they rarely occur.  Due to a small gap under the screen, dust accumulates, which can be very unnerving.  Cleaning is possible only in the service center, otherwise it is impossible to get rid of contaminants. </p>

    <p>  Directly, the Nokia TFT-screen has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã3.2 inches, the standard palette is 16 million colors.  Below the display are the call / end buttons and the Menu key.  At first glance, it may not seem very convenient that they are all located on the same site, but in reality everything is simple - clicking on each of the buttons gets a quick response.  It is very good that they are mechanical, not sensory, which is quite problematic to use.  There is a ‚ÄúNokia X6‚Äù and a shortcut key.  It is sensory and is located above the display. </p><h2>  X6 cameras </h2><p>  Under the screen you can see the ‚Äúeye‚Äù of the VGA-camera.  The smartphone uses a five megapixel camera.  The optics installed here are Carl Zeiss.  Same as in N97.  The only difference is the lack of a curtain that scratches the lens eye.  The camera has a two-section LED flash that works great at a distance of up to 2 meters.  The application starts quickly enough - in just 4 seconds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The image size can be put at your discretion: 5, 2 or 0.3 megapixels.  The photos taken with the help of Nokia X6 are pretty good in quality. </p><h2>  Camera specifications </h2><p>  The camera lens has the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  optics from Carl Zeiss; </li><li>  focal length - 10 cm; </li><li>  focusing - 5.45 mm; </li><li>  macro shooting - from 10 to 50 cm; </li><li>  twentyfold digital zoom capability; </li><li>  the choice of various scenes: auto, portrait, night mode, landscape, sports and others; </li><li>  the ability to disable geotagging (then the coordinates of the place where it was taken will not be added to the photo). </li></ul><h2>  Case "Nokia X6" </h2><p>  All inserts and panels here are pretty well fitted, due to this, nothing creaks and does not play anywhere.  The SIM card slot is on the left, it is covered with a plug.  We can assume that this is a slot for a memory card, but it is not here.  The internal memory of the device is 32 GB.  The SIM card can even be pulled out of a working phone, but then you need tweezers.  If everything is done according to the rules, then first they pull out the battery, and then, pulling the lever, the SIM card itself.  It is difficult to say why manufacturers used this design, because it is inconvenient. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="repair nokia x6" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12457/1036729.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  On the side of the case (right) is a paired volume control button, a camera button and a screen lock slider.  The latter is recessed directly into the smartphone case, which makes it more reliable, since it eliminates the possibility of jamming.  There is nothing more on the sides of the Nokia X6.  But on top is the plug of the micro USB connector, a dedicated power key, an opening for the RAM and a headphone jack.  They are here without a doubt deserving of praise.  Included with the smartphone comes the highest quality Nokia headphones - WH-500.  Their separate cost is 5000 rubles.  In addition, the kit comes with an annual subscription to download without any restrictions on licensed tunes from the Ovi music store.  The speakers, taken up by a metal mesh, are located on the left side of the X6.  They are very loud and of good quality. </p><p>  It is the headphones, coupled with a <span>capacitive screen, that</span> explain the overpriced price of the X6.  Manufacturers decided to make this unit musical and equip it in full.  Therefore, the user who bought the X6 gets the maximum opportunity, albeit for a considerable amount of money. </p><h2>  X6 specifications </h2><p>  The smartphone "Nokia X6" has the following characteristics: </p><ul><li>  year of manufacture - 2009; </li><li>  OS - Symbian OS 9.4 S60 5th Edition; </li><li>  processor - ARM 11 434 MHz; </li><li>  memory - 32 GB of ROM and 128 MB of RAM; </li><li>  battery capacity - 1320 mAh; </li><li>  camera resolution - 5.0 megapixels; </li><li>  VGA camera resolution - 0.3 MP; </li><li>  GPS </li></ul><p>  The Nokia X6 smartphone has pretty good specifications.  Note that the gadget is equipped with standard functions: an audio player, voice recorder, video player, voice dialing, GPRS data transfer system with class 32 version. Transfer rate - 3.6 Mbps. </p>

    <p>  There is no radio in X6.  For the device, which is positioned as a musical flagship, this is a big minus.  But then the audio player can be used with an unlimited number of user settings.  For this, an eight-band equalizer is provided.  Thanks to the settings, you can choose the sound that suits you best.  You can play music both through the phone and through Home Media (home network). </p><p>  According to the manufacturers, the battery supplied with the X6 can last up to 11 hours, in standby mode - over 420, with the player working - up to 35, in video recording mode - over 200, and when playing videos - up to 4 hours. </p><p>  Despite all the shortcomings, the device has clearly more advantages, so we can safely say that the Nokia X6 phone is worth buying. </p><h2>  Scope of delivery </h2><p>  The Nokia X6 smartphone comes with the following kit: </p><ul><li>  smartphone itself; </li><li>  rechargeable battery brand BL-5J; </li><li>  USB cable </li><li>  mains charger; </li><li>  wired headphones (WH-500); </li><li>  to the smartphone "Nokia X6" instruction in Russian; </li><li>  mini DVD. </li></ul><h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  The smartphone has acquired a large number of people.  Accordingly, customer reviews were divided.  There are no problems with the quality of communication in Nokia X6, everything is fine here.  The ringer volume is quite high.  But some tunes may not play quite loudly on the device.  The vibrating alert is weak, barely felt. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia x6 phone feature" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12457/1036727.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  In terms of musical functions, the device is quite crude, we must think that the developers will certainly fix in the future firmware versions flaws and flaws.  No one can say how long it will take.  But for the buyer, who will use the smartphone for calls, and also sometimes listen to music, these problems will not seem significant.  It all depends on how the device will be operated.  Chopping nuts is an optional activity, because repairing the Nokia X6 is quite expensive. </p><p>  The phone is perfect for both people engaged in business and for young people who appreciate good and high-quality devices.  Thus, you should definitely buy a Nokia x6 phone.  The characteristic of this gadget pleases modern users.  Have a nice shopping! </p>
