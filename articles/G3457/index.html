Colmar (France), whose attractions are admired by tourists, will help you!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This inconspicuous town, demonstrating amazing architectural beauty that reflects its centuries-old history, immerses its guests in past eras.  Belonging to the province of Alsace, which is the stumbling block of France and Germany, it is famous as one of the most comfortable places in old Europe.  A real open-air museum, like a fairytale settlement, welcomes tourists all year round.  Picturesque Colmar (France), the sights of which reflect its diversity, does not at all look like a sleepy provincial town. </p><h2>  Perfect place to relax </h2><p>  The capital of the famous <span>Alsatian wines</span> is located on the banks of the Lauch River (La Lauch), in the flat part of the province.  The winding narrow streets, bright facades of buildings, a large number of canals form an unusual style of the city that causes admiration.  Incredibly harmonious Colmar with Renaissance buildings is considered the driest city in France, which contributes to the development of winemaking.  Tourists note the ideal conditions for relaxation at any time of the year: a moderately warm climate and a small amount of rainfall. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="colmar france reviews" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1795440.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Colmar (France), whose sights will appeal to even the most discerning travelers, delights in its special beauty untouched by modern civilization.  Appearing at the beginning of the VIII century, it finally became part of the country in 1918.  Voltaire also said about the city that he was "50 percent French and 50 percent German." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to see? </h2><p>  What architectural masterpieces in the open do beautiful Colmar (France) hide?  Sights created by human hands help you get to know the rich history of a town with a special atmosphere.  Thus, the colorful neighborhoods of boaters and fishermen seem to carry a tourist several centuries ago. </p><p>  Some of the pretty houses along the river were destroyed by fire during the terrible fire of 1706, but now the dwellings restored by the townspeople delight the visitors of the city with colorful facades. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Colmar city in France" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1795431.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Petite venise </h2><p>  In the south-east of Colmar is a romantic quarter, called "little Venice".  Located along the banks of the Loch River, over which a large number of bridges are built, it is very reminiscent of the historical center of Bruges.  The area in which the restored half-timbered (frame) houses, which appeared in the period from the 14th to the 18th centuries, are lined up in a row, is a real pride of the inhabitants of the city of Colmar (France). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="colmar france attractions reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1795421.jpg" width="600"></div>

Looking at the unusual structure, you can see a variety of human emotions.  The fact is that the unique architectural monument got its nickname thanks to masks and sculptures of grimacing heads that adorn the local attraction. </p><h2>  Maison pfister </h2><p>  The hallmark of a hospitable settlement is the house of Pfister, built in the 16th century.  The building made of stone and wood, bearing the name of one of its owners, delights vacationers who admire the facade decorated with ancient frescoes depicting the emperors of Germany and scenes from the Bible. </p><p>  Inside the world-famous house with a long wooden gallery, a wine shop is opened where you can taste elite types of sparkling drink. </p><h2>  Coll√©giale saint-martin </h2><p>  The colorful Colmar (France), whose sights are becoming an object of admiration for the guests, is proud of the unforgettable example of Gothic architecture - the Catholic Church of St. Martin.  The majestic religious monument, the exact date of its appearance is unknown, was often destroyed, but the inhabitants always restored the <span>medieval temple.</span>  After the last restoration work, it looks simply amazing: the portals are decorated with sculptures, the roof is covered with colorful tiles, the tower, decorated with a sundial, is eye-catching. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="colmar france photo" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1795428.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The church is famous for its excellent acoustics, and it is no coincidence that annual music festivals are held in it. </p><h2>  Bartoldi House Museum </h2><p>  The many-faced city of Colmar in France is the birthplace of the famous architect and sculptor Bartholdy, who performed the Statue of Liberty in America.  In the very center of the magnificent pearl of the country is the family nest of the creator, who created more than 35 famous monuments in different states.  The house-museum contains his personal belongings, drafts and furniture. </p><h2>  Indoor City Market </h2><p>  One cannot help but visit Colmar and visit the city market, designed by the famous architect of the province.
