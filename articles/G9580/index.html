It is clear that buying them in large quantities is unrealistic - it is quite expensive.  But having sewed one clutch with your own hands, and then again and again, you will get a whole collection for every day! </p><p>  A clutch bag is a small handbag without handles.  They are made of leather, suede, textile, yarn, etc. The decoration is also diverse - based on the style, purpose and taste of the hostess. </p><p>  It is very simple to sew a clutch with your own hands from any material that is available. </p><h2>  Tools and materials for sewing a clutch </h2><p>  This is almost everything that is in the house: old bags, jeans, pieces of leatherette, thick fabric, sealant. </p><p>  You can buy the material in any store specializing in the sale of fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sochic.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chain clutch" class="if uuid-2961993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2961993.jpg"></div><p>  Sewing threads will also be needed - it is better to take strong, synthetic with reinforcement, suitable needles and sharp scissors. </p><p>  The presence of a sewing machine is welcome, but it is not necessary - everything can be done manually. </p><p>  For leather or suede clutch bags, it is possible to use old jackets, bags, skirts, etc. In this case, you will also need a special tool - a punch or hole punch - to pierce holes in hard leather. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Accessories, fasteners, carabiners - all this is available and sold in stores. </p><h2>  How to sew a clutch with your own hands from a fabric </h2><p>  It is easy to make a very beautiful and simple handbag yourself.  A large bow looks very stylish and can be used as a pen. </p><p>  For work, prepare a piece of dense fabric - so you save on a sealant, lining fabric, zipper, matching threads, scissors. </p><p>  So, we sew a clutch with our own hands!  Patterns are better to build on paper.  We draw rectangles with the following sizes and in such quantities: </p><ul><li>  Top of bag: two with sides 16 x 23 cm. </li><li>  Bow detail: two with sides 17 by 25.5 cm. </li><li>  Jumper: one with sides 6 by 13 cm. </li><li>  Lining: two with sides 16 by 23 cm. </li></ul><p>  First, we will form a bow - for this, we will fold the part of the jumper with its face inward and stitch along the edge.  Turn it out and iron, and then fold it into a ring and sew along the edge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.polkadotchair.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sewing a clutch with a bow" class="if uuid-2962021" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2962021.jpg"></div><p>  We also lay the two details of the bow on top of each other with the inside out and sew them along the long sides.  We twist, straighten and iron.  The resulting rectangle is pushed into the ring - jumper. </p><p>  Now we attach it to the main part of the top and sew the edges of the bow to the side cuts. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Take a zipper and sweep it to the top of both parts.  Using the zipper foot, lock it in place. </p><p>  Next we sew a lining.  To do this, it is necessary to stitch the two parts together, folding them with their faces inward.  We attach it from above, with secret stitches, sweeping in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe "lightning", but leaving a small hole. </p><p>  Now sew the remaining sides of the external parts and turn the product straight.  Sew the left hole with invisible stitches. </p><h2>  Clutch from an old bag </h2><p>  Very often things on the shelves of our cabinets gather dust, seemingly unnecessary, but the hand does not rise to throw them away.  It is these things that can easily be turned into a necessary accessory that will last a very long time.  Here is such a do-it-yourself clutch bag - photo below - you can sew from old bags. </p><p>  First, spacing each seam.  Lay out and sort all individual parts.  Do not take worn and damaged parts - they will only ruin the look of the finished thing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kreadivmisfitlife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stylish clutch" class="if uuid-2961994" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2961994.jpg"></div><p>  The lining, depending on its condition, may come in handy for a new bag. </p><p>  Since for the very first time, everything seems more complicated than it actually is, the pattern will be simple - with the front, back and valve. </p><p>  Take the old bag and cut out the "parts".  Do the same with the lining. </p><p>  Now all the details (top and lining) are folded inside out, and are sewn down at the bottom and sides.  The lining is carefully inserted inside, a "zipper" is sewn or a magnetic fastener is attached. </p><p>  It turns out clearly, the seams are tapped with a hammer. </p><p>  The new stylish bag is ready! </p><h2>  DIY leather clutch </h2><p>  Sewing a leather envelope is an easy task.  The advantage of this material is that it does not require compaction.  The skin has excellent shape retention properties.  Also, this material does not require fastening, fasteners are not required - only the successful selection of a pattern is important. </p><p>  Sewing such a clutch with your own hands is simple.  The work is similar to the above, but there are still more pluses - no time is spent on ‚Äúdismantling‚Äù, there are no defects on the material.  The pattern is almost the same, only the shape of the valve is changed. </p><p>  We need the following materials for work: </p><ul><li>  Leather, suede or dermantine. </li><li>  A sharp knife, scissors. </li><li>  Accessories (half ring, snap hook, magnetic clasp). </li><li>  Rulers, pencils. </li><li>  Strong synthetic threads. </li><li>  Punchers, awl. </li></ul><p>  Gently spread the skin flap upside down.  The pattern is simple, therefore, we will build it in place.  If you doubt your skills, first draw it on paper, and then transfer it to the material. </p><p>  For example, the sides of the handbag should be equal to 15 cm and 25 cm. Then we draw a rectangle for the pattern with sides 25 and 30 cm. Immediately finish building the valve - choose the size of your choice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ccdbb.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="leather clutch pattern" class="if uuid-2962038" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2962038.jpg"></div><p data-hc-id="cdbb9c222a7671ae4e4826e10040">  Next, proceed to sewing.  Measure 15 cm and fold the part along this mark, face inward.  Using an awl or punch, punch holes around the entire perimeter, retreating from the edge by 2-3 mm.  The distance between them should be the same - in them we will lay a seam. </p><p data-hc-id="cdbb9c222a7671ae4e4826e10040">  Now we take a needle with thread and stitches, sew the entire perimeter, get to the end and turn back.  Thus, we get a double line imitating a machine one. </p><p data-hc-id="cdbb9c222a7671ae4e4826e10040">  At the end of this process, we cut out two narrow strips - a strap and a holder for a half ring.  We pass a short strip into the fittings, bend in half and fix it where it suits you.  We insert a long belt into the half-ring and fix its ends together - in the form of a ring. </p><p data-hc-id="cdbb9c222a7671ae4e4826e10040">  Almost done!  It remains to attach a magnet or Velcro.  Although it is quite possible to do without it, since the valve is heavy and closes reliably. </p><p data-hc-id="cdbb9c222a7671ae4e4826e10040">  So, without making much effort, you and I created a wonderful and stylish handbag! </p><h2 data-hc-id="cdbb9c222a7671ae4e4826e10040">  Clutch bag </h2><p>  Sometimes a small handbag is simply necessary, but you don‚Äôt want to spend money on it!  You can go for a little trick and do everything yourself in a very short time! </p><p>  Tools and materials we need: </p><ul><li>  A small plastic folder - it can be purchased at the stationery store. </li><li>  Material for pasting the surface - it does not matter, leather or fabric - to your taste. </li><li>  PVA glue. </li><li>  Fine sandpaper. </li><li>  Brush </li><li>  Decor in the form of beads, rhinestones, sparkles. </li></ul><p>  The fabric sticks very poorly to a smooth surface, so we pre-sanded daddy with a sandpaper.  Now take a brush and glue the folder on one side with glue.  Glue the material so that around the edges there are allowances for seams of about 1 cm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="folder clutch" class="if uuid-2962013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2962013.jpg"></div><p>  Having worked one side, go to the second.  Also glue matter, avoiding the formation of wrinkles, air bubbles and other defects. </p><p>  Oversize also glue and wrap inside the folder. </p><p>  It remains to decorate the resulting clutch and that's it - you can demonstrate it to others! </p><h2>  Clutch decoration </h2><p>  For everyday use, bright shiny things are undesirable, it is tasteless!  But for an evening out, such an accessory is a must! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fashiondivadesign.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decor shawl stave" class="if uuid-2962018" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2962018.jpg"></div><p>  For decoration of a small handbag, any kind of decorative materials is perfect: </p><ul><li>  The fabric embroidered with sequins. </li><li>  Beads, beads. </li><li>  Ribbons - satin, rep, organza. </li><li>  Rivets, clips, eyelets. </li><li>  Lace, sewing. </li><li>  Chains, beads. </li></ul><p>  Do-it-yourself clutch bag is easy and simple!  Such an activity will help to reveal all your abilities and skills, develop imagination and taste.  Create and enjoy wonderful unique things! </p>
