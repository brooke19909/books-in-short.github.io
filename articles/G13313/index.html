  <section class="page js-page"><h1>East Pakistan: History, Facts, and Events</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  East Pakistan is a province that existed from 1947 to 1971.  It was created during the partition of Bengal.  Having gained independence, it became an independent state of Bangladesh.  In this status remains at present.  In this article we will talk about the history of this territory, the main events that led to its independence. </p><h2>  Provincial Education </h2><p>  East Pakistan was formed in 1947.  The province was created under the partition of Bengal.  This is a historical region in the northeast of South Asia, in which Bengalis mainly lived.  Currently, the territory of Bengal is divided between India and Bangladesh. </p><p>  In 1947, this region was divided according to religious principles.  Mostly Muslims began to live in East Pakistan; in India, adherents of Hinduism.  This happened during the existence of British India - a large colonial possession in South Asia, formed in the middle of the XIX century. </p><h2>  Mountbatten plan </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Louis Mountbatten" class="if uuid-3123168" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3123168.jpg"></div><p>  The formation of East Pakistan was made possible by the Mountbatten Plan.  This is a plan for the division of the British colonies, named for the Viceroy of India, who developed it. </p><p>  In 1947, King of Great Britain George VI approved it as an Indian Independence Act.  According to Mountbatten's plan, instead of British India, the Indian Union and Muslim Pakistan were created.  Both received the rights of British dominions.  However, initially part of the territory remained controversial. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The fate of Bengal and Punjab was decided by separate voting in the Legislative Assembly.  Each principality was given the opportunity to independently determine which of the new states it will enter or remain in its former status. </p><p>  The Punjab partition laid down in the Mountbatten plan led to a bloody war.  In total, about one million people died as a result of the partition of British India. </p><h2>  Rename </h2><p>  The province was originally called East Bengal.  But in 1956 it was renamed.  It was then that it began to be called East Pakistan.  The modern name for this territory is Bangladesh.  In 1971, the region managed to achieve independence.  The people's liberation war led to this. </p><p>  If East Pakistan used to be part of British India, now it is an independent territory. </p><h2>  Provincial governors </h2><p>  During its existence, 15 governors were replaced.  Knowing which country was called East Pakistan, you will better understand the history of this region. </p><p>  The first governor was Amiruddin Ahmad.  Among the most prominent politicians who held this position, it should be noted Zakir Hussein.  This is an Indian statesman who was the president of India in the late 60s.  He pursued a policy of secularism, which was criticized by Muslim activists.  He led the region from October 1958 to April 1960. </p><p>  In August 1969, for about a week, the region was led by Sahabzad Yakub Khan.  This is a Pakistani statesman and military leader.  In the 80-90s, he headed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs three times. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From September 1969 to March 1971, the seat of the governor was occupied by Saeed Mohammed Ahsan.  This is a famous Pakistani military leader who led the navy.  After him, the post belonged to Pakistani General Tikka Khan for several months.  Which was particularly cruel to the Bengali population of East Pakistan.  For his actions during the Bangladesh War of Independence, he was nicknamed the Bengal Butcher.  He also noted the brutal suppression of the Bengal opposition, which was organized by Rahman and the separatist movement Avami League. </p><p>  The last governor of the region was Amir Niyazi, who stayed in this post from December 14 to 16, 1971.  He was the leader of the Pakistani forces during the Bangladesh War of Independence, considered one of the most successful military figures in the history of Pakistan.  Having been defeated, he signed the act of surrender, after which the war was over.  For Pakistan, this rout was an official humiliation as a regional power. </p><h2>  Bangladesh War of Independence </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.blogekattor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bangladesh War of Independence" class="if uuid-3123169" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3123169.jpg"></div><p>  East and West Pakistan, that is, modern Pakistan and Bangladesh, participated in this armed conflict.  At that time they were parts of one country and India. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The territories were very different from each other in cultural terms.  The western part has always dominated, most of the political elite lived there.  At the same time, in terms of population, West Pakistan was inferior to East. </p><p>  In 1970, powerful cyclones hit the east coast.  They caused the death of about 500 thousand people.  At the same time, the central government reacted inefficiently to the elimination of natural disasters.  His mediocre work was greatly annoyed.  After this winning party, the Avami League failed to take their jobs. </p><p>  The President of Pakistan was in talks with Majibur Rahman, who advocated the secession of East Pakistan.  Negotiations failed, then the order was given to begin the operation "Searchlight" for the military capture of this unit.  Rahman was arrested.  The methods of West Pakistan were bloody, resulting in a large number of human casualties.  The target was the Indians and the intelligentsia, as well as about 10 million refugees who tried to take refuge in India. </p><p>  On the eve of his arrest, Rahman declared Bangladesh's independence, urging him to fight for it.  Party leaders League Avami founded a government in exile that met in Indian Calcutta. </p><p>  The war of independence lasted for ten months - from March to December 1971.  The reason was the desire of the Bengalis to national liberation.  The People‚Äôs Liberation Movement in Bangladesh, Mukti Bahini, together with regular forces, entered into a confrontation with the Pakistani armed forces. </p><p>  On December 16, victory over the Pakistani army was announced. </p><h2>  Declaration of independence </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebiz-news.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mujibur Rahman" class="if uuid-3123176" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3123176.jpg"></div><p>  After that, Bangladesh was officially named East Pakistan.  It was originally a parliamentary republic.  With Rahman as the first prime minister in history. </p><p>  He put forward four fundamental principles on which the states were based.  These were socialism, nationalism, democracy and secularism.  He began to disarm militant insurgent groups, foreign economists were invited to develop a program to develop the country along the socialist path. </p><p>  In 1972, a large-scale nationalization of industrial enterprises was carried out.  First of all, sugar factories, cotton and jute factories.  The government also seized control of insurance companies, banks and tea plantations. </p><p>  Parliament was approved at the end of 1972.  Now you know which country used to be called East Pakistan. </p><h2>  At the beginning of the story </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.aljazeera.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern bangladesh" class="if uuid-3123183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3123183.jpg"></div><p>  Bangladesh, formerly called East Pakistan, faced serious difficulties at the beginning of its independence.  The socialist path of development was complicated by the famine of 1974-1975, which was triggered by severe flooding.  As a result of the natural disaster, about two thousand people died, a million were injured, and about a million more local residents were left without a roof over their heads.  As a result, the disaster covered about 3/4 of the country.  Killed up to 80% of the crop. </p><p>  Food shortages that year coincided with rising oil prices, which led to a significant increase in inflation.  Management was accused of nepotism and corruption.  As a result, martial law was introduced at the end of 1974. </p><p>  Amendments to the constitution were adopted.  The parliamentary and democratic system has been replaced by presidential rule with a one-party leadership system.  Rahman became president, declaring the need for change, which should lead to the victory over terrorism and corruption.  The prime minister‚Äôs attempts to establish authoritarian rule led to a bloody coup d'etat. </p><h2>  Change of rulers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.andolonnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ziaur Rahman" class="if uuid-3123175" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3123175.jpg"></div><p>  In August 1975, Rahman was killed with his whole family.  The wave of terror that swept through the country ended with the rise to power of General Ziaur Rahman, who restored the multi-party parliament.  He was killed in 1981 as a result of another military coup. </p><p>  General Hussein Mohammad Ershad took the lead.  He remained in power until 1990, when under pressure from the West he was forced to resign.  A decrease in the role of anti-communist leaders in the region played a role. </p><p>  Khaled Zia, the widow of General Zia Rahman, led the Nationalist Party to victory in parliamentary elections, becoming the first female prime minister in state history.  In 1996, the Avami League seized power, led by one of the surviving daughters of Mujibur Rahman.  In 2001, the Nationalist Party regained power in the country.  In the same year, there was an armed conflict with India. </p><h2>  Indian-Bangladeshi border conflict </h2><div class="photo" data-original="foreignpolicy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Indian-Bangladeshi border conflict" class="if uuid-3123166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3123166.jpg"></div><p>  The conflict lasted from April 16 to 20, 2001.  The reason was the appearance of the Indian outpost in the disputed territory.  The Indians refused the demand to dismantle it.  The Bangladeshi army forced them out of the disputed territory. </p><p>  The fighting lasted three days.  During this time, mortar and rocket attacks were used.  The Indians lost 16 people killed, the armed forces of Bangladesh - three. </p><p>  The conflict was resolved at the level of leaders of neighboring countries. </p><h2>  Current situation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.economist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheikh Hasina" class="if uuid-3123182" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3123182.jpg"></div><p>  In 2007, elections were held under the supervision of the transitional government.  The main task was the fight against corruption.  Many officials and politicians were arrested.  Victory was won by Avami League.  Sheikh Hasina became Prime Minister. </p><p>  In 2014, her party again won the parliamentary elections, extending its term of office by another five years. </p><p>  Now East Pakistan is an agro-industrial country with a developing economy.  It is considered one of the poorest states in Asia.  About 63 percent of the local population is employed in agriculture. </p><p>  The main export items are jute, clothing, frozen fish, leather, and seafood. </p>
