Consider the advantages of the latter method, since the main topic of the article is a trip to Sochi by car.  Traveler reviews allow you to highlight the following points: </p><ol><li>  Absolute independence from anyone.  You leave when you want, and in the future are guided only by your needs or family members, if you are not traveling alone. </li><li>  You can call in cities or towns that will be on your way. </li><li>  An opportunity to see various sights without any haste. </li><li>  There will be no problem taking home all the souvenirs and other purchases that you make on vacation. </li></ol><h2>  Tips for motorists based on traveler reviews </h2><ul><li>  Make a route of your trip and study it carefully, paying particular attention to places of rest and overnight. </li><li>  Calculate the amount of time you will be on the road. </li><li>  Make sure that there is a full tank of gasoline, you can also take a filled canister with you. </li><li>  Going on the road is best in the early morning. </li><li>  The best speed on the road is 90-100 kilometers per hour.  But in some sections of the road it may be 40. Look carefully at the road signs. </li><li>  Difficult sections of the road, such as serpentine, it is advisable to drive during the day, especially if there is no driving experience. </li><li>  If you feel tired and want to sleep, then you need to stop for rest and sleep.  It is better to lose time, but to maintain the health of one's own and loved ones. </li><li>  There is a saying: "Not sure - do not overtake."  Think better than going overtaking, especially on difficult sections of the road.  Remember one more proverb - "Slow down, you will continue." </li><li>  You must take care of booking cheap hostels or hotels for overnight stays.  If this is not done, you will have to pay more money, since there may no longer be inexpensive options.  Of course, about where you will live in Sochi, you also need to think in advance and arrange with the owners or book a hotel room. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews in sochi by car from tyumen" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/1519856.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Rest and food </h2><p>  Comfort and safety are one of the main conditions for a trip by car in Sochi.  Reviews of motorists say that for their observance it is necessary to allocate time for rest, especially if no one changes the driver behind the wheel.  During the trip, you will often come across roadside hotels.  The prices are reasonable, as evidenced by the reviews, you can find hotels up to 1000 rubles a day.  And if you take care of this in advance, you can save.  Almost all hotels have a cafe or a dining room where you can have a tasty and inexpensive meal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What you need to take on the road </h2><ul><li>  A large amount of drinking water.  He will want to drink very often, therefore, in order not to overpay for water later, and sometimes of dubious quality, it is better to take care of this in advance. </li><li>  Take food with you.  It is desirable that it is not perishable.  If you take the sausage, then only raw smoked, sandwiches will help you to quench a slight hunger, until you find a cafe or dining room.  Also take fruits, vegetables, cookies, crackers. </li><li>  Take care of the discs with your favorite music and cartoons for children.  You can take the performances of comedians and audio books. </li><li>  Be sure to take cash on the road, as it will not always be possible to pay with a card. </li><li>  Great if you have a navigator or, in extreme cases, an atlas of roads. </li><li>  New traffic rules, in case of disputes with the traffic police. </li><li>  Portable electric stove. </li><li>  Wet wipes, toilet paper. </li><li>  Disposable tableware sets. </li><li>  Cable, spare candles, jack. </li><li>  First-aid kit. </li></ul><p>  This list can be supplemented.  Think about what you need more on the road by car in Sochi.  Reviews of motorists, which can be found in large quantities, will certainly help you. </p><h2>  Doctor himself </h2><p>  On the road, various health problems can arise, of course, it is impossible to foresee all situations, but, as I testify about the reviews of many, some medicines should be taken with you.  These include: </p><ul><li>  Painkillers: Nurofen, Diclofenac. </li><li>  Antiviral: Viferon, Ingavirin. </li><li>  For allergies: Zirtek, Tavegil, Suprastin. </li><li>  From digestive disorders: activated charcoal, Smecta, Loperamide. </li><li>  From nausea and motion sickness: "Dramina", "Kokkulin." </li><li>  Antiseptics in the form of sprays. </li></ul><p>  It is also worth taking a sterile bandage and cotton wool with you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="route ufa sochi by car reviews" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/1519870.jpg" width="585"></div>

The most important thing here is to plan the route correctly. </p><p>  Many families drive south each year.  Of the pluses note: the ability to not pay for transport, at any time you can go to any place, there is no need to carry heavy bags, independence from the services of taxi drivers.  Many people get bored with traffic jams, which are usually in the Tuapse and Sochi area, so it‚Äôs better to drive through these places in the early morning.  Some even ride with young children who carry the road well.  They like to look out the window, listen to children's songs and watch cartoons, which should be taken care of in advance. </p><p>  By and large, a lot of people travel on the route Moscow - Sochi by car.  Reviews almost all leave mostly positive.  Of the minuses, the problem area is noted in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãDzhugba and Dagomys.  There for almost 200 kilometers there is a serpentine.  It is better to pass it at night, because at other times there are big traffic jams. </p>

    <h2>  Different directions </h2><p>  Let us consider in more detail several travel routes. </p><ul><li>  A large number of people travel to Sochi by car from Yekaterinburg.  Reviews from tourists will help you plan your trip carefully.  The distance you need to travel is about 3,000 thousand kilometers.  It can be overcome within two to three days.  The following routes are located: Sverdlovsk Region, Chelyabinsk, Bashkiria, Tatarstan, <span>Orenburg, Samara,</span> Saratov, Volgograd, Rostov-on-Don, <span>Krasnodar, Sochi.</span>  The road is not very difficult, but it requires attentiveness and certain skills.  In general, the impressions are very pleasant.  From the beauties seen, travelers say, the breathtaking: amazing sunsets and sunrises, high mountains, fields with sunflowers, rivers and lakes, hills and, finally, the sea.  All road difficulties are immediately forgotten.  Joyful emotions and a desire to repeat the trip include numerous reviews. </li><li>  In Sochi by car from Tyumen.  The travel time is about 40 hours, the distance is about 3,000 kilometers.  You pass a large number of beautiful Russian cities.  These are: Kurgan, Chelyabinsk, Ufa, Samara, <span>Saratov, Volgograd,</span> Rostov, Krasnodar, Dzhubga, Loo.  Travel time from two to three days.  You can stop by in the city, see the sights, relax, and go on. </li><li>  <span>The route Ufa</span> - Sochi by car.  Driver reviews are mostly positive.  Traffic jams cause inconvenience, but some of them can be bypassed, having lost much less time on this than standing in them.  If the car is air-conditioned, you can even ride with a small child.  Many children even tolerate such trips better than adults.  The distance to be covered is about 2300 kilometers.  If you leave early in the morning, then the next day you will already be in Sochi.  But if you want to explore the cities you pass by, and there are more than 20, then you will spend more time on the road. </li><li>  The road Moscow - Sochi by car.  Traveler reviews usually begin with advice to leave the capital early in the morning.  In this case, you will have time for rest and sleep in Rostov-on-Don.  You will spend 13-15 hours on the road, having traveled about a thousand kilometers.  Some drivers get to Krasnodar and rest there.  It‚Äôs about another four hours.  Deciding where you will stay for the night is better in advance.  There are paid sections of the road along the way, they will need to pay about 300 rubles.  Well, on the second day of the trip you will find the south: sea, sun, relaxation. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sochi car reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/1519851.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Hazardous areas </h2><p>  According to reviews, the road to the south by car does not cause much trouble if you go, observing the rules of the road and not exceed the speed more than expected.  But there are several sections on the highway that require increased attention and accuracy of the driver. </p><p>  During the journey, at times you will have to drive along a narrow, winding, mountain road.  Also overcome the passes.  I would like to pay special attention to the difficult section of the road in the Dagomys area.  Its length is about 200 kilometers.  What is he like?  This is a mountain serpentine.  Turns are steep and closed.  Huge trucks and double-decker buses can leave you at any time.  Here you need to be especially careful.  It is better to drive through this area in the morning or in the afternoon, and in front of it you must definitely have a good meal and rest in order to restore your strength.  Then everything will be in perfect order. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car trip to sochi reviews" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43527/1519857.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sights of Sochi </h2><p>  Among the huge number of interesting places, according to reviews, I want to highlight a few. </p><ul><li>  Park "Riviera".  Rides, a dolphinarium, a penguinarium, a huge amount of greenery and beautiful flowers are located in one of the most famous and favorite places of the city. </li><li>  <span>Sochi Arboretum.</span>  Tourists come here from all over the globe.  There is something to see: rare plants, a <span>bamboo grove,</span> beautiful statues, fountains, an ostrich farm, swans. </li><li>  Yew-boxwood grove.  It is so easy to imagine yourself in a fairy kingdom. </li><li>  Olympic Park.  It is better to come here in the morning and stay for the whole day.  The vast territory on which there are Olympic facilities, souvenir kiosks, cafes, attractions.  You will definitely come back here. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The road to Sochi is fraught with many adventures and surprises by car.  Traveler reviews given in our review will certainly help you make it easy and enjoyable.  It remains only to wish everyone a successful journey and a carefree vacation. </p>
