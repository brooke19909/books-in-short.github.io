Holidays in Greece with children - where is better</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The cradle of human civilization.  A country rich in unique historical monuments.  The state, offering tourists a vacation on four warm seas with luxurious sandy beaches.  Superb cuisine, abundant in seafood and vegetables, as well as stunningly beautiful nature, surprising with giant pines and silver olive groves.  We hope you guessed which country will be discussed in today's article?  Still in doubt?  Not worth it, there is no other land like Greece on the world map. </p><p>  Millions of tourists come here every year, and with each new season the percentage of Russians among them is becoming higher.  This year, Greece is worthy of competition with the popular resorts of Egypt and Turkey.  Almost every third Russian family planning a summer vacation thinks about choosing Greek resorts. </p><p>  However, a great problem for our compatriots is the variety of tourist areas that the country provides.  It is especially difficult to choose one or another resort if you go on vacation with a child.  Therefore, today we will tell you everything about holidays in Greece with children (where is better and what is the approximate cost of the tour).  We also provide a description of one of the most inexpensive hotels in Crete, ideal for checking in with kids. </p>

    <h2>  Greece: making a choice </h2><p>  The economic crisis, which in recent years has negatively affected tourism in many countries, has forced our compatriots to look for new resorts that offer the best prices and accommodation.  Unexpectedly for many people, Greece quickly found its bearings in the new environment and managed to offer the Russians a rich and affordable vacation in their resorts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is so attractive for tourists in this country?  Oh, it's very hard to put together.  After all, Greece can provide a huge variety of not only resort areas, but also leisure activities, as well as hotels for any wallet. </p><p>  First of all, family travelers are attracted by the fact that almost all the beaches and resorts in the country are great for families with children.  Most of them are well equipped, have developed infrastructure and a gentle entrance to the water.  All beach areas of Greece are very clean, which is very important when you choose a place to spend a vacation with your child. </p><p>  Tourists have the opportunity to choose among a large number of hotels.  In Greece, there are quite a lot of good hotel complexes from two stars, and four-star and five-star hotels have been working on the all-inclusive system for several years now.  This is another reason to make a choice in favor of the Greek resorts. </p><p>  Great for relaxing with children is the mild Mediterranean climate of the country.  In summer, there is rarely a choking heat with high humidity, which is simply ideal conditions for tourists.  And in winter, pretty comfortable weather reigns on the coast, allowing you to enjoy visiting local attractions. </p><p>  Not the least role in choosing Greece as a place to relax is played by national cuisine.  She is one of the healthiest in the world and is always very popular with kids of all ages. </p><p>  Also, many parents believe that the Greek holidays will be able to reveal dry historical facts set forth in textbooks for children from a different angle.  After all, a school-age child will gladly go on a sightseeing tour, which he had only read about in books before.  In addition, Greece is rich not only in ancient ruins and treasures of antiquity, but also in holy places, the most revered of which is Athos. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We think that all the information presented is enough to make a choice in favor of this amazing country.  However, do not forget that a visa to Greece is necessary for the Russians.  Although every year the visa regime between the two countries is greatly simplified.  What does the tourist season of 2017 prepare for us? </p><h2>  Visa to Greece for Russians </h2><p>  In order to enjoy the gorgeous beaches of the country, our compatriots must issue a "Schengen".  A tourist visa allows you to stay in Greece for up to thirty days.  This time is enough for those who dream of a vacation on the islands or the mainland. </p><p>  You can apply for a visa at more than twenty visa centers.  Every year, the list of cities in which you can draw up all the necessary documents is increasing.  Next year, Greece plans to open at least ten more visa application centers in Russia. </p><p>  To obtain a "Schengen" you must present the following papers: </p><ul><li>  profile; </li><li>  copies and original of a foreign passport; </li><li>  copies of a Russian passport; </li><li>  two photographs of a standard sample; </li><li>  insurance; </li><li>  confirmation of hotel reservation and airline tickets; </li><li>  financial document. </li></ul><p>  The cost of a visa is set at sixty euros.  Your documents are usually considered for about two weeks in the regions and from two to five days in Moscow and St. Petersburg. </p>

    <h2>  Visa-free islands </h2><p>  Sometimes Russians take the opportunity of visa-free entry to some Greek islands.  The most popular among our compatriots are: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Rhodes; </li><li>  Kos; </li><li>  Lesbos. </li></ul><p>  However, this way to visit Greece has its pitfalls: </p><ul><li>  without a visa, Russians can be on these islands if they arrived there by sea from Turkey; </li><li>  a tourist cannot go to another part of the country; </li><li>  vacationers must return to their homeland again through Turkey; </li><li>  Holidays on the islands should not exceed fourteen days. </li></ul><p>  Many Russians have no idea that visa-free entry to the islands is a kind of trick.  Indeed, on the territory of the state you still have to draw up a package of documents that is no different from those that are necessary to obtain a ‚ÄúSchengen‚Äù.  Therefore, experienced travelers are still advised to get a Schengen visa in Russia, so your trip will be more relaxed and enjoyable.  Especially when it comes to traveling with children. </p>

They have their own characteristics and characteristics, for the article we have chosen those that will be ideal for relaxing with a child. </p><p>  If you prefer the mainland of Greece, then you should pay attention to the following resorts: </p><ul><li>  Halkidiki Peninsula  Tourists have chosen two peninsula resorts - Kassandra and Sithonia.  There are beautiful golden beaches, as well as pine forests that fill the air with simply incredible aroma.  Sithonia is more suitable for family vacations, the resort is quite calm and has developed infrastructure. </li><li>  Peloponnese Peninsula.

It is washed by the Mediterranean Sea, forming numerous secluded lagoons with sandy beaches.  The best resort of the island is Faliraki, where there is a large water park. </li><li>  The greenest island is Corfu.  There are many monuments of medieval architecture that will be interesting to children from five years old.  The most popular beach area is Agios Gordios, located in a cozy bay, where almost never there is wind and waves. </li><li>  Crete is one of the most favorite holiday destinations among Russians.  Our compatriots, captivated by a rich excursion program, water parks and a large selection of hotels, come here most often.  The best for children are the beaches of Elounda. </li></ul><p>  We would like to tell you more about this resort. </p>

    <h2>  Elounda: a resort with incredibly beautiful beach areas </h2><p>  If you decide to go with your child to Crete, then choose this part of it.  Elounda is famous throughout Greece for its luxurious hotels and an abundance of entertainment.  Here you can forget about everything, immersed in the incredibly diverse life that is provided to tourists by employees of hotel complexes. </p><p>  The beaches of Elounda are a special topic of conversation.  They are considered one of the most beautiful in Greece and, despite their small size, are very popular among vacationers. </p><p>  Private beach areas are located in the Pigadakia area.  The most luxurious hotels were built here, which managed to "take hold" of a part of the beach.  Almost every hotel complex has its own marina, where cute boats moored in bright colors approach. </p><p>  Skisma has a city beach, which is ideal for children.  Here you can relax, sunbathing and swimming in a cozy lagoon or playing volleyball and doing water sports.  Kids enjoy spending time on the playground, equipped right on the beach. </p><p>  On the way to Plaka there are numerous wild pebble beaches.  They are surrounded by olive groves, which gives them a slightly fantastic look.  Sometimes trees go down to the water, creating an incredibly beautiful landscape. </p><p>  If you like beaches where everything is very well organized, then you should go to Hionas.  It is municipal, but equipped with everything necessary for a good holiday.  Here you will find not only sun loungers and umbrellas, but also showers, a lifeguard base and picturesque bars with an abundance of delicious snacks and drinks. </p><p>  It is worth noting that most hotels in Elounda are quite expensive.  But we are ready to tell you about a small hotel complex that will be affordable for any average Russian family.  If you are looking for the best value for money, then opt for the Aristea Hotel. </p><h2>  Description and location of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Hotel Aristea 2 * is located in Greece in Elounda almost in the very center of the resort.  Its location is quite convenient for families with children.  Judge for yourself - you don‚Äôt have to go to the beach for more than five minutes, there are a bus stop, shops and bars nearby, and from the airport to Aristea Hotel 2 * you will need to overcome only seventy-three kilometers. </p><p>  From the hotel you can drive to any part of Elounda and other resort areas of Crete in a few minutes.  However, many travelers admit in their reviews that they have never seen a more beautiful place than Elounda. </p><p>  Aristea Hotel 2 * in Crete is a fairly old and simple hotel, but it is quite comfortable here, and the staff is always ready to provide the necessary assistance to guests. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure and service at the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel complex Aristea Hotel 2 * has a fairly small area without its own pool.  Many tourists consider this a significant drawback, but still recognize that the rest of the hotel leaves a lot of pleasant experiences.  Guests especially enjoy strolling on a hot afternoon in the beautiful garden surrounding the hotel complex. </p><p>  Since the only building of Aristea Hotel 2 * consists of three floors, an elevator is provided in the building.

    <h2>  Number of rooms and living conditions </h2><p>  For those planning a family vacation in Aristea 2 *, a description of the rooms is a very important criterion when choosing a suitable hotel.  Therefore, we paid special attention to this topic. </p><p>  We have already specified that the hotel complex is small in size, so there are only thirty-three rooms in it.  They are mainly designed for two and three people, but you can find single apartments.  However, they usually have a street view and are very small in size. </p><p>  Most of the family rooms overlook the picturesque Mirabello Bay or one of the nearby islands.  Please note that smoking is prohibited on site, but pets are allowed. </p><p>  Each room has a TV, telephone, air conditioning (extra), a small bathroom with a hairdryer.  All guests of the hotel noted in the reviews that the size of the apartments was a little embarrassing for the first time, but they quickly got used to it.  The bathroom always has a good pressure of hot water, which is very rare in Greece. </p><p>  Check-in at the apartment takes place at two in the afternoon; check-out is from seven in the morning to twelve in the afternoon.  Toddlers up to two years old can stay in the room for free, for children under twelve years old who are accommodated in an extra bed, you must pay four euros per day. </p><p>  An adult or a child over twelve years old, living in a room in an extra bed, must pay eight euros per day. </p><p>  In general, our compatriots recommend the hotel for a relaxing family vacation, which involves mainly beach activities or independent trips to the sights of the island. </p>

    <h2>  Cost of rest </h2><p>  Experienced travelers claim that organized tours to Greece from Moscow will be much cheaper than an independent holiday trip.  Therefore, when planning your vacation, you should carefully study the prices of tickets. </p><p>  Naturally, the cost of the tour will directly depend on the chosen category of the hotel and the duration of the vacation.  For example, a trip to Greece from Moscow on a weekend to a three-star hotel will cost from six thousand rubles. </p><p>  If you plan to spend at least two weeks at sea, then you should focus on the amount of forty thousand rubles.  The price includes air travel, accommodation and two meals a day. </p><p>  Holidays in Greece are always remembered for a long time.  Whatever resort you choose, it will in any case make a lasting impression on you.  And how could it be otherwise, because Greece is the real cradle of the culture of modern mankind. </p>
