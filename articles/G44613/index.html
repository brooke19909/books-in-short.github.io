A year after its founding, the organization set about developing new cities and towns.  Since 2011, the company "Bystrodengi" has the status of MFIs.  The popularity of this financial agent continues to gain momentum.  Consider all the main points associated with the activities of "Quick Money".  Feedback from customers and employees about this microloan organization is highly controversial. </p>

    <p>  The work of the operators who receive clients at the offices of MFIs is evaluated by visitors first of all, and not always positively. </p><h2>  Operating room of the company: reviews with a plus sign </h2><ul><li>  Customers enjoy a homely atmosphere in many departments of this organization. </li><li>  Regular visitors of the company are satisfied with the attitude of the employees and the quality of the services provided. </li></ul><p>  Private individuals who do not have a relationship with the staff give negative feedback about the company "Fast Money". </p><h2>  Cash and foreign exchange transactions: reviews with a minus sign </h2><ul><li>  Individuals making currency exchange operations at the bank complain that as a result of the slowness and incompetence of the operating room workers, money is converted for a very long time.  During this time, due to changes in the exchange rate, customers lose quite large sums of money. </li><li>  There are cases when office employees refused to serve clients with poor eyesight, in particular, those who forgot glasses at home. </li><li>  Private individuals complain that the service is very slow because there aren‚Äôt enough working cash desks in the Bystrodengi offices. </li><li>  Responses of legal entities allow us to see that the process of opening current accounts in an organization is greatly delayed.  Instead of the promised 1-2 days, customers have to wait 3-4 days or more. </li></ul><p>  Lending is considered a priority area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity of the MFI ‚ÄúBystrodengi‚Äù.  Feedback from borrowers (real and failed) regarding the issuance of loans is very controversial. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Loan operations: reviews with a plus sign </h2><ul><li>  The obvious advantage of the organization is the speed and efficiency in issuing credit resources. </li></ul><ul><li>  No documents confirming receipt of income by the applicant are required - certificate 2-NDFL. </li></ul><ul><li>  In the event of an unforeseen situation, you can contact the company with a request for a recount of payment or a deferment. </li></ul><h2>  Issuance of credit resources: reviews with a minus sign </h2><ul><li>  The primary and most significant drawback of this financial company is the prohibitively high percentage of loans. </li></ul><ul><li>  Customers are unhappy that the form of contracts provided by the MFIs is capable of misleading the potential borrower, since the daily rather than the annual interest rate for using credit funds is indicated there. </li></ul><ul><li>  Loans are issued by Bystrodeng employees without proper analysis of the solvency of individuals applying to them, as a result of which loans are issued to people who are unable to pay off debt (students, mothers with many children).  Then their relatives have to pay. </li></ul><ul><li>  MFI employees involved in the issuance of loans do not always inform borrowers that the item ‚ÄúInsurance‚Äù will be provided in the contract, and therefore the loan amount will be increased by the amount of commissions payable to the insurance company. </li></ul>

    <h2>  General conclusions about the work of the company "Fast Money" </h2><p>  The feedback from employees, loan recipients, and other clients of MFIs suggests the following conclusion: the organization provides a ton of opportunities for all categories of clients and employees.  Like any operating company, Bystrodengi has followers and ill-wishers.  What kind of relationship a client will have with this MFI depends on him. </p><p>  Should I contact the MFO "Bystrodengi"?  Reviews of regular customers and organization staff allow new customers to make their choice.  However, the final decision will be made directly by consumers of financial services. </p>
