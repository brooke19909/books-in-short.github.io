The latter, of course, are much more interesting in terms of hardware "stuffing", but not every buyer is able to purchase such a device.  But in the budget segment there is a significant increase in consumer demand.  Naturally, the first thing that attracts attention is the price.  Also, manufacturers have significantly improved the characteristics of low-cost gadgets, expanded functionality and improved quality. </p><p>  An excellent alternative to simple push-button ‚Äúdialers‚Äù is the DIGMA HIT Q400 3G smartphone.  Feedback on the model and its characteristics will be considered in the framework of this article.  The cost of the device is critically low.  You can buy it for only 1900-2000 rubles.  What does the manufacturer offer for the money?  Let's get it right. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="digma hit q400 3g reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2188004.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Packaging and equipment </h2><p>  The phone is packed in a small box of thin cardboard.  Outwardly, it is framed quite brightly.  A photo of a smartphone flaunts on a white background.  Above it there is an inscription testifying to belonging to the Digma brand.  The name itself, like the type of device, is printed at the bottom of the box.  On the right side, the manufacturer briefly presented the main characteristics.  We are talking about the OS version, screen size, Wi-Fi support, the ability to work in 3G networks, a 2-megapixel camera and two SIM cards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk about the configuration, then the <span>smartphone DIGMA</span> HIT Q400 3G (White / Black) receives different <span>reviews</span> .  The fact is that to minimize the cost, the manufacturer had to reduce the set of accessories to a critical minimum, that is, put in the box with the phone only a coupon that indicates a guarantee, and a brief guide.  The lack of headphones did not greatly disappoint buyers, but the charger caused a flurry of negativity.  Of course, you can use the power adapter from an old smartphone, but the very fact of such austerity unpleasantly affected the overall assessment of the gadget. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  In the form of a classic monoblock, this device is made.  Exquisite design elements the user will not find.  Unfortunately, you don‚Äôt have to rely on uniqueness and originality by purchasing a phone for 2 thousand rubles.  There is no wide variety in the color scheme, buyers pay attention to this, leaving reviews on the Web.  The DIGMA HIT Q400 3G smartphone black and white is not very interesting for the children's audience, and since schoolchildren most often buy it as the first phone, there are extremely few bright copies. </p><p>  But users respond positively about dimensions.  The device weighs only 107 g, making it convenient to carry not only in the bag, but also in the pockets of any clothes.  As for the size of the body, you can only find fault with the thickness.  Currently, 10 mm is considered a fairly large indicator.  Height and width are standard, as for a 4-inch smartphone.  They are 130 and 64 mm, respectively. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The brightness of the back cover is reduced due to the use of a textured surface.  Fingerprints, of course, will remain, but not in large numbers.  The picture is quite small, so it does not immediately strike the eye.  The phone practically does not slip in the hand, which minimizes an accidental drop.  For those for whom the criterion of branding is one of the main, it is recommended to choose a white smartphone DIGMA HIT Q400 3G.  Reviews of this specimen indicate that on it, unlike black, pollution is less noticeable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone digma hit q400 3g reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2188106.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The arrangement of elements on the back cover is standard, as for gadgets of this type.  In the upper part in the center are the flash and the eye of the main camera.  They are displayed in one vertical line.  Below, closer to the left side, is the elongated hole of the speaker.  You can argue about the convenience of such an arrangement for a long time, however, users noticed that the volume will decrease significantly if you put the device on a soft surface with the back side.  There are no more functional elements on the battery cover.  As for the shape of the panel, its side faces are rounded.  This allowed to visually reduce the thickness of the body.  The cover is removable.  Under it are the battery and slots for two "SIM cards", as well as memory cards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the front side there is nothing remarkable.  Large screen frames spoil the look.  According to users, their width is unjustified.  In the upper part, the developers placed a conversational speaker and a selfie camera window.  There are no proximity or lighting sensors.  The control panel with three touch buttons is displayed below. </p><p>  Users praise the build quality.  With strong pressure on the panel deflection is not observed.  Also there are no backlashes and creaks, which, of course, is the advantage of the "state employee". </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the low cost of the gadget was reflected on the screen.  To reduce the price, the developers installed a display that is made using TFT technology.  Image quality is poor.  Users are also unflattering about viewing angles in their reviews.  The DIGMA HIT Q400 3G Black / White smartphone is an entry-level device, so you should not expect innovative developments. </p><p>  The 4-inch screen has a rather modest resolution - 800 √ó 480 pixels.  The clarity of the image is greatly reduced on the street.  The brightness range is not high.  When exposed to sunlight, the information becomes unreadable.  The multi-touch option is designed for only two touches.  Some owners had problems with the sensor.  Based on this information, the screen of this smartphone is difficult to rank among the advantages.  But in defense of the gadget, we note that for 2000 rubles you can‚Äôt count on anything more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="digma hit q400 3g smartphone black reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2188108.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hardware platform </h2><p>  What reviews did the DIGMA HIT Q400 3G get about performance?  Most users rated the device using a 5-point system for the top three.  The device is based on the inexpensive Spreadtrum SC7731 chipset.  Its capabilities are limited to a frequency of 1200 MHz.  It is up to this limit that four computing modules can be accelerated with increasing load.  The Mali-400MP2 graphics processor and 512 MB of RAM complement the hardware platform. </p><p>  The comments say that the smartphone interface works smoothly.  Lightweight applications run quickly, but there may be complications with games.  The gadget will pull only the simplest. </p><p>  The advantages are also difficult to attribute and the amount of internal memory.  For everything about everything, the user is provided with 4 GB, of which about half is occupied by the operating system.  You can increase the memory up to 32 GB by installing a flash card. </p>

    <h2>  Communication </h2><p>  In this model, support for new generation networks is not implemented.  The device works with 2G / 3G.  The smartphone has two slots for SIM cards, but they work alternately, since there is only one radio module. </p><p>  The developers did not forget about the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi modules.  Last single band.  As for bluetooth, its version (2.1) is already considered obsolete.  Also implemented and navigation.  It takes approximately one minute to start the GPS module. </p><h2>  Battery Life </h2><p>  Owners of the DIGMA HIT Q400 3G device in reviews often touch on the topic of autonomy.  The developers equipped the smartphone with a 1400 mAh battery.  Naturally, such a capacity will not be enough for a long life.  However, if we take into account the low resolution of the screen and the not-so-powerful platform, then with an average load you can count on 10-15 hours without recharging.  This time is significantly reduced if you use the Internet, play or listen to music.  In intensive operation, the battery will last for about 3 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone digma q400 3g hit white reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2188110.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Camera features are also low in reviews.  DIGMA HIT Q400 3G is equipped with 0.3 megapixels and 2 megapixels modules.  Unfortunately, the developers and optics have significantly saved.  Both cameras do not have auto focus.  Users called the quality of the pictures mediocre.  Image clarity and detail are low.  Color rendering is weak.  The only thing you can use cameras for is communication via video and messengers. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The software of this model is the only indisputable plus.  The sixth Android is installed on the smartphone.  There is no branded shell, as well as advertising software.  And this many users attribute to the benefits.  The system can be updated by air. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone digma hit q400 3g white reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2188109.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  DIGMA HIT Q400 3G: reviews </h2><p>  So, having studied the opinion of the owners of this model, we can conclude that the HIT Q400 3G is in fact a simple ‚Äúdialer‚Äù.  The gadget fully justifies its cost.  Its characteristics correspond to the initial level of the budget segment.  However, users still highlighted several advantages.  These include build quality, a separate slot for an external drive, small housing sizes, light weight and the ability to work with two cards of cellular operators. </p>
