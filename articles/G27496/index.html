She is the only one in the solar system, but all good things sooner or later ends.  Have you ever wondered if the Earth stops, what will happen?  We will try to find the answer to this question in this article. </p><p>  From the time of the school bench, everyone knows that our earth has the shape of a ball and rotates around its axis.  It is also in constant motion around our source of heat and light, the Sun.  But what is the cause of the rotation of the earth? </p>

    <p>  All these questions are quite interesting, for sure, at least once in my life this was asked by every inhabitant of our planet.  The school course gives us little information of this kind.  For example, we all know that as a result of the Earth’s movement, we have a change of day and night, maintains the air temperature, familiar to all of us.  But all this is not enough, because this process is not limited to this. </p><h2>  Rotation around the sun </h2><p>  So, we figured out that our planet is always in motion, but why and at what speed does the Earth rotate?  It is important to know that all the planets in the solar system rotate at a certain speed, and all in the same direction.  Coincidence?  Of course not! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Long before the appearance of man, our planet formed, it arose in a hydrogen cloud.  After this, a strong push came, as a result of which the cloud began to rotate.  In order to answer the question “why”, we recall that each particle, when passing through a vacuum, has its own inertia, while all particles balance it. </p><p>  Thus, the entire solar system rotates faster and faster.  From this our Sun was formed, and then all the other planets, and those movements inherited from the luminary. </p><h2>  Rotations around its own axis </h2><p>  This question is of interest to scientists and now, there are many hypotheses, but we will give the most plausible. </p><p>  So, in the previous paragraph we already said that the entire Solar system was formed from an accumulation of “garbage”, which was accumulated as a result of the fact that the young, at that time, Sun attracted him.  Despite the fact that its bulk went to our Sun, nevertheless, planets formed around it.  Initially, they did not have the usual form for us. </p>

    <p>  Sometimes, colliding with objects, they collapsed, but had the ability to attract smaller particles, and gained their mass.  Several factors made our planet spin: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Time. </li><li>  Wind. </li><li>  Asymmetry. </li></ul><p>  And the last is not a mistake, then the Earth resembled the shape of a snowball molded by a small child.  The irregular shape made the planet unstable, it was exposed to wind and radiation from the sun.  Despite <span>this, the Earth</span> emerged from an unbalanced position and began to spin, pushed by the same factors.  In short, our planet is not moving itself, but it was pushed many billions of years ago.  We did not specify at what speed the Earth rotates.  She is always in motion.  And in almost twenty-four hours it makes a complete revolution around its axis.  Such a movement is called daily allowance.  The speed of rotation is not the same everywhere.  So at the equator, it equals about 1670 kilometers per hour, and the North and South Pole may even remain in place. </p><p>  But besides this, our planet is still moving along a different trajectory.  A complete revolution of the Earth around the Sun takes place in three hundred sixty-five days and five hours.  This explains that there is a leap year, that is, it has one more day. </p><h2>  Is a stop possible? </h2><p>  If the Earth stops, what will happen?  To begin with, a stop can be considered both around its axis and around the Sun.  We will analyze all the options in more detail.  In this chapter we discuss some common points, and whether this is possible at all. </p><p>  If we consider a sharp stop of the Earth's rotation around its axis, then this is practically not realistic.  Only a collision with a large object can lead to this.  We’ll clarify right away that there will be no difference whether the planet rotates or even flew out of its orbit, since a stop can be caused by such a large object that the Earth simply can not withstand such a blow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  If the Earth stops, what will happen?  If a sudden stop is practically impossible, then slow braking is quite real.  Although this is not felt, our planet is already slowly slowing down. </p><p>  If we talk about flying around the Sun, then stopping the planet in this case is something from the realm of fantasy.  But we will drop all probabilities and assume that this did happen.  We suggest that you examine each case separately. </p><h2>  Abrupt stop </h2><p>  Although this option is hypothetically impossible, but we still assume.  If the Earth stops, what will happen?  The speed of our planet is so great that a sudden stop for any reason, just blow it all. </p><p>  To begin with, in what direction does the Earth rotate?  From West to East at a speed of more than five hundred meters per second.  From this we can assume that everything that moves on the planet and continues its movement at a speed of more than 1.5 thousand kilometers per hour.  The wind, which will blow at the same speed, will cause a strong tsunami.  In one hemisphere there will be six months a day, and then, those who do not burn the highest temperature, will finish six months of severe frost and night.  But what if after that they will remain alive?  They will be destroyed by radiation.  In addition, after the Earth stops, our core will make several more revolutions, while volcanoes will erupt in those places where they have not been seen before. </p>

    <p>  The atmosphere also will not stop its movement instantly, that is, there will be wind blowing at a speed of 500 meters per second.  In addition, a partial loss of atmosphere is possible. </p><p>  This version of the disaster is the best outcome for mankind, because everything will happen so quickly that no one will just have time to come to his senses, will not understand what is happening.  Since the most likely result is an explosion of the planet.  Another thing is the slow and gradual stop of the planet. </p><p>  For many, the first thing that comes to mind is eternal day on one side and eternal night on the other, but this is not really a big problem compared to the rest. </p><h2>  Smooth stop </h2><p>  Our planet slows down its rotation, scientists say that man will not stop completely stopping it, as it will happen in billions of years, and long before that the Sun will increase in volume and simply burn the Earth.  But, nevertheless, we will simulate the situation of a stop in the foreseeable future.  Just for starters, let's deal with the question: why is there a slow stop? </p>

    <p>  Previously, a day on our planet lasted about six hours, and the Moon has a strong influence on this factor.  But how?  It causes water to oscillate with its attractive force, and as a result of this process a slow stop occurs. </p><h2>  Still happened </h2><p>  We are waiting for an eternal night or an eternal day in one of the hemispheres, but this is not the biggest trouble, compared with the redistribution of land and the ocean, which will lead to the mass destruction of all living things. </p><p>  Where the sun will be, all plants will gradually die out, and the soil will crack from drought, but the other side is the snow tundra.  The area most suitable for habitation will be intermediate, where there will be an eternal sunrise or sunset.  Moreover, these territories will be quite small.  Land will be located only at the equator.  The North and South Poles will be two large oceans. </p><p>  It is no exception that a person will need to adapt to exist in the earth, and spacesuits will be needed for walks on the surface. </p><h2>  No movement around the sun </h2><p>  This scenario is simple, everything that was on the front side will fly into the free space of space, because our planet moves at a very high speed, while others will receive an equally strong blow to the earth. </p>

    <p>  Even if the Earth gradually slows down its movement, then in the end it will fall on the Sun, and this whole process will take sixty-five days, but no one will survive until the last, as the temperature will be about three thousand degrees Celsius.  If you believe the calculations of scientists, then in a month on our planet the temperature will reach 50 degrees. </p><p>  This scenario is practically not real, but the absorption of the Earth by the Sun is a fact that cannot be avoided, but humanity will not be able to catch this day. </p><h2>  Earth flew from orbit </h2><p>  This is the most fantastic option.  No, we will not go on a trip through space, because there are laws of physics.  If at least one planet from the solar system flies out of orbit, then it will bring chaos in the movement of all the others, as a result, it will fall into the "paws" of the Sun, which will absorb it, attracting its mass. </p>
