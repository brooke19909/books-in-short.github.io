  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Human pressure as an essential indicator of health status</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Human pressure is <span>arterial pressure, the</span> indicators of which are determined by the activity of the heart.  When <span>measuring pressure</span> , the so-called upper - systolic level, which occurs at the time of contraction of the heart muscle, and the lower - diastolic, which occurs at the time of relaxation, are taken into account. </p><p>  Normally, blood pressure should not exceed 120/80.  Moreover, many doctors agree that this indicator of blood pressure is ideal.  Nevertheless, the ideal pressure of a person is 110/70, the owners of which can only be <span>healthy people.</span>  Of course, it is necessary to strive for this indicator - to strengthen your health and try to maintain such a result for many years. </p><p>  It is generally accepted that with age, body weight tends to increase, and at the same time, an increase in blood pressure indicators is also an age norm.  However, German doctors note that this is typical of people who lead an unhealthy lifestyle and urge that this concept be considered unacceptable.  Based on clinical trials, they argue that with proper nutrition, physical training that enhances health, and the absence of bad habits, a person‚Äôs pressure can have normal values ‚Äã‚Äãuntil they are old. </p><p>  But if all the same, the pressure is not normal?  What to do to avoid hypertension - high blood pressure, which entails the risk of cardiovascular disease and even stroke.  First of all, reconsider your lifestyle: maybe there is something that needs to be changed and a few steps taken towards your health.  If before hypertension was considered a disease of the older generation, today it is "getting younger."  Young people, barely reaching the age of 25, begin to suffer from this ailment.  However, recognizing the disease in time, it is possible to cope with it, it is only necessary to eliminate the causes of its occurrence. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Get rid of excess weight, which increases the risk of hypertension. </li><li>  Cut back on salt. </li><li>  Reduce alcohol consumption to a minimum. </li><li>  If you smoke, try to get rid of this addiction. </li><li>  Increase physical activity. </li></ul><p>  A disease in which a person‚Äôs blood pressure is lowered (hypotension), although it does not entail dangerous consequences, is still not so harmless.  <span>Low pressure</span> companions are <span>fatigue,</span> headache, upset gastrointestinal tract.  Strict dosing of time for work and rest can help here, in a word - daily routine.  Good nutrition and enough time for sleep - at least eight hours. </p><p>  However, one should not expect that human pressure should have stable indicators. </p><p>  Blood pressure instability is a normal phenomenon in the physiology of the human body. </p><p>  For example, from physical exertion, the pressure rises, sometimes a sharp change in weather conditions may be the reason for the increase in blood pressure.  This is a normal reaction of the body - it adapts.  Such increases are short-term and insignificant. </p><p>  Also, ‚Äújumps‚Äù in blood pressure can provoke factors such as nervous tension and mental stress.  The same effect is possessed by drugs that act on the nervous system excitingly - coffee, strong tea, alcohol. </p><p>  So, <strong> </strong>  human blood pressure is an important indicator of the state of health, both of the cardiovascular system and of the whole organism.  This indicator is quite accessible for self-monitoring. </p><p>  A tonometer is a device for measuring pressure; today it can be purchased at any pharmacy.  After all, even with good health, it is desirable to measure the pressure, so it will not be superfluous to purchase it for your home medicine cabinet. </p>
