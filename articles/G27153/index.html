For more than twenty years, the <span>Northern War</span> lasted (from 1700 to 1721) for supremacy over the Baltic lands.  Sweden lost in this war, Russia prevailed.  Victory in the Northern War led to the proclamation of Russia by the empire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="proclamation of empire of Russia" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/390994.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fateful period </h2><p>  In 1721, Russia was proclaimed an empire with its capital in St. Petersburg.  After the Mongol and <span>British, the empire</span> created by Peter I, became the third state in terms of area known at that time.  The victorious 1721, when Russia became an empire, provided an opportunity to enter the <span>Baltic Sea.</span>  The country came to its coast with a strong fleet and army. </p><p>  And the proclamation of Russia by the empire, and the acquisition of Peter the Great the title of Emperor of All-Russia took place in a crucial year for the state. </p><h2>  North War.  Causes </h2><p>  By the beginning of the XVIII century, the Swedish empire had complete domination in the Baltic Sea and was one of the most advanced states in Europe.  Its power and large territory attracted the countries of the Northern Union (it included Russia, the Danish-Norwegian kingdom and Saxony).  In 1697, the Swedish monarch Karl XII turned fifteen.  This fact could not but be considered as very important by the countries of the Northern Union when counting on getting an easy victory in the Northern War. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Russia felt an acute economic need for access to the Baltic Sea, since at that time it had only one port in the White Sea - Arkhangelsk, with a very difficult and irregular navigation system. </p>

    <p>  When in 1697 Peter the Great traveled across Europe and the Swedes took him coldly, he took it as a personal offense, which later became one of the reasons for declaring war. </p><h2>  The Northern War of the period 1718-1721 </h2><p>  The first peace congress of the Northern War period was held in the spring of 1718.  It was at the √Öland Congress that it was necessary to determine the conditions for signing a peace treaty between Sweden and Russia.  However, Sweden was delaying negotiations.  This position was caused by the attitude of other powers in this matter.  For example, Denmark was afraid of signing a <span>separate peace</span> between Russia and Sweden. </p><p>  In the fall of 1718, on November 30, Charles XII was killed.  This happened during the siege of Fredrickshald.  The king‚Äôs sister, Ulric Eleanor, ascended the throne.  England's position in the Swedish court intensified. </p><p>  July 1719  Under the command of Apraksin, the Russian fleet is landing near Stockholm.  Then there are raids on the suburban territories of the capital of Sweden. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the fall of 1719 (November 9), Sweden signed an alliance treaty with England and Hanover.  The last went Ferden and Bremen. </p>

    <p>  During 1720, peace treaties were signed in Stockholm between Sweden and its former adversaries.  On January 7, peace is concluded with the <span>Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</span> and Saxony, on February 1, with Prussia (the latter gives way to Pomerania). </p><p>  On July 14, another peace treaty was concluded.  Under its terms, Denmark transferred part of the territories in Schleswig-Holstein, and a cash indemnity was received.  Now all Swedish ships passing through the Sound of the Sounds were obliged to pay a fee. </p><p>  Finally, on August 30, 1721, the main peace treaty was signed in Nishtadt. </p><h2>  The signing of the Nystadt Peace Treaty </h2><p>  This document completed the Northern War, which lasted from 1700 to 1721.  Ingermanlandia, Livonia, part of Karelia and the whole territory of Estonia were annexed to Russia.  In addition, she made a commitment to return Finland.  The obligation of Russia, according to the results of the contract, included the payment of monetary compensation to Sweden. </p><p>  Ratification of the contract occurred on September 9.  Magnificent celebrations were held in Moscow over the signing of the Nistadt Peace Treaty. </p><h2>  Peter I - the first Russian emperor </h2><p>  In 1721, when Russia became an empire, <span>Peter the Great,</span> by decision of the Senate and the Synod, adopted the title of All-Russian Emperor.  The first among those who recognized the new royal title of the <span>Russian Tsar</span> were Prussia and Holland.  Last - Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.  It happened only in 1764. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first Russian emperor" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/390995.jpg?1399454067794" width="399"></div>

    <p>  The All-Russian Emperor is a title that was worn by absolutely all the rulers of the Russian Empire from 1721 to 1917. </p><h2>  Reforms by Peter the Great </h2><p>  The first Russian emperor remained in history not only as a brilliant military leader, but also as a progressive reformer.  As a result of the Northern War, Russia was secured access to the sea.  The construction of a modern fleet in the Baltic has begun.  This process entailed significant changes in trade and industry.  Under Peter the Great, reforms touched everything, starting from a change in the reckoning, ending with transformations in the fields of education, religion and autocracy. </p>
