And really, what is missing here?  A clean, shallow and warm sea of ​​amazing blue, and a choice: on the one hand, Azov, and on the other - Sivash.  The steppe air, bringing amazing smells, mesmerizing screams of gulls, healing herbs and thermal springs - all this seems to attract relaxation.  The Arabat arrow, whose bases were known since the days of the Soviet Union, has now turned into one of the most wonderful corners of Ukraine.  In this article, we will only reveal to you one page of a book of this magical land that can be read endlessly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest Arabatsky arrow base" class="if" height="213" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13387/811307.jpg" width="286"></div>

    <h2>  Why go here </h2><p>  Firstly, the Sea of ​​Azov is one of the warmest and shallowest, Sivash is generally unique, and in addition, the longest sand spit in Europe invites you to relax.  The Arabat Spit, whose bases are located along the coast, is the best suited for the recovery of children.  The most famous of them are “The Seagull” (first and second), “Rainbow”, “Calypso”, “Gengorka”, “Brigantine”, “Tavria”, “Pearl of Azov”.  The water temperature in the sea in the summer heat reaches thirty degrees, and in Sivash it is just like in a bath.  But do not think that you will die here from stuffiness.  Fresh sea winds will drive away the heat and restore good spirits.  And if you can't stand the summer heat, welcome here in September!  The season here lasts a long time.  It begins in May, and continues until the fall.  But be that as it may, even in the high season a special microclimate is created here, which softens the sharpness of the scorching sun.  And desert sandy beaches, as if going to infinity, into the sea, will give you not only a beautiful tan, but also teach you meditation and philosophical attitude to problems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Treatment </h2><p>  Nature has generously awarded this corner.  The water of the Sea of ​​Azov itself contains dozens of trace elements that our body so needs.  While bathing, they penetrate the skin.  There are healing mud and healing brine.  In addition, wells with mineral water are open on the spit, which can beneficially affect both the nervous system and the pathology of bones, joints and muscles, as well as skin diseases.  On their basis, there is a balneotherapy facility, where you can perfectly combine recreation and relaxation - “Arabatskaya Strelka”.  Bases with similar equipment and qualified personnel of this level can be counted on the fingers.  They also practice underwater massage, there are special treatment pools and baths. </p><h2>  Types of housing </h2><p>  Since rest on the Arabat Spit was always very budgetary, people went here just to swim in the sea, one might say, from time immemorial.  But as a health resort, this scythe has been known for the last fifty years.  All this happened due to the discovery of the already mentioned iodine-bromine geothermal sources.  Since then thousands of vacationers have flocked here.  Moreover, the resort infrastructure is constantly evolving, and now many modern hotels and guest houses with all amenities and communications have been built here.  Therefore, many people are sure that there is only one place that can bring them a healthy, happy and comfortable stay - the Arabat arrow.  Bases, boarding houses, hospitals, hotels, the private sector - all here awaits tourists.  There are many departmental vacation spots: Neftekhimik, Shakhtostroitel, and so on, but you can buy permits there for free access.  The offers are very different, and the level of comfort depends on your demands and the ability to pay for additional services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Genichesk Arabatsky arrow" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/811015.jpg" width="253"></div>

The map of the spit shows us that there is a beautiful city of Genichesk.  Several resort villages are also not far behind in receiving vacationers.  Especially worth mentioning is <span>Genicheskaya Gorka,</span> Strelkovoye and Schastlivtsevo.  It is here that people with average incomes come who prefer reasonable prices and good quality service.  We can say that any courtyard welcomes guests and tourists here, and this year almost all the owners of houses, hotels and bases have acquired Wi-Fi.  But it is recreation centers that occupy a leading place in popularity among family people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Base Arabatsky arrow" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13387/811306.jpg" width="290"></div>

    <h2>  What to expect </h2><p>  We have already said that they continue to function since Soviet times, but, of course, the level of service has improved significantly.  And the Arabatskaya Strelka base also offers treatment.  Economical houses, familiar to us from childhood, and stone buildings complemented by cozy cottages from the real Carpathian spruce, with good furniture and excellent plumbing.  More than fifty different points of this kind accept those wishing to relax, not only from Ukraine, but also from neighboring and distant countries.  In addition, there are very affordable prices.  Many of these bases have suites and parking lots.  Some have a green area.  There are those that are located right on the beach, so that the sound of the sea is heard in the rooms.  Almost at all bases there are excursion bureaus.  From here you can go to the Askania-Nova Nature Reserve. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea of ​​Azov Arabat arrow" class="if" height="205" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/811017.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Where are they located </h2><p>  The largest settlement in these places is the city of Genichesk.  The Arabat spit goes further into the sea, as much as a hundred and ten kilometers.  But recreation facilities are located here quite locally.  The vast majority of them are located in the area of ​​the Thin Strait, near Gengorka.  Then the bases of the village of Schastlivtsevo are compactly followed by Strelkovoy.  But no matter what area you choose for your stay, after visiting these places you will always strive to return to the Sea of ​​Azov.  The Arabat arrow, with its strange, wild nature and solitude, is a rare opportunity to plunge into the world of a real, unclouded vacation. </p>
