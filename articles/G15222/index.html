And the purpose of the hotel (athletes are mainly accommodated in it) also does not promise fashionable conditions.  Prices here, according to guests, are quite reasonable.  This option is mainly of interest to budget guests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The courtyard of the hotel." class="if uuid-3102815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/3102815.jpg"></div><p>  Many guests are pleased that parking is available near the hotel (free).  The location of the hotel, residents are sharing, you can‚Äôt imagine better: it is only a five-minute drive from the center. </p><p>  At the reception, everything is organized quite simply.  Guests are warmly welcomed by a polite administrator who informs everyone about the availability of places, as well as about the cost of living.  Check-in to the rooms is fast enough, without delay.  There is no elevator in the hotel, guests are given the opportunity to use only the stairs. </p><p>  The cost of rooms, shared by tenants, often surprises with their inconsistency with the conditions provided in them.  Many reviewers claim that the price of accommodation is too low, given the excellent equipment of the premises.  For example, a single person in a double room costs 750 rubles.  per person, the stay of two guests will cost 1,500 rubles.  The authors of the reviews believe that this is a penny price for excellent accommodation in the city center. </p><p>  The rooms have everything you need for a comfortable stay.  The rooms are bright and clean.  The furniture is very simple, but practical.  In the hallway of each room there is a spacious wardrobe with a mirror.  In the rooms, residents are provided with double and one-and-a-half beds, bedside tables and a coffee table, two cups or mugs.  Boiling water can be requested from the administration.  Each of the tenants is entitled to two towels. </p><p>  An evacuation plan usually hangs on the wall in the room (if you wish, curious residents can get information about the number of rooms located on the floor, etc.).  Each room has a folder with documents on the rules of residence, price list and other information. </p><p>  All accommodations have their own toilets.  A small bathroom is equipped with a shower, toilet, hairdryer, sink with a mirror.  The bathroom provides for only wall lighting, but it is quite enough.  Hand gel is usually on the sink.  Guests must bring shampoo with them.  There is a hairdryer (worker), shower, heated towel rail, thanks to which the bathroom is not cold and, if necessary, you can dry wet things.  Water flows without interruption, both cold and hot. </p><p>  Guests consider one of the minuses that the shower does not have a stand for a shower, so it‚Äôs not very convenient to wash in it, although you can get used to it.  Residents also call a drawback that in the bathroom there is no shelf for soap accessories.  There are leaks on the ceiling in the bathroom, although they have been recently renovated. </p><p>  A big plus of the rooms, according to guests, is the presence of a refrigerator and a TV (modern flat).  As one of the minuses of the rooms, guests note the absence of ceiling light in some of them.  It is inconvenient for many people to use only wall light for reading.  Guests respond positively to the food and service at the hotel.  Ob is recommended as one of the most convenient and budget accommodation options in Barnaul. </p>
