    <p>  Therefore, if your vacation falls at the beginning of summer or early autumn, then it is better to opt for Cyprus.  Turkey is more suitable for those who expect to relax in the midst of the tourist summer season. </p><p>  Also know that if you prefer outdoor activities, discos and parties, it is best to go to the coast of Antalya.  Cypriot resorts are more suitable for families with small children. </p><h2>  The cost of trips </h2><p>  Suffering from the problem of what to choose, Turkey or Cyprus for vacation, many make the final decision when they find out about the cost of the permit.  The choice depending on the budget for many becomes decisive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you take these two countries into account, Turkey obviously wins.  Rest in hotels on the <span>coast of Antalya</span> will be much cheaper, ceteris paribus.  In addition, a visa is not required to enter the country.  Formally, a tourist visa you automatically receive at the airport. </p>

    <p>  There is no particular difficulty with a <span>visa to Cyprus</span> .  She is free.  But at the same time, you still have to get it in advance, which means spending extra time. </p><p>  So, Cyprus or Turkey?  What to choose?  At the height of the summer tourist season, a ticket to a three-star Turkish hotel will cost you from 40 to 50 thousand rubles for two.  A big plus of this holiday is that Turkish hotels operate on the famous all-inclusive system.  It implies that you eat at the buffet, that is, you have at your disposal an unlimited amount of food, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks of local production.  Therefore, having bought a ticket once, you no longer worry about accommodation, food, and most often about entertainment.  Most hotels, even three-star ones, have an entertainment program for every evening. </p><h2>  Cyprus or Turkey - what to choose in August? </h2><p>  Remember that the cost of a similar hotel in Cyprus in the same month will be much higher.  About 50 to 60 thousand rubles per couple.  The prices here are, of course, higher, but the service is appropriate.  In addition, the infrastructure itself is more developed.  One has only to say that a three-star hotel in Cyprus according to the service will correspond to a four- or five-star hotel in Turkey. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Another obvious plus of vacation in Turkey is that here you can fully relax, even without knowing any foreign languages.  The local staff has long fallen in love with Russian tourists and can freely explain on any problem that concerns you. </p><p>  At the same time, it is almost impossible to meet Russian-speaking waiters and administrators in Cyprus.  Here it is very rare.  Even on many excursions you can‚Äôt find a Russian-speaking guide.  But at the same time in Cyprus they are more favorable to tourists.  The level of service here is approaching European.  In the resorts of Cyprus you will not find the Asian obsession, which so many annoying in Turkey.  All staff are smiling, courteous and do not allow themselves familiarities. </p><p>  Summing <span>up the interim conclusion</span> in the dispute about what to choose - Cyprus or Turkey, we can say that Turkey wins due to the virtual absence of visas, low cost of trips and Russian-speaking staff.  Cyprus receives an advantage for the high level of service and unobtrusive staff. </p><h2>  Climate on vacation </h2><p>  When deciding what to choose, Turkey or Cyprus in 2017, pay attention to the weather and climate.  On the beaches of Cyprus it will be comfortable to relax from about mid-May until the very end of October.  At this time, the water in the sea warms up very quickly even after a cool night.  In addition, the island has many beaches with pure white sand.  The most famous and beloved among the guests are in Protaras and Ayia Napa. </p>

    <p>  There are practically no private beaches in Cyprus.  Almost all municipalities.  However, local authorities support them in perfect condition, so tourists have no reason to complain about anything.  Many of the coastal areas have been awarded the international <span>Blue Flag</span> mark <span>,</span> which indicates the cleanliness of the beach and sea water. </p><p>  Enough pebble and sandy beaches in Turkey.  Cleopatra's beach is especially popular in the Alanya region.  All decent hotels are located on the first line, almost by the sea.  Most hotels have their own beaches.  Sun loungers and extra amenities are sometimes provided for a fee. </p><p>  So, you are going to Turkey or Cyprus in October.  What to choose between these two resort countries?  Remember the main thing, the climate, in particular the temperature of the water, is almost identical here.  By the way, in October in both countries 25 degrees of heat.  The water temperature does not differ much in other months of the holiday season. </p><p>  And what to choose - Cyprus or Turkey - in September?  In Turkey, the water warms up to 28 degrees, and in Cyprus to 27. The number of beaches here is very large, and their condition is close to perfect.  So, choosing according to this criterion will not be easy. </p><h2>  What to see at the resorts? </h2><p>  Of course, both countries, first of all, suggest a beach holiday.  But sooner or later, he bothers even the most passionate lovers to soak up the sun.  Then it's time to go on excursions.  The number of attractions is another factor that will help determine: Cyprus or Turkey to choose.  September 2017 is considered a very favorable time for educational trips.  The air temperature during the day is not so high, so moving and sightseeing is much easier. </p>

    <p>  It is worth recognizing that both of these countries are famous for a large number of architectural and historical monuments.  In Turkey, you can go on an educational tour to the capital Istanbul, visit and improve your health at the thermal spas in Pamukkale, visit the ancient cities of Troy, Side or Ephesus. </p><p>  At the same time, the choice of attractions in Cyprus is much more modest.  But here you can find beautiful palaces and temples.  Travel guides advise you not to book an excursion, but to rent a car and enjoy the beauties of this island on your own. </p><h2>  If you went with children </h2><p>  Rest with children involves a certain level of service that you expect from the host.  Turkey is famous for its diverse animation programs for both children and adults.  Some hotels hold incendiary discos until the morning.  In others, on the contrary, in a small territory of tourists, family bungalows are placed in isolated from each other.  This is a great option for a large family vacation. </p>

    <p>  In the resorts of Cyprus, the atmosphere is much more calm and measured.  In abundance of pools and playgrounds for the smallest.  In addition, the political situation also speaks in favor of Cyprus, which is much calmer on the island than in Turkey. </p><h2>  Cost of food </h2><p>  Admittedly, eating at the resorts of Cyprus is not cheap.  Prices practically do not differ from those that can be found in French tourist cities.  For lunch or dinner with drinks, you will have to pay from 20 to 30 euros for each guest. </p><p>  In this regard, Turkey looks much more preferable, even if you do not use the famous all-inclusive system.  True, in stores expensive alcohol.  Still, this is a Muslim country.  For example, the price of a bottle of brandy can reach $ 20.  Therefore, most tourists prefer to eat and drink exclusively in hotels. </p>
