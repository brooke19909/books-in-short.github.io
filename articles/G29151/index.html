    <h2>  When is the best time to wake up? </h2><p>  Rest time does not pass monotonously.  In a dream, one phase replaces another.  The best option, according to scientists, is awakening during the mild phase.  If the alarm clock wakes up at a time when the dream is deep, then you may feel bruised and feeling as if there was no night rest at all. </p><p>  But there is such an option that, having overslept quite a bit, a person is charged with a lot of energy and has a great time all his next day.  This, as a rule, occurs precisely because he woke up during the fast <span>phase of sleep.</span>  Well, if a person can do it himself.  Well, if that does not work out, then an excellent modern device comes to the rescue. </p>

    <h2>  Smart Sleep Time app </h2><p>  You can install Sleep Time on your iPhone.  The application operates as follows: an alarm clock is set and placed next to the pillow.  The screen should be pointing down.  The phone will read the movements of a person and thus determine the onset phase of sleep.  When the necessary time approaches for awakening, it is activated.  Thus, according to the owners, a smart alarm clock with phases of sleep guarantees a pleasant morning with a sense of good spirits and good mood. </p><h2>  Smart Pillow App </h2><p>  Another great app is Pillow.  Sleep tracking is performed using special sensors: a microphone and an accelerometer.  In this way, movements during sleep and breathing are tracked.  There are paid and free versions of the application.  But the main function works in both of them.  When the alarm goes off, the volume starts from zero and gradually reaches 70%.  If at this time you touch the screen with your hand, the volume will decrease and after a few seconds the sound will disappear.  But the mechanism will work again after ten minutes in the same mode. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Smart app Smart Alarm Clock </h2><p>  For Android, as mentioned, you can download Smart Alarm Clock.  The application works in much the same way as the options described above.  The following functions are available for it: </p><ul><li>  you can independently choose in which phase of sleep you want to wake up; </li><li>  all sounds are recorded; </li><li>  statistics on <span>sleep cycles</span> and their phases; </li><li>  special music is offered for falling asleep, as well as for awakening; </li><li>  weather forecast available. </li></ul>

    <h2>  The smart app WakeUp OrDie!  Alarm clock </h2><p>  This application is also intended for Android.  He is considered one of the most unsuccessful.  Usually a smart alarm clock with phases of sleep, trying to wake up its owner, falls silent and gives you a little more sleep, and then again declares itself.  But this is definitely not a description of WakeUp OrDie!  Alarm Clock.  The device will ring until a green monster in it disappears.  And for this, the smartphone needs to be shaken well. </p><p>  There are practically no settings in this application, the owners note.  All that can be done is to set the necessary time, turn on the vibrating function, and also select a smoothly growing melody. </p><h2>  Smart app "Buddhist" </h2><p>  This is an interesting app.  When activated, it seems that in the morning it‚Äôs not an electronic device that wakes up, but a real person, only a stranger.  To get this unusual opportunity, they first register in a special service, after which they set the necessary time.  Now you can go to bed. </p><p>  When the very moment ‚ÄúX‚Äù comes, another registered user of the same service will wake Sonya.  In almost all cases, calls for one or the other are free.  The only exceptions are calls for those who are in roaming. </p><h2>  Stationary Alarms </h2><p>  The most common of these types are Axbo alarms.  The gadget is in the form of a box with an integrated processor inside.  A special wristband is attached to it, due to which the heart rate during sleep is read.  Thus, a smart alarm clock feels like a phase of sleep.  The device works from the network, and understanding its essence is not particularly difficult. </p><p>  But for those who still doubt the need to purchase these watches, you should first try to download a free or paid application on your smartphone.  Then there may be a more accurate opinion of him.  Users respond well about the device, it‚Äôs easy to figure it out on their own. </p><p>  Well, those who decide to purchase this smart alarm clock should prepare +/- twelve thousand rubles.  It is in this amount that the purchase of the device will cost. </p>

    <p>  So, the heartbeat will now be under control, due to which it can be decided when the training should be strengthened, and when it is better to stop and finish it.  But the main thing that interests us is a smart alarm clock.  The bracelet with its help monitors the phases of sleep in the same way as in other gadgets.  It is placed on the arm and go to bed.  Ergonomic design makes the device almost invisible, which is very important during sleep.  It will hardly be felt on the hand.  But for especially susceptible natures this need can be circumvented.  After all, a tablet from a gadget can easily be attached to night pajamas.  And he will continue to read just as easily the necessary information in order to wake his master at the most suitable time for this. </p><p>  The price range for devices varies greatly depending on the functionality that is built into them.  However, to date, almost everything, even the simplest devices, have a smart alarm sensor.  Devices can be purchased in various <span>price ranges, the</span> cost ranges from a thousand rubles to sixteen thousand and above. </p><p>  A significant advantage is the water resistance of the bracelet, which makes it possible to stay with him in the pool or while taking a shower. </p><p>  A more serious device of this type is a watch with a smart alarm clock.  They have impressive functionality and a spectacular beautiful design.  However, at the same time, watches are more bulky.  Therefore, sleeping with them for some people may seem problematic and uncomfortable.  And the cost of these devices is much higher than bracelets.  So, the price range ranges from two and a half thousand to sixty-five thousand rubles and above. </p>
