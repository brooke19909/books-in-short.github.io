The hostel seemed cozy to some, but for others it left a lot of negative impressions. </p><p>  In the responses, guests write that they are satisfied with this hostel.  The big plus is the location.  Walk to the nearest metro station for no more than 7 minutes.  Nearby there is a train station, a bus stop and many attractions.  On the way to the place of overnight, you can go to fast food restaurants (there are at least 3 of them along the way), as well as a grocery store.  The hostel itself, at first glance, is cozy and bright.  The reception is a friendly receptionist.  Documents are drawn up quickly and with a smile.  They talk about the rules of accommodation and service.  The room seems cramped for 12 people.  When the number is full, it becomes uncomfortable.  Save the curtains on the beds.  The big minus is that there is only one outlet near each berth.  As for showers and toilets, they spoiled the whole impression of the hostel.  Of course, one cannot blame the administration for the fact that the sanitary rooms are dirty, for the most part the guests are to blame.  A cleaning lady is cleaning daily, but this is not enough. </p><p>  According to the reviews of guests who stayed in a family room, the ‚ÄúCome in‚Äù hostel on Paveletskaya in Moscow, the address of which was mentioned above, is ideal for tourists.  Value for money at this hotel is top-notch.  Large spacious kitchen with everything you need liked the guests.  Guests who settled at night were delighted to have a vending machine with sweets and free tea and coffee. </p><p>  Of the minuses in the reviews, customers write that the rooms and showers are dirty.  There is an unpleasant odor.  In rooms for 12 people, guests do not observe silence.  It is noisy at night in the corridors.  Street Kozhevnicheskaya, house 19 (hostel "Come in") - quite a crowded place, so extraneous sounds come from the street too.  In the kitchen, some noticed cockroaches.  Dishes were often lacking.  The fridge has an unpleasant odor. </p><p>  In the reviews, guests write that the hostel can stay overnight.  However, you must understand that with the full filling of large rooms a comfortable stay should not be expected.  Those who want to sleep in silence, it is better to take a family room.  As for breakfast, the guests speak about them well.  Invigorating coffee and nutritious porridge are what you need in the morning. </p><p>  For those who come to the hostel "Come in", registration is carried out around the clock.  All customers must go through a security point.  The employee does not let people intoxicated and inappropriately into the territory of the mini-hotel.  When registering, you must leave a symbolic fee (security deposit), which is returned after eviction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vashotel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="restroom" class="if uuid-2968307" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2968307.jpg"></div><p>  In the reviews, guests say that the hostel "Come in" (how to get there, described above) is in a convenient location.  The big name above the building, which glows in the evening, helps to find the right place from afar.  If there are any difficulties with finding the right point, then the administrator will help you (by phone).  A big plus is clean and fresh linens.  The downside is the lack of air conditioning and poor soundproofing. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Hostel "Come in" on "Paveletskaya" in Moscow is a good place for an overnight stay.  For a small price, guests are given the opportunity to spend the night in the center of the capital.  The mini-hotel has everything you need for personal hygiene and cooking.
