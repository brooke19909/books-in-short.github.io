It is based on the fact that paper books began to be sold much less frequently, and circulations of even the most popular publications are falling.  But this does not mean that the modern world is not reading. </p><p>  Since we live in the era of information technology, and a variety of gadgets have captivated our lives, this is also reflected in books.  Now people prefer to spend money once and buy an e-book than to go to the store every month in search of the desired work. </p><p>  Gadgets such as electronic books are not only convenient and easy to use, they provide an opportunity to save a significant amount and provide access to literature at any time of the day.  You can not say about bookstores.  Indeed, if it suddenly happens that you want to read ‚ÄúAnna Karenina‚Äù at three in the morning, the bookstore will not open its doors, but the e-book will help out 100%. </p><p>  Another significant plus of ‚Äúreaders‚Äù is compactness.  In one small device, you can put together a whole library and easily take your gadget with you on vacation.  You no longer have to carry heavy books in your backpack.  It remains to find out which company is better than e-books. </p><h2>  How to choose a reader? </h2><p>  Now the e-book market is full of various products, it‚Äôs quite difficult to choose the best from a thousand, especially for beginners.  Therefore, having analyzed the ratio of price and quality, fans of reading compiled a list of the best gadgets to read.  In addition to functionality, it is worth answering the question of which e-book is better for the eyes. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Representatives were selected based on the following criteria: technical specifications and functionality, price and quality compliance, customer reviews and expert opinion of professionals. </p><p>  Which ebooks are the best? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aspirasi-ndp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="electronic books" class="if uuid-2404362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76877/2404362.jpg"></div><h2>  Gmini MagicBook S62LHD </h2><p>  Opens the list of the best e-books Gmini MagicBook S62LHD.  The reader is notable for its small size, the diagonal is only 6 inches.  Such a book will fit even in the smallest handbag. </p><p>  For its low price, the manufacturer provides us with a decent e-book with a stylish design, backlight for reading in the dark and low weight.  What else do you need for reading travelers? </p><p>  Gmini MagicBook differs from its counterparts in this price segment in that it holds a charge much longer than its counterparts.  The battery capacity is 1500 mAh, this allows you to regularly use the gadget and charge it only 2 times a week. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the backlight of the book is not bright, the eyes do not get tired while reading, which allows you to spend a long time reading your favorite book without harm to health.  They will help to make the right choice in the question of which e-book is better - the price of the goods. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What is the plus? </h2><p>  Judging by customer reviews, the following advantages and disadvantages can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  The book is made of quality material. </li><li>  It features a powerful battery. </li><li>  Functionality allows you to adjust the brightness of the backlight for the desired lighting. </li><li>  The book does not have a screen rotation, which can become a hindrance to a comfortable reading. </li><li>  Some owners complain of insufficient internal memory. </li></ul><p>  As we see the merits of the book clearly outperform the flaws.  Therefore, if you are in search of a budget ‚Äúreader‚Äù, pay attention to this instance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="top ebooks" class="if uuid-2407799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76877/2407799.jpg"></div><h2>  Reader book 2 </h2><p>  Easy to use and affordable Reader Book 2 has already won the hearts of millions of readers around the world.  Buyers boldly attribute the gadget to budget options.  And although the cost of the book is low, this fact did not affect the appearance and quality of the assembly. </p><p>  The book differs from its counterparts in that it does not have control buttons, so you have to turn the pages through the sensor, and this, as practice shows, is much more convenient.  The gadget reads all the popular and commonly used text formats; it is nimble due to the power of the processor. </p><p>  If the question is which backlit e-book is better, then Reader Book 2 wins in its price category. </p><h2>  What do the reviews say? </h2><p>  From the reviews of the owners, we can draw the following conclusions: </p><ul><li>  Fairly low price. </li><li>  Stylish design and quality assembly. </li><li>  Read almost all available formats. </li><li>  The complete absence of buttons and control via the sensor. </li><li>  Scanty equipment. </li><li>  E-Ink display, built-in backlight and Wi-Fi. </li></ul><p>  Why should you prefer books with an E-Ink display?  They called this type of display "electronic ink" and at the moment this technology for displaying text on a reading device is the best on the market.  The essence of the work of such a display is to imitate an ordinary book so as not to harm the eyes with long reading.  Also, such a display is characterized by low energy consumption, which allows you to charge the device as rarely as possible, even with active use. </p><p>  For those who are used to reading at night, manufacturers have provided a backlight that copes with the lighting function even in the most adverse conditions.  And a little secret: if your book does not support such a function, you can always purchase external lighting. </p><p>  The book also supports Wi-Fi.  But why e-book this feature, you ask?  Its only plus is updating the library through a network connection.  You will no longer have to connect the ‚Äúreader‚Äù to the computer using the cable.  Which format is better for an e-book?  Pay attention to TXT, RTF, FB2, EPUB, MOBI, DOC, PDF, DJVU. </p><h2>  PocketBook 640 </h2><p>  The undoubted leader in the category of price and quality ratio is the <span>PocketBook 640.</span> It is notable for its small size - the device‚Äôs diagonal is 6 inches.

Therefore, if you decide to go to the park, lie on the grass, the clear sky and the bright sun will not interfere with spending time with the benefit and pleasure of reading your favorite book. </p><p>  The device is also equipped with Wi-Fi and does not require a permanent connection to a computer.  The battery capacity is 1300 mAh, judging by the reviews of one charge, it lasts up to three weeks of regular reading.  At the moment, PocketBook 640 is one of the most popular models in its segment.
