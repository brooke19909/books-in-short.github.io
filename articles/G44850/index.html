The need for such an indicator may arise in different cases, but it is most often required when registering the status of a poor family.  This status allows you to use different measures of support from the state.  Therefore, citizens should understand how to calculate the average per capita income of a family.  This process can be performed independently using the appropriate formula, and you can also use special online calculators that freely creep on the Internet. </p><h2>  When do you need to calculate an indicator? </h2><p>  Calculation of per capita family income may be required for various reasons.  These include: </p><ul><li>  citizens want to determine how much money is spent on each family member; </li><li>  the status of the poor is drawn up; </li><li>  people want to plan their family budget competently and effectively. </li></ul><p>  Most often, the need for this indicator arises if people receive a small income, and therefore want to receive support from the state.  In this case, you need to prove that they are ranked among poor citizens.  If for every member of the same family there is too little money, then people can count on different benefits and preferences.  Therefore, they must know how to calculate the average family income. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to calculate the average family income" class="if uuid-3030480" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3030480.jpg"></div><h2>  The amount of income for registration of benefits </h2><p>  To take advantage of different social preferences intended exclusively for low-income citizens, it is important that one family member has less than the cost of living multiplied by 1.5. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The cost of living is set by the regional authorities of each city, so it may vary slightly in different regions.  For example, in the capital, this figure is 16160 rubles.  In order for citizens to be able to apply to social protection bodies to apply for various benefits and preferences, the income per family member should be less than 24,240 rubles. </p><h2>  Calculation Rules </h2><p>  The value of the average per capita income of the family is individual, therefore this indicator is significantly different for each citizen.  It depends on him whether a person has the right to contact the representatives of social protection bodies to arrange various preferences.  The amount of these benefits may vary in different regions. </p><p>  When calculating the indicator, the following parameters are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  it is important to take into account all cash receipts in the family; </li><li>  even the scholarship received by students, as well as the pension paid to older family members, is taken into account; </li><li>  the calculation can be carried out independently in advance to determine the possibility of applying for social protection; </li><li>  social service employees make their own calculations based on documents received from applicants, and they also request extracts from banks or the tax service to reveal all hidden income. </li></ul><p>  If people use any tricks to draw up various support measures, then if they find out that they transmitted fictitious documents, all types of help will be canceled, and deceivers will have to pay a significant fine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livestrong.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="procedure for calculating the average per capita income of a family" class="if uuid-3030484" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3030484.jpg"></div><h2>  Who can be ranked as members of the same family? </h2><p>  Before calculating the average per capita income of a family, you should decide who exactly belongs to this family.  This includes the following persons: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  official spouses engaged in joint farming; </li><li>  their kids; </li><li>  other relatives living in the same territory and leading the same household; </li><li>  other persons who do not have kinship, but under certain conditions they can be recognized as members of the same family. </li></ul><p>  An exact definition of persons who are members of the same family is contained in Art.  2 SC and in Art.  31 LCD  All citizens must live in the same property, and they must have a residence permit in this territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="feminist.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="family per capita income law" class="if uuid-3030485" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3030485.jpg"></div><h2>  Who is not part of the family? </h2><p>  The following persons are not included in the family: </p><ul><li>  children who are adult citizens with their own household, therefore they have a residence permit at a different address; </li><li>  parents deprived of their rights to children; </li><li>  citizens in military service; </li><li>  people serving sentences for various crimes in prisons; </li><li>  children supported by the state. </li></ul><p>  People living in a civil marriage are not legally members of the same family.  Therefore, they will not be able to count on state support, even if they are engaged in joint farming. </p><h2>  What is included in the average family income? </h2><p>  When calculating this indicator, all cash receipts to the family are taken into account.  They can be received by grandmothers, parents and even children.  All incomes that citizens may have for personal purposes are taken into account.  These include the following cash receipts: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  salary from official places of work of citizens; </li><li>  compensation paid to persons engaged in the implementation of public duties; </li><li>  various social benefits represented by unemployment benefits, pensions or maternity transfers; </li><li>  severance pay paid upon reduction of a citizen at the place of employment; </li><li>  temporary disability benefits; </li><li>  alimony; </li><li>  scholarships assigned to students in different universities; </li><li>  surcharges, allowances, bonuses and fees; </li><li>  interest received due to the presence of a deposit in the bank; </li><li>  profit that goes to the family as a result of doing business; </li><li>  money and property received by inheritance; </li><li>  funds donated to a family member; </li><li>  rent for the transfer of real estate or car rental. </li></ul><p>  During the calculation, taxes paid on received funds are not taken into account.  Only knowing the information about all incomes can you determine the average per capita income of a family in Moscow or another region. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.talentedladiesclub.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to calculate the average family income" class="if uuid-3030486" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3030486.jpg"></div><h2>  What cash receipts are not taken into account? </h2><p>  There are some revenues that should not be used during settlement.  According to the law, the average family income does not include the following cash receipts: </p><ul><li>  money earned by adult children living separately from their parents; </li><li>  funds paid by the state to children on state support; </li><li>  payments assigned to the spouse in the process of training in any military institution. </li></ul><p>  Citizens should notify social security employees about the availability of such income, but these incomes do not increase the average per capita income. </p><h2>  For what period is the calculation performed? </h2><p>  Before calculating the average per capita income of a family, it is important to understand how long this process takes.  According to a single technique, information is used for three months. </p><p>  If any citizen receives a salary or other income in the form of foreign currency, then a recalculation is made.  For this, the exchange rate valid on the settlement date is used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.psychoterapiabrzozow.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to calculate the average per capita income of a family" class="if uuid-3030481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3030481.jpg"></div><h2>  What is the formula used? </h2><p>  The procedure for calculating the average per capita family income involves the use of a simple and understandable formula: </p><p>  Income per family member = total family income / 3 months / number of members of one family. </p><p>  If the main purpose of the calculation is the assignment of a subsidy, then income information for six months rather than three months may be required.  In this case, the formula uses 6 instead of 3. </p><h2>  Calculation Example </h2><p>  To understand how to calculate the average per capita income of a family, it is recommended to use approximate calculations.  For example, in one apartment spouses, two children and a grandmother are registered and live together.  A man and a woman are officially employed, and their total salary is 48 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Grandmother receives a pension of 19 thousand rubles.  One child is studying at the university on a full-time basis and on a budgetary basis, so he receives a monthly scholarship in the amount of 1.8 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Based on these data, the calculation is made: per capita income = (48000 + 19000 + 1800) / 3/4 = 5733 rubles.  The resulting indicator is compared with the size of the subsistence level established in the region where citizens live.  If the income per person is less than the minimum, then you can contact the social security department to arrange different preferences, as the family is recognized as poor. </p><p>  Understanding how to calculate the average per capita income of a family is actually very simple.  Thanks to this, it can be determined whether citizens can count on state aid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rmmortgagesolutions.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="average per capita family income in Moscow" class="if uuid-3030487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3030487.jpg"></div><h2>  Calculation using the online calculator </h2><p>  If citizens do not want to use the standard formula for various reasons, they can get the necessary information using a special online calculator.  Such programs are freely available on the Internet. </p><p>  For the calculation, you must enter the necessary information in a special form.  They are represented by the number of family members, income received and the number of months for which the calculation is made.  With the help of such a program, you can quickly get the desired indicator. </p><h2>  How to register the status of the poor? </h2><p>  Information on how to calculate the average per capita income of a family is required in order to determine whether citizens can rely on different types of state aid.  If their income is less than the subsistence level, then they can contact the social protection authorities for registration of numerous preferences.  To do this, they prepare the following documentation: </p><ul><li>  personal documents for each family member submitted by passports or birth certificates; </li><li>  extract from the house book, confirming that specific people are really registered in one real estate; </li><li>  certificates from workplaces containing information on the salary of each adult family member; </li><li>  certificate of marriage; </li><li>  certificates from the PF, if citizens receive pensions or benefits from this fund; </li><li>  documentation from the educational institution that contains information about the amount of the scholarship received by the student; </li><li>  a certificate from the employment center if an adult is registered with this organization; </li><li>  extract from the USRN, including data on all real estate objects belonging to the family; </li><li>  other documents with which you can confirm other cash receipts, and this includes the declaration of 3-personal income tax, statements from current accounts or the declaration of the individual entrepreneur on the basis of the applicable tax regime; </li><li>  bank statements. </li></ul><p>  Other papers may be needed if necessary.  All of them must be original documents.  It is not allowed to in any way falsify the information contained in these papers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tennessean.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="per capita family income" class="if uuid-3030483" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3030483.jpg"></div><h2>  Responsibility for providing false information </h2><p>  Before calculating the average per capita income of a family, you should collect documentation confirming the flow of money to citizens.  Often, when referring to social protection bodies, people deliberately hide any income in order to obtain the status of the poor. </p><p>  If such a violation is detected by citizens, then this leads to the following negative consequences: </p><ul><li>  people are deprived of the right to use various benefits, privileges and preferences; </li><li>  they pay a heavy fine; </li><li>  It is required to return all previously received funds from the state. </li></ul><p>  Additionally, people can be prosecuted.  Therefore, if citizens wish to receive assistance from the state, then they must transmit to the representative of social protection only original documents regarding the income received. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.darpanmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="calculation of per capita family income" class="if uuid-3030482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3030482.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In order for citizens to receive state aid, they must prove that the family is ranked among the poor.  To do this, you need to understand how to calculate the average per capita income of a family.  The procedure can be performed independently using a special formula or through online calculators.  Assistance is granted if the income per citizen is less than the subsistence level. </p><p>  Employees of social protection bodies independently carry out settlements on the basis of official documents received from the applicant.  Using the results obtained, various preferences and support measures are assigned. </p>
