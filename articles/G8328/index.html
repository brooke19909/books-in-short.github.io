    <p>  Almost all rooms offer scenic sea or pool views.  The bathroom is spacious enough.  The furniture is new, the bedding is clean, the towels are snow-white.  The walls need repair, but the eye quickly gets used to this shortcoming.  Of the toiletries, there is only soap and paper.  Everything else must be brought with you. </p><p>  They clean the rooms efficiently and quickly.  Towels are changed daily.  Bed linen - once every three days.  Guests must clean the balcony on their own. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  Breakfast is included in the price.  The food is monotonous, but you do not have to starve.  In the morning on the table you can see several types of sausages, cheese, olives, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãvegetables, eggs in several variations, beans in tomato sauce, cottage cheese with toppings, muffins, croissants, cookies, pies, cereals.  Drinks include tea, coffee and hot chocolate.  From fruits only pineapples and oranges. </p><p>  According to vacationers, the menu is good for three stars. </p><p>  Guests have the opportunity to order dinner at the hotel.  It costs such a pleasure of 12 euros per person.  But for the kind of money you can eat in neighboring taverns, where food is more diverse. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The sea is very close.  Just cross the road and you will find yourself on a wonderful beach.  Cars practically do not drive here, and there is a traffic light.  The beach is equipped with sunbeds, umbrellas, locker rooms and showers.  You can eat and quench your thirst in a <span>beach tent.</span> </p><p>  Sunset at sea is convenient.  There are stones, but they do not interfere if you swim near the coast.  After the ridge of stones, sand is again, so you can just swim over it.  The sea is amazing in color, very warm and clean.  No waves, no storms in the area.  But on the opposite coast, the sea is constantly raging. </p><p>  Of the inconveniences, it is worth noting the fact that by evening the wind rises on the coast and carries sand.  It is almost impossible to be ashore. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  Communication in the hotel is not always.  The Internet sometimes does not catch at all, and sometimes it can be used even in the room.  The speed is low.  But in all the nearest cafes you can get free Wi-Fi access. </p><h2>  Car rental </h2><p>  In Greece, you need to rent a car.  This will greatly simplify and reduce the cost of sightseeing trips.  The cost of the car is about 30 euros per day, along with insurance, and do not worry that you will somehow damage the car.  Locals do not follow the rules of the road.  You need to be prepared for this.  But the intense movement is only in Rhodes.  You need to ride calmly and carefully. </p><h2>  Places near the hotel </h2><p>  There are wonderful taverns along the promenade.  Prices are different, but the food is delicious everywhere, except for the pizzeria.  Here, pizza is not impressive, and the service, according to vacationers, is poor. </p><p>  On the other side there are also cafes, but more expensive and crowded. </p><p>  The best choice is a tavern located at the crossroads, if you walk along the pool.  Here are the lowest prices and the largest portions.  For 15 euros you can get a salad, side dish, sweets and drinks.  One serving is enough for two adults. </p><p>  Almost all taverns bring bread that is not in the order, but then it is included in the bill.  If you do not eat it, then it is better to immediately refuse.  At the same time, they can bring you a dessert that you also did not order, but in most cases it is a gift from the establishment. </p><p>  Near the hotel there is a supermarket and a large store with low prices.  On the contrary - a fruit market. </p><h2>  Interesting places </h2><p>  By renting a car, you can travel to almost all the attractions of the island.  The road to the old town takes only 20 minutes.  This is an incredibly atmospheric place.  There are many shops, there is an aquarium, a promenade.  Greek cuisine is very satisfying, so evening walks along the sea are simply necessary. </p><p>  The old city is a real fairy tale.  Here you can stay forever and every time you feel new emotions.  Shopping, dinners in taverns, coffee, sunset - all this is fascinating and makes you come back here again and again. </p><p>  There are not many interesting places on the island.  You should definitely visit 7 sources.  Butterfly Park - an attraction for an amateur.  It is better to come here at the end of summer. </p><p>  There are a lot of temple buildings in Rhodes.  Particularly noteworthy are places such as Lindos, the ancient city of Kamiros, the Baths of Kalisei.  On the way there are many picturesque bays where you can swim and sunbathe, taking with you an umbrella.  The sun in Greece is just merciless. </p><p>  Filerimos is famous for its viewing platform, church and peacocks, which can be hand-fed. </p><p>  Experienced tourists say that at least once you need to meet the sunset in the castles of Monolithos and Kritinia.  It is completely free, and the views that open leave a lasting impression. </p><p>  By ferry you can go to the island of Symi.  A ticket at the port is much cheaper than tour operators.  You can even go to Turkey for a day.  By the way, in Marmaris there is an opportunity to get new things. </p><p>  Rhodes is definitely worth a visit.  The most friendly Greeks live here.  And the Lomeniz Hotel 3 * hotel will allow you to spend your holidays with high quality and inexpensive. </p>
