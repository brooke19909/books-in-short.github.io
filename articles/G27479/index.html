The monument is dedicated to Belarusian children aged 8 to 14 years, from whom all blood was taken for officer hospitals of the Nazi army.  Truly, the most terrible place in Belarus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourister.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to children - victims of fascism" class="if uuid-2810938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2810938.jpg"></div><p>  A must-see is the palace and park ensemble - Gatovsky's estate.

The temple operated until 1932, and after that was used as an archive.  Unfortunately, the war years did not spare the magnificent building, and in the summer of 1941 the church was destroyed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelroomsearch.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holy Trinity Church" class="if uuid-2811078" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2811078.jpg"></div><p>  Now, at the place where the white-stone temple once stood, a new church has been erected to welcome guests with a bell chime. </p><p>  One of the oldest attractions in Zhlobin is the Intercession Church, the construction of which began in 1807.  The temple is built in the shape of a cross.  Due to the fact that the Intercession Church is an architectural monument of Classicism, it was untouched during the years of the persecution of the Orthodox Church. </p><p>  During the Soviet era, a salt warehouse, a restaurant and even a stable operated in the church.  In 1989, the temple began to be restored, in 1991 - it was consecrated.  Today, every guest of the city can pray in the Intercession Church. </p><p>  A must-see is the Pirevichi Church of All Saints.  Its area is more than 500 m <sup>2</sup> .
