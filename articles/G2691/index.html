Reasons, ways to accelerate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Beeline mobile operator provides traffic with package offers that are valid for a month.  At the same time, very active users often encounter a situation where it is still far from the end of the current period, and access to the Network is already limited or completely closed.  What to do if the Internet speed on Beeline has dropped?  In this case, the operator provides subscribers with a solution - extra speed.  I wonder what this option is and how to use it.  Then read on. </p><h2>  Ways to Increase Internet Speed </h2><p>  Today, Beeline subscribers are offered two options: the acquisition of additional traffic or the extension of speed by activating the options "Extend speed" and "Automatic renewal".  They are available if the Internet speed from Beeline on the phone or modem has fallen when using the ‚ÄúAll‚Äù and ‚ÄúHighway‚Äù tariff plans with a limited amount of traffic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gadgetpark.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline Internet speed dropped on the phone" class="if uuid-2865778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45096/2865778.jpg"></div><p>  Each service is divided into two subspecies and makes it possible to select the desired amount of additional Internet according to the needs of the subscriber.  We will consider each of them in more detail and analyze a useful option for automated speed extension; it can be used if the speed of the home Internet from Beeline or mobile has fallen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Option "Extend Speed" </h2><p>  You can find out the amount of remaining traffic by dialing a simple combination of numbers on the device: * 102 #.  If the traffic provided by the tariff has really ended, then the ‚ÄúProlong Speed‚Äù service will make it possible to stay in touch.  The company has provided for this several ways in accordance with the needs of subscribers.  They differ in the amount of additional megabytes and the price, so each client will be able to choose what is suitable specifically in his case.  The user can complete the service before the end of the billing period.  The price of the package will depend on the region of location. </p><h2>  1 GB Internet increase </h2><p>  If the speed of the Internet at Beeline has dropped, and only a few days are left before the end of the month, then it is most advisable to activate the option of minimum renewal by 1 GB.  Such a measure will be quite enough.  The price of the service is 100 rubles.  If you want to use the offer to increase speed, the indicated amount will be written off from the subscriber‚Äôs account.  To connect, you need to dial 0674093221 on the device. This is not the only way.  There is a combination even easier: * 115 * 121 #, then the call button.  The Internet will work much faster immediately after dialing a phone number or code. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mag-m.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline has dropped the speed of mobile Internet" class="if uuid-2865779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45096/2865779.jpg"></div><h2>  3 and 4 GB acceleration </h2><p>  If the user is a lot of time on the Web and the speed dropped pretty quickly, then 1 GB for him will definitely not be enough.  Depending on the region of location, users are provided with the service of increasing traffic by 3 and 4 GB.  The price in this case increases to 200 and 500 rubles, respectively.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãincrease is available until the end of the billing period on the tariffs "All" and "Highway".  The duration of use of the service may not exceed 30 days.  To activate the option, dial the code * 115 * 122 # or number 0674093222 from your device.  The Internet will start to work faster immediately after sending the request.  With such a gigabyte volume, watching movies, websites and transferring data will not cause any problems. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Extra Traffic Rate </h2><p>  When you connect the additional traffic service, if the speed of the mobile Internet from Beeline has dropped, it will entirely depend on the Network in the region where you are located.  The size of the package provided in this case does not matter.  For 2 GB traffic, this indicator is 236 Kbps, and for 4 GB - 74 Mbps.  If the type of 3G network is used in the region, then the subscriber will use the Internet at a maximum speed of 14.4 Mbit / s.  In addition, this indicator depends on the model of the modem used.  The option is not available if roaming is activated, only subscribers located in Russia can use it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.satvision-cctv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why the speed of the Internet beeline fell" class="if uuid-2865780" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45096/2865780.jpg"></div><h2>  Other service connection methods </h2><p>  If the speed of the Internet from Beeline on the phone has fallen, then additional gigabytes can be purchased in one of several available ways.  Ordering an additional 1, 3 or 4 GB is available through your account.  To do this, you need to log in to the personal page of the official Beeline portal and fill out an application in the appropriate section. </p><p>  In addition, the subscriber can call the operator number 0611 from his device. The representative of the organization will perform all necessary actions, after which the Internet will be available to the user at high speed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Another way to solve the problem when the speed of the Internet on the Beeline modem has dropped is to go to the office of the company.  The unit employee will answer all questions and connect the desired option.  As you can see, there are enough options for increasing speed, so each subscriber will be able to solve the problem in a convenient way. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zen.yandex.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why the speed of the Internet beeline fell on the phone" class="if uuid-2865781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45096/2865781.jpg"></div><h2>  Auto Renew Option </h2><p>  If you do not intend to find out why the Internet speed on Beeline has dropped, and it is important for you to always be able to enter the Network, then the automatic renewal service will definitely interest you.  When the Internet package comes to an end, the system activates an additional speed of 100 MB or 5 GB, depending on the user's choice.  Auto-renewal of 100 MB is allowed on the tariffs ‚ÄúZero Doubts‚Äù, ‚ÄúWelcome‚Äù, ‚ÄúVsesechka‚Äù, ‚ÄúAll‚Äù in versions 1 and 2. At the end of one package, the following is triggered.  The cost of each of them is 50 rubles. </p><p>  5 GB automatic renewal works on the ‚ÄúAll‚Äù tariff in version 3, 4 and 5.  The option is activated immediately after the end of the main traffic.  Each next 5 GB will cost the user 150 rubles.  This option can be connected on other tariffs either independently or as an addition to the ‚ÄúHighway‚Äù option. </p><p>  Both versions of the speed extension service are connected and disconnected by typing one command.  On all the above tariff plans, the auto-renewal service is activated by the system as soon as the main packet traffic ends, since it is built-in. </p><p>  On other tariffs, including archive ones, only the initial version can be independently connected - a package of 70 MB.  Its cost is 20 rubles.  If the option is not included initially, then it can be connected independently by entering the command * 115 * 23 # or by calling the number 0674717781. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.belnovosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline Internet speed dropped" class="if uuid-2865782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45096/2865782.jpg"></div><h2>  Shutdown </h2><p>  To refuse automatic speed extension, you will need to dial * 115 * 230 # or call 0674717780. Important!  The action of the additional traffic services ‚ÄúProlong Speed‚Äù and ‚ÄúAuto Renew‚Äù has a time limit - it is necessary to spend additional purchased megabytes and gigabytes before the start of the next billing period and the activation of a new main package.  Otherwise, they are reset to zero. </p><h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  Sometimes, to increase the speed of Beeline, it is not necessary to activate an additional Internet package.  Settings can help solve this problem.  We will analyze the available options in more detail: </p><ol><li>  Not all subscribers think about why the Beeline Internet speed fell on the phone, but in vain.  This may be caused by the automatic download of application updates.  In the phone‚Äôs settings, you can change this parameter and prevent the system from installing them without confirmation.  In addition, a great way to preserve mobile Internet traffic is to download updates only when connected to a Wi-Fi network. </li><li>  Another effective way to speed up the Internet on a phone or any other device is to clear the cache.  When it is full, application performance is significantly reduced.  Including those through which you go online or chat with friends. </li><li>  You can speed up the speed of the Internet on Beeline by properly setting your browser.  Turn off the function of automatic loading of images, Java and Flash-application and you will immediately see the difference! </li><li>  When using mobile Internet via 3G or 4G, the reason why the speed of the Internet from Beeline on the modem or phone has dropped may be due to interruptions in the signal.  Most often this happens on the ground floors and in buildings with thick walls.  To correct the situation, you have to change the location. </li><li>  To increase the speed indicator when downloading a file, you will need to temporarily disable everything that may interfere with this process: downloading other documents, correspondence applications, antivirus and other working programs. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.murmansk.kp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why the speed of mobile Internet beeline fell" class="if uuid-2865784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45096/2865784.jpg"></div><h2>  Third-party utilities and applications </h2><p>  To increase the productivity and speed of the Internet from Beeline, you can use special programs and utilities: </p><ol><li>  Internet Booster - improves the Internet by automatically clearing the cache, changing connection settings and more. </li><li>  Internet Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãMaster - increases the speed with one click on the screen. </li><li>  Ashampoo Internet Accelerator - optimizes data transfer by automatically configuring the basic connection settings. </li><li>  Speed4Web - automatically optimizes the loading of pages from the Web. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="ekaraganda.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Internet Beeline Modem Fell" class="if uuid-2865799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45096/2865799.jpg"></div><h2>  Stable low connection speed </h2><p>  The reason for the low speed of the Beeline Internet may be the smartphone itself.  There may be several reasons for this: </p><ol><li>  If the Internet on the phone works fine through Wi-Fi, and through the mobile network slowly, you should check the settings in the ‚ÄúNetwork Mode‚Äù section on the smartphone.  Maybe you just need to change the type of preferred network from GSM to WCDMA or LTE. </li><li>  Not sure why Beeline‚Äôs mobile Internet speed has dropped?  Unlicensed phones and tablets from China do not support the frequency ranges by which 4G signals are transmitted in the Russian Federation.  To check if this is the problem, you need to insert a Beeline SIM card into another device and start the mobile Internet. </li><li>  Some virus applications do not completely block network access, but only limit browser performance.  Therefore, it will be useful to scan the phone system with an anti-virus application. </li></ol><p>  Due to the fact that the mobile operator Beeline takes care of its subscribers, they can not limit themselves within the framework of the paid package.  The company offers several ways to increase the speed of the Internet at an affordable cost. </p>
