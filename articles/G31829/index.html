    <h2>  Activities </h2><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is the activity of the organization.  Oddly enough, it is extremely important for many.  It is always nice to understand which company we are dealing with.  It is clear that our today's organization is connected with finance to one degree or another.  Only now her activity is considered very important at the moment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Why?  NPF Future (Welfare) is a <span>private pension fund.</span>  In the NPF Future, it was renamed in June 2015.  He is engaged in collecting, saving and increasing your money.  But only when it comes to the <span>funded part of the pension.</span>  That is, it helps in ensuring your old age.  There is nothing suspicious about this.  Therefore, reviews regarding the activities of the corporation are more encouraging.  No cheating, everything is transparent and clear.  But some are interested in how to get money from the NPF Blagosostavost.  This will have to be thoroughly understood.  Otherwise, you can be left without a livelihood at all. </p><h2>  Luring </h2><p>  Initially, of course, you will by all means be lured into our organization today.  And to say that from the age of 18 you need to take care of pension savings.  Such a scheme with youth works at 100%.  Thus, the company attracts new customers.  But no one talks about the details of financial transactions that may await you ahead. </p><p>  What do they promise?  Anything to attract attention.  High profitability, simple and favorable conditions, the ability to terminate the contract with the company at any time without any serious consequences.  In general, as the clients assure, you will be lured here by all means.  If only you did not think about how to stop communicating with the company "Welfare" (non-state pension fund).  How to get money from here?  Over time, this issue begins to worry many.  And all this, despite the promises of the fund.  Why is this so?  And how to conduct this process? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="joining a non-state pension fund" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1262919.jpg"></div>

The whole problem is that a very interesting scheme is used here: the pension savings that the client makes are his money, his voluntary contributions.  That is, in fact, you will be the owner of the account.  And only you can manage the money.  And ‚ÄúWelfare‚Äù is a kind of intermediary between you and the state.  A kind of guarantor of retirement. </p><p>  Just why do citizens more and more often think about taking money from a given pension fund.  There are reasons for that.  About them, too, to learn further.  In general, if the client‚Äôs investments in the organization are his money, his voluntary contributions, then you can take them back at any time without any problems.  In practice, a completely different picture is emerging.  What features await us? </p><h2>  If entered </h2><p>  Are you a customer of our organization today?  By joining the non-state pension fund Blagosostavost, you will have to prepare for a huge number of features and other nuances that need clarification.  Especially if you want to move to another pension fund or even take the money. </p><p>  The most interesting thing is that many customers do not suspect at all that they are part of the organization.  Such cases are more and more common every day.  In fact, you are required to make <span>pension contributions.</span>  If you want to change the pension fund, get ready for a lot of problems.  They are often silent about them.  But if everything was so simple, no one would ask: "I want to take money from NPF Blagosostoyanie. How can I do this?"  No matter how you find out that you became a member of the organization.  Now you have to try pretty hard to get your money back. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to pick up pension savings NPF welfare" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1262917.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cash </h2><p>  Many believe that solving this issue will not be difficult.  Simply terminate the contract with the organization.  On the one hand, this is indeed so.  But the termination process has a huge number of rules and pitfalls.  Failure to do so will make it impossible to refund you. </p><p>  It is noted that very often they will tell you that it is possible to receive a pension funded part in cash.  Many rejoice after such promises.  This is actually just a hoax.  So lure gullible and naive customers.  Remember one important point if you decide to open an account for future retirement.  It is possible to put funds into the non-state pension fund "Welfare", but you will not see them in cash.  In any case, until you yourself retire.  Currently, the legislation of the Russian Federation does not provide for the payment of pension savings in advance, and even in cash. </p><h2>  Another fund </h2><p>  The exit from NPF "Welfare" is possible at will.  Moreover, the process itself does not require any features from you, as customers note.  But as soon as the question touches money, problems will begin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="this is his money, his voluntary contributions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1262920.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The thing is that, as a rule, you can exit from one pension fund and transfer to another.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter in which state or not.  Only under such a condition can one somehow withdraw the accumulated funds from Welfare.  No other is given. </p><p>  If you decide to transfer, you need to declare it.  It is enough to write a statement in free form on the withdrawal from one organization, as well as on the start of work with another.  And after that, as a rule, it is possible to take the funded part of the pension for further transfer thereof to a particular company.  But not everything is so simple at NPF Future (NPF Blagosostatoie).  <span>A non-state pension fund</span> is generally a dubious association.  Many citizens generally recommend staying away from them.  After you have made a statement about leaving the company and joining another, just wait for an answer.  You will be notified in writing of the possibility / impossibility of your transfer indicating the reasons. </p><h2>  State </h2><p>  You can also return to the generally accepted scheme of pension savings.  That is, to state co-financing.  Not the most common occurrence, but it does occur.  Do you want to take money from the "Welfare" and transfer it to the state account?  This process, according to reviews, also does not take you much time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf future npf welfare private pension fund" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1262921.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What is required?  Again statement.  Only here you will have to attach information about your registration.  That is, to prove belonging to a particular branch of the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation.  Further, the application is considered for some time.  And you will receive a notification with a response.  If all is well, you can transfer funds from the account in the "Welfare" to the state.  The organization does it, you will not see these operations.  Just like cash. </p><p>  By the way, you can change pension funds only once a year.  Having entered the non-state pension fund "Welfare", you will have to wait a while.  Was there already a change this year?  Then there is nothing to hope for.  They will refuse to terminate the contract and transfer the funded part of the pension.  And legally, do not be surprised. </p><h2>  I do not see money </h2><p>  Interested in Welfare (Non-Governmental Pension Fund)?  How to take money from there under certain circumstances?  It all depends on which particular case is being considered.  Just like that, in the form of cash or a bank transfer, no one will let you pick up the transferred funds.  This is impossible, prohibited by law.  You can write a statement on the transfer of the funded part of the pension to another fund.  Only in this way is the withdrawal of accumulations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="exit from NPF welfare" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1262922.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What is noteworthy, you can withdraw your money in cash in principle.  Only this option is often irrelevant.  Why?  Because you can complete this business only after retirement.  Pensioners have every right to collect their funded parts upon application with the presentation of a pension certificate.  There is no longer any chance to really see and even hold in your hands the voluntary contributions made to the Non-State Pension Fund Welfare. </p><h2>  Expectation </h2><p>  An unpleasant surprise for fund participants is <span>the expectation of</span> payments.  And both to pensioners, and in case of transfer to another organization.  Many customers complain that they are simply being deceived.  And it takes a very, very long time to wait for the money. </p><p>  Want to refuse the services of the company "Welfare" (private pension fund)?  How to get money from here?  You need to think in advance.  Only by worrying in advance about writing the corresponding application, you will be able to return the money in time.  Many assure: it takes 3-4 months to wait for payments.  Of course, during this period you will not receive any additional charges in any fund.  An unpleasant moment, about which no one warns. </p><h2>  Bounce </h2><p>  The most interesting thing is that "Welfare" is pushing with all its might and trying not to let go of its customers.  Here, as the participants assure, a very interesting and simple scheme is used: you are simply denied termination of the contract for one reason or another.  That statement was not written that way, the conditions for transferring to another pension fund were not met.  In general, some are bored by this alignment, and they remain in the organization "Welfare". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf future welfare non-state" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1262923.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If you really intend to leave the fund, you will have to prepare to do it with a fight.  A few complaints, re-written statements and a long wait for the transfer of funds - and you will get your way.  Just keep in mind: for the year in which the exit from the corporation takes place, you will hardly receive any profit.  For many, these are insignificant losses, but it is worth knowing about them. </p><p>  So the reviews "Welfare" is not the best.  Although it is a reliable company, it is extremely difficult to regain the funded part of the pension.  There are only two options: either transfer from an account to another non-governmental fund, or to a state one.  In extreme cases, you can take money upon reaching retirement age.  By joining a non-state pension fund, you still run the risk.  Think carefully before joining Welfare. </p>
