    <p>  For the first time, the voice of Autoradio was heard in Perm, in 1990.  And after some couple of years, the radio station received broadcast status, and as a source and media rushed to conquer all of Russia.  Three years ago, to celebrate the 20th anniversary in Moscow, Russian stars and foreign performers, famous politicians, athletes and actors came to the celebration of Autoradio.  The anniversary marathon lasted almost eleven hours; huge sums of money, gifts and other significant prizes were raffled off. </p><h2>  Russian Radio - 105.7 MHz </h2><p>  The second most popular channel and silver on our list, representing the <span>rating of</span> Moscow <span>radio stations</span> , goes to Russian Radio.  The main feature of this station is broadcasting exclusively in Russian, that is, there are no Western songs, only domestic speech and music. </p>

    <p>  All radio stations in Moscow, before getting to the peak of their popularity, went through a difficult and thorny path, and Russian Radio was no exception.  His first broadcast was released back in 1995, and initially everything was broadcast in test mode. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A few months later, the first advertisement appeared, and the creators of the radio did not fail, having inserted the phrases of Nikolai Fomenko into each advertising block, which ridiculed our realities in a humorous form.  A few years later Fomenko was replaced by Vadim Galygin, and after him Dmitry Nagiyev took hold as a humorous commentator. </p><p>  In 1997, the Golden Gramophone Award was established.  It was recognized by all radio stations in Moscow and Russia.  A rewarding ceremony is held every year in the Kremlin, and prize winners are selected based on the results of the radio listeners' voting. </p><h2>  Retro-FM - 88.3 MHz </h2><p>  Bronze receives ‚ÄúRetro-FM‚Äù, on the waves of which musical compositions of the 70s, 80s and 90s of the last century sound.  The station began its work in late 1995 and is aimed at the age group of 30 to 50 years. </p><p>  All radio stations in Moscow and Russia have their own listener, but the number of fans of Retro-FM is simply amazing - 8 million people, and this, almost - 12% of the entire population of the country. </p><h2>  Europe Plus - 106.2 MHz </h2><p>  The station broadcasts mainly for teenagers and close to her audience (from 16 to 30 years old).  Radio stations in Moscow and the region can envy the territory that Europe Plus is capable of covering.  Broadcasts are conducted not only for the capital and the Russian listener, but also for the former CIS and other neighboring countries. </p><p>  It will be useful to note that the station takes first place in terms of the cost of ad units. </p>

    <p>  All <span>Moscow radio stations</span> recognize the scope with which Europe Plus works.  She is a partner and organizer of concerts of stars of such magnitude as Sting, Madonna, Timberlake, <span>Kylie Minogue</span> and Byonce.  A few years ago, the radio station signed another good partnership contract with the U2 band, a concert of which was recently held in Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Radio Chanson - 103.0 MHz </h2><p>  As already mentioned, many radio stations in Moscow have some of their original features and musical images, but they are still far from the level of Radio Chanson.  More than a million people wake up and go to bed with the waves of this radio.  Across Russia, this figure is naturally higher, but what‚Äôs remarkable: Radio Chanson‚Äôs main audience should be male, but judging by statistics, more than 47% of listeners are women. </p>

    <p>  The channel broadcasts thematic programs and musical compositions marked ‚Äúchanson‚Äù.  Talks are held with famous bards, performers of city romances and other authors of folk art.  High-quality radio station fell in love not only in Russia, but also in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. </p><h2>  Echo of Moscow - 91.2 MHz </h2><p>  Echo of Moscow gained its fame thanks to the events that took place in August 1991.  In those difficult times for the country, the channel became a single radio station that opposed the GKChP.  In principle, little has changed since then.  Echo of Moscow is still considered an independent <span>media,</span> not only listeners, but also outside critics. </p><p>  In the words of the general director of the station, A. Venediktov, ‚ÄúEcho of Moscow‚Äù is a place where you can freely discuss, analyze and express your (and any) point of view. </p>

    <p>  Radio has the status of a closed joint-stock company, where most of the shares are in the hands of Gazprom Media Holding, and the rest are distributed among the employees of the station itself - hence the ‚Äúfrequency‚Äù of opinions. </p><h2>  Radio Energy - 104.2 MHz </h2><p>  One of the most popular French stations was also loved by Muscovites.  Broadcasting in our territory began about ten years ago, after Radio Energy acquired a license to use the brand. </p><p>  The air is filled mainly with moving and youthful musical compositions, therefore the station has an appropriate age group - from 16 to 30 years.  On the air you can hear brief news and the latest news of modern music styles. </p><h2>  Humor FM - 88.7 MHz </h2><p>  The main priority for this radio was and remains humor.  The station began broadcasting about 11 years ago, replacing Radio Disco, which had lost its former popularity. </p><p>  On the radio station you can hear light pop music, diluted with all kinds of jokes and jokes.  For an inexhaustible stream of new jokes, the Humor FM radio station has established close relations with the TNT channel, popular Internet resources such as AnekdotRU, and, of course, with the listeners themselves, who are sending endless streams of new jokes via telephone and SMS. </p>

    <p>  Many Muscovites speak very warmly about the Humor-FM radio station, because it is practically the only channel where you can escape from the annoying city bustle and crappy news. </p><h2>  Business FM - 87.5 MHz </h2><p>  This station is purely business in nature and is distinguished by fresh and reliable stock market news, exchange rates, monitoring of the business press and other business information. </p><p>  "Business FM", judging by the reviews of critics, is that rare case when its slogan is: "First Business Radio" is not lying.  The station‚Äôs special pride is the ‚Äúinstant news‚Äù concept, which comes out as quickly as possible, without waiting for the main news block. </p><h2>  Road Radio - 96.0 MHz </h2><p>  Closes the rating of Muscovites favorite radio stations no less significant channel for car owners - Dorozhnoe Radio.

The radio station broadcasts popular chanson compositions, city romances, music of the last century and light pop music dilutes all this along with important information about events taking place on the roads.
