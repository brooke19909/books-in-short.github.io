A year later, when the manufacturer announced the release of the Pentax K100D Super, the device was characterized similarly.  So what is the difference?  If you look closely, the newer model has changed the dust removal system, and it has become compatible with SDM-lenses with fast and quiet autofocus. </p><p>  In addition to these two new additions, the Pentax K100D Super features the same compact size, ease of use, high ISO sensitivity and image stabilization mechanism to eliminate blurry images.  Although the model was equipped with a 6-megapixel sensor, when the rest of the DSLR cameras were already available with a resolution of 10 megapixels, its low price of $ 519 and an impressive set of functionality more than compensated for this. </p><h2>  Pentax K100D: design overview </h2><p>  Despite the relatively low cost, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a compact point-and-shoot camera.  The K100D is an entry-level digital SLR camera, that is, it is aimed at people who want advanced control capabilities and want to have access to a wide <span>selection of lenses.</span>  At the same time, Pentax is known as a manufacturer of convenient and functional devices that can be used by photographers who have only experience with compact cameras. </p><p>  In addition to high performance, the device has other advantages.  And the ability to change optics is probably the biggest difference between SLR and compact cameras.  The K100D is equipped with Pentax 18–55mm f3.5 / 5.6 AL optics, but is also sold without it, which allows you to take advantage of a wide range of offers.  One of the biggest advantages of Pentax SLR cameras is that they are 100% compatible with all the lenses that it has ever created.  Thanks to the KAF2 mount, everything is suitable - from old optics with manual control to new autofocus.  No other manufacturer provides such backward compatibility. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Even more surprising is the fact that all optics at the same time get at their disposal an integrated shock compensation system.  Other manufacturers, such as Canon and Nikon, sell lenses with image stabilization much more expensive, and even 40-year-old optics work better with Pentax.  As a result, the pictures look much sharper than before. </p>

    <h2>  Shooting </h2><p>  Auto Pict mode allows you to automatically shoot when the camera itself determines the necessary settings in accordance with environmental conditions.  The camera leaves the photographer with the right to choose one of several options for flash, frame size and quality, ISO sensitivity and focus method, but all other parameters are calculated by the device itself.  Even with the default settings, an inexperienced amateur photographer can not worry about anything other than aiming and capturing images.  The automatic shooting mode copes well with a wide range of objects, but the essence of the SLR camera is that it is completely different from the compact one.  DSLR cameras are designed for those who want to control their pictures on their own. </p><h2>  Instructions for choosing the optimal settings </h2><p>  Based on the illumination, distance and movement of the subject, automatic selection of the optimal Pentax K100D settings is possible.  The description of the procedure is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Set the mode dial to Auto Pict.  In this case, the camera will choose the best way to capture images. </li><li>  Set the focus mode switch to AF. </li><li>  Using the viewfinder, point the camera at the subject.  In this case, optics can change its visible dimensions. </li><li>  Position the subject within the frame and half-press the shutter button.  The AF system will start working, the indicator of which will signal the completion of focusing.  If necessary, the built-in flash will be set to the operating position. </li><li>  Press the shutter button fully.  Shooting completed. </li><li>  You can use the LCD screen to check the photo.  After the picture is taken, it is displayed on the screen for 1 second.  At the same time, you can delete it by clicking on the corresponding button on the rear panel. </li></ol>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Shooting modes </h2><p>  In addition to Auto Pict, the Pentax K100D provides six preset picture modes for specific scenes: portrait, landscape, macro, moving subjects, night portrait, and no flash.  The camera optimizes settings for various scenes and, like a car, the user has the ability to set some frame parameters depending on the selected scene.  In addition, there are 8 additional modes for shooting at night, surfing and snowing, text, sunset, children, pets, by candlelight and in the museum. </p><h2>  Exposure and Aperture Setting Options </h2><p>  Finally, the camera can operate in program mode (P), aperture priority mode (Av), shutter priority (Tv) and manual exposure (M).  These are standard features of any DSLR camera.  In addition to these, the Bulb (B) setting allows you to manually control the duration of the shutter opening during very long exposures.  Modes work as follows: </p><ul><li>  <em>P: The</em> camera sets the shutter speed and aperture independently.  The user has the ability to change its settings, including the choice of the flash mode, adjust the exposure of the camera and flash, metering mode, autofocus, shooting, ISO sensitivity, white balance, image size and quality.  The same options are available in Tv, Av, M, and B. </li><li>  <em>TV:</em> shutter speed is set by the user and aperture is set by the camera. </li><li>  <em>Av: The</em> photographer adjusts the aperture, and exposure is automatically selected. </li><li>  <em>M:</em> shutter speed and aperture set by user. </li><li>  <em>B:</em> Same as M, except that the shutter remains open while the shutter button is pressed. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Exposure Compensation </h2><p>  This function allows you to change the exposure within ± 2 EV in increments of 1/3 EV only in P, Tv and Av modes.  Most effective for center-weighted or spot metering.  There is also a function of exposure bracketing for shooting several frames with different shutter speeds: underexposed, standard, and overexposed. </p><h2>  Light meter </h2><p>  By default, measurements in the K100D Super are performed using a 16-segment multi-zone system.  Center-weighted and spot options are available.  Multizone photometry as a whole works well, but sometimes misses out on bright areas in high-contrast scenes, such as a bright sky or ocean with the sun reflecting in it.  However, these shortcomings are found in other digital cameras.  High-contrast scenes with more appropriate light levels produce better results. </p>

    <h2>  Focusing </h2><p>  The Pentax K100D uses an 11-point AF system, and the user can also select the focus area for automatic or manual focusing of the image.  In addition to the switch located near the lens mount, focusing modes can be controlled using the camera menu.  Two AF options are available: single (AF-S) and continuous (AF-C).  The first one is for stationary objects and blocks focus changes when the shutter button is pressed halfway.  The second is used when shooting moving objects and sharpens continuously during half-pressed descent. </p><p>  Unlike most SLR cameras with multi-zone AF, which use only one or two cross-type sensors, operating both in the vertical and horizontal directions, the SAFOX VIII system includes 9 such sensors, which results in greater accuracy of its operation. </p><p>  Focusing speed Pentax K100D Super user reviews are called quite fast and independent of the installed lens.  The AF sensor also determines the correctness of manual focusing.  Although this model is not the fastest in the Pentax lineup, it focuses almost as fast as the high-end K10D camera. </p><h2>  Monitor and viewfinder </h2><p>  Pentax K100D is equipped with a 2.5 ”LCD display with 210 thousand pixels and an adjustable brightness level.  The screen has a wide 140-degree viewing angle both vertically and horizontally, so pictures can be shown to several people at the same time.  12x magnification of images is also possible.  The display does not work in sight mode - you cannot compose pictures with it.  To do this, use a bright and fairly large viewfinder with 0.85x magnification and 96% frame coverage.  This is better than most entry-level SLR cameras. </p>

    <h2>  Flash </h2><p>  The built-in flash extends from the top of the camera body when you press the button located on the back of the Pentax K100D.  The characteristics of the lamp allow photographing at a distance of 0.7–4 m from the subject, depending on the ISO and aperture settings.  There are 4 flash modes available: automatic, manual, and with red-eye reduction for each of them. </p><p>  According to the reviews of the owners, its only minus is that the maximum synchronization speed is 1/180 s.  This is suitable for shooting in low light, and using it during the day as a fill flash often requires shutter speeds of 1/500 s or less.  Therefore, you have to set the aperture to f22 or more, which is not ideal. </p><h2>  Color </h2><p>  There are two main tones of the image: bright and natural, with the first one set by default.  According to user reviews, this setting actually leads to oversaturated colors, overexposure, and graininess.  For this reason, they recommend tuning the camera to natural tones. </p><p>  The Pentax K100D camera covers the color space of Adobe RGB and sRGB.  Although the former provides a wider color gamut, novice photographers are more likely to use sRGB, since in this case the pictures look much brighter on the screen and when printed.  The colors are saturated, especially in the red and green parts of the spectrum.  So that the photos are not oversaturated, they should be slightly underexposed.  To this end, users set exposure compensation values ​​to -0.3 or -0.7 EV. </p><p>  The menu system of the camera also allows you to adjust the saturation, sharpness and contrast of the image. </p>

    <h2>  Photosensitivity </h2><p>  Auto ISO is used by default in auto and scene modes and, at your discretion, sets the <span>ISO sensitivity</span> from 200 to 3200. You can also limit the Auto ISO range, for example, to 200-800.  ISO 200 is accepted by default in modes P, Tv, Av and M, if the ISO value has not been previously selected.  The light sensitivity can be set manually by choosing one of the following values: 200, 400, 800, 1600 or 3200. </p><h2>  White balance </h2><p>  Auto white balance is set by default for all Pentax K100D shooting modes.  The user can also select settings for incandescent lamps, fluorescent lighting, direct sunlight, flashes, clouds, shadows, or exposed to white or gray reference objects. </p><h2>  Battery Life </h2><p>  Pentax is one of the few manufacturers of SLR cameras that allows you to install AA batteries.  The greatest benefit of this solution is the ability to use both batteries and standard batteries, which can be purchased everywhere, even in a small village in a foreign country.  In addition, the K100D can be powered by long-life lithium batteries of the CR-V3 type.  The camera allows you to take 1480 pictures with autofocus enabled, image stabilization, dust removal function at each start and with periodic use of the built-in and external flashes. </p><h2>  Optics Features </h2><p>  The included 18–55 mm lens is pretty good.  The optics show slight vignetting (dark angles) at a wide angle (18 mm), but sharpness is sufficient throughout the frame.  The lens suffers from a small barrel-like distortion in the wide-angle position and pincushion in the telephoto.  Despite the 6-megapixel resolution, images are detailed and clear even at 100% magnification.  Violet halos are observed along the edges (at high-contrast borders), but they are noticeable only at double magnification. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Pentax K100D user reviews are called more similar to their older brother K10D than other budget SLR cameras.  The focusing speed of the camera is about the same.  With a continuous shooting speed of 2.7 fps, the camera's performance is excellent, but a small buffer of 3 RAW or 5 JPEG images and a low sync speed of the built-in flash significantly limit the camera.  According to reviews, the quality of images is one of the best that can be seen on devices with a 6-megapixel sensor, and ISO noise is limited precisely because of this.  Full compatibility with all lenses of the manufacturer means almost unlimited possibilities for expanding and growing photographic skills.  Colors are rich even with a natural setting of the tonality of the image.  The built-in stabilization and dust removal system means this camera is surprisingly full-featured.  Beginners who have just switched from compact cameras, with automatic and scene modes, feel very confident with him. </p><p>  Considering the price, the K100D Super is a great entry-level offer. </p>
