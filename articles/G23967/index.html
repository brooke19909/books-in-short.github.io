This camera is not afraid of the weather in any of its manifestations.  With the GoPro camera, you can easily go on any trip around the world and capture the best time in your life. <br>  Woodman Labs, which has been producing camcorders under this logo since the early 2000s, has been able to achieve a phenomenal effect in recent years.  She achieved almost the same as Apple. <br>  Today.  GoPro compact high-quality digital cameras are the iPhone in the world of smartphones.  This is not just a brand, but a word denoting high reliability and the highest level of quality, which determines the whole meaning of this device. <br><br>  em&gt; Features and Design: <br><br>  The classic GoPro camera is produced in several versions at once, or, in the literal translation of ‚Äúedition‚Äù.  These publications differ mainly in completeness. <br>  Also, before making a purchase, it is recommended that you carefully study each ‚Äúpublication‚Äù as best as possible and it will be more convenient to do this at the official GoPro company. <br>  As mentioned earlier, the build level expects the highest praise.  In general, this is the first thing that buyers usually pay attention to and praise this. <br>  Very good fit of parts and the complete absence of backlash.  Dimensions GoPro 59 √ó 41 √ó 21 millimeters, and the mass of an empty device is 74 grams.  Among other things, the camera is easy to put in a bag or helmet, put in a pocket or on the steering wheel of a motorcycle.  Moisture-resistant housing with mounts adds little weight - but it's nothing. <br>  The device comes with a standard set of accessories (in this place it should be noted: even the classic standard set is enough to implement all your ideas): <br>  Included are several mounts and a removable cover with a radio remote control for remote control with a USB cable. <br>  The concept of the device itself has remained old, as in earlier versions, but the design has slightly changed.  The battery for the camera now has the shape of a small brick.  Of course, old batteries are no longer suitable for this camera. <br>  The price of a GoPro camcorder in Russia is 20 500 rubles;  The average cost for GoPro in Moscow is 14 990 rubles. </p></div></article>
