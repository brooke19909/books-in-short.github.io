It can be assembled on various active radio elements.  Currently, field or <span>bipolar transistors</span> are used in its assembly <span>,</span> less commonly, radio tubes (triodes and pentodes).  The Brovin kacher was invented in 1987 by the Soviet radio engineer Vladimir Ilyich Brovin as an element of an electromagnetic compass.  Let's take a closer look at what kind of device it is. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brow kacher" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/370648.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Unknown semiconductor capabilities </h2><p>  Kachrov Brovina is a type of generator assembled on a single transistor and working, according to the inventor, in an emergency mode.  The device demonstrates mysterious properties that go back to the research of Nikola Tesla.  They do not fit into any of the modern theories of electromagnetism.  Apparently, the Brovin kacher is a kind of semiconductor discharger in which the discharge of electric current passes through the crystal base of the transistor, bypassing the stage of formation of an <span>electric arc</span> (plasma).  The most interesting thing in the operation of the device is that after the breakdown, the crystal of the transistor is completely restored.  This is due to the fact that the device is based on a reversible avalanche breakdown, in contrast to thermal breakdown, which is irreversible for a semiconductor.  However, as evidence of this mode of operation of the transistor, only indirect statements are given.  Nobody, except the inventor himself, studied the operation of the transistor in the described device in detail.  So these are just the assumptions of Brovin himself.  So, for example, to confirm the ‚Äúrocker‚Äù mode of operation of the device, the inventor cites the following fact: they say, regardless of what polarity the oscilloscope is connected to the device, the polarity of the pulses shown to them will always be positive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a brower?" class="if" height="490" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/370651.jpg?1397057396411" width="316"></div>

After all, the electrical circuit of the device is very similar to an electric pulse generator.  Nevertheless, the author of the invention emphasizes that his device there is an obvious difference from the proposed schemes.  It gives an alternative explanation of the physical processes inside the transistor.  In a blocking generator, the semiconductor periodically opens as a result of the flow of electric current through the feedback coil of the base circuit.  In quality, the transistor in the so-called non-obvious way must be constantly closed (since the creation of an electromotive force in the feedback coil connected to the base circuit of the semiconductor can still open it).  In this case, the current generated by the accumulation of electric charges in the base zone for further discharge, when the threshold voltage is exceeded, creates an avalanche breakdown.  However, the transistors used by Brovin are not designed to operate in an avalanche mode.  A special series of semiconductors has been designed for this.  According to the inventor, it is possible to use not only bipolar transistors, but also field, as well as radio tubes, despite the fact that they have fundamentally different physics of work.  This forces us to focus not on the research of the transistor itself in quality, but on a specific pulse mode of operation of the entire circuit.  In fact, Nikola Tesla was engaged in these studies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brower field effect transistor" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/370653.jpg?1397236395978" width="600"></div>

He planned to use <span>a sound frequency generator that</span> changes the tone in accordance with the location of the device relative to the magnetic field of the planet.  I used a blocking generator as a basis, improving it, and the resulting device was subsequently called the Brovin kacher.  A reliable generator circuit turned out to be very useful: it is built according to the classical principle, only a feedback circuit based on an inductance core based on amorphous iron has been added.  It changes the magnetic permeability at low intensity values ‚Äã‚Äã(for example, the magnetic field of the planet).  The sound compass triggered when the orientation was changed as intended. </p><h2>  Side effect </h2><p>  An analysis of the properties of the assembled circuit revealed some inconsistencies in its work with generally accepted concepts.  It turned out that the signals received at the electrodes of a semiconductor transistor, measured by an oscilloscope with respect to the positive and negative poles of a voltage source, always had the same polarity.  So, the npn transistor produced a positive signal on the collector, and pnp - negative.  It is with this effect that the Brovin kacher is interesting.  The circuit of the device contains an inductance, which during operation of the device has a resistance close to zero.  The generator continues to operate even as a powerful permanent magnet approaches the core.  The magnet saturates the core, as a result, the blocking process should stop due to the termination of the transformation in the feedback circuit of the circuit.  At the same time, hysteresis did not stand out in the core; it was not possible to identify it with the help of Lissajous figures.  The amplitude of the pulses on the collector of the transistor was five times higher than the voltage of the power source. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY brower" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/372284.jpg?1397236549316"></div>

    <h2>  Kacher Brovina: practical application </h2><p>  Currently, the device is used as a plasma arrester to create pulses of electric current without arcing in experimental devices.  The most commonly used duet is the Brovin kacher and <span>Tesla transformer.</span>  This is due to the fact that the arc arising in the arrester, in principle, serves as a broadband generator of electrical vibrations.  It was the only high-frequency pulse generator available to Nicole Tesla.  In addition, the inventor has created, on the basis of quality, measuring devices that allow determining the absolute value between the generator and the radiation sensor. </p><h2>  Scientists shrug </h2><p>  The above description of the device and the principle of its operation (and this can be seen visually) contradict traditional science.  The inventor himself openly demonstrates these contradictions, he asks everyone to understand together with the paradoxical measurements of the parameters of his device.  However, the position of openness on this issue has not yet led to any results; scientists cannot explain the physical processes in a semiconductor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brower kacher reliable circuit" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/370665.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  It is important <strong> </strong></h2><p>  A description of the Brovin quality effect in the near space may turn out to be a way of spinning the spins of atoms of surrounding substances.  This is indicated by the author of the invention in an experiment with enclosing the device in a sealed glass vessel from which air was pumped out to reduce the pressure level in it.  As a result of the experiment, there is no superunit effect that would allow classifying the device as a <span>perpetual motion machine</span> (with the exception of real experiments on the transfer of energy by wire).  This was first demonstrated by Nikola Tesla.  However, possible incorrect readings of power <span>metering devices</span> are explained by the pulsed, very inharmonious nature of the current flow in the energy consumption circuits of the kacher.  While measuring devices such as a tester are designed for either a constant or a sinusoidal (harmonic) current. </p><h2>  How to assemble a Brovin kacher do-it-yourself </h2><p>  If, after reading the article, you are interested in this device, you can assemble it yourself.  The device is so simple that even a novice ham radio can make it.  The Brovin kacher (diagram below) is powered by a modified network adapter 12 V, 2 A, consumes 20 watts.  It converts an electrical signal into a 1 MHz frequency field with an efficiency of 90%.  For assembly, we need a plastic pipe 80x200 mm.  The primary and secondary windings of the resonator will be wound on it.  The entire electronic part of the device is located in the middle of this pipe.  This scheme is completely stable, it can work for hundreds of hours without a break.  The Brovin self-powered kacher is interesting in that it is capable of lighting unconnected neon lamps up to 70 cm away. It is a wonderful demonstration device for a school or university laboratory, as well as a desktop device for entertaining guests or for displaying tricks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kachever browina diagram" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/370667.jpg?1397057787212" width="504"></div>

    <h2>  Description of electrical circuit assembly </h2><p>  The inventor recommends the use of a bipolar transistor KT902A or KT805AM (however, it is possible to assemble a Brovin cascade on a field effect transistor).  The semiconductor element must be fixed on a powerful radiator, pre-lubricated with heat-conducting paste.  You can optionally install a cooler.  Resistors are permissible to use constants, and capacitor C1 is generally excluded.  First you should wind the primary winding with a wire of 1 mm (4 turns), then the secondary winding with a wire no thicker than 0.3 mm.  The winding is wound tightly round to round.  To do this, we attach its end to the beginning of the pipe and begin to wind, smearing the wire with PVA glue every 20 mm.  It is enough to make 800 turns.  We fix the end and solder the insulated conductor to it.  Windings should be wound in one direction, it is important that they do not touch.  Next, you need to solder the sewing needle into the upper part of the pipe and solder the end of the winding to it.  Next, solder the electrical circuit and place it with the radiator inside the plastic pipe.  This elementary device is the Brovin kacher. </p><h2>  How to make an "ion engine"? </h2><p>  We start the assembled device with a minimum voltage of 4 volts, then gradually begin to increase it, while not forgetting to monitor the current.  If you assembled the circuit on the transistor KT902A, then the streamer at the end of the needle should appear at 4 volts.  With increasing voltage, it will increase.  Upon reaching 16 volts, it will turn into a ‚Äúpussie‚Äù.  At 18 V it will increase to about 17 mm, and at 20 V the electric discharges will resemble a real ion engine in operation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="self-feeding brower" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/370669.jpg?1397057862242" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As you can see, the device is elementary and does not require large expenditures.  It can be assembled with your child, because children love to play with the "pieces of iron."  And here is a double advantage: not only will the baby be at work, it will also show self-confidence.  He will be able to participate in a school exhibition with his creation or show off to friends.  Who knows, maybe, thanks to the assembly of such an elementary toy, he will develop an interest in radio electronics, and in the future your child will be the author of some invention. </p>
