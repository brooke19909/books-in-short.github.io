    <p>  The head of the article ‚ÄúBaba Yaga from cones‚Äù can be made from any natural material of a rounded shape.  It can be chestnut, walnut, a small pine cone.  In spruce, even small, the shape is elongated and pointed, and in pine cones it is round.  On the back side, all the scales are adjacent to each other, a dense round part is obtained, on which it is perfectly possible to place all the other parts of the face. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Small parts </h2><p>  Baba Yaga from cones should also have a face, hair, you can even prepare a scarf for her.  After all, Russian women used to wear headscarves, and our old woman is a resident of the Russian forest, so she must also be the owner of such a headdress.  If the head is made of chestnut or walnut, then it will be enough to make the eyes of plasticine or applique.  To do this, take two small balls of white plasticine and attach to the top of the chestnut, two more black or brown balls cling to them on top, only smaller. </p><p>  If you decide to make the eyes of Baba Yaga from cones using the application method, then you need to cut out two white circles and draw points on them with a black marker.  Then glue at eye level on the chestnut or nut with PVA glue. </p>

    <p>  If the head is made of a small pine cone, then you can cover the entire ‚Äúface‚Äù with yellow or beige plasticine, and place eyes and nose on top of the leveled surface.  Then the role of the eyes can be played by acacia seeds or buckwheat. </p><p>  The nose can be created from a piece of plasticine, as well as other materials.  A small acorn, a piece of branch, a hook-shaped pasta will do. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hair and headgear </h2><p>  Hair for Baba Yaga from cones is made from natural hemp ropes, threads from a skein of yarn of a suitable color, straw.  It‚Äôs easiest to make a brush out of thread or rope.  To do this, wrap yarn in several layers on a cardboard template.  The more threads there are, the more magnificent will be the hairstyle of the old woman.  Then, on the one hand, all the threads are gathered with a simple cotton thread into a knot, a couple of turns are made around the top of the brush so that all the parts stay together.  On the opposite side, sharp edges are cut with sharp scissors so that the threads are all the same length.  Then the hair is attached to the crown on the PVA glue. </p>

    <p>  A scarf for Baba Yaga made of cones is made of a piece of cotton fabric.  A pattern of a triangular shape is drawn on cardboard.  It should be an isosceles triangle, where the base is made long so that then the scarf can easily be tied around the head.  According to the pattern, the contours on the fabric are outlined, and cut out with scissors.  It remains only to tie him on his head.  If threads are cut on the fabric after the cut, the edges can be burned with a candle or a lighter. </p><h2>  Assembling parts together </h2><p>  To get the figure of Baba Yaga from cones, you need to fasten all the parts prepared in advance together.  To do this, take a large piece of plasticine and roll a round ball.  They stick it on the top of the fir cone, and on top is the head, which we already made separately.  If the arms are bent at the elbows, then you need to connect two small sticks or twigs at an angle with plasticine.  Then, in the neck area, plasticine balls are attached on one side and the other.  Sticks of hands are inserted into them.  You can also arrange the lower part with plasticine.  There will be a palm in which you can insert a broom. </p><p>  How to make a broom for a fabulous forest old woman?  This is not difficult.  You need to take one long branch, the size of a little more than a character.  To create the broom itself, you need to collect thin branches of the same length from the bushes.  A bundle of thin ones is folded around a large branch, tightly tied with a simple cotton thread.  It is necessary to wind several tight turns so that small branches do not crumble.  The finished broom is placed in a stupa or in Yaga‚Äôs hand. </p><h2>  Materials for the stupa </h2><p>  It is impossible to imagine a forest dweller without her main flying attribute.  Of course, further we will talk about the stupa.  What is she like?  This is a large round-shaped container resembling a bucket.  It is made of wood.  Yaga, when you need to go in pursuit of someone, sits in it and flies away.  Baba Yaga from cones in a stupa will not work if you miss this detail in its fairy-tale image.  The stupa is made of a paper or plastic cup, which serves as the basis for further application of natural material. </p>

    <p>  It can be glued either with bark from a tree, planting it in a circle on glue, or with twigs.  You can still wrap a cup of burlap and tie in a circle with twine.  It will also turn out original.  Now we dwell in more detail on the manufacture of Baba Yaga from cones in a mortar.  The photo below shows how to do this. </p><h2>  How to make a stupa from twigs? </h2><p>  A disposable paper cup should be glued around the circumference with brown plasticine, covering the entire surface.  This is necessary so that the branches do not fall out of the stupa.  Then, in turn, thin branches of the same size are attached, pressing into the plasticine mass with a light touch of a hand. </p>

    <p>  It remains only to tie the twine branches below and above.  You can take a simple rope, or contrasting bright yarn, for example, red.  When the flying object is done, Babu Yaga is carefully placed in a stupa.  Everything, the craft is ready. </p>
