    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  What is Touch Bank?  This is a modern banking company, which conducts its activities mainly through the Internet.  That is, virtually.  <span>Touch Bank</span> does not have a huge number of branches - only the head office in Moscow.  Maybe it is because of this that some reviews express doubt about the company's integrity.  After all, any virtual banks are not credible.  They often turn out to be the most common deception. </p><p>  But Touch Bank, as indicated on the official website, operates under the license of a large banking organization, OTP Bank.  That is, a financial institution is a kind of affiliate.  OTP Bank should be responsible for Touch Bank.  For this reason, organizations can truly be trusted.  After all, if you ask OTP Bank, it turns out that Touch actually works under their license.  In fact, there is no concern that Touch Bank is a non-existent company. <strong><br></strong> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Services </h2><p>  What activities does the organization conduct?  It is already clear that this is a real bank.  But only Touch Bank fully exists on the Internet and has a single office.  As already mentioned, this is a virtual organization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the bank's address" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1351177.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But she provides the services exactly the same as the most ordinary bank.  What kind of reviews does Touch Bank receive for its services?  Mostly positive.  After all, you can: </p><ul><li>  Open a bank account. </li><li>  Make a contribution. </li><li>  Get a loan. </li><li>  Issue a debit card. </li><li>  Get a credit card. </li><li>  Use insurance services. </li><li>  Connect to the bonus program. </li></ul><p>  The only thing that cannot be done here is to make a currency exchange.  Not too bad news, given that we are dealing with a virtual bank.  Such a service simply physically cannot be realized.  As you can see, all Touch Bank services are similar to those that exist in real banks.  Only numerous reviews indicate that loans and bank cards are in great demand.  Almost every client mentions them. </p><h2>  Address </h2><p>  If you look at the official website of the organization, then you can find the address of the bank called Touch Bank.  It has already been said that he has only one office.  And he is in the capital.  But this is not such a problem.  In case of any malfunctions or negative moments, you can call the management of the banking organization at any time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Where exactly is the Touch Bank?  In Moscow, on Leningradskoye Shosse, building 16A, building 1. This is the legal address indicated on the official page of Touch Bank.  Numerous reviews indicate that not everyone is ready to travel around the capital to solve certain service issues.  Therefore, telephone calls are in great demand. </p><h2>  Contacts </h2><p>  How exactly can you keep in touch with Touch Bank?  There are several options: the official page and phone calls.  Touch Bank reviews for these two components are not getting the best.  The thing is that customers indicate a long service and terrible service.  That is, you can call the company office for a long time, but never get through.  Or some operators simply hang up in the middle of a conversation.  Especially if you start to express your dissatisfaction with the service.  It is not known whether this is true or not - there is no evidence.  But the opinions of customers very often emphasize such phenomena. </p><p>  If we talk about communication through the official website and email, then you will be sure to answer all your questions.  Only have to wait a very long time - about a few days.  And this is not the best way characterizes Touch Bank.  The rating of this organization falls due to some customer dissatisfaction.  Where can I try to contact if you have questions or problems with the service?  Call the numbers: 8-800-5000-200 or 7-495-221-30-60.  You can use absolutely any combination at any time.  The official website of Touch Bank indicates that this organization works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="touch bank credit card" class="if" height="205" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1351175.jpg" width="600"></div>

They will definitely help you. </p><h2>  Loans </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs worth to find out what reviews Touch Bank receives for the services it provides.  Indeed, many consider this organization to be very doubtful.  Although, if it really provides quality service, you can change your negative opinion.  It is known that loans are in great demand at Touch Bank.  The population prefers to take them when necessary to make large purchases.  Touch Bank offers several types of loans.  This is a consumer cash loan and a special card issue.  The latter service is in great demand. </p><p>  Loans to the population are indeed offered.  Only now in matters of debt repayment some problems arise.  Firstly, reviews indicate that Touch Bank has a high interest rate on a credit card.  Secondly, very often a variety of disputes arise over payments received.  The thing is that customers of Touch Bank talk about constant calls from employees of a financial institution.  They require payment of debt, even if you have paid off a loan long ago.  No one is safe from such cases.  But according to numerous reviews, then in Touch Bank such incidents happen often. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="touch bank rating" class="if" height="239" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/1352090.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Otherwise, there are no complaints.  After all, you can repay a loan ahead of schedule at any time.  Unless reviews on Touch Bank indicate that withdrawing cash from a card is not very profitable.  The commission is charged in the amount of 299 rubles + 4% of the amount you want to receive.  Therefore, use a "credit card" to receive cash is not worth it. </p><h2>  Deposits </h2><p>  Some want to go to the bank in order to make some kind of savings.  And Touch Bank allows you to use a similar service.  After all, you can <span>open a deposit</span> and replenish it at any time.  True, in order to use funds outside the World Wide Web, you will need a credit card from Touch Bank.  More precisely, their universal plastic, which can serve both for credit and for simple storage of funds.  This must be specified when ordering a card.  Very comfortably! </p><p>  The reviews indicate that the terms and conditions of the deposit in Touch Bank are pleasing.  After all, you can use your account on the Internet for online purchases.  Also, with the help of the card there is a cash withdrawal and deposit to the account at any time.  The annual interest rate is 9%.  In this case, additional funds are credited to you daily.  To replenish and withdraw money, as already mentioned, you have the right when you want.  And all this without loss.  In principle, there are no complaints about deposits in Touch Bank.  Unless sometimes the dissatisfaction with the fact that to use the money you have to wait for the issuance of a bank card of this organization increases.  But this is not a disadvantage of the institution.  Rather, the advantage that the virtual ‚ÄúTouch Bank‚Äù gives.  While you are waiting for delivery, you have the opportunity to use the deposit online. </p>

    <h2>  Debit card </h2><p>  The most attention of customers is caused by Touch Bank <span>debit card</span> .  It is she who attracts with her capabilities.  With it, you can use contactless payment PayPass.  This is a new service that has already been successfully implemented by Tinkoff Bank.  Now ‚ÄúTouch‚Äù is trying to implement this idea.  Moreover, so far he succeeds quite successfully.  Only reviews of Touch Bank reflect a lot of negativity regarding debit plastic.  Yes, it does exist.  But according to numerous opinions, despite the favorable conditions of use, some not the best moments of service still occur.  For example, you will have to pay for the content of the card.  Many indicate that about 300 rubles are obtained per month.  And this is even in the absence of card payments. </p><p>  With activation, there are also some problems.  To do this, you need to reach the Touch Bank branch.  Customers point out that this is not so easy.  There are problems with telephone communications.  As a result, with the activation of plastic, too.  If you are connected to the bonus program, you must additionally transfer funds to a debit card.  Some note that this system still does not work well.  And even if there are bonuses, no additional money is credited to the account. </p><h2>  Delivery </h2><p>  Customer dissatisfaction is often caused by the delivery of a Touch Bank bank card.  The thing is that it can not be obtained in all cities of Russia.  This fact is frustrating.  It turns out that not everyone can use the services of Touch Bank at the moment.  For example, residents of St. Petersburg themselves must go to the head office of the organization in order to get their plastic.  Otherwise, there are no complaints.  Unless couriers can answer questions regarding the type of plastic delivered. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="touch bank loans" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1351174.jpg" width="600"></div>
