    <h2>  Resort Location </h2><p>  The location of this hotel is <span>South Goa.</span>  Reviews of tourists indicate a fairly favorable location of the hotel.  This is due to the fact that the path to Colva Beach takes no more than one minute, even if you walk with a slow walking step.  It is also worth noting that not far from the hotel is the Margao railway station, so you can easily go on an excursion to nearby cities.  The way from the airport to the hotel will not be too tiring, because the road will take you no more than half an hour. </p><h2>  Description of guest apartments </h2><p>  Resort Longuinhos Beach Resort 3 * (Goa) offers guests to stay in one of the 50 comfortable rooms that can be divided into three subgroups: </p><ul><li>  Standard apartments are compact in size and simple in design.  In view of their low cost, we can say that they provide travelers with the necessary minimum, which will help them to relax after intense excursions and swimming in the clear sea.  There is a double bed, and there is also the option of placing on a pair of single beds. </li><li>  "Deluxe" - these are quite luxurious rooms that differ in sophisticated interior design and a fairly large space.  Like the previous category, the apartments are one-room and are also designed to accommodate two adult guests (the child can be provided with an extra bed).  A distinctive feature of these rooms is the presence of a cozy balcony on which you can dry your clothes or enjoy the well-kept courtyard of the hotel and its pool. </li><li>  The most expensive room category for this hotel is the suite.  This apartment is very spacious, as it consists of two rooms.  The bedroom is small enough, but quite cozy and comfortable to accommodate two adult guests.  The room has upholstered furniture, which can serve as an extra bed.  there is also a small kitchenette that allows you to cook in your room. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Hotel Longuinhos Beach Resort 3 * is one of the most successful options if you decide to go to South Goa.

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  In addition to the positive aspects, there are also a number of shortcomings in the Longuinhos Beach Resort 3 * hotel.  Traveler reviews include a number of comments on this resort: </p><ul><li>  the furniture in the room is very old and shabby, and there are stains on the walls, so it would not hurt to make at least cosmetic repairs; </li><li>  despite the fact that the apartment has a large closet, it does not have shelves or hangers (how to put things there is not entirely clear); </li><li>  in most rooms (with the exception of the most expensive apartments) there are no refrigerators, and therefore it is not possible to buy food for future use (apparently this was done with the aim of lodging guests in restaurants); </li><li>  there is no safe in the apartment, so you have to use a paid cell, which is provided at the reception; </li><li>  breakfasts are very scarce and tasteless, besides seasoned with an incredibly huge amount of hot spices. </li></ul><p>  Be that as it may, the Longuinhos Beach Resort 3 * Resort is a great place for unassuming tourists who want to plunge enough in the gentle sea, as well as get to know Indian culture and many attractions. </p>
