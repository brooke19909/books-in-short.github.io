    <p>  Development in this area began immediately after the discovery of the possibility of the existence of controlled <span>nuclear fusion.</span>  Then, of course, none of the scientists could have imagined for what purposes the <span>military machine</span> could direct the latest invention <span>.</span>  But the order to create thermonuclear weapons was delivered promptly and clearly.  Scientists, of course, did not dare to say too much, so they got down to business. </p><p>  But things went quickly - the first working <span>nuclear reactor</span> came into operation exactly before the new, 1943th year.  This happened in the USA, and not in Nazi Germany, whose government, by the way, saw its imaginary victory in the war in the halo of such a rare phenomenon at that time as a thermonuclear explosion.  However, Hitler‚Äôs supporters did not succeed in realizing their plans - German scientists did not find the required amount of <span>enriched uranium,</span> which is simply vital for the operation of the reactor.  There was a shortage a month and a half before the May surrender, which meant that the engineers would not have had enough time to produce fuel under any circumstances.  In the end, German scientists, together with their reactor, left for the United States, where they continued their research, but already under the supervision of local special services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thermonuclear explosion" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12314/88923.jpg" width="381"></div>

Three days later, the city of Nagasaki received the same ‚Äúgift‚Äù from the United States.  Due to explosions and the influence of radiation, several hundred thousand civilians died and died.  Almost all survivors were permanently disabled.  Soon, Tokyo surrendered, and the <span>world community was</span> seriously thinking about the appropriateness of using such weapons. </p><p>  Until the end of World War II, a thermonuclear bomb was not used for its intended purpose.  However, over the next 20 years, <span>nuclear powers</span> exploded as much ammunition for testing as would be enough for more than one war.  The apotheosis of this unofficial competition was the explosion on October 30, 1961 of the year of the shell called "Tsar bomb."  The tests were carried out on New Earth, in an atmosphere of complete secrecy.  The force of the explosion was about 58 megatons, which is equivalent to almost 6 thousand bombs dropped by the Americans on Hiroshima.  If then they were armed with the Tsar Bomb, then a country such as Japan could be completely forgotten. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thermonuclear weapon" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12314/88925.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The thermonuclear bomb is a useful, but at the same time, terrible invention of design thought.  Being the <span>most powerful weapon,</span> it forces states to live in peace, but at what cost?  After all, if the world is achieved by resolving differences, this is one thing, and if the world is forced, then this is completely different.  The Cold War, of course, is long over, but so far, many political scientists and military historians do not rule out the possibility of a new major military conflict, during which the nuclear powers use their main weapons, and the world will come to an end in its current understanding.  But this, of course, is only a theory. </p>
