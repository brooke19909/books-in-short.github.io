    <p>  The only difficulty is to choose a suitable style, because skirts connected with knitting needles not only emphasize the advantages of the figure, but also reveal its flaws. </p><h2>  Variety of models </h2><p>  How to tie a skirt that can attract attention?  Whatever style the girl prefers, among the variety of models she can easily choose what she likes.  These are strict office skirts, and “grunge” ones made of <span>thick yarn</span> with loose loops, and ethnic-style models with ornaments, braids and arana.  Also models for an evening exit from shiny yarn and casual skirts. </p><p>  Owners of magnificent forms need to be especially attentive to the choice of style.  General recommendations: avoid excessive fitting and large volumetric pattern.  It is better to stay on the A-silhouette and a length slightly above or below the knee.  Among the possible styles you can consider: </p><ul><li>  skirt year; </li><li>  A-line skirt </li><li>  free straight silhouette model. </li></ul><p>  Slender girls can choose any style, but it is not recommended to wear mini skirts very high, as they violate the proportions of the silhouette. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to look for when knitting </h2><p>  A feature of a knitted fabric is elasticity and extensibility.  It is good if there is a small amount of elastane in the yarn.  According to reviews of knitters, it is best to choose natural yarn with the designations “anti-pilling”, “laster” or “superwash” for work - such threads are pre-treated with a special compound to minimize the formation of coughing.  So that the product does not deform during socks, it is necessary to make a cover or a petticoat for it. </p><p>  When knitting in a circle, it is likely that the sides will sag, so for figures with a pronounced difference between the waist and hips, it is preferable to knit a skirt of two parts and with tucks. </p><p>  When knitting a skirt of a straight silhouette knee-length for an average size (44-46), about 400-500 g of yarn will be needed.  This value may vary depending on the selected pattern, the length and splendor of the skirt. </p><h2>  How to knit a skirt </h2><p>  Even the simplest straight-skirt can be made in many ways. </p><ol><li>  Bottom to top is a familiar method for many.  On the knitting needles the number of loops is equal to the width of the skirt on the bottom.  To the line of the hips it is knitted with a straight cloth, and then the loops are reduced only on the sides or also in the place of the tucks. </li><li>  From top to bottom, knitting a skirt with knitting needles is very convenient.  The belt of the skirt is immediately tied out, increases are made to expand to the hips.  Working in this way, it is easy to try on a future skirt by adjusting the width and length of the product. </li><li>  Another option.  How to knit a skirt with knitting needles?  You need to start work from the line of the hips.  Loops are drawn from the auxiliary thread, then knitting continues with the main thread to the bottom of the skirt.  The auxiliary thread opens and knitting up continues on open loops. </li><li>  You can tie the skirt for women diagonally.  In this way, a perfectly sitting thing is created without additional tucks.  And, if the work is made of sectional dyeing yarn, the effect will be amazing.  How to tie a skirt in an oblique?  Three loops are typed on the knitting needles, in the next front row on both sides it is added along the loop with the help of yarn.  From the inside, the crochets are tied with a crossed loop to mask the holes.  Additions are made at the beginning and end of each facial row until the side of the resulting triangle is equal to the height of the side seam.  After this, the loops are added only at the beginning of the row, and at the end one loop is reduced.  When the panel of the skirt reaches the desired width, reduction must be done on both sides. </li><li>  Another way to make a skirt is cross-knitting.  With the help of shortened rows, it is convenient to knit tucks, pleated skirts also turn out perfectly. </li><li>  Separately, it is worth noting knitting skirts with a seamless method on circular knitting needles.  This option is similar to knitting on straight knitting needles, only the edge loops are not typed. </li></ol>

    <ol><li>  Starting any knitting project, you need to make a sample of that pattern, which will be the work.  You need to connect the fragment 15 by 15 cm, moisten it and dry it in a horizontal position. </li><li>  Next, the number of loops and rows in 1 cm of the figure is calculated.  After that, you need to calculate the number of loops on the bottom of the skirt and along the waistline.  The difference between these values ​​is 4 cm for all sizes.  Multiplying the number of loops in 1 cm by 4, we get the number of loops that need to be reduced from the hips to the waist. </li><li>  After calculating how many rows from hip to waist, you need to evenly distribute the cut loops.  The skirt belt can be made knitted or sewn.  For a seamless knitted belt, knitting continues above the waistline by another 3.5 cm, then the front row is sewn with purl loops to form an inflection, and another 3.5 cm with the main pattern.  On the inside of the belt loop, pinch along the waist line, leaving a small area for stretching the elastic. </li></ol><h2>  Cross knitting skirts </h2><p>  Cross knitting involves work from one side to another.

    <p>  Very attractive look models made of yarn, dyed sectionally.  Unlike ordinary knitting, vertical stripes are created in the cross, which can advantageously adjust the silhouette.  Fans of Missoni style and pleated skirts will find many models made in this way. </p><h2>  Flared skirts </h2><p>  Flared skirts, knitted with needles, are especially suitable for women with curvaceous shapes - they emphasize the waist, smoothing the fullness of the hips.  Such models are presented in the following types: </p><p>  1. A trapezoidal skirt, consisting of several wedges or gradually expanding to the bottom.  The difference in the method of adding loops: when knitting wedges, increments are made at the beginning and end of the segment, so that the line of the wedge clearly stands out.  Very often, along the line of decorative increases is a drawing: a plait or braid.  In a regular skirt-a-line, increases are made along the side seam and, if the yarn is thin, in the middle of the fabric.  In this case, the number of tucks in the skirts, “blades” is equal to the number of borders between the wedges. </p>

    <p>  2. Skirts-corrugation, or pleated, can be knitted in the transverse direction and from top to bottom.  In both cases, to obtain a hem between a certain number of loops of garter or hosiery knitting, forming the width of the folds, vertical tracks from the front or back loops are knitted.  For a more pronounced pleated effect, folds are formed along the waistline. </p><p>  3. The skirt-year is knitted according to the pattern of a direct silhouette, and at a certain height, at equal intervals, increases are made, forming wedges.  In this style, it is very important to choose the right place for the beginning of the flare, so that the folding bottom does not weigh down the volumetric hips. </p>

    <p>  A skirt with pleats from the belt is suitable for slim girls.  For sizes where visual figure correction is needed, it is preferable to use folds from the hip line or along the bottom of the product. </p><h2>  Knitting skirt for girls </h2><p>  Features of a children's figure make it possible to choose any model you like.  The skirt of the girl, knitted with needles, can be with pleats and frills, straight and magnificent, plain and motley.  The product will be decorated with multi-colored stripes, ornaments and knitted images of your favorite characters. </p><p>  How to tie a skirt so that the baby wore it for more than one year?  Firstly, the work is worth doing from top to bottom - when the girl grows up, the length is easy to increase by simply tying several rows.  Secondly, it is better to choose yarn with a natural composition, the presence of a large percentage of acrylic will lead to the formation of coughing, and the skirt will lose its attractive appearance.

    <p>  When knitting with threads of different colors, it is desirable that they be of the same thickness.  The knitting algorithm for such a skirt is very simple. </p><ol><li>  Measure the waist circumference of the girl, calculate the required number of loops from the sample connected by the front surface.  Calculate the desired width of the skirt on the bottom and determine the number of loops that need to be added for expansion. </li><li>  The skirt is knitted in one piece - in front and back.  Work can be done on straight or circular knitting needles. </li><li>  To start work with a whole knitted belt with a 1 to 1 elastic band. If you wish, create splendor along the waist line, in the first row of the front surface you can double the number of loops.  Another option is to add a certain number of loops at equal intervals in the rows. </li><li>  Thus, the skirt is knitted to the desired length, the last rows are made with a stabilizing pattern with alternating front and back loops: in this case, a garter stitch.  In the future, these rows can be dissolved and a few more bands tied. </li><li>  At the end of the work, sew the side seam, if any, finish the design of the belt and pull out the elastic. </li></ol><h2>  Crochet skirt </h2><p>  The most common type of crocheted skirt is an openwork summer model of cotton threads with the addition of silk or viscose.  Such models can be straight silhouette or flared.  Knitting can be done in tiers or individual motifs. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet skirt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66624/2189644.jpg"></div>  Crocheting a skirt, like knitting, is easy.  It is enough to choose the pattern you like, execute it in the sample and calculate the required number of rapports that fit into the width of the product canvas.  Crochet a skirt is better from top to bottom.  To openwork looked more expressive, a contrasting fabric can be used as a cover.
