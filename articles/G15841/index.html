This area is simply created for a wonderful pastime. </p><h2>  Fishing in Savelyevo.  How to get to the place </h2><p>  Visits are open year-round.  To get there, you need to drive from the Moscow Ring Road along the Leningradskoye Shosse for about 38 km, then, after Pawn, turn left to Savelyevo.

Having passed the village, on the left side you can see the lake, which is the ultimate goal of the route.  People who do not have their own car can use public transport that runs from the Voykovskaya metro station (bus 440).  The stop is located opposite the turn to the fishing industry. </p>

And does the price correspond to the quality of the services provided?  More about this below. </p>

    <h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  How much does fishing in Savelyevo cost?  Prices for trips to the main water area are within 2 thousand rubles.  The catch rate has not been established.  This means that you can take with you as many fish as you catch.  Naturally, such a turn of events gives clients quite understandable joy.  But, as the fishermen note, it was not without limitations.  Allowed to use up to 5 gear, on which there will be one hook.  However, according to vacationers at the base, they are not observing this very strictly, especially at a considerable distance from the guard houses.  Fishing in Savelyevo will cost nothing for war veterans and children under 12 years old.  But for the catch itself you still need to pay.  In addition, they must be accompanied by a fisherman.  Currently, every 11 package is provided as a gift.  It should be noted that fish in Savelyevo are launched in large batches.  In addition, on weekends, the pond is filled additionally.  The amount of potential production that needs to be launched into the reservoir is calculated based on the number of fishing enthusiasts.  The best fishing in Savelyevo begins immediately after the launch, it bites especially well in the place where it happened.  Therefore, in the morning, vacationers try to stop near the dam.  This whole picture resembles an <span>ice battle.</span>  Such races for the best places are actively discussed at many fishing forums. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Bait </h2><p>  In winter, the main prey is trout.  The main lures are spinners ("Williams"), trout paste (cheese, garlic, sorbet), squid, caviar, shrimp, "nymph".  Each fisherman uses his own option.  Carp in Savelyevo bites no worse than in other bodies of water.  He prefers corn, worm, boilies.  Som loves a bunch of worms and a liver.  Of course, the fish is not always predictable, it can peck on another bait. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Since the reservoir is natural, there is a significant difference in depths and many areas with snags.  This is what attracts lovers of a good catch.  Koryazhnik is located in the far corner, on the side opposite the dam, as well as on the side of the forest.  There is a VIP zone on the pond, the size of which does not exceed the yard hockey box.  It is located near the cages.  The price of a permit in this zone is 500 rubles per fisherman (including women and children), plus a fee for each kilogram of catch.  The main part of it is trout, as well as in the rest of the pond.  In the VIP zone, it is allowed to catch a maximum of two gear per trip. </p><p>  The duration of a <span>paid reservoir</span> depends on the length of daylight hours.  All questions and nuances that have arisen can be discussed in advance with the administration (the database has its own website: savelevo-fish.ru). </p>
