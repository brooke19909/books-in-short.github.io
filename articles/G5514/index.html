Already at that time it was quite large and famous, as it was on a significant trade route.  According to one version, the settlement was founded by the peoples of Scandinavia.  Famous historians argue about the origin of the name of the city today.  There are two versions.  If you believe the first, then the settlement was named after the river ("Chickens") on which it stands.  Opponents of this theory say that the city was designated in honor of the partridges living in its vicinity.  These birds are also depicted on the modern coat of arms of the city.  In 1095 the Principality of Kursk was founded.  In the sixteenth century, a reliable fortress was erected here, and for two centuries the city was an important military-strategic object for the entire Kievan Rus.  But already in the eighteenth century, the Tatar-Mongol forces heavily sacked and destroyed this settlement.  However, it was restored and played a significant role in the Great Patriotic War.  Many monuments of Kursk are dedicated specifically to the battle of Kursk, which significantly influenced the course of the war.  Today, the village proudly bears the title of a hero city.  This settlement is also included in the list of the cleanest and most well-groomed cities in Russia. </p><h2>  Remember the war ... </h2>

Such development is typical for many settlements of our country, but local architecture nevertheless deserves attention.  Kursk is rich in churches, and in its vicinity are several ancient monasteries.  It is definitely worth visiting the Sergiev Kazan Cathedral, located on Maxim Gorky Street.  In its decoration, it is not inferior to the churches of Moscow, it operates today, it is easy to get into the service here.  The <span>Znamensky Monastery</span> has been preserved in good condition to this day <span>.</span>  Some of the buildings are not used for their intended purpose, in different years there was a plant and a warehouse in them.  But today, part of the monastery has been restored and is operational.  Speaking about the sights of Kursk, one cannot ignore the Church of the Resurrection of Christ.  This is a relatively small red brick building with rich interior decoration.

If you came to visit all the monuments of Kursk and visit several museums, you should stay here at least a couple of days.  The main thing is to decide where you want to live, in a hotel or in a separate apartment?  There are enough offers in both segments of temporary housing.  But still it‚Äôs worth to book an interesting option in advance - this will save your time.  Hotels can be found for every taste from inexpensive to super modern with appropriate prices.  The first category includes: ‚ÄúVisit‚Äù, ‚ÄúMill‚Äù and ‚ÄúKursk‚Äù, the best hotels of the city: ‚ÄúAurora‚Äù, ‚ÄúNightingale Grove‚Äù and ‚ÄúOktyabrskaya‚Äù. </p>
