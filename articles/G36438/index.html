However, we draw the attention of the reader that there are currently a lot of such gadgets.  Almost all are equipped with two slots, allowing you to use SIM cards of different operators.  Given this, the selection of the best models will be carried out with an emphasis on other characteristics.  We also highlight devices with 4G support, two radio modules and a powerful battery.  An equally important criterion is the balance between equipment and price.  Not all expensive smartphones can be called the best.  The gadgets of the budget segment deserve this title.  So, let's get down to the description of certain models. </p><h2>  The best Phillips smartphones with two SIM cards </h2><p>  Although the models of the Philips manufacturer cannot be called quite popular, they still have their fans.  Of the entire assortment, we can distinguish devices Xenium X588, Xenium X818, X586.  Let's take a closer look at their features. </p><ul><li>  Philips Xenium X588 is a pretty powerful gadget.  This is evidenced by a capacious battery of 5 thousand mAh and RAM of three gigabytes.  In addition to these advantages, the smartphone is equipped with a good screen.  User can enjoy 5 ∫ diagonal.  The quality of the reproduced picture corresponds to the HD resolution.  The ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the device is the chip of the Chinese manufacturer MediaTek model MT6750.  In order for the user to be able to install applications, the smartphone has a built-in storage of 32 GB.  Also, this model has a fingerprint sensor for fingerprint reading and a USB Type-C type charging connector. </li><li>  Philips Xenium X818 is a smartphone with two SIM cards, which, according to users, has absolutely no drawbacks.  This model has excellent characteristics that allow it to compete with devices from other manufacturers.  The indisputable advantages of the smartphone are: a large screen (5.5 ∫) with Full HD resolution, a productive platform (Helio 10, ROM - 32Gb, RAM - 3Gb), an excellent camera with a 16-megapixel sensor.  Users have no problems with autonomy, since the 3900 mAh battery is responsible for this indicator.  With an average load, the device is able to work for several days. </li><li>  Philips X586 is a great model that will suit any user without exception.  It launches "heavy" games without problems and allows you to work with resource-intensive applications.  The basis of the hardware platform was the MediaTek MT6735 processor.  The manufacturer sold two gigabytes of RAM and 16 Gb of native memory.  Quite good performance has this smartphone and the criterion of autonomy.  The device is equipped with a 3000 mAh battery.  The camera did not fail either.  The main one has a resolution of 13 megapixels.  And this ensures a high-quality image. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.digit.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philips Xenium X588" class="if uuid-2327527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2327527.jpg"></div><h2>  Segment up to 5000 rubles </h2><p>  The best smartphones with two SIM cards are among the cheapest.  The fact that they have a low cost is not due to the fact that they are of poor quality.  Significantly reduce their cost by limiting the functionality.  As a rule, such models differ in modest characteristics.  They do not install high-resolution screens, powerful batteries, large amounts of memory and productive processors.  However, this does not make cellular reception worse.  If a person just needs a ‚Äúworkhorse‚Äù, then we recommend that you pay attention to the following models. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fly FS407 Stratus 6 </h2><p>  With a price tag around 2000 rubles, you can find a good smartphone with two SIM cards.  Fly FS407 Stratus 6 is just that.  According to users, it has everything that you might need.  We are talking about the camera, Wi-Fi-module, GPS.  However, it is worth noting that you do not have to count on a long battery life, since the device is equipped with a rather weak battery with a capacity of 1300 mAh.  If you activate Wi-Fi, the device will be discharged to 0% in just 4-5 hours.  This, of course, is a significant minus, however, working in the "dialer" mode, the gadget will live quite a whole day.  Owners of this model can be advised to purchase a portable battery that will allow you to stay in touch at any time. </p><p>  Despite this drawback, the FS407 Stratus 6 has significant advantages.  These include excellent speaker volume, nice design, compact size, low weight. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gsmchoice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fly FS407 Stratus 6" class="if uuid-2327521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2327521.jpg"></div><h2>  Alcatel Pixi 4 4034D </h2><p>  Another inexpensive smartphone with two SIM cards, which can claim the title of the best in this segment, is the Alcatel Pixi 4 4034D.  It is sold in stores with a price tag slightly above 2000 rubles.  For that kind of money, the user gets a gadget with a 3.2 megapixel camera, equipped with a flash, music player, 4-inch screen.  The native memory in the phone has only four gigabytes.  This, of course, is critically small, but the problem of lack of space can be solved in a simple way - by installing a memory card.  The device supports drives up to 32 GB.  Mobility is provided by a 1500 mAh battery.  Her resource is enough for seven hours of conversation.  And this, of course, is pretty good for a public sector employee.  There is not much RAM installed in the phone - only 512 MB, so you can‚Äôt count on working with modern applications. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The most important drawback of this model, many users consider the lack of speakerphone, and as for the "dialer" this criterion for some may be decisive. </p><h2>  Segment up to 10 000 rubles </h2><p>  The best smartphones with two slots for SIM cards are also available in the category of up to 10,000 rubles.  They, like the ones described above, do not differ in advanced functionality, but the main characteristics in them are a cut above.  Manufacturers in such smartphones provide users with a decent hardware platform, excellent cameras and powerful batteries.  The devices have wireless modules, good speakers are installed, and, most importantly, cellular communication works without failures. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi 4X </h2><p>  An excellent smartphone with two SIM cards is presented by the manufacturer from the Middle Kingdom.  It's about the Xiaomi brand.  Recently, the gadgets of this company have become quite popular.  In the segment of up to 10,000 rubles, the Redmi 4X model stood out brightly.  Its main and indisputable advantage is that the manufacturer optimally maintained a balance between cost and performance.  There were no complaints about the assembly of users.  The case itself is made of metal, looks solid and reliable.  The screen with HD quality has a size of 5 ∫.  Powered by a Snapdragon 435 MSM8940 chip.  It is based on eight computing elements that are capable of delivering a frequency of 1400 MHz.  The characteristics of the hardware platform complement 2 gigabytes of RAM.  The volume of native memory is average - 16 Gb.  The battery is capacious - 4100 mAh.  Its resource will be enough for 18-20 hours of conversation.  There are no problems with cameras either.  At the heart of the rear is a 13 megapixel sensor.  Pictures are of decent quality.  Although two SIM card slots (Micro + Nano) are installed in the device, they work alternately, since there is only one radio module. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.alzashop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi Redmi 4X" class="if uuid-2327520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2327520.jpg"></div><h2>  Meizu M5c </h2><p>  A smartphone with two Meizu M5c SIM cards can be purchased for about 6,000 rubles.  What equipment is offered for the money?  The device runs on the MediaTek MT6737.  When the load increases, the processor accelerates to 1300 MHz.  The amount of memory will be enough even for a demanding user - 2/16 Gb.  There is the possibility of using an external drive, with which the built-in storage is expanded to 128 Gb.  The gadget was released in 2017, so the manufacturer installed the current version of the operating system on it - ‚ÄúAndroid 7.0‚Äù.  On a single charge, the smartphone can work up to 37 hours of talk time.  These results are provided by a 3000 mAh battery.  The screen for this segment has quite typical characteristics - 5 ∫, HD.  The cameras are weak.  Their resolution is 8 and 5 megapixels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.slashgear.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meizu M5c" class="if uuid-2327523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2327523.jpg"></div><h2>  Premium class </h2><p>  The best smartphone with two SIM cards is very difficult to single out in the premium class.  Almost all models have powerful features.  The cost of such devices, of course, is high, but it is fully justified by the equipment.  Manufacturers are trying to surprise users with the most sophisticated "chips."  Expensive smartphones, as a rule, have a capacious battery, an optimally balanced platform, a camera that can compete with cameras.  It is rather difficult to single out one model in the assortment series, so we turn to user reviews. </p><h2>  Sony Xperia XZ Premium </h2><p>  When choosing the best smartphone with two SIM and a memory card in the premium class, you should pay attention to the Sony Xperia XZ Premium.  At the exhibition in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthis flagship received high marks from experts.  Buyers were also pleased with the new product.  She got a great chipset - Snapdragon 835 MSM8998.  Command processing is carried out by 8 computing modules that operate at a frequency of 2450 MHz.  The storage device on which the data is stored has a capacity of 4 Gb.  Built-in memory - 64 Gb.  This is more than enough even for an advanced user.  However, if necessary, this storage is increased to 256 Gb by installing a memory card.  The smartphone has a stable 3G and 4G signal.  For mobility, a lithium-ion battery is responsible.  Its capacity is 3230 mAh.  The gadget implements Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 technology for fast charging.  The housing is protected against moisture.  This flagship excelled in an excellent camera.  Its resolution is 19 megapixels.  High quality shooting is provided by the Sony IMX400 Exmor RS.  The front module also has a good resolution.  The 13-megapixel sensor provides excellent quality photos and videos. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stuff.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Xperia XZ Premium" class="if uuid-2327525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2327525.jpg"></div><h2>  The best models of smartphones with two SIM cards and a powerful battery </h2><p>  Currently, most manufacturers produce functional gadgets with powerful batteries.  These models are in demand.  And some of them are quite popular.  The first place buyers gave the gadget ASUS ZenFone 4 Max ZC554KL.  In addition to having a stylish design and excellent hardware platform, a powerful 5000 mAh battery is still considered a significant advantage.

Unlike FLY and ASUS devices, it is equipped with a battery with a capacity of 10,000 mAh.  Impressive ?!  However, this can be considered both an advantage and a disadvantage.  In the first case, such a battery provides a long service life, and in the second, it has increased the thickness (14 mm) and weight (288 g).  The design of the smartphone is original.  The platform is based on the MT6750 processor (2 / 32Gb).  The device boasts an excellent display (5.5 ∫, 1920 √ó 1080 px). </p><div class="photo" data-original="sanyamalhotraa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ZenFone 3 Max ZC520TL" class="if uuid-2327526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2327526.jpg"></div><h2>  4G smartphones </h2><p>  Currently, choosing smartphones with 4G and with two SIM cards is not a problem.
