  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Peasant Reform of 1861 Causes and consequences</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Forever in the history of Russia, Alexander II will remain as the liberator of serfs.  Reforms of Alexander II were always distinguished by democracy and gradualism.  Do not forget that gradual reform is the secret of the rule of a competent monarch.  And Alexander the second fully recognized this secret. </p><p>  Alexander the Second, from his youth, was occupied by Peasant Reform.  However, he could only begin her after taking the throne.  What were the reasons for such a zealous desire of the monarch to free <span>serfs?</span> </p><p>  1) Alexander the second, as a wise and competent ruler, understood that serfdom hindered the state.  The European world has long abandoned the use of any slaveholding elements.  Russia continued to linger, fearing reactionary reforms.  According to Alexander the second, peasant reform was supposed to eliminate fundamentally all the reasons for Russia's lagging behind world powers. </p><p>  <span>2) Alexander</span> was deeply convinced that the existence of serfdom in the country had a bad effect on Russia's defense ability.  Serfdom led to a downgrade of Russia among European powers.  Moreover, many European monarchs considered doing business with Russia below their dignity.  Just like in the days of Ancient Russia, when Vladimir could not get the hands of the princess of Constantinople just because he was a pagan. </p><p>  3) Do not forget that the new monarch was brought up in the spirit of enlightenment and democracy.  The creative intelligentsia has long advocated the abolition of serfdom.  The teacher of Alexander the second in his youth was Vasily Zhukovsky himself, who was the leader of the creative intelligentsia of the 19th century.  It Zhukovsky is considered the teacher of Pushkin.  According to Alexander the second, peasant reform should have a positive impact on the spiritual component of Russian society. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The foundation for the reform was laid in 1857, when the monarch created the Privy Commission.  The secret commission was to develop a plan according to which the abolition of serfdom was to become the most smooth and inconspicuous. </p><p>  The main problem for the monarch was the confrontation between the interests of serfs and the nobility.  The nobles were sincerely convinced that the abolition of serfdom was useless for the country.  They did not want to part with their lands and with their peasants. </p><p>  The serfs, on the contrary, believed that peasant reform should fully restore their freedom, and besides, bring land on which to farm.  It was impossible to please both of them. </p><p>  <span>February 19,</span> 1861 a significant event took place for all of Russia - serfdom was abolished.  Throughout the country, the decree of Alexander the Second was read in churches.  According to this decree, all serfs received freedom and independence from their former landowners.  Each peasant received land for personal use.  However, this land was still considered the property of the landowner.  Peasants were obliged to buy their land from the landowner, seeking independence of possessions. </p><p>  Thus, the <span>abolition of serfdom in</span> 1861 forever changed Russia.  However, neither the landlords nor the peasants were satisfied.  The landlords believed that they were robbed, taking away the legitimate lands.  The peasants were sure that the former serfdom was replaced by a new one, which became known as mining.  As a result, Alexander the second was condemned in almost all walks of life.  After 20 years, Alexander will finally lose credibility among the masses.  In 1881, he was killed by conspirators from among the popular circles, which were especially widespread in Russia at the end of the 19th century. </p><p>  Despite everything, Alexander the second entered the history of Russia as a great figure, an inimitable reformer, a visionary politician.  It is thanks to the active reformist activity of Alexander the Second that modern Russia has such a look. </p>
