  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fashionable crochet: Osinki - club for needlewomen!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The demand for needlework is growing daily: offline stores are littered with yarn, floss, charts, magazines, and themed online stores, sites, forums, and communities are created online.  The most sought after hobby is crocheting.  "Osinki" is the "habitat" of professional and novice knitters. </p><h2>  Why is crocheting a popular destination? </h2><ol><li>  Convenience.  For this hobby, only threads, a hook and a pattern are required.  Materials do not take up much space and can be taken on the road, to the beach, to rest. </li><li>  Simplicity.  The patterns are not as complex as in knitting, you only need to master a maximum of ten operations that vary. </li><li>  Diversity.  Due to the texture of the threads and the knitting technique, the product can be light and airy or ‚Äúhard‚Äù, that is, keep its shape.  No wonder they crochet clothes, <span>toys, pillows,</span> bags, coats, flowers, hats, washcloths, paintings. </li><li>  Fashion.  Many designers decorate their clothes with decorative knitted flowers, patterns, elements.  Even swimwear can be crocheted! <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheting aspen" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/341773.jpg" width="570"></div></li></ol><p>  The needlewomen draw inspiration from like-minded people who like crocheting.  Osinki is a popular club of professional craftswomen and novice knitters who share their experiences, copyright schemes, magazines and their work.  Here you can learn how to knit children's and adult clothes, summer fashion models, chic napkins, exclusive toys, mittens, socks, bags, scarves, and even pet clothes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is the Osinka club useful for? </h2><ul><li>  Crochet: patterns of <span>dresses, tunics,</span> blouses, swimwear, coats, socks, bags, scarves, napkins, and even washcloths can be found on the site itself or ask forum users. </li><li>  Professional courses.  The site provides an opportunity to undergo distance learning from specialists on a free and paid basis.  The bottom line is that by signing up for the newsletter, you get a number of free lessons, and then, if you wish, you sign up for paid classes. </li><li>  Handicrafts of needlewomen from the Osinka club.  <span>Crocheting tunics,</span> sweaters, napkins, toys and various items can only be found on the forum.  In addition, registered users can ask the authors of the products for advice. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pattern" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/341774.jpg?1393161849025" width="570"></div></li><li>  Forum.  In this place there are conversations on knitting, lessons and entertaining topics. </li><li>  Contests.  Masters of different levels of professionalism can try themselves in competitive events and get prize places and a certificate of victory for this. </li><li>  Master Class.  You can take advantage of detailed foreign lessons or arrange with the site administration about the publication of your work. </li></ul><h2>  Where to start crocheting? </h2><p>  "Osinki" on the pages of the forum opens a special section for beginner knitters.  First you need to know that there are several types of this direction. </p><ul><li>  Simple knitting that everyone can master.  Products using this technique are knitted in whole or in patterned elements.  In addition, the rows are created alternately, either on the face or on the wrong side of the product. </li><li>  In the Tunisian form, a long hook is used and things are knitted with a continuous cloth.  Moreover, having knitted a row, the next one must also be led from the face, only in the opposite direction. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aspen crochet tunic" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/341777.jpg?1393161895914" width="225"></div></li><li>  Irish lace is a complex knitting that requires a lot of time, experience and strength.  But the products in this technique are refined, stylish, very delicate. </li><li>  <span>Knitting on a fork</span> and crochet creates exclusive patterns that need to be combined into one. </li></ul><p>  Each technique has its own characteristics.  At the same time, simple crochet (Osinki gives a lot of patterns and tips in this direction) imitates lace, and Tunisian knitting, and complex plots.  For example, the craftswomen create original bags from plastic covers that are <span>crocheted,</span> or autumn maple leaves.  And all this is possible if you have threads and a hook, and also have a minimum of knowledge about stitches. </p>
