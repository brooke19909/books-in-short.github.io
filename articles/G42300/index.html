    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The second name of Vottovaara is Mount of Death.  Where is this facility located?  You should look for a landmark in central Karelia, near the villages of Sukkozero and Gimola.  Its height is not great (417 meters), which, however, is not so small for this region.  From the point of view of researchers, Vottovaara is a mountain in Karelia, which is a large rock with a steep southern slope, which has a width of two kilometers.  It stretched from north to south for 7 kilometers.  The mountain is located in a remote place, surrounded by swamps and abandoned roads built in Soviet times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vottovaara mountain in Karelia" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1233095.jpg" width="405"></div>

Thus, an amphitheater appeared in the center, covered with small lakes and rocks. </p><p>  Scientists of Karelia consider that Vottovaara is a mountain, which is a unique geological monument.  But in recent years, it has become of great interest to followers of various mystical trends.  As a rule, they claim that Death Mountain (Vottovaara) is a place where evil forces are concentrated.  Moreover, many magicians and sorcerers believe that the mountain is a bridge to another world. </p><h2>  Mount Vottovaara: information for consideration </h2><p>  Numerous seids that someone had erected on this earth, and gloomy swamps alternating with rocks, as well as chilling stories about shamans living on this mountain, contribute to the emergence of the most incredible legends.  Often, local residents talk about allegedly seen in the UFO district. </p><p>  Until now, it has not been scientifically proven when and by whom numerous stone structures were created.  More likely is the version that this is a creation of the ancient inhabitants of Karelia, who were aware of the unusual properties of the mountain.  Therefore, they used it to conduct religious rites. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mount vottovaara karelia" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1238712.jpg" width="600"></div>

Spruce and pine trees alternate here with traces of forest fires and old clearings.  The peaks of the mountain are rocky plateaus covered with bizarre-shaped trees of different heights.  For example, old, centuries-old pines do not grow here above two meters.  And the birches are twisted as if some unknown force had done it. </p><h2>  Seydy </h2><p>  At the top of the mountain, whose area is about six square kilometers, more than 1600 stones.  They are arranged in some mysterious order.  Scientists involved in the study of this object believe that this is the oldest cult complex - Mount Vottovaara.  The information obtained as a result of the work of numerous scientific expeditions suggests that the stones located in this territory are saids.  This name was given to cult boulders or rock fragments.  They are artificially isolated from the environment.  In other words, the seid has clear signs of human exposure. </p><p>  The densest concentration of seids was recorded on the slopes of the amphitheater, as well as on the highest point of the ridge, as well as on the slopes of the amphitheater.  They are located mainly in groups of up to six pieces.  The largest of them, weighing more than three tons, are installed on the "legs", more precisely on several smaller stones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mount vottovaara information" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1233098.jpg" width="600"></div>

Seydi surprisingly harmoniously fit into the general relief of the mountain - a somewhat fabulous, disheveled chaos created by an ancient earthquake. </p><h2>  Trees </h2><p>  Almost every tourist is amazed at how the trees look on Vottovaara Mountain.  Why do they have such a bizarre shape?  Look: they are like twisted into knots.  Locals explain this anomaly with cold and strong winds at the top.  Nevertheless, on Death Mountain, twisted trees grow in the neighborhood of perfectly normal plants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trees on mount vottovaara why" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1233099.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "Stairway to Heaven" </h2><p>  Vottovaara is a mountain in Karelia that constantly poses many mysteries to scientists.  One of them is the ‚Äústairway to heaven‚Äù.  So called thirteen steps cut down in the rock, which end with a deep cliff.  Archaeologists and historians claim that the ancient tribes that lived in these places did not have an ‚Äúidea of ‚Äã‚Äãa staircase,‚Äù as well as other tribes did not have an ‚Äúidea of ‚Äã‚Äãa wheel.‚Äù  The question of which origin (artificial or natural) should be attributed to this design has not yet received an official answer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vottovaara mountain how to get there by car" class="if" height="451" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1233093.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The cult complex </h2><p>  Wanting to unravel the plan of architects of antiquity, modern scientists have compiled a detailed plan of this complex.  To their surprise, a clear figured composition (circular, square or spiral) did not appear on paper.  The different ages of the seids suggest that the complex probably took a long time to form. </p><p>  There is a scientifically based version that Mount Vottovaara in Karelia is a grandiose religious complex that has no analogues anywhere in the world, where sacrificial rites have been held for centuries.  Scientists note that the Sami had two lines of beliefs - the cult of their ancestors and the cult of seids as patrons of crafts.  It is important that among the Sami, Seid worship was celebrated until the beginning of the 20th century.  This suggests that the complex could have formed before this time. </p><h2>  Why exactly Vottovaara? </h2><p>  Why did this ancient mountain choose this mountain as the most suitable place for ritual ceremonies?  While scientists over the years conducted their research, the rumor of the mysterious Vottovaara quickly spread throughout the world.  Lovers of everything unusual and mysterious became interested in her.  Expeditions reached here in succession.  And today it is safe to say that the most frequent guests in these parts are psychics. </p><p>  The most recognized magicians and sorcerers from Russia gather on the mountain every year.  What attracts them to Vottovaara?  The mountain, according to the magicians, has an amazing property - there is an amazing connection with space, which is not found in any other place in Russia.  This place has powerful energy, which, like a battery, feeds the powers of psychics.  Often they call this mysterious mountain an ‚Äúacupuncture‚Äù point.  Through it, our planet, as through an antenna, carries out an energy-informational exchange with space.  This is not easy to verify, so we will take the word of professional magicians. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vottovaara mountain how to get" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1233092.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Scientists believe that the ancient inhabitants of these territories could know about such unusual properties of the mountain.  Only in this way can one explain why the "land of sacrificial idols" was located here. </p><h2>  Research </h2><p>  Unfortunately, really serious physical research has not yet been conducted.  Probably, the study of electromagnetic radiation and the measurement of radiation background would give an explanation for this phenomenon and shed light on the strange phenomena occurring here. </p><p>  Many ordinary travelers believe that Mount Vottovaara (Karelia) has an abnormal effect on electronic equipment and mechanisms, as well as on the human body.  The reports of many expeditions mention the simultaneous stopping of hours at once by several members of the expeditionary team, fresh flash cards in digital cameras suddenly turned out to be crowded, many researchers started bleeding from the nose, people lost their orientation for a while and couldn‚Äôt reach the clearly visible target for hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="death mount vottovaara" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1233101.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mysteries of the mountain </h2><p>  Today, many lovers of mysterious and mysterious places are interested in Mount Vottovaara.  How to get here by car?  We will talk about this a bit later.  And now we‚Äôll talk in more detail about what surprises this mountain presents today. </p><p>  Officially recorded messages of local residents about the UFOs observed in the vicinity of the mountain.  Some cases occurred directly over Vottawaara.  For example, in 1987, a resident of these places spoke about a luminous object on top of a mountain, which disappeared sharply in the dark, and then reappeared surrounded by fiery flashes.  It seemed that the light was coming from the stones. </p><p>  In October 1988, several <span>unidentified flying objects were</span> allegedly approaching Vottovaara <span>.</span>  According to many eyewitnesses, a group of UFOs moved over the top of the mountain, changing their position very quickly.  This negatively affected the operation of <span>compasses (magnetic).</span>  In the spring of 1998, photographer <span>V. Orlov,</span> who was taking pictures on Vottovaar, printing photos, found that many of them captured a "light arc" that he did not see. </p><p>  In the mid-nineties, a group of Moscow tourists reported strange clicking sounds that emanated from stones.  According to the members of the tourist group, they did not even have time to get scared when they heard a strange buzz coming from above, as if there was a huge firework circling there.  A moment later, in front of the astonished gaze of tourists, a vision of a woman dressed in yellow clothes appeared.  This was accompanied by mysterious sounds that made stones, leaving the impression of something bordering between the devil and the divine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mount vottovaara" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1233100.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  In the summer of 2011, the Government of Karelia declared the Vottovaara complex a landscape natural monument.  The protected area today is more than one and a half thousand hectares.  The complex includes a mountain and surrounding area. </p><h2>  Mount Vottovaara: how to get there? </h2><p>  If you go by car from St. Petersburg, then Lake Ladoga can be circled both on the left and on the right.  In the second case, the length of the path will be 630 kilometers.  You need to get to Petrozavodsk, turn onto the R-15 highway and turn to Gimoly near the village of Girvas.  You will have to overcome 130 kilometers of primer.  Its quality depends largely on when the grader passed here: you can drive this road in 1.5-2 hours or spend all three if it is broken.  The distance from Petrozavodsk to Vottovaara is 220 kilometers. </p><p>  If you go around Lake Ladoga on the left, then your path will be 540 kilometers.  At the crossroads you will see signs: directly - Yarn and Petrozavodsk, to the right - to Pitk√§rana.  You need to turn left.  Although this road is almost 100 kilometers shorter, you can spend much more time, because after turning to Suoj√§rvi (to Gimol), you will have to travel 200 kilometers along the dirt road.  In perfect condition, it is quite rare. </p><p>  In the village of Gimoly you will see a lot of announcements with phone numbers of conductors.  From Gimol to the famous mountain about 20 kilometers, and most of the way are forest tracts, often running through swamps.  Therefore, it is better not to save, but to hire experienced guides. </p><p>  You can get to Vottovaara from Petrozavodsk by train number 680 "Petrozavodsk - Kostomuksha".  He walks once a week.  Travel time is 7.5 hours.  Tourists from St. Petersburg are suitable train number 350 "St. Petersburg - Kostomuksha."  He walks twice a week.  The road will take 12.5 hours. </p>
