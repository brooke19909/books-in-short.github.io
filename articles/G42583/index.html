    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The pedestrian Patriarchal bridge was built by the project of architects and artists Z. K. Tsereteli, M. M. Posokhin, as well as engineers A. Kolchin and O. Chemerinsky.  Construction <span>working documentation</span> passed the examination, design acceptance tests were successful.  The bridge opened in September 2004 and became one of the favorite places of Muscovites and tourists.  It got its name in honor of the Russian patriarch Alexander II.  Then, when the bulk of the production of the Krasny Oktyabr confectionery factory was transferred from the territory of Bersenevskaya Embankment, the stylobate bridge part was completed.  In this way the Patriarchal bridge was built.  The grand opening of the new part took place on the first Saturday of September 2007 - on this day Moscow City Day was celebrated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patriarchal bridge" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20295/457199.jpg" width="600"></div>

The Patriarchal Bridge consists of three-span structures and is located opposite the Cathedral of Christ the Savior.  The first branch of the bridge goes through the Moscow River, connecting Prechistenskaya embankment with Bersenevskaya.  The second stylobate part is located above the <span>Vodootvodny Canal</span> and passes through Bolotny Island to the <span>Yakimanskaya Embankment.</span>  This design position does not interfere with the normal traffic and allows for good navigation of ships.  In the near future it is planned to complete the flyover, through which it will be possible to go to the Big Yakimanka. </p><p>  Near the bridge there are such attractions: the famous museum "House on the Embankment", the majestic Cathedral of Christ the Savior and the profitable <span>house of Pertsov.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow Patriarchal Bridge" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20295/457197.jpg" width="600"></div>
