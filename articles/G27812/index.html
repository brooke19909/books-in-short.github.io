Since the refineries are the most liquid assets of the enterprise, their correct accounting is extremely important. </p><p>  Liquidity is the ability of things to turn into money.  MPZ in the list of such things takes one of the first places, since it is at the expense of MPZ that the enterprise makes a profit. </p><p>  This article will discuss general information about the refinery, accounting entries - materials are put into production, for other needs, the disposal and sale of refineries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="accounting entries released materials production" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60193/2046256.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What is MPZ? </h2><p>  Before proceeding to the description of the postings - materials were released into production and other postings, we will analyze some concepts. </p><p>  MPZ recognized assets involved in the main activities of the enterprise.  MPZ are determined by three criteria: their use in the production cycle, directly for sale and for other organization needs.  In other words, MPZ are materials used at the enterprise.  Since the MPZ refers to current assets, another important criterion that determines the MPZ is the period of their use, which should be shorter than 12 months or one production cycle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="materials released to production" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60193/2046254.jpg"></div>

Many are interested in the difference between these concepts.  In fact, there is no difference between them, and in different sources, both MPZ and inventories mean the same thing.  Prior to the entry into force of PBU 5/01, the term inventories was more often used to indicate reserves. </p><h2>  Admission and valuation of MPZ </h2><p>  The receipt of materials can be made through the purchase or creation of their means of the company.  Upon receipt of the material, the <span>accompanying documents</span> and a receipt order are drawn up (not to be confused with a cash receipt order), which should contain all the basic information about goods and materials.  Accounting and storage methods may also be used.  These include the batch method and the varietal method.  MPZ can be used for production purposes ( <span>account 20)</span> or their further sale.  When writing off goods and materials, they must be evaluated.  There are three options for evaluating the MPZ when writing off: at the unit price, at the average price, or at the price of the first at the time of purchase (FIFO). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="receipt of materials" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60193/2046258.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Consumption (vacation) MPZ </h2><p>  Material consumption means their delivery from warehouses for further use in the production cycle or for the needs of the company.  Most often, a record of the consumption of goods and materials is made on the debit of account 20. The movement of goods and materials inside the enterprise from one warehouse to another or for construction on the territory of the enterprise is regarded as an internal movement of the plant.  Documentation of these <span>business transactions</span> involves the use of the following documents: invoice for internal movement, limit-intake card M-8, requirement-invoice M-11 and consignment note M-15.  They are indicated in parentheses after the characteristics of the business transaction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="score 20" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60193/2046257.jpg"></div>

Other disposals include write-offs of the refinery and their donation.  The write-off occurs in three cases: the goods and materials become unusable, aging (moral), the detection of shortage or theft of the oil refinery and their deterioration (due to force majeure circumstances too).  Moral aging refers to a decrease in the liquidity of the refineries, due to the appearance on the market of new improved analogues. </p><p>  Material is written off by decision of a commission specially created for this purpose, in which persons responsible for goods and materials must be present.  Inspection of the refinery is carried out and an act of disposal is prepared.  Donation of material should occur through primary documents for the consumption of goods and materials - invoices, statements for external expenses and others.  In this case, the fact of donation is taxed, as well as the usual sale of refineries for money.  Other accounting for the disposal of materials is carried out using the following documents: material debit statement (hereinafter referred to as AFM), accounting statement-calculation (hereinafter referred to as BSR), invoice (hereinafter referred to as invoice), cash receipt order (hereinafter FFP), invoice M-15, KO-1 form, sales book. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="material disposal accounting" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60193/2046255.jpg"></div>
