  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to relax in summer: vacation options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On the eve of the summer season, each of us thinks about a vacation.  And the subconscious already draws tender sand underfoot, the gentle sea and the warm sun.  To make dreams come true, it is worth considering in advance where to relax in the summer.  In our article we want to talk about the best resorts in the country and abroad. </p><h2>  Evpatoria </h2><p>  The Black Sea coast offers a fairly large selection of resorts in the country.  If you are thinking about where to relax in the summer with children at sea, then it is worth remembering such a recognized children's resort as Yevpatoriya.  From the very beginning, the city was focused on kids, for whom nature itself created amazing conditions for swimming.  If pebble beaches prevail throughout the peninsula, then in Yevpatoriya, children will appreciate fine fine sand.  In addition, the city has interesting entertainment for children of all ages.  An amusement park, a dolphinarium, an aquarium, a children's theater, a dino complex - and this is not the whole list. </p><h2>  Sochi </h2><p>  If the question arises, where to relax in the summer, then the first thing that comes to mind is Sochi.  The most famous Russian resort can please you with interesting objects and entertainments at any time of the year.  Interactive museums, Olympic venues, a race track, water parks and amusement parks, family rope parks and an extreme skypark - all this can be seen with your own eyes.  The resort is of interest not only for adults, but also for children.  Sochi can offer a very diverse vacation for tourists.  The modern city is equipped with interesting latest facilities.  In addition, the close location of the mountains allows you to go hiking to enjoy the waterfalls and gorges, ride quad bikes and horses.  Even if you do not really like idle lying on the coast, here you will find a lot of interesting entertainments.  And yet, most of the tourists in the summer are attracted by the beaches.  The pebble coast will delight you with clean and warm water.  Of course, <span>rest in Sochi</span> cannot be called cheap.  But if you stay in the villages closest to the city, you can find quite acceptable options. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.nemiga.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort sochi" class="if uuid-2264702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2264702.jpg"></div><p>  Perhaps the main attraction of Sochi is the unique subtropical climate.  This is simply not anywhere else in Russia.  If you are planning a family vacation and wondering where to relax with your children in the summer, Sochi can be an ideal place.  Especially considering the number of children's facilities that operates on its territory. </p><p>  And the special nature of the region deserves close attention of tourists.  You can admire the riot of colors and flowering in the very old Southern Culture Park.  In a relatively small area, you can see plants literally from different parts of the world. </p><h2>  Anapa </h2><p>  One of those places where you can relax in the summer at sea is the famous Anapa.  The resort remains one of the most developed in the country.  Anapa boasts the best beaches on the Black Sea.  The resort is in demand not only because of the sea.  They also come here to improve their health in sanatoriums, hydropathic and mud baths.  Or just soak up the spa.  Rest in Anapa allows you to feel the mixture of Kuban and Caucasian traditions, cuisines and cultures.  The fame of local cuisine and wine has long gone beyond the region.  Therefore, each guest of the region seeks to visit the local cafes and fully enjoy the local hospitality. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Gelendzhik </h2><p>  Sochi is not the only place on the Black Sea coast.  Where to relax at sea in the summer?  It is worth recalling the beautiful Gelendzhik.  In addition to the warm sea, there are also sanatoriums in which mud and mineral water are used for treatment.  Gelendzhik boasts a variety of beaches, among which there are not only pebble, but also sandy.  The resort is located in a very picturesque place.  The city has a beautiful promenade, safari park, water park and many other attractions.  If you are interested not only in sea vacations, but also other attractions of the city, then you definitely will not get bored on vacation.  Gelendzhik is considered the cleanest city in Russia.  The city is located in a closed bay, which closes it from almost all sides.  For this reason, there is always warm water and almost no waves.  Local agencies offer a variety of excursions, jeeping in the mountains, fishing in the sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="apelsin-gel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gelendzhik resort" class="if uuid-2264706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2264706.jpg"></div><p>  The resort has a beautiful promenade, which is the central place where tourists gather in the evenings.  In Gelendzhik, it's good to relax with children.  Local beaches seem created for kids.  In addition, the resort has a lot of entertainment for children.  No less beautiful nature of the surroundings of the resort.  Here you can see the Caucasus Mountains, mountain streams and streams.  Gelendzhik is one of the most interesting places where a summer vacation will be guaranteed to be rich and interesting. </p><h2>  Kislovodsk </h2><p>  If you are interested in the question of where to relax in the summer in Russia, you should pay attention to the famous resort of Kislovodsk.  Caucasian mineral waters are still relevant.  Modern hotels and resorts are good for the whole family.  They can be rejuvenated by taking procedures and soaking up the spa.  Tourists will surely enjoy walks in the Resort Park with the Valley of Roses.  Guests of the city can take a cable car ride and also drink mineral water in the very old Narzan Gallery.  Natural attractions of the region are no less interesting, including <span>Honey Falls.</span> </p><h2>  Crimea </h2><p>  Where to relax in the summer in Russia at sea?  Crimea is one of those places that can be recommended for spending vacations.  Rest on the peninsula can be very vivid and memorable.  And the reason for this is beautiful beaches, unique nature, numerous palaces and other unique attractions.  In addition to such famous resort towns as Feodosia, Sevastopol, Yalta, Sudak, in the Crimea there are also small villages where summer vacations are a little cheaper.  But no less interesting.  The resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe peninsula has a well-developed infrastructure.  Local guides offer numerous entertainment.  In addition, the peninsula is rich in palace buildings, parks and other interesting objects that are popular among tourists.  There really is something to see here.  Moreover, a single vacation to inspect even the main facilities is clearly not enough. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gde.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in Crimea" class="if uuid-2264707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2264707.jpg"></div><p>  In Crimea, you can combine relaxation with excursions and wellness treatments.  Holidays spent on the peninsula, you will surely remember. </p><h2>  Azov coast </h2><p>  Where to relax in the summer at sea inexpensively?  As a budget holiday, you can consider the coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  By the way, it is very suitable for families with children.  The sea is very shallow, and the coast has gently sloping sandy approaches.  In addition, in the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov there are no jellyfish that children do not like so much. </p><p>  Of course, the resorts of the Azov coast are much more modest than the Crimea and the Krasnodar Territory.  But local towns and cities (Yeysk, Kuchugury, the village of Golubitskaya, Primorsko-Akhtarsk) will please with more modest accommodation prices and good service.  If you are thinking about where to relax inexpensively in the summer, then you should pay attention to the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  The modest resorts on its coast, of course, will not offer you a chic vacation.  But you will spend a measured quiet vacation in the outback. </p><h2>  Karelian Isthmus </h2><p>  <span>Where to relax in the summer in Russia,</span> if you do not belong to the category of lovers of sea resorts.  In this case, you should study the natural beauties of the country.  And there are a lot of them in Russia.  In the north of St. Petersburg on the Karelian Peninsula, there are stunningly beautiful places worth seeing.  In June, romantics can see white nights between the Gulf of Finland and Lake Ladoga, and in July you can even swim, but with the advent of August, it is time for mushrooms and berries.  In Vyborg, tourists will be interested in a medieval castle, Monrepos park and granite caves.  In Priozersk you can see the Korelu fortress.  The Karelian Isthmus is a great place for outdoor activities.  Local guides offer river rafting, rock tours and more. </p><h2>  Baltic Sea </h2><p>  It‚Äôs hard to say where it‚Äôs best to relax in the summer.  Much depends on your personal preferences.  If you do not like the heat, then you can go to the Kaliningrad region.  You will be pleasantly surprised by the well-groomed and clean land.  A good rest is guaranteed on the Curonian Spit, which stretches from Zelenograd to Lithuania, ending near the city of Klaipeda.  It is worth saying that the spit is a protected area.  Here the sandy coast is surrounded by dunes and coniferous forests.  Surprisingly, on the one hand, the spit is washed by the Baltic Sea, and on the other - by fresh waters. </p><div class="photo" data-source="http://www.dfl.org.ru/news/6875/" data-original="www.dfl.org.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Curonian spit" class="if uuid-2264711" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2264711.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, you can swim here both in fresh and in salt water.  True, the Baltic Sea cannot please with such high water temperatures as, for example, the Black Sea.  Nevertheless, swimming here is quite possible.  You can have a good time settling in Zelenograd or the villages of Rybachy, Morskoye and Lesnoye.  However, it is worth remembering that it is impossible to make bonfires or cut trees on the Curonian Spit.  After all, this is a conservation area. </p><h2>  Lakes of Russia </h2><p>  If not at sea, then where to relax inexpensively in the summer in Russia?  Of course, on beautiful lakes.  After all, each in its own way is unique and is surrounded by marvelous nature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prigatour.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Caspian sea" class="if uuid-2264714" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2264714.jpg"></div><p>  The Caspian Lake, or the sea, is located just between Asia and Europe.  In the summer, it manages to warm up to 30 degrees, which means it is quite suitable for swimming.  On the coast you can find quite budget places to stay.  In the Caspian, you can stay in cities such as Kaspiysk, Makhachkala, Lagan, Astrakhan, Derbent.  Also, small villages on the coast are suitable for recreation.  Of course, the local infrastructure is not too developed, but this is not the main thing.  If you go for the sun, sand and water, then all this you will certainly find here.  But your vacation will definitely fall into the category of economical ones.  Fans of fishing and hunting will be able to do their favorite thing.  And mothers with children, meanwhile, will fully enjoy all the charms of a beach holiday.  The Caspian coast is the place where it is possible to have a cheap summer vacation, unlike the Crimea and the Krasnodar Territory. </p><h2>  Baikal </h2><p>  There is no universal advice where it is better to relax in the summer: at sea or lakes.  It all depends on your wishes.  We suggest that you add beautiful Lake Baikal to the lists of options considered.  Of course, it is not in the south, but in Siberia, but still quite acceptable for a beach holiday.  By the way, hotels, camp sites and cottages have long been built on the coast. </p><p>  While resting on Lake Baikal, you can go fishing, go boating, go for berries and mushrooms, try your hand at rafting down the river, ride horses.  In general, guests will not be bored.  On the coast you can go with the whole family.  The clear water of the lake is considered unique, because there are no more such reservoirs in the world. </p><h2>  Lake Brosno </h2><p>  In the north of the Tver region, you can spend time on the shores of <span>Lake Brosno.</span>  The reservoir has its own characteristics.  The fact is that at a depth of forty meters there is a process of decay of the forest in it, which is why hydrogen sulfide is actively produced, which goes to the surface of the water.  If you do not know about this, then you will certainly be surprised by the noise from the bursting bubbles.  Locals tell an old legend that a dragon lives in the lake.  It is he who makes noise and scares uninvited guests.  Of course, the legend is just a beautiful fairy tale that attracts curious tourists here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sun-expo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake brosno" class="if uuid-2264718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2264718.jpg"></div><p>  Numerous camp sites and recreation centers work on the shore of the reservoir.  In addition, you can always settle in the private sector.  But it is worth remembering that the swimming season in the pond lasts only two months.  The lake is surrounded by forests, which gives tourists the opportunity to collect berries and mushrooms, ride horses along the trails.  Lake Brosno is another place where it is fun and interesting to relax in the summer, especially if you like natural beauty. </p><h2>  Extreme vacation </h2><p>  Among the tourists there are many people who prefer outdoor activities, rather than idle lying on the beach.  Such travelers may be advised to go rafting or mountain climbing.  There are many suitable places for one and the second sport in Russia.  Extreme sportsmen prefer rafting along the fast rivers of Karelia, hiking in the mountain region of Khamar-Daban, climbing the Caucasus mountains, diving in the amazing caves of the Urals and much more. </p><p>  Rafting has been popular for quite some time.  Among his fans there are people of completely different levels of training and even beginners.  For each category of tourists their own routes are selected.  As a rule, for rafting, rivers are sent to the Urals, Altai, Karelia, the Caucasus or Eastern Siberia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.altai-guide.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rafting in altai" class="if uuid-2264721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2264721.jpg"></div><p>  The routes are designed in such a way that there are numerous camp sites on the way.  In between rafting, tourists can visit excursions, see interesting places and go fishing.  Such tours are good for active people. </p><h2>  Holidays abroad </h2><p>  If we sorted out domestic resorts a little, then where to relax in the summer abroad?  The choice of foreign resorts is quite large. </p><p>  You can, for example, go to Burgas.  The mild climate and shallow sea, beautiful sandy beaches stretching for kilometers - all this you will find in the resort.  It is very comfortable to relax with children.  The sea seems to be created specifically for kids.  In addition, the city has a zoo for young tourists, attractions, playgrounds and more.  And in August you can become a member of the sand sculpture festival.  In general, in Bulgaria it is good to relax with the whole family, since there are all the necessary conditions and entertainment for representatives of all ages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="besttaxitransfer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Burgas" class="if uuid-2264723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2264723.jpg"></div><p>  In the summer, you can also go to Antalya.  The beautiful coast of the resort and historical attractions will pleasantly complement your vacation if you want to get to know the history and culture of the region. </p><p>  In the summer, southern Spain is no less attractive for tourists.  One of the popular resorts is Malaga.  However, the beautiful coast and excellent beaches are not all that Andalusia can boast of.  Here, everywhere, one can observe a mixture of cultures and eras.  Therefore, in Malaga, you should definitely see the ancient Roman theater, the Arab fortress, houses in the Baroque style and modern.  And of course, you need to visit Seville and Granada.  The beaches of the resort are simply amazing.  The coast will appeal to those who like to swim.  The depth here begins very quickly. </p><p>  Another resort in Spain is no less attractive - Alicante.  It is especially good to relax here in July.  By this time, the sea warms up well, even in the evenings it is very warm, so you don‚Äôt need a jacket.  The resort is incredibly attractive for tourists of all ages.  The beaches are good even for toddlers and the elderly.  The picturesque coast has both equipped and wilder areas.  Lovers of antiquities and sights will surely be lured by the old part of the city.  A lot of entertainment is available at the resort for children.  In general, Alicante can be recommended as a family vacation spot. </p><p>  If your vacation falls on June, do not rush to be upset.  Of course, in most resorts at this time it is too early to swim.  But this does not apply to Sicily.  The sunny island in southern Italy begins the swimming season one of the first in all of Europe.  The island has a large selection of resort towns, each of which has its own advantages.  When considering options, pay attention to the beach cover (pebbles or sand), infrastructure and other nuances.  There are a lot of natural and historical sights on the island.  Therefore, you definitely will not be bored. </p><p>  Those planning a vacation in Italy can be advised to go to Rimini.  The affordable prices of the resort will pleasantly surprise you.  In addition, the local coast is perfect for children.  Wide beaches stretch for many kilometers.  Well, do not forget about the amazing sights of Italy.  Which you need to see while on vacation. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summer is a wonderful time that passes very quickly.  Therefore, you need to have time to relax and gain strength for the whole year.  There are a lot of options for summer holidays, as you can see.  Therefore, everyone will be able to choose for themselves something interesting and attractive.  Even within Russia you can find wonderful places to relax. </p>
