    <h2>  What does the development strategy of the bank provide? </h2><p>  Particular attention should be paid to the development strategy that the Tauride Bank adheres to.  Reviews of experts about it are beyond praise.  In order not to be unfounded, it should be noted that the management plans for the near future include such tasks as: </p><ul><li>  raising the technical level of all bank systems; </li><li>  introduction and development of advanced forms of service; </li><li>  improvement of the Internet banking service; </li><li>  the opening of new structural units; </li><li>  increasing the efficiency of existing branches; </li><li>  improvement of technical equipment of workplaces of bank employees; </li><li>  capital increase through the issue of shares. </li></ul><p>  The development strategy, in spite of all the problems that exist today, remains the leadership that Tavrichesky Bank strictly follows.  The bankruptcy that has been talked about so much lately is very exaggerated.  At least, so say the main shareholders of the financial institution, and regular customers of the bank support this position and are in no hurry to change the partner with whom they have been fruitfully cooperating for many years. </p>

    <h2>  Tavrichesky Bank: bankruptcy or reorganization? </h2><p>  The year 2014, due to a series of economic sanctions against Russia, was a real test for the country as a whole.  The financial difficulties faced the majority of the population of the Russian Federation.  The problems that affected the entire Russian banking sector did not leave aside the Tauride Bank.  Reviews with a negative connotation about his activities began to spread with great speed.  In January of this year, information leaked to the press that the capitalization of a financial institution had reached a critical level, which amounted to 10.7% with 10% of acceptable.  The leadership of Tavrichesky is trying to make a difference for the better by lending and issuing additional shares.  However, experts are skeptical of these attempts, and their forecasts remain disappointing.  More recently, the question of what the Tavrichesky Bank expects ‚Äî revocation of the license or nonetheless reorganization ‚Äî was widely discussed.  Opinions, as usual in such cases, were divided.  Those who claimed that there was no bankruptcy turned out to be right.  This became known on March 13 of this year, when the Bank of Russia approved the International Financial Club (OJSC AKB) as an investor who is to exercise control over the activities of Tavricheskiy with a view to its <span>financial recovery.</span>  As a result of these actions, it is assumed that the bank will be able to fully restore the effective service to its customers and, as before, make timely payments and other payments. </p>

    <h2>  Tavrichesky Bank: customer reviews </h2><p>  Just a month ago, bank customers were panicky afraid of losing all their savings.  Many believed that the Tauride Bank (St. Petersburg) could not avoid the closure.  The problems that he had to face seemed to inevitably lead him to revoke the license and, accordingly, to close it.  Naturally, in such conditions, customer reviews of the bank were not the best.  However, in connection with recent events - the decision to reorganize - the situation has changed radically, and people have the hope that Tavricheskiy will be "rehabilitated" and will continue to please its employees with a high level of service and professionalism, while guaranteeing reliability and complete safety finance. </p>
