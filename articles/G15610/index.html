Tasks of Ethnography</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This article provides an answer to the question of what ethnography studies.  We will talk in detail about this science, indicate some of its features, justify its relevance and significance. </p><p>  How to start the answer to the question of what ethnography studies?  With the definition of the meaning of its name.  Ethnography is a science that studies <span>peoples.</span>  <span>"Ethnos"</span> in Greek means "tribe", "people", and "grapho" - I write.  Therefore, in the <span>literal sense, the</span> name of this science can be translated as "description of peoples."  By analogy, for example, petrography is a description of stones, geography is a description of the Earth, etc. But there are no purely descriptive sciences.  The description for any of them is just the basis for conclusions, discretion of patterns in the development of a particular phenomenon and subject.  For example, geography learns relief, vegetation, climate, wildlife, etc. from the point of view of their relationship, patterns of development.  Only knowing the laws, we can use the wealth of nature in the service of society. </p><p>  Speaking about what ethnography studies as a science, it should be noted that it also does not just describe the peoples living on Earth.  She learns the laws by which they are formed and develop, as well as the reasons why one people is different from another.  Based on this, the following definition can be deduced: ethnography is a science that studies peoples, reveals the complex processes of their development. </p><h2>  The rise of ethnography </h2><p>  Although factual data, which subsequently formed the basis of ethnography, began to be collected and accumulated quite a long time ago, it itself emerged as an independent science only in the middle of the 19th century.  The object of her research first became sociohistorical organisms (sociors) - individual human societies that continued to remain primitive at the time this science arose.  Moreover, ethnography at first studied not so much them as a whole, but rather the culture of these societies.  It has always been and remains the only science whose subject of study is primitive societies.  However, ethnography is a science that studies not only sociors.  You can select at least two of its objects. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Two objects of ethnography </h2>

    <p>  In any pre-capitalist class society, with the exception of the ancient one, there were always two connected but different <span>cultures: elitist (culture of the</span> upper classes) and ordinary people (culture of the lower classes).  The latter, as it develops, collapses, but disappears only under capitalism.  This process often takes quite a while.  And the science of interest to us from its very beginning began to study not only the <span>primitive culture,</span> but also the common people, especially the peasant.  This should be taken into account when answering the question of what ethnography is studying.  A brief summary of the above is as follows: from the very beginning, it had 2 objects - a primitive and popular culture. </p><h2>  Features of the development of ethnographic science in the UK </h2><p>  Great Britain was the largest colonial power at the time of the emergence of ethnography.  Many territories were subject to this state, and primitive societies inhabited many of them.  But the peasantry in Great Britain had already disappeared by this time.  As a result, ethnography was born in this country as a science that is engaged in the study of only primitive societies.  And the study of what was connected with the remnants of the peasant world was dealt entirely with folklore.  Nevertheless, English scholars rather early became interested in the peasantry of East societies, which fell under the rule of Great Britain, primarily India (B. Baden-Powell, G. Maine).  However, these studies were most often considered as not related to ethnography.  In addition, their object was mainly a peasant community, and not culture. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ethnography in Germany </h2><p>  As for Germany, there is also a view on what ethnography is studying.  The definition of this science by German scientists was somewhat different, which, however, is easily explainable.  The fact is that the peasantry continued to exist in this country.  Therefore, the answer to the question of what ethnography studies in Germany at first was as follows: common culture.  And only then did the science of primitive societies begin to emerge, developed after Germany had turned into a colonial power.  By the way, this happened quite late. </p><h2>  The development of the science of ethnography in Russia </h2><p>  The features of the development of our country were such that the primitive and peasant world not only existed side by side, but also interacted and penetrated into each other.  The line between them often had a relative character.  Therefore, the Russian scientific community had a common name for this science (ethnology or ethnography), however, there were no special terms for the two disciplines that make it up. </p><h2>  Ethnology and Racial Theories </h2>

    <p>  In Western Europe, from the mid-19th century, the second name of this science arose - ethnology.  Translated, it means "study of peoples."  This name is more suitable for reflecting the essence of the science of interest to us.  However, it arose in Western Europe when racial theories according to which peoples are divided into higher and lower races became widespread.  Lower races are natural nations that are at a low level of socio-economic development.  They have no history, and even if it is, it remains unknown.  These peoples should only be described, that is, fix their livelihoods at the present time.  This is what science such as ethnography should do. </p><p>  The peoples at a high level of cultural and economic development are historical, with a long and complex history.  It is necessary to study them, and this is the task of ethnology. </p><h2>  Use of the terms "ethnography" and "ethnology" </h2>

    <p>  It should be noted that the division of all peoples into historical and natural, higher and lower most scientists still did not accept.  They rightly believed that there is only one science - history, which is divided into 2 sections: the history of human society and the history of nature.  The first began when humanity stood out from the animal world.  It is determined by the general laws of the development of society.  Thus, the division of peoples into natural and historical has no scientific basis.  However, the term "ethnology" still entrenched in the West for the science of peoples.  In Russia, for its designation, the term "ethnography" is usually used.  Nevertheless, it should be noted that the same content was invested in these terms both in Russia and in the West: it was the study, not the description of the peoples living on Earth. </p><p>  At the All-Union Conference held in Almaty in 1990, it was decided to unify the terms that designate the science of peoples.  Ethnography in our country also began to be officially called ethnology.  However, the term "ethnography" has been preserved.  Today we say "ethnographic museums", "ethnographic expeditions", etc. Thus, ethnology and ethnography are two terms that serve to denote the science of peoples. </p><h2>  Differences between nations </h2>

    <p>  The peoples living on Earth differ in racial (physical) characteristics - in color and shape of hair, skin color, growth, in the structure of the soft parts of the face, etc. By this attribute, they are divided into Mongoloid, Caucasoid, Negroid, and also mixed in racial respect.  Physical anthropology is studying all these differences between them. </p><p>  The peoples of our planet speak different languages ‚Äã‚Äã- German, English, Russian, etc. Languages ‚Äã‚Äãare united into related <span>language families.</span>  Linguistics is engaged in their study.  It considers grammar, phonetics, vocabulary of languages. </p><p>  The peoples inhabiting the Earth are also distinguished by their names (Russians, Tatars, Georgians, etc.), self-awareness (I am Belarusian, I am Kyrgyz), mental characteristics and a whole range of cultural and everyday elements inherent in each of them (original clothes, homes, ceremonies in social and family life, etc.).  Thanks to this, each nation can isolate itself from the rest, not possessing these features.  Ethnology, or ethnography, is studying these differences. </p><h2>  Ethnic Features </h2><p>  Thus, we can assume that the object of studying the science of ethnography is the people, and the subject is ethnic features.  The latter are understood as self-awareness, a complex of elements of spiritual, social and <span>material culture,</span> especially the psyche and life, developed as a result of a long historical development.  All of the above features make up the national culture of the people.  It is the main subject of such a science as ethnography. </p><p>  We will answer the question of why it is necessary to study the ethnic characteristics of a particular nation, its culture. </p><h2>  Ethnography and History </h2>

    <p>  First of all, their knowledge provides us with the opportunity to solve questions about its origin, historical development.  The history of the people is written on ethnographic material.  It should be able to read.  Cultural and everyday features are always closely linked to political, economic, environmental factors.  Therefore, the entire cultural and domestic complex changes when these factors change.  Therefore, knowing the life and culture of the people, we can talk about the natural-geographical and socio-economic conditions in which it existed.  All this is very important for understanding the roots of its origin, as well as development.  Due to the fact that ethnography solves all these issues, it can be considered a historical science.  This is precisely what it refers to by classification status. </p><h2>  Ethnography - Social Discipline </h2><p>  However, its significance is not limited to the above.  What is important is what ethnography studies.  Briefly describe its significance on the other hand. </p>

    <p>  Knowledge of national life and culture provides an opportunity to determine the direction of various cultural and everyday processes taking place at the present time.  And without their knowledge it is impossible to carry out cultural and socio-economic transformations.  There have always been processes on our planet that have changed the cultural and everyday life of various peoples, and sometimes led to the fact that some of them disappeared, while others appeared.  All these processes also relate to what ethnography studies. </p><p>  History knows many examples of the disappearance of some peoples and the appearance of others.  In particular, once there were Thracians, Gauls, Meshchera, Bulgars, Meria, etc. Today they are not.  The French, Bulgarians, Tatars, etc. appeared. This happened as a result of ethnic processes that took place intensively in the past.  They occur in our time.  Their orientation should be known in order to be able to optimally manage society.  The fact is that the underestimation of the trends in the development and functioning of ethnic groups leads to the emergence of <span>interethnic conflicts,</span> as well as to other negative consequences that impede social development on the path to progress.  This problem, which is solved by the science of ethnography, gives grounds for its attribution to the cycle of social disciplines. </p><h2>  Ethnography and Ecology </h2><p>  And to solve current environmental problems today, knowledge of the cultural and everyday features of various peoples is of great importance.  After all, these features significantly affect the direction of economic activity, which, in turn, affects the natural and geographical environment.  Without an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cultural and everyday features of the peoples concerned, it is impossible to intervene in their economic activities.  For example, you should not transfer nomadic people to settled areas, settle in mountain valleys, etc. This is fraught with significant moral and economic losses.  It is no coincidence that in our time a new science has appeared - ethnic ecology.  It examines the various relationships and interactions that exist between the natural-geographical environment and humans. </p><h2>  Ethnography and Politics </h2><p>  But even this is not a complete answer to the question about the significance of what ethnography is studying.  Grade 5 in history lessons usually covers the topic of "ethnography", but it concerns it only superficially.  Meanwhile, the importance of this science is very great.  Without an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cultural and everyday features of the various peoples inhabiting the Earth, it is impossible to establish cultural, political and economic contacts between them.  And without them it is impossible to imagine not only the development of mankind, but also its very existence.  In order to live in good neighborliness and friendship with any people, you need to know him.  This is especially true for multinational areas.  After all, people live here, different in culture and language. </p><h2>  Musical Ethnography </h2>

    <p>  In conclusion, we note that there are interdisciplinary disciplines related to this science, one of which is musical ethnography.  Specialists in this field are trained in conservatories.  Perhaps you already guessed that he was studying musical ethnography?  The correct answer is folk music.
