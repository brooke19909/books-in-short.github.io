    <p>  Vacuum cleaners have long ceased to be an element of luxury.  If only 15 years ago they could be found only in the apartments of wealthy people, now more and more average families are acquiring this miracle of technology.  Why is a <span>washing vacuum cleaner</span> so attractive to a buyer <span>?</span>  Customer reviews indicate that they are most often taken to clean apartments that have many carpets and upholstered furniture.  No matter how thoroughly the owners vacuum the floor covering or the carpet, the dirt eats deeper and deeper with time.  And the carpet from light beige turns into dark brown.  Separate conversation about families with young children.  It's no secret that kids constantly draw something on the floor, leave puddles 5-6 times a day during the period of accustoming to the pot, constantly spill something, smear and crumble.  Of course, the coating can be removed and washed in the bathroom or taken to dry cleaning.  However, if we are talking about a large palace 3 * 4 meters, this is not so simple.  The way out of this difficult situation is to purchase a washing vacuum cleaner.  Customer reviews indicate that this unit is a real salvation.  It can be used both for <span>daily cleaning</span> and for weekly general. </p><p>  The permanent leader of washing vacuums for many years is German Thomas.  The models of this company are quite heavy and voluminous.  Such a vacuum cleaner is usually equipped with a brush for upholstered furniture, for a floor, a narrow brush, a crevice brush, two transparent nozzles for mopping and upholstered furniture, a telescopic tube, and also a nozzle for <span>washing windows.</span>  With it, you can not only get rid of dirt on the carpet, but also wash windows, tiles, ceilings, clean up spilled water, and clean furniture.  Thomas is a washing vacuum cleaner with a water filter (aquafilter).  During dry cleaning, all garbage settles in a special container with water.  In addition, several <span>coarse filters are</span> included in the kit and one fine filter, a hepa filter, which traps even the smallest particles of dust, which means that this device is indispensable for allergy sufferers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What are the downsides of a washing vacuum cleaner?  Customer reviews indicate that its main drawback is the size, weight, slowness and complexity of care.  The length of the models of this brand is about half a meter, for such a colossus it is difficult to find a place in an ordinary Khrushchev.  Weight - about 10 kg, it will be difficult to get daily to a fragile woman or child. </p><p>  If you need to clean in a one-room apartment, you can put it in the center of the room, and if it is a 3-to 4-room apartment, you will have to drag the water vacuum cleaner from one room to another, which is also quite difficult and inconvenient.  However, the large dimensions and weight are a common drawback of all washing vacuum cleaners of any model.  Caring for him is also quite difficult.  After cleaning, it is necessary to rinse the hose and tube, all used nozzles, wipe the vacuum cleaner itself from the inside, wipe the containers, having previously poured dirty water out of them, and wait until all the parts have dried. </p><p>  It turns out that the cleaning itself takes about 15 minutes and the same amount will be needed to remove the vacuum cleaner.  Of course, not every housewife will want to mess with him so much time, which is much easier than ordinary vacuum cleaners with a bag - he managed it in 10 minutes and immediately put it in a corner.  Another thing is the general cleaning, with a vacuum cleaner you can walk around the apartment and only then wash it. </p><p>  What else could be a washing vacuum cleaner?  Customer reviews indicate that in addition to models from Thomas, Zelmer, Karcher, and Ariette equipment are also popular.  They differ in power, equipment, size, appearance and <span>type of</span> dust <span>container</span> , type of tube (metal telescopic or composite plastic) and, of course, price. </p>
