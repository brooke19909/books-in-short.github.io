    <h2>  Number one in the city </h2><p>  Those who like to ride in a big way, welcome to this huge ice arena.  It should be noted the SKA Large Indoor Ice Rink at the Sports Palace.  This is the main training base, so most often during the day the arena is inaccessible to everyone.  However, on weekends, in the evening and at night, all lovers and fans of this sport gather here.  The largest indoor ice rink in St. Petersburg offers its guests skate rental and sharpening.  You can sit and relax in the stands, and if you want to refresh yourself, then welcome to the cafe. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  Why did ice skating fans love the Hockey Palace so much?  First of all, because this indoor ice rink is located in St. Petersburg in close proximity to the metro, so it‚Äôs easy to get to it even without your own transport.  Address - Sportivnaya station, <span>Zhdanovskaya embankment,</span> 2. What else do regular visitors note?  Excellent quality of ice and a huge area of ‚Äã‚Äãice mirror.  It is convenient and free even with a large number of visitors.  Pleasant music is another plus that does not go unnoticed by skaters.  Peppy and rhythmic music sounds until 05:00, or until the last visitor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="closed skating rinks schedule and prices" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1820231.jpg" width="600"></div>  The cost of services here is quite affordable.  Entrance costs 300 rubles, and skate rental 100. You can take your own.  This is even more convenient, because when making a lease, it is necessary to leave a deposit.  Of the minuses, only a tight schedule of classes on ice can be noted, so certain hours are designed for free skiing.

By the way, it is located very close to the previous one, you need to get off at the same metro station.  If suddenly there were no empty seats in the Hockey Club, then welcome here.  A large and comfortable skating rink is a great choice for those who do not like to sit around.  Of the pluses, the amazing quality of ice and the vigilance of employees should be noted.  They do not allow alcohol to be carried with them.  This avoids many unpleasant situations.  There are two ice arenas, and when the influx of vacationers is too large, a passage opens between them.  As a result, skaters are evenly distributed and do not interfere with each other.  The cost of going out on the ice is 400 rubles per session; rental costs 200 in the evening and 400 in the night. </p>
