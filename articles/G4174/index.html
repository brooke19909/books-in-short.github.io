One of them is located in the north, and the second in the south.  The first of these is the DPRK.  This abbreviation stands for Korean People's Democratic Republic.  But most often, speaking of Korea, they mean the country that is in the south.  It is officially called the Republic of Korea. </p><h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  <span>The Korean Peninsula</span> is located south of Russian Vladivostok and the Primorsky Territory.  This is the eastern part of Asia.  On both sides of the peninsula are the Japanese and Yellow Seas.  Located in the north, the Korean People‚Äôs Republic is separated from the PRC (China) by the Amnok River.  These lines pass in the northwestern part of the DPRK.  The Duman River flows east.  It separates the DPRK from China and Russia.  The Korean Strait separates the peninsula from Japan. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="35.90775699999999" data-lng="127.76692200000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="3"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/4/4/2/13442.png"></div><p>  In the southern part of this piece of land is the Republic of Korea.  The state has one land border.  It is located in the north of the Korean Republic, where the country is adjacent to the DPRK.  In the west, its borders with China run through the Yellow Sea.  In the east, in the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan, there are borders with the country of the Rising Sun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The territory occupied by South Korea covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã99,720 square kilometers.  Moreover, the total length of its state border is 238 km. </p><p>  Most of the Republic of Korea is hills and mountains.  The highest point of the country is the peak of Hallasan volcano (1950 m).  There are very few lowlands and plains.  Of the entire country, this is only 30%.  Most of them are located in the southeast and west of South Korea.  Most of the country's inhabitants live here. </p><p>  Belongs to this state and almost three thousand islands.  However, basically they are extremely small and uninhabited.  The largest island of the Republic of Korea is Jeju.  It is located at a distance of 10 km from the south coast. </p><h2>  Ancient history </h2><p>  According to scientists, the first people on the territory of the Korean Peninsula appeared more than 70 thousand years ago.  This part of the land was relatively densely populated during the Paleolithic.  Confirmation of this is the large number of tools made of stone, which researchers found during archaeological excavations. </p><p>  Korea as a country began to exist in 2333 BC.  During this period, called Kochoson, there were three states on the peninsula.  Among them are Kogure, as well as Silla and Baekje.  It was in the first of them that Buddhism once arose.  Starting from the 3rd century.  BC  e.  this religious trend began to develop most actively.  In addition, by studying written sources, scientists found that around the same time on the Korean peninsula, martial art was given a start, which subsequently formed the basis of modern aikido. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Early states </h2><p>  A little later, the formation of three political centers took place on the territory of the Korean Peninsula - in Kogul, Silla and Paekche.  They were not only on the peninsula, but also in Manchuria.  Historians have discovered facts of existence and less significant state entities. </p><p>  In the 7th century  Silla conquered the territories of Kogul and Pakche.  After 300 years, Korea seized power over these territories.  At the same time, a country called Parhe was developed in the north of the peninsula. </p><h2>  Later states </h2><p>  The territories of the three countries - Silla, Taebon and Hupekce - were combined.  As a result, the state of Korea arose.  It was from him that the modern name came about - Korea. </p><p>  In the 13th century  this territory was ruled by the Mongols.  The rule of the invaders, which lasted for several decades, negatively affected the development of the country in the future. </p><p>  Then the Joseon Dynasty came to power.  The rulers of Korea moved the country's capital to Seoul.  After that, the construction of palaces began in the city.  The country began to establish diplomatic ties with neighboring China.  The main religious trend in it was Confucianism.  Instead of Chinese, its own alphabet, Hangul, was created.  During the reign of the Joseon dynasty, a number of important discoveries were made.  Fundamentals of scientists saw the light.  According to researchers, it was then that the famous tea ceremony arose. </p><p>  From 1592 to 1598, the Japanese raided the country.  And in the end she was subdued by them. </p><p>  In the 19th century  war broke out between neighboring Japan and China.  The fighting caused serious damage to the Korean territory, as it took place mainly on its border.  In 1876, the parties signed a ceasefire agreement guaranteeing independence for the country.  In 1894, the reign of the Joseon Dynasty ended.  Then the king of the Kojon stood at the head of the country, creating the Khan Empire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 1904 - 1905  the world was interrupted by the Russo-Japanese war.  It ended with the annexation of Korea.  Japan exercised power over this state until 1945. A tough assimilation policy was characteristic of this period.  In 1945, the single state was divided into two.  Its southern territory was influenced by the United States, and the northern - by the USSR. </p><h2>  Newest period </h2><p>  The history of the Republic of Korea began after the signing of the joint Soviet-American agreement, when the superpowers divided their spheres of influence on the peninsula.  This happened in 1945. According to this agreement, that part of Korea, which was located south of the 38th parallel, passed under the jurisdiction of the United States.  And the territory to the north is under the jurisdiction of the USSR. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.englishspectrum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="symbolic image of South and North Korea" class="if uuid-3032754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3032754.jpg"></div><p>  The Republic of Korea experienced different periods in its history.  Throughout its existence, there has been a change in authoritarian and democratic governance.  Different governments ruled the country, and depending on their change, the Republic received its numbering.  Consider each of these milestones in history. </p><h2>  First Republic </h2><p>  The date of foundation of the state located in South Korea is 08/15/1945. Its name, translated from the state language, literally sounds like the Great Korean Republic of Khan. </p><p>  Lee Son Man was elected its first president.  A little later, on September 9, 1945, the North Korean People‚Äôs Republic (DPRK) was formed.  She was led by Kim Il Sung.  In the same year, South Korea adopted its first constitution. </p><p>  The period of the First Republic was quite difficult.  He was overshadowed by the war that fought between North Korea and South.  The armed forces of the UN, USSR and China took an active part in the hostilities.  The result of this war was the enormous economic and material damage that was inflicted on both countries. </p><p>  The end of the era of the First Republic came in 1960. The change of government took place after the April revolution that took place here and the elections following these events. </p><h2>  Second republic </h2><p>  For some time, power over South Korea passed to an interim administration led by Ho Jong.  But as a result of the elections held on July 29, 1960, the Democratic Party won.  As a result, the Second Republic was formed, at the head of which was President Yoon Bo Song. </p><h2>  The seizure of power by the military government </h2><p>  The rule of the Second Republic was short-lived.  Already in 1961, a military coup took place in the country, and power passed to Major General Park Jung Hee.  In 1963, elections were held in South Korea.  Their result was the election of General Pack as president. </p><h2>  Third Republic </h2><p>  Pak also won the 1967 election. He won 51.4% of the vote.  In 1971, the general declared a state of emergency in the country. </p><p>  During the Third Republic, her government ratified a peace treaty with neighboring Japan.  South Korea also legalized the deployment of US forces on its territory.  Because of this, her relationship with America has become even closer.  The Republic of Korea provided great support to the United States during the war with Vietnam.  She sent almost 300 thousand of her soldiers to conduct combat operations in this country. </p><p>  This period is also characterized by the beginning of serious progress in the economy.  The measures taken by the government significantly increased the state‚Äôs GDP. </p><h2>  Fourth Republic </h2><p>  In 1972, South Korea adopted a new constitution.  According to its provisions, the role of the president in governing the country was significantly strengthened.  At this time, the people of the Republic of Korea did not stop holding anti-government protests.  In this regard, General Park Jung Hee decided to extend the state of emergency. </p><p>  During the period of the Fourth Republic, there was a regression of democratic values.  The government carried out constant arrests of dissenters.  However, despite the political crisis, the economy in the country grew rapidly. </p><h2>  Fifth republic </h2><p>  In 1979, General Park was killed.  Power passed into the hands of General Chung Doo-hwan.  The country was immediately overwhelmed by numerous democratic demonstrations.  The culmination of these events was the world-famous massacre in Gwangju. </p><p>  The struggle for democracy in South Korea lasted a long 8 years.  However, people's efforts were not in vain.  In 1987, elections were held in the country on the principles of democracy. </p><h2>  Sixth Republic </h2><p>  It arose after the country's transition to a democratic track.  In 1992, the country elected its first civilian president.  The economy of the Republic of Korea continued its rapid development.  However, substantial global crises inflicted significant damage to her from time to time. </p><h2>  Coat of arms </h2><p>  Let's move on to the symbolism of the country.  The coat of arms of the Republic of Korea expresses tribute to the ancient traditions of the local people, closely intertwined with modernity.  It was approved by a special decree of the president in December 1963. The emblem of the South Korean Republic reflected the most important symbols for the local people.  You can see them on the flag of the country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pl.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coat of arms of South Korea" class="if uuid-3032763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3032763.jpg"></div><p>  The main emblem of the Republic of Korea contains a deep meaning, and at the same time its design is quite simple.  Its main element is the red-blue whirlwind (thegyk).  It is enclosed in a circle located in the pentagon.  This symbolism is national.  The Republic of Korea on its emblem depicted the constant confrontation between "yin" and "yang," which are opposing forces.  But in general, these symbols constitute harmony and inextricable unity.  The deep meaning lies in the colors of the figures.  So, red means nobility, and blue is associated with hope. </p><p>  The rectangle that borders the tag is a stylized image of a mallow flower.  This plant is also a national symbolism.  In the Republic of Korea, this flower was revered in antiquity.  At all times, the people associated it with prosperity and immortality. </p><p>  The whole design of the coat of arms is ovita with a white ribbon.  In its lower part you can see the name of the country - the Republic of Korea.  It is written in hieroglyphics, which are components of the phonemic Hangul script. </p><h2>  Flag </h2><p>  This state symbol is quite easy to recognize.  The flag of the Republic of Korea has a rectangular shape, the ratio of the length and width of which is within 2: 3.  The cloth has a white background on which trigrams and a central emblem are placed. </p><p>  The flag of the Republic of Korea is not accidentally white.  The fact is that it is he who is national in the country.  White in Buddhism personifies purity and holiness, the ability to control his thoughts.  It is also considered the color of the mother. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ncregister.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flag of south korea" class="if uuid-3032734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3032734.jpg"></div><p>  The central emblem of the flag is tegyk.  It is the same as on the coat of arms of this state. </p><p>  The flag design was first developed in 1883. It was the state symbol of the Joseon Dynasty.  It was then that trigrams appeared on the flag.  On a modern panel, they were placed closer to the corners.  Trigrams mean many concepts.  If we consider them starting from the upper part, located near the shaft, and move clockwise, then such symbols personify the Sky and the Moon, the Earth, as well as the Sun.  Trigrams can also be considered as south and west, north and east.  They indicate the seasons, denoting summer and autumn, winter and spring.  They also correspond to the four elements - air and water, earth and fire.  Trigrams made in black.  For Koreans, it means justice, vigilance and perseverance. </p><p>  The flag of South Korea was officially approved in 1948. </p><h2>  Anthem </h2><p>  The main meaning of this symbolism in any country lies in the assertion of independence, as well as independence.  The anthem of the Republic of Korea is rather a lyrical ode.  It describes the difficult fate of a people who suffered great losses due to external threats, but at the same time did not lose heart and remained faithful to their nation. </p><p>  Initially, the writing of the music of the anthem provided for its performance with wind instruments, which the violin was to accompany.  Today there are several versions.  One of them was invented by creative musicians of South Korea.  This is a rock version of the anthem, which is especially popular among young people. </p><h2>  Administrative division </h2><p>  The structure of South Korea includes 9 provinces.  One of them is autonomous.  The provinces include smaller entities.  These are counties and cities, towns and municipal districts, urban areas and volosts, as well as villages. </p><h2>  Seoul </h2><p>  The capital of the Republic of Korea is the largest city in the country.  Seoul is located on the banks of the Hangan River.  The city received its modern name in 1946 from the Korean ‚Äúsoul‚Äù, which means ‚Äúcapital‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mensjournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="view of seoul" class="if uuid-3032773" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3032773.jpg"></div><p>  The first mention of the settlement of people, which was located on the site of the current Seoul, refers to the 1st century  n  e.  From the second half of the 4th century  the city, whose name sounded like Vireson, became the capital of the early state of Baekje.  Somewhat later, this administrative center was renamed.  It became known as Hanson, and from the 14th century.  - Hanyang.  Then, around the city, a powerful fortress wall appeared that successfully fit into the rocky slopes of the surrounding mountains. </p><p>  Seoul developed steadily until the 16th century, until it was badly damaged by Japanese troops.  After the expulsion of the invaders, the city continued its peaceful existence for some time.  In 1627, he was again attacked, now by the Manchu troops. </p><p>  Throughout its history, the city had to go through several palace coups.  And only at the end of 18 in Seoul did a period of cultural and economic prosperity begin.  After Korea was annexed to Japan, the city began to be called Kenson. </p><p>  In 1948, the government of South Korea was located here.  But during the war on the peninsula in the city, power was constantly changing.  Either he passed under the control of the North Korean Republic, then he was captured by the Chinese armies.  As a result of hostilities, the city was badly damaged.  The Korean people took up its restoration only at the end of the war. </p><p>  In the 1980s-1990s, Seoul significantly expanded contacts with the capital of the People‚Äôs Republic of Korea, Pyongyang.  A little later, in 2000, the heads of the two states signed an international agreement on cooperation and reconciliation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="foreignpolicy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="presidents of two countries" class="if uuid-3032757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3032757.jpg"></div><p>  Today, Seoul is a major cultural, economic, transport and tourist center of South Korea.  On its territory there are a large number of unique historical attractions.  Thanks to this, the capital of the country is a popular destination for tourists from all over the world. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Two countries located on a peninsula in the eastern part of Asia have the same historical roots.  That is why in South Korea and in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the sights that have come down to us since ancient times have a common theme. </p><p>  The greatest interest of tourists in the DPRK is the city of Kaesong.  In ancient times, it was the capital of a single Korean state called Kore.  Today, ginseng production brings fame to this city, because its main plantations and healing plants are concentrated in it. </p><p>  There were three wars in the history of Keson, as a result of which many ancient buildings located in it were destroyed.  However, some of them still survived to our days, causing interest among tourists.  This is a Confucian educational institution dating back to the 10th century, a bridge built in the 13th century, as well as the remains of the walls of ancient temples. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.uritours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient bridge in keson" class="if uuid-3032779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3032779.jpg"></div><p>  For those tourists who have visited South Korea, experienced travelers are advised to inspect places of worship.  The country has many shrines and temples.  Most of them are Buddhist. </p><p> One of these shrines is the Singhings Temple.  It is located on the slope of Mount Seoraksan and is the oldest of the Buddhist structures in the world.  It was built in 653 AD, suffered several fires and was completely restored after them.  On the way to the temple, tourists are greeted by a Buddha sculpture, which is made of gilded bronze and has an impressive size. </p><p>  Another unusual building in South Korea is another temple.  It is located in the middle of mountain forests and is called 1000 Buddhas.  The temple is a circle of statues of this deity.  In total there are several hundred of them.  In the center of the circle is a Bodhisattva statue made of bronze.  This deity is depicted sitting on a lotus. </p><p>  In Seoul is one of the oldest Buddhist temples.  It was erected in 794 on the slope of Mount Sudo.  This is Bonnens Temple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="modernseoul.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mendon Temple in Seoul" class="if uuid-3032805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/3032805.jpg"></div><p>  On the streets of Seoul, travelers can find a Catholic temple.  This is the Cathedral of Mendon, which was built relatively recently, in 1898. The building is made in the Neo-Gothic style and is known for the fact that at the beginning of the 20th century.  the relics of the Korean martyrs were buried here. </p><p>  Among the interesting sights of South Korea are: </p><ul><li>  Dong-hak-sa monastery; </li><li>  cave temple on top of Mount Thohamsan - Sokkuram; </li><li>  Chonme sanctuary; </li><li>  Toksugun Palace; </li><li>  Seoraksan National Park and many others. </li></ul>
