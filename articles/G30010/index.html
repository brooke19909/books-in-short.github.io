Sights of the ancient city</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On both banks of the Oka River, at the confluence of the Orlik tributary, the ancient Russian city of Orel is located.  Its sights are an integral part of Russian history and culture.  It was founded in the middle of the sixteenth century, during the <span>reign of Ivan the Terrible.</span>  It was a fortress.  It was intended to protect the kingdom of Moscow from the southeast direction from those wishing to question its territorial integrity.  Over time, the fortress lost its fortification value.  Today it is just an average Russian city, without which it is impossible to imagine both Russian history and modern reality.  And if you have not lost interest in what is happening outside the Moscow Ring Road, then you are here, in Oryol.  Fortunately, this is not so far from Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eagle sights" class="if" height="264" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/228167.jpg" width="470"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Orel city.</strong>  <strong>sights</strong> </p><p>  In this relatively small town there is very much to look at.  In Russian history and culture, he did not take a peripheral place.  The fate and creativity of many figures of Russian literature and art are connected with the city.  Because the attractions of <span>Orel and the Oryol region</span> deserve attention.  The first thing to pay attention to in the city is the oldest Orthodox churches.  These are the churches of Michael the Archangel and Nikolo Peskovskaya - very characteristic and expressive examples of Russian temple architecture.  In the thirties of the last century, both churches were significantly damaged, but were not destroyed, they were used for household and other purposes far from the purpose.  But today they are carefully restored and brought into a "divine form."  Without these temples, towering over the city center, it is impossible to imagine the Eagle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions of the eagle and the Oryol region" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/228165.jpg" width="502"></div>  Sights of the city, of course, are not limited to this.  A symbolic place is the arrow of Oka and Orlik.  In ancient times there was a hillfort, but the modern city was founded on this place.  This event is immortalized by a memorable stele and square, laid in honor of its foundation.  For a considerable number of figures of Russian literature, the place of the beginning of the creative path was precisely the Eagle.  The sights of literary life are collected in the Museum of Orlovtsev writers.  It is located in an old noble estate.  Museums of Leskov and Bunin, two famous Russian writers, also deserve unconditional attention. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãeagle attractions" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/228166.jpg" width="502"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Military monuments</strong> </p><p>  The city was at the center of Russian history in August 1943 during the period of the greatest battle in the history of the <span>Kursk-Oryol arc.</span>  As a result of the offensive, Belgorod and Oryol were liberated.  The sights of the city reflect the memory of the Great Patriotic War.  This is a monument to the tank liberators of the city of Orel, and the Oryol Military History Museum (diorama).  But in the Oryol region there are military monuments from more distant eras.  These include the <span>Saburov fortress,</span> located ten kilometers from the city.  This <span>open-air museum</span> for the glory of Russian weapons was created by Field Marshal Count Kamensky in honor of the victories of Russia in the Russian-Turkish wars of the eighteenth century. </p>
