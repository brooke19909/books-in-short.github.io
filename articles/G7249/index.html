The article talks about how it arose, reveals the basic concepts and history. </p><p>  The growth of capitalist processes occurred in economically developed countries located in Western Europe.  Feudalism receded and lost its position.  A new stage of development has come.  Manufactory began to replace medieval workshops.  Manufacturing is an enterprise based on the division of labor, manual craft equipment and the labor of hired workers.  The heyday of manufacturing production falls on: </p><ul><li>  the middle of the XVI century - the last third of the XVIII century in Europe; </li><li>  the second half of the 17th century - the first half of the 19th century in Russia. </li></ul><p>  The name of the manufactory is given by two Latin words: manus - "hand", and factura - "made".  Manufacturing production was an important stage of development, since due to the fact that workers had a narrow specialization and labor was socially divided, a transition to machine production was carried out. </p><h2>  Why did manufacturing come about? </h2><p>  With the course of history, an increase in handicraft began to be observed, commodity production increased, small commodity manufacturers began to be divided into categories.  They opened new workshops, hired workers, accumulated money.  To facilitate the work, increase the speed of work, manufactory production naturally developed. </p>

    <p>  The freedom of the workshops and the absence of any regulations were the features of the manufacturing industry of that time.  In Russia, the first manufactory that emerged was the Cannon Yard (Moscow, 1525).  He combined the work of casters, blacksmiths, solders, carpenters and other craftsmen.  After the Cannon Courtyard, the Armory Chamber appeared, where they minted gold and silver, produced enamel and enamel.  Other famous Russian manufactories are Khamovny (linen) and Mints. </p><h2>  How manufactories appeared </h2><p>  Manufactories appeared in several different ways.  If a scattered manufactory is a home-made manufactory (and everything is clear here), then a centralized one united representatives of several craft specialties under its roof, which made it possible to produce a product from beginning to end, without moving it from place to place. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Each form has its own characteristics.  <span>Broken manufactory</span> is such a system in which the owner of the manufactory was engaged in supplying artisans with necessary raw materials and tools, and then selling their finished product. </p>

    <p>  In a centralized factory, all hired workers were in the same workroom.  With a mixed form of manufacture, a combination of the functions of a separate execution of work actions with work in a common workshop was observed.  Centralized manufactories had views by industry.  The most common were textile, mining, metallurgical, printing, sugar, paper, porcelain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The centralized manufacture was an ideal form for organizing labor in such industries where in the technological process a joint work of a large number of workers performing various labor operations was supposed.  The reign of Peter I in the history of manufactories was remembered by the appearance of treasury, patrimony, estate, merchant and peasant industries.  At the same time, industry made a sharp reorientation to manufactories instead of artisans.  200 - this is how many Petrovsky manufactories arose.  Despite the capitalist features of manufactory Russian production, the use of peasant labor made manufactories feudal. </p><h2>  What is the main difference between centralized and dispersed manufactories </h2><p>  Historically, both types of production can be clearly distinguished.  The main criterion for distinguishing a centralized factory from a diffuse one is the location of the hired workers.  In the first case, they all worked under one roof, in the second they were in their own small workshops.  The location of the centralized and dispersed manufactories determined the mechanism of interaction between workers and the owner. </p><h2>  What are the differences between manufactories </h2><p>  The main difference between manufactories was indicated above.  But there are a few more points by which you can determine which production is in front of you: a diffused or centralized manufactory.  The differences are as follows: the centralized owners were most often state-owned enterprises directly funded from the state budget, or private, to which the state granted special privileges for a long time.  Broken manufactories are private business owners. </p>

    <p>  Comparison of centralized and dispersed manufactories can be continued by the presence of different strengths.  Advantages of the first: </p><ul><li>  not afraid of competition; </li><li>  the most sophisticated and advanced industrial technologies of that time were used. </li></ul><p>  Pros of scattered production: </p><ul><li>  Broken manufacturing is an opportunity to minimize costs; </li><li>  an almost cost-free way to quickly increase output or reduce it; </li><li>  cheap labor. </li></ul><h2>  Why was a mixed manufactory needed? </h2><p>  Mixed manufacture essentially became a transitional step from dispersed to centralized.  It became a combination of the execution of individual work actions in a centralized manufactory with work at home.  Usually mixed production appeared on the basis of houses, where <span>artisan</span> prevailed <span>.</span>  Also, at first it was mixed factories that produced the production of complex goods, such as, for example, watches.  Small craftsmen made various individual small parts, and were assembled later in an entrepreneurial workshop. </p><h2>  Who worked at the manufactories? </h2><p>  With the development of production, the labor of the centralized and scattered manufactory also changed.  Bonded workers ‚Äî state-owned peasants and workers ‚Äî worked at <span>state-owned enterprises</span> .  Serf peasants worked for the landowner in patrimonial manufactories, in a different way - for field enterprises.  When organizing their manufactory production, merchants used both bonded and civilian employees as labor.  The peasant also had the opportunity to open a manufactory, and he could only hire hires there. </p><p>  A scattered manufactory is an opportunity for the rural poor to somehow improve their lives.  In the event that there were not enough resources to support themselves and their families, having a house and a small plot of land, one could find some kind of additional source of income.  The poor man who knew how to process wool, when it was received, processed it into yarn.  The entrepreneur took the yarn he received, passed it on to the next employee who already wove the fabric from the yarn, and so on until the end result. </p><p>  The state actively intervened in the development of manufactories.  It introduced a monopoly on the manufacture of specific goods, such as salt, tobacco, lard, wax, etc. This led to prices rising, and the trading opportunities of merchants declining.  There have also been increases in direct taxes.  The role of St. Petersburg in the development of Russian manufactories is interesting.  At a time when it was still a poorly structured city, merchants were forcibly relocated to it to help development.  Administrative mechanisms to regulate freight flows were introduced.  This largely influenced the fact that the foundations of entrepreneurial trade were destroyed. </p>
