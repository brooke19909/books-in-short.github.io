These Slavic magi carried wood, bone and silver.  This metal was sacred for our ancestors, since, according to ancient beliefs, it protected, gave strength and cleansed man at all three levels.  Of course, our contemporaries mostly treat such symbols superficially, acquiring them as ordinary jewelry.  As a tribute to fashion, wedding rings with Slavic symbols appear on sale, it is printed on T-shirts and sweatshirts, and some even put ancient signs on the body in the form of a tattoo. </p><p>  Specialists are extremely negative towards such popularization.  They recommend first of all to carefully study the Slavic symbolism and the meaning of all the amulets and only then make a decision on the wearing of a symbol.  After all, each of them has tremendous power, which will affect its owner regardless of his desire.  So that you do not get into trouble, thoughtlessly using the charms of our ancestors, we collected information about them in the article.  You will be able to learn about the meaning of Slavic symbolism, and most importantly, you will understand how to choose for yourself the very only amulet that will be with you for the rest of your life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="-.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Slavic symbolism" class="if uuid-2460608" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2460608.jpg"></div><h2>  Pagan traditions of the Slavs and their symbolism </h2><p>  Our ancestors adhered to pagan beliefs, which in their own way explained the universe and all the processes occurring in it.  Today, historians look a little differently at the Slavs, their culture and knowledge.  Archaeological excavations have given scientists a lot of new information about how this people lived and what ideas about the universe he possessed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In a more simplified version, adopted to explain the cultural traditions of the Slavs, they are referred to as pagans.  Therefore, they animated all natural phenomena and worshiped many gods.  In addition to the main and powerful deities, it was customary to respect the lower spirits who lived in forests and houses.  Many of them possessed the power to preserve an entire genus from generation to generation.  To do this, it was only necessary to put in the right places the ancient Slavic symbolism, which has the meaning of a talisman. </p><p>  As historians say today, the Slavs wore a large number of amulets.  Some of them were made in the form of pendants and accompanied a person from birth to death, others were applied to clothing to save a person on the road or give strength to a warrior, and still others were needed to help in various difficult times. </p><p>  Slavic charms and symbolism carried divine power within them, there was nothing dark or fabulous in them.  After all, our ancestors, possessing truly incredible knowledge about the Universe, possessed methods of attracting light forces to their side.  In recent years, scientists have come to the idea that our ancestors did not just develop their own symbolism, which is absolutely not similar to what other peoples of the world had, but encrypted all their knowledge in it.  Since most of the written sources of that era were not preserved, it is charms and symbols that are the only way to learn more about the Slavs and their culture.  Historians believe that in ancient times they perfectly understood how easy it is to destroy written sources, but the patterns are not so easy to forget, once seen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today, clothes with Slavic symbols are sold everywhere, however, be very careful before putting on something that you do not have a full understanding of.  Having become the bearer of an unsuitable sign for yourself, you are quite capable of attracting troubles into your life.  However, taking the choice with all responsibility, you can make the correction of fate and protect yourself from low vibrations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zakustom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="amulets on clothes" class="if uuid-2460613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2460613.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of Slavic charms </h2><p>  Slavic symbolism, which represents amulets, today is not fully disclosed.  Historians and archaeologists have managed to assemble disparate symbols into a single group, finding out their meaning and purpose.  However, this knowledge is not enough to choose a talisman. </p><p>  In the days of our ancestors, only wise men or elders of the clan could make amulets.  Moreover, the most wise and oldest woman belonged to the elders.  To make charms, she chose special days on which other family members did not bother her.  During work, the woman remained silent.  Around her, too, silence should have reigned so that vain thoughts did not penetrate the amulet and did not deprive him of strength. </p><p>  The finished product needed to be charged.  This important matter was entrusted to the Magi.  Today, charging the amulet seems to be something dark and connected with the other world.  However, the Slavs this process was very different.  During the ceremony, the Magi called on their gods and all the forces of nature, their particle penetrated into the object and remained in it.  Some amulets during the life needed to be recharged, while others were so powerful that they retained their functions for many decades. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="magictheory.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lada star" class="if uuid-2460626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2460626.jpg"></div><h2>  Types of amulets </h2><p>  In one article it is very difficult to tell about all Slavic symbolism and amulets.  Their significance is all the more difficult to convey to modern people in full meaning, because our worldview is so very different from our ancestors.  Therefore, you should not hope that you will be able to independently understand such a complex issue. </p><p>  Everyone who wants to choose a Slavic amulet for themselves should understand how many types of them exist: </p><ul><li>  Name amulets.  They were made immediately after the birth of the child, focusing on his zodiac sign.  The Slavs had their own zodiac circle, consisting of sixteen symbols.  Some of them are similar in characteristics to the generally accepted signs of the zodiac, but still have certain differences.  After charging, the nominal amulet was put on the neck of the child and was no longer removed.  He was called to give him strength and endow with those qualities, the lack of which was identified by date of birth. </li><li>  Female amulets.  Women in Slavic culture carried a very important mission.  They were the link between life and death, and were also carriers of all knowledge of the universe.  Women fully possessed sacred knowledge and could feel the vibrations of all worlds.  To save their family from troubles, to bear and give birth to healthy children, to give strength to their husband and to attract wealth to the house, they wore various amulets.  Women could wear them arbitrarily depending on the situation and needs.  At the same time, it was possible to wear not one or two, but even ten amulets.  The Slavs believed that the only way a woman could contact her clan and use its power. </li><li>  Male Slavic symbols and charms.  This category of signs in the first place was to preserve male power, attract good luck in military affairs and protect against injuries and death.  Unlike women, men did not have the right to wear several charms at once.  The warrior had to choose one amulet that guards him throughout his life.  The only addition to it was the symbolism applied to clothing (T-shirts with Slavic symbols today are called upon to perform the same function in the modern world) and weapons.  It was applied mainly by women, who also invested their love power in them.  Therefore, in ancient times, the Slavs took the marriage union with great seriousness.  The men were sure that the right wife could not only keep the house in order and give birth to healthy children, but also bring happiness to the family in every sense of the word. </li><li>  Common amulets.  Such symbols could be worn simultaneously by men and women.  They mainly carried a protective function. </li><li>  Symbols for a certain age.  Our ancestors had an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a concept as human energy.  And accordingly, they understood that a baby whose forces are aimed at knowing this world needs much more energy.  In addition, he simply needs additional protection from evil forces, since the crumb is not yet able to put it on his own.  But an experienced and wise person in age does not feel the need for so many amulets and protective symbols.  Therefore, the oldest Slavs in the family had a minimum number of amulets. </li></ul><p>  If you are really interested in Slavic symbolism, in Moscow there are several specialists who can not only tell you about the talismans, but also teach you how to choose them.  We will also tell readers about this in the next section. </p><div class="photo" data-original="slavyanskaya-kultura.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Olena Grass" class="if uuid-2460617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2460617.jpg"></div><h2>  Charm </h2><p>  Any amulet requires a serious approach to your choice.  To an even greater extent, this applies to Slavic symbolism, which carries powerful energy in itself, which must be properly managed.  We give the rules for choosing the amulet in the form of list items, so they are much easier to remember: </p><ul><li>  Be sure to spend time studying the symbolism.  Do not be lazy and read all available information about the meaning of certain signs.  If you do everything right, then already at this stage you can select several characters that carry the energy and strength you need. </li><li>  Do not discount intuition.  The Slavs believed that internally a person always knows exactly what he needs.  Therefore, listen to yourself: when you see your amulets, pleasant vibrations spill over your body.  This means that you are on the right track, and your protector, as well as an assistant, will be the sign you saw. </li><li>  Consider the person to whom you pick up the amulet.  We have already given their species classification.  It must be used when choosing an amulet for yourself and any other person close to you.  Also keep in mind that strangers cannot be given amulets.  This process is very intimate and is intended for people who are related or love each other. </li><li>  Building protection levels.  Our ancestors did not just wear jewelry, did embroidery and applied tattoos with Slavic symbols to their skin.  Having this or that sign on them, they formed circles of protection.  Women did this on three levels: the head was protected by <span>temporal rings,</span> neck and earrings, the throat and chest by pendants, hryvnias and necklaces, and the hands by numerous bracelets.  In parallel, protective signs were applied to clothes and a belt.  This was quite enough to completely isolate themselves from the creatures of the dark worlds.  However, today it is extremely difficult to build such a defense, so it is better to opt for one or two amulets.  They will form a small circle of protection, which can be considered the maximum possible for a modern person. </li></ul><p>  Once you started wearing the Slavic symbol as a talisman, carefully monitor all changes in life.  If negative situations began to prevail in it, then the amulet was chosen incorrectly.  It is also likely that it was not charged. </p><p>  The Slavs believed that it is possible to appeal to the light forces only to those who themselves observe the laws of good.  Therefore, if you want to receive help from Slavic charms, then lead a correct lifestyle, try to do good to other people and watch your thoughts, avoiding a negative attitude. </p><h2>  Amulets for babies </h2><p>  If you want to choose a protective Slavic symbolism for a baby, then do not hang amulets on his neck.  Our ancestors guarded the newborns with embroidery on clothes, inscribed signs on the cradle and toys, as well as on rugs.  According to Slavic beliefs, the crumb is still between the worlds, so wearing a talisman can, on the contrary, draw it into another world.  Therefore, until the moment of his growing up, it was possible to protect the child only by means of surrounding objects. </p><h2>  Amulets for children </h2><p>  Children from seven to twelve years old were considered quite adults.  However, some adult talismans were still inaccessible to them, so boys and girls wore pendants that performed a dual function - protection and help in strengthening one's own energy. </p><p>  In addition to traditional Slavic symbols, the boys were put on the neck of the image of totem animals.  Before the initiation into adulthood, which occurred at about twelve years old, they were his only guardians.  Girls were ordered to wear solar symbols and floral ornaments.  However, the latter was not fully accessible to them, most often until the age of twelve they could only afford images of bells. </p><p>  The following characters were considered the most suitable characters for children of a specified age: </p><ul><li>  Molvinets.  This symbol is closely related to the genus.  This deity, according to beliefs, gave life to all the Slavs and was direct evidence of their belonging to the great race.  Molvinets protected all Slavs from any negativity generated by words.  In addition, he turned the evil eye, spoilage and swear words to the one who uttered them.  The reflective power of the amulet was very appreciated by our ancestors, so it was primarily hung on the neck of children, pregnant and young beauties.  It is known that Molvinets has one more property - it increases the strength of kind words spoken to its bearer several times. </li><li>  The twelve-pointed cross.  This amulet denotes the power of fire and is one of the hallmarks of the god Rod.  He protects his possessor from any external manifestations and the effects of evil. </li><li>  The grass is over.  In common people, this amulet is known as the Fern Flower, and it is endowed with tremendous power.  An amulet with such a sign was considered universal, since it could be applied to almost any surface.  He protected babies while on clothes, and women as a symbol on a pendant.  Of all the possible variants of a tattoo with Slavic symbols for men, it was considered the most popular.  Children were almost always protected by grass-grass, since such a talisman is able to protect against any ailment and misfortune sent by dark forces. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="vse-o-tattoo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tattoo of Slavic characters" class="if uuid-2460610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2460610.jpg"></div><h2>  Women's amulets </h2><p>  A woman in Slavic culture performs several important functions, therefore she must keep herself and her family in every possible way.  Everything that is connected with the subtle world of spirits and otherworldly forces is the responsibility of a woman.  The following symbols were considered the best amulets for her: </p><ul><li>  Makosh.  Only an adult and wise woman as a guardian of the family could wear such a sign.  It helps to keep family warmth, love and traditions.  Thanks to Makosha, well-being and happiness come to the house, young family members respect the traditions of their kind, and everyone else is healthy and active.  Also, this symbol can bring abundance. </li><li>  Ladinets.  In general terms, the amulet can be described as a symbol of female harmony.  Our ancestors believed that he is able to strengthen the feminine, which will lead to the restoration of balance at all levels of personality.  Slavs who wore Ladin gained peace, joy and happiness.  This instantly affected the appearance of a woman who became more attractive, healthier and more active.  Her hormonal balance returned to normal, which contributed to a decrease in body weight and an improvement in the quality of skin and hair. </li><li>  Star of Lada.  This is the best amulet for married women and those who dream of creating a family.  It symbolizes the divine principle, expressed in the fusion of the forces of nature and female harmony.  The amulet invites families, love and prosperity to families, so it was not only worn on the body, but also depicted on the walls of the dwelling. </li></ul><h2>  Men's amulets </h2><div class="photo" data-original="anisima.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Veles stamp" class="if uuid-2460622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2460622.jpg"></div><p>  The main distinguishing feature of Slavic talismans for men is strength.  They are called to increase it and give confidence in themselves: </p><ul><li>  Seal of Veles.  This symbol represents the paw of a predatory beast (bear or wolf).  He should bring good luck in business and well-being, but on condition that he be worn throughout his life. </li><li>  <span>The Ax of Perun.</span>  It belonged to a warrior who gave himself all in the name of the cause of protecting his land and family from dark forces and Gentiles.  This symbol is part of the cult of the <span>god Storm.</span>  He belonged to those deities who were responsible for the transfer of traditions and power from father to son.  In this way, Rod is preserved in the most important sense for the Slavs. </li><li>  Christmas carol.  Kolyada is classified as the main deity.  He is the god of all things on Earth and in other worlds, responsible for changes for the better and renewal in the broad sense of the word.  A man wearing this amulet will always stand on the side of the world and conquer darkness. </li><li>  Bunny.  This symbol is often worn by women, but it is intended for men.  The fact is that the Bunny helps preserve the Rod, contributing to the birth of its successor - the boy.  Women who want to give birth to an heir must embroider this amulet on clothes.  And men can wear it on the body, in which case they can conceive a boy.  Interestingly, many deities give power to the Hare.  Most of them are responsible for fertility. </li></ul><h2>   </h2><p> There are a lot of such characters.  The most famous is the Wedding, which is often applied to wedding rings with Slavic symbols.  In another performance, he could be given into the hands of the bride so that she would begin her main functions - the guardian of the family.  After the triumph, the amulet needed to be removed and a place found for him within the house.  Today, rings with Slavic symbols are very popular, therefore, out of all the variety of signs, the bride and groom can be advised specifically by the wedding. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vseprivoroty.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="amulets for honeymooners" class="if uuid-2460615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45245/2460615.jpg"></div><p>  The symbol of the Race is considered a talisman for any person belonging by blood to the Slavs.  It is a complex amulet made up of several characters. </p><p>  The Tree of Life is an excellent <span>family amulet.</span>  According to Slavic beliefs, the three faces of the world - Rule, Jav and Nav - can be represented as a tree with powerful roots.  It is designed to accumulate generic energy and protect the family from everything negative, including illness, the evil eye and targeted damage. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Slavic symbolism is very diverse.  Therefore, we did not tell about all the signs that are protective symbols.  However, it is worth remembering the main thing: any amulet inherited from our ancestors has incredible power, which must be used only in the name of good. </p>
