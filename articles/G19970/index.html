Photos and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The most beautiful lake in the world Lake Baikal has always attracted to itself.  Recently, tourism has increased significantly due to the fact that there are wonderful comfortable camp sites on the Small Sea of ​​Lake Baikal.  Let's look at some of them, see what conditions are offered there, read the reviews of vacationers.  Of course, this little virtual tour will help you make the right choice and get an excellent holiday on Lake Baikal. </p><h2>  Small sea </h2><p>  Before we begin to consider the campsites on the Small Sea, let's see what it is, in fact, such as the Baikal Small Sea?  Lake Baikal from the north-east stretched to the south-west for 620 km.  About the middle of its length, on the western side, is the Small Sea.  Some call it the gulf, others call it the strait.  The <span>island of Olkhon</span> also forms this natural body of water, also very elongated from the north-east to the south-west <span>.</span>  The length of the sea is about 100 km, the maximum width is about 16, and the minimum is 5 km.  Olkhon Island with its huge "body" covers the sea from ice and in winter and summer Baikal currents, so that the water here warms up to +22 degrees, and in the bays - up to +25.  That is why <span>camp sites</span> are so actively being built <span>on the Small Sea of ​​Lake Baikal.</span>  Now there are more than two dozen of them.  The banks of the reservoir are significantly indented by bays and bays.  Many of them have wonderful strips of sandy beaches that surround the majestic mountain ranges and evergreen conifers.  The most popular among tourists is the Mukhor Bay, the depth of which is only 5 meters, and even closer to the coast it is even less.  In summer, the water here is not colder than in the <span>Aegean Sea,</span> so the most popular type of recreation is beach.  There are other wonderful bays and coves on the Small Sea, for example, such as Grandmother with a strip of golden sand, Khuzhir-Nugai, Hagdan-Dalai.  There were built such wonderful camp sites on the Small Sea, such as Danko, Laguna, Khuzhir-Nuge, and Geser.  There are many picturesque capes on the coast, crashing into the water surface.  But the Zama plain is especially popular with tourists.  The eponymous base is located here, offering a varied <span>vacation in winter</span> and summer.  Tourists are accommodated here in comfortable rooms of various categories - from "standard" to "luxury".  The restaurant offers delicious and delicious dishes, an extensive wine list and impeccable service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chalets on the Small Sea" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/962318.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport connection </h2><p>  The geological and natural features of this territory are such that only motor vehicles connect the camp sites on the Small Sea.  You can get here on vacation by buses departing from Irkutsk every day from the side of the main entrance to the Trud stadium.  Departure in the summer at 9:00 and at 12:00, and in the off-season and in winter - only in the morning.  Anyone who needs to leave towards Angarsk should take a bus at the Sovremennik Palace of Culture.  Departure at 7:30 every day.  Travel time to the Small Sea will take about 4-5 hours.  The ticket price is also different (depending on distance) and ranges from 900 to 1100 rubles one way per person.  When getting on a bus, you need to check with the driver if this route leads to the desired base?  The fact is that several buses depart from the Trud stadium at the same time.  They all go towards the Small Sea, but to different holiday homes. </p><p>  You can get to the campsites on the Small Sea of ​​Lake Baikal and by car.  The starting point is the city of Irkutsk, from where it is about 250 km to the Gulf of Mukhor.  You need to follow the Kuchugsky (Yakutsky) highway.  The road leads through the villages of Oyok, Bayandai, Elantsy (where you must refuel).  You can’t get to the MPC (Sakhyurt).  About 5 km to this village there is a fork.  If you turn left on it, the road will lead to Mukhor Bay.  And if you turn right - then to the village of MRS, and then to the crossing to Olkhon.  A good dirt and gravel road has been laid along Mukhor.  Sometimes it passes very close to the water's edge, from where amazing landscapes open.  But not all camps of the Small Sea can be reached by car.  Some, for example, "Shumak", vacationers delivered by helicopter. </p><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But in the summer you can get to the camps of the Small Sea by water.  The starting point is the pier "Rocket", which is in the solar neighborhood.  The ship follows to Ust-Barguzin with a call to Olkhon.  There you need to transfer to another boat.  Getting from Olkhon is not very convenient, since you need to climb the hill on foot (as much as 1.5 km) to the crossing, swim to the MPC, and then catch the bus or order a boat at the camp site, where you are going on vacation. </p><h2>  "Chara" </h2><p>  Chara campsite on the Small Sea, charming and very comfortable for people of all categories, is located in a young pine forest, between pretty hills in Mukhor Bay, just 900 meters from the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hostels on the Small Sea of ​​Baikal" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/962324.jpg" width="557"></div>  Here housing is provided taking into account the financial capabilities of vacationers.  These are simple houses of the "economy" type, in which there are no amenities in the form of a toilet and shower, but a very pleasant atmosphere, clean, comfortable, and even all the furniture, walls, ceilings, floors are made of environmentally friendly materials.  For those who like to live in comfort, the Chara camp site on the Small Sea offers standard rooms, unusually beautifully and romantically decorated “suites” and separate cottages where you can comfortably accommodate a large family.  According to reviews, food at this base is organized taking into account the different preferences of vacationers.  Everyone can take a ticket with a comprehensive three meals a day or eat in the restaurant for a custom-made menu.  Snacks and soulful tea parties at the Chara camp site are held in the fireplace room, furnished with great taste.  There is also a bar where, in addition to drinks, you can take snacks.  Leisure of vacationers at the camp site includes swimming in the bay in summer (the water temperature from July to September allows this) and in the indoor pool, in the winter - ice skating and skiing, and all year round fascinating excursions with wonderful guides who give their whole soul to their work.  Precisely because so much is being done on the basis of “Chara” for a wonderful holiday for each guest, the reviews about it are only the most enthusiastic.
