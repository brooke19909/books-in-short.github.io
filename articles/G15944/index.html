    <h2>  A little bit about the camera </h2><p>  The first generation of FED cameras was produced from 1934 to the mid-50s.  After that, the FED-2 camera replaced him.  Under the name of the first generation (without numbering), a large number of different cameras were delivered, which differed from each other in insignificant details.  This device is considered a copy of Leica II of German origin.  The shutter is created from curtains that were previously rubberized.  Self-timer and sync are not provided. </p><h2>  Modifications </h2><p>  The FED camera was released in several modifications.  What are their differences?  Various coating technologies were used, inscriptions were made differently, and configurations of parts were changed.  Thanks to this diversity, collectors have long since born a genuine interest in this model. </p><h2>  Non-serial release </h2><p>  In 1933, 30 cameras were created manually, which had an additional rangefinder.  But these devices did not get into the series.  At the same time, the Pioneer, a camera of a similar design, was created at the Leningrad plant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the middle of spring 1934, a batch of 500 cameras was released.  They were a copy of Leica II, like the FED itself.  A little later, another similar design called "FAG" was released for sale.  The party consisted of 100 pieces, and production was established in the city of Moscow. </p><h2>  War and release </h2><p>  Initially, the FED camera was produced at the Kharkov factory, but due to the outbreak of war, the documentation was transferred to the Krasnogorsk conveyor.  Continued production was established by 1948. </p><p>  The sale of the Zorkiy camera has begun.  She was a complete copy of the "FED", which was produced in the pre-war period.  The first copies were called the same as their predecessors.  The only difference was that the factory logo was additionally applied.  Until 1949, the combined name ‚ÄúFED 1948 Zorky‚Äù was used.  Starting next year, the name was reduced to "Dawn." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does the fad camera cost" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1938827.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Many are interested in how much the FED camera costs.  It should be noted that the first model is not very expensive.  It is often sold at a bargain price, leaving the buyer an opportunity to bargain.  The average price is about 1 thousand rubles if you purchase the model at various auction trading sites.  The following camera models are much more expensive. </p>
