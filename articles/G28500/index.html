Epochs in Art in Order</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Historical periodization is an indispensable thing both in science and in <span>everyday life.</span>  There are certain eras that span specific time periods.  Their names were invented recently, after a person was able to look in retrospect, evaluate and divide past events into stages.  Now we will look at all the epochs in order, find out why they were named that way and what they are characterized by. </p><h2>  Why is there historical chronology? </h2><p>  This technique was developed by researchers for a reason.  Firstly, each separate period is characterized by special cultural trends.  Each era has its own worldview, fashion, society structure, type of business building, and much more.  Considering the epochs of humanity in order, one can also pay attention to the fact that each of them is characterized by separate types of art.  This is music, and painting, and literature.  Secondly, in the history of mankind there really were so-called turning points, when morale radically changed, new laws were established.  This, of course, entailed a change in addictions that manifested themselves in art.  Such changes could be influenced by revolutions, wars, scientific discoveries, the teachings of great philosophers and church leaders.  And now, before we look at all historical epochs in order, we note that our society has recently experienced such a cardinal change.  Scientific and technological progress has completely turned our ideas about communication, sources of information, and even about work.  And the reason for this is the Internet, without which ten years ago everyone did, but today it is part of everyone‚Äôs life. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-686635" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/686635.jpg?1570975921"></div><h2>  Antique period </h2><p>  We omit the history of primitive society, because at that time there was no single ideology, religion, or at least a writing system.  Therefore, when the epochs of humanity are examined in order, they begin precisely from the ancient period, because at that time the first states, the first laws and morality appeared, as well as the art that we are still studying.  The period began around the end of the 8th century BC.  e.  and lasted until 476, the date of the fall of the <span>Roman Empire.</span>  At this time, not only a polytheistic religion appeared with a clear fixation of all deities, but also a writing system - Greek and Latin.  Also during this period in Europe such a concept as slavery arose. </p><h2>  Middle Ages </h2><p>  Even when the school examines the era in order, special attention is paid to the study of the Middle Ages.  The period began at the end of the 5th century, but the date of its end, at least approximate, does not exist.  Some believe that it ended in the middle of the 15th century, others believe that the Middle Ages lasted until the 17th century.  The era is characterized by a huge rise in Christianity.  It was during these years that the great crusades took place.  Along with them, the Inquisition was born, which exterminated all opponents of the church.  In the Middle Ages, a form of slavery such as feudalism arose that existed in the world many centuries later. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-686630" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/686630.jpg?1570975921"></div><h2>  Renaissance </h2><p>  This era is usually singled out as a separate one, but many historians believe that the Renaissance is, so to speak, the secular side of the Middle Ages.  The bottom line is that at the end of the <span>14th century,</span> people began to appeal to humanity.  Some antique rules and morality returned, the Inquisition gradually surrendered its position.  This was manifested both in art and in the behavior of society.  People began to attend theaters, a concept such as a social ball arose.  The Renaissance, like Antiquity, originated in Italy, and today, numerous monuments of architecture and art confirm this. </p><h2>  Baroque </h2><p>  When we examine directly the epochs of the history of mankind in order, the Baroque, although not for long, took an important branch in the formation of art.  Below we will consider it in more detail, but for now, note the following.  This era was the logical conclusion of the Renaissance.  We can say that the craving for social life and beauty has grown to an incredible scale.  An architectural style of the same name appeared, which is characterized by pomposity and pretentiousness.  A similar trend manifested itself in music, and in drawing, and even in the behavior of people.  <span>The Baroque era</span> lasted from the 16th to the 17th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-686628" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/686628.jpg?1570975921"></div><h2>  Classicism </h2><p>  In the second half of the 17th century, humanity decided to move away from such a magnificent idleness.  Society, like the art that it created, has become canonized and fitted under clear rules.  Classicism began to manifest itself in the design of buildings and interiors.  Right angles, straight lines, rigor and asceticism came into fashion.  Theater and music, which were at the peak of their cultural development, were also subject to new reforms.  Certain styles appeared that guided the authors in one direction or another.  Below we will examine the epochs in art in order and in more detail learn what classicism was. </p><h2>  Romantic period </h2><p>  In the 18th century, people seemed to be infected with a mania of beauty and unearthly fantasies.  This period is considered the most mysterious in the history of mankind, ephemeral and original.  A tendency has appeared in society, according to which each person is a separate spiritual and creative person, with his own inner world, emotions and joys.  As a rule, when historians represent cultural epochs in chronological order, one of the most important places is given to romanticism.  In this period, which lasted until the 19th century, unique masterpieces of music (Chopin, Schubert, etc.), literature (famous French novels) and painting appeared. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-686629" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/686629.jpg?1570975921"></div><h2>  Education </h2><p>  In parallel with romanticism, art itself improved.  When all epochs are listed in order, as a rule, Enlightenment is placed behind classicism.  Along with the development of science and art, at the end of the 17th century, the level of intelligence began to increase in society at a tremendous speed.  This was expressed in the rejection of orthodox religious norms.  Instead of sacred knowledge, logic and a bright mind came.  This greatly undermined the authority of the aristocracy and the ruling dynasties, which in many respects referred to the help of the church.  The Age of Enlightenment became the starting point of a new philosophy based on mathematics and physics.  A number of astronomical discoveries have occurred that have disproved many religious dogmas.  The Age of Enlightenment affected not only Europe, but also Russia, as well as the Far East, and even America.  During this period, serfdom was abolished in many powers.  It is also worth noting that in the 18-19th centuries, for the first time, women began to take part in scientific and government meetings. </p><h2>  Latest time </h2><p>  We briefly listed all historical epochs in order and approached the 20th century.  This period is famous for the flourishing of various <span>trends in art,</span> numerous coups d'etat and changes in regimes of power.  Therefore, from a historical point of view, this era is called the <span>latest time.</span>  Since the beginning of the 20th century, it can be said that society has become completely equal.  Slavery was eradicated all over the world, and clear borders of states were established.  Such conditions have become the optimal environment for the development of not only art but also science.  We now live in this era, therefore, in order to consider it in detail, it is enough to look around. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-686634" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/686634.jpg?1570975921"></div><h2>  Brief Summary </h2><p>  After we presented all the epochs of world history in order, described them, having learned what our society was in this or that century, we proceed to the study of the beautiful.  Indeed, in parallel with the formation of laws and the borders of states, art was formed, which for many is the main determining factor for dividing the history of mankind into separate periods.  Below we will present the epochs in art in order, characterize them and we will be able to compare a clear picture of how our society was formed from the very beginning of time.  To begin with, we will summarize the main "era", and then divide them into separate sectors.  After all, musical periods do not always coincide in time frames with the same periods in literature or, say, in painting. </p><h2>  Art: era in chronological order </h2><ul><li>  The ancient period.  From the moment the first cave paintings appeared, ending with the 8th century BC.  e. </li><li>  Antiquity - from the 8th century BC.  e.  until the 6th century AD  e. </li><li>  Middle Ages: <span>Romanesque</span> and Gothic.  The first dates from the 6-10th centuries, and the second from the 10-14th centuries. </li><li>  The Renaissance is the famous 14-16th century. </li><li>  Baroque - 16-18th century. </li><li>  Rococo - 18th century. </li><li>  Classicism.  It was formed against the background of other areas from the 16th to the 19th century. </li><li>  Romanticism - the first half of the 19th century. </li><li>  Eclecticism is the second half of the 19th century. </li><li>  Modernism is the beginning of the 20th century.  It is worth noting that modern is a common name for this creative era.  In different countries and in different areas of art, their own trends have formed, which we will discuss below. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-686633" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/686633.jpg?1570975921"></div><h2>  What the pen will tell ... At the source of writing </h2><p>  Now consider the literary epochs in chronological order: the ancient stage (Antiquity and the East), the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, Classicism, Sentimentalism, Romanticism, Realism, Modernism and modernity.  For the first time, literary creations began to appear in Greece, Rome, and also in the <span>countries of the East.</span>  It was in these powers that the first writing arose.  Myths began to appear in the ancient world - about Heracles, about Zeus and other gods, about titans and giant birds.  Later the first philosophers, thinkers and writers appeared.  This is Homer, Sappho, Aeschylus, Horace.  This genre is now called lyrics, but often such stories are referred to as a historical reliable source.  The world of the Ancient East is famous only for its instructive poems.  However, let's not forget that it was in this part of the world in ancient times that the most important book of mankind appeared - the Bible. </p><h2>  Middle Ages and Renaissance </h2><p>  There is no clear boundary between these periods, and it is not needed.  Indeed, in the years when Europe was just beginning to form as a state system, people were not up to art.  The first manifestations of creativity in the Middle Ages were stifled by the church.  Therefore, the literary inheritance that we have inherited from those years is only a knightly epic.  Here you can name ‚ÄúSong of my Side‚Äù, ‚ÄúSong of Roland‚Äù and ‚ÄúSong of the Nibelungs‚Äù.  Centuries later, the Renaissance sets in, and such names as Shakespeare, Dante, Boccaccio, Cervantes become known to the world.  Their stories can be called free, because there is no clear structure, and in the center of events is a person and his feelings.  This is the main characteristic of the Renaissance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-686632" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/686632.jpg?1570975921"></div><h2>  Formation of strict canons </h2><p>  When we list the epochs in order, century after century, everything falls into place, except Classicism.  It seems that it exists outside of time, space, against the background of other currents.  From the moment that the classics became the basis for the creativity of European authors, a number of patterns appeared in the writing of literary works.  They were clearly divided into <span>genres: ode,</span> satire, tragedy, comedy, epic, fable.  We can say that since then the boundaries of creativity have been set, which we use today (pay attention at least to the cinema). </p><h2>  Sentimentalism and romanticism </h2><p>  These two currents seem to complement each other.  They are famous for their novels, which describe the experiences of the heroes, their state of mind, tastes and interests.  Among the authors of romanticism, such surnames as Balzac, Dickens, Hoffmann, Victor Hugo, the Bronte sisters, Mark Twain, W. Scott and many others are registered in red letters.  In the later years of romanticism, authors such as Oscar Wilde and Edgar Allan Poe created it.  Their stories are already devoid of sentimentality, but filled with deep philosophy. </p><h2>  Realism and modernism, as well as modern literature </h2><p>  At the junction of the 19th and 20th centuries, many currents appeared in the literature.  In our country they were called the Silver Age, in others they were simply named in accordance with the style of a particular work.  The most popular was symbolism and decadence.  Representatives of these areas were authors such as Verlaine, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Blok.  Acmeism was quite popular in Russia.  Its main representative was Anna Akhmatova.  Since then, literature has become as realistic as possible.  People abandoned inner experiences and illusions.  From the beginning of the 20th century to the present day, the authors describe any events from the most realistic point of view, taking into account all the innovations of progress. </p><h2>  art </h2><p>  Now it's time to consider all eras in painting in order.  We note immediately that there are much more of them here than in the literature, therefore we will address each of them briefly and concisely. </p><ul><li>  Cave painting. </li><li>  The art of Ancient Egypt and the Middle East. </li><li>  Cretan Mycenaean culture. </li><li>  Antique drawings and writing. </li><li>  Middle Ages: iconography and Gothic illustrations on religious subjects. </li><li>  Rebirth.  Bright representatives are Michelangelo, da Vinci and others. </li><li>  Since the 18th century, the Baroque style appears in painting.  Pronounced in the paintings of Caravaggio. </li><li>  Classicism, which has been forming in the fine arts since the 16th century, was embodied in the works of Poussin and Rubens. </li><li>  Romanticism has shown itself in the canvases of Delacour and Goya. </li><li>  Impressionism appeared at the end of the 19th century.  Van Gogh is considered to be its bright representative, and Gauguin, Lautrec Munch and others act along with him. </li><li>  In the 20th century, painting was divided into socialist-realist and surrealistic.  The first current developed exclusively in Russia.  The second conquered the whole world.  It is clearly visible in the paintings of S. Dali, P. Picasso and other artists of this time. </li></ul>
