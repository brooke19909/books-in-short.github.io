Father of Anton Pavlovich Chekhov</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Father Anton Pavlovich Chekhov, Pavel Egorovich, was born in 1825 in the village of Olkhovatka.  The Chekhov family was serfs.  At school, P.E. Chekhov studied literacy, singing, and mastered the violin.  Since 1840 he studied at the Chertkova sugar factory in his village. </p><h2>  Youth </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Chekhov's father" class="if uuid-1743996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35123/1743996.jpg?1547659780"></div><p>  Since 1841, he became a free peasant, thanks to his father, then he was added to the list of philistines of Rostov.  A year later, he was already driving the bulls from his village to Moscow, where he successfully sold them. </p><p>  In 1844, his father identified Pavel Egorovich to Kobylin I.E. (Taganrog merchant).  Not even a year had passed before Chekhov was already in charge of his clerical trade. </p><p>  A year later, Pavel Egorovich Chekhov (1825-1898 g.) Played a wedding, <span>Evgenia</span> Yakovlevna <span>Morozova</span> became his chosen one.  Subsequently, she gave him six heirs: Alexander, Nikolai, <span>Anton, Ivan,</span> Maria and Mikhail.  Thus, the Chekhov family was large and friendly. </p><p>  In order to further successfully develop his trade, he had to abandon the philistine estate.  07/21/1858 Pavel Egorovich was awarded the merchant title in the third guild.  A year later, he was approved in the rank of the second guild, which was paid another sixteen years. </p><p>  But trade was not Chekhov‚Äôs only occupation; he also took an active part in the city‚Äôs social activities.  So, since 1866, Pavel Egorovich Chekhov was appointed a member of the trade deputation, four years later he was handed a form list.  In 1871 he was awarded a medal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Family ruin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Pavel Egorovich Chekhov" class="if uuid-1743989" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35123/1743989.jpg?1547659780"></div><p>  The year 1876 was not easy for the family of Pavel Egorovich, it was ruined.  This was due to the decline in trade in Taganrog, because at that time railways were being laid in Rostov.  Also Pavel Egorovich Chekhov, father of A.P. Chekhov, paid for the construction of a house for his family, but an unscrupulous contractor set a too high price for the construction. </p><p>  All this drove the family into a debt hole.  Pavel Egorovich Chekhov, whose biography was very difficult, was forced to leave for Moscow.  There he was in poverty for over a year. </p><p>  In 1877 he received the position of clerk at the merchant I. E. Gavrilov.  There Chekhov's father A.P. worked for more than thirteen years. </p><p>  Since 1892 he moved to live in the Melikhovsky estate of Anton Pavlovich Chekhov.  There he ran a farm, looked after the garden, wrote a diary, studied all the newspapers and informed A.P. Chekhov about the articles. </p><p>  The cause of the death of Pavel Egorovich was an unsuccessful operation in 1898, which was carried out in Moscow.  There he was buried at the Novodevichy cemetery. </p><h2>  Wife </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Czech family" class="if uuid-1743991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35123/1743991.jpg?1547659780"></div><p>  Evgenia Yakovlevna Chekhova (Morozova) was the wife of Pavel Egorovich.

Her family was forced to move to Taganrog, where she was sent to the <span>Institute of Noble Maidens</span> Kurilova.  There she mastered good manners, tone, was trained in dancing. </p><p>  Evgenia Yakovlevna experienced a period of family ruin heavily, but she always believed in her husband and supported all his undertakings.  She took over the household management in Moscow and Melikhov. </p><p>  Exemplary parents, Pavel Egorovich Chekhov, Evgenia Yakovlevna Chekhova devoted much time to raising and educating their children.  Evgenia Yakovlevna was a very hospitable, affectionate and helpful woman.  She was sure that each of the children loved her in a special way.  In turn, she did not single out her favorites among them, and gave her love to the children as a whole and to each individually. </p><p>  Death overtook her before her 83rd birthday, the reason for this was a serious illness. </p><p>  In the future, Anton Pavlovich Chekhov repeatedly mentioned that he inherited the talent from his father, and from his mother he took the best - her soul. </p><h2>  Pavel Egorovich Chekhov.  Children.  Eldest son Alexander </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Pavel Egorovich Chekhov biography" class="if uuid-1743988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35123/1743988.jpg?1547659780"></div><p>  The eldest son of Pavel Yegorovich Alexander was born in 1855, he was a writer.

Khrushcheva-Sokolnikova.  He could not marry her, since the Tula spiritual consistory did not agree to divorce her husband, thereby condemning her to eternal celibacy.  This did not prevent the beloved from having two heirs (Anton and Nikolai). </p><p>  Four years he served in Taganrog, St. Petersburg and Novorossiysk customs.  This left a negative imprint on his work, because he almost abandoned it.  In 1886, Anton Pavlovich helped Alexander get a position in the newspaper. </p><p>  Two years later, he lost his wife, and in 1889 he was married to N.A.
