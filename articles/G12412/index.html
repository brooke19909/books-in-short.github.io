    <p>  Egypt's significant investments in the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, its architecture - low-rise (mostly up to three floors) hotel buildings.  The resort city, like a pearl, is framed by the mountain ranges of the <span>Sinai desert,</span> gradually turning into rocky dunes, and closer to the coast - into wonderful beaches. </p><h2>  Sound reputation </h2><p>  The hotel complex Tropicana has a well-deserved international reputation.  In addition to Russians and Ukrainians, vacationers from Western Europe are staying here: Germans, British, Greeks, French.  There are regular customers.  The hotel is really good. </p><p>  Choosing this good-quality second-line hotel, tourists remain satisfied, on average rating its services (on a five-point scale) at ‚Äú4‚Äù with many advantages.  Of course, there are fives, but there are fewer of them.  Obviously, the reason for the restrictions affecting the "star" Tropicana Azure Club 4 (on the map of hotels in Egypt, in any case, the hotel is always present. And this indicates recognition).  And yet it has a relatively small territory - 52 thousand m2.  It does not have its own beach.  Are such circumstances significant?  Of course.  How does the institution manage to enter the top hotels in Egypt?  This is what we will talk about in this article. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About the location of the hotel </h2>

The architecture is typical of Sharm El Sheikh.  The territory is landscaped, compact and very well maintained.  Around the clock staff clean it.  The hotel terraces are not just swept, but also washed.  Therefore, you can move around them barefoot, which often vacationers do.

    <p>  The furniture is of the same type, it is made of dark wood with a texture reminiscent of teak, which is justified in view of the ideal resistance of such a tree to both humidity and heat.  Tropicana Club Azure 4 rooms are furnished according to the classical harmonic series.  This means that the observer‚Äôs gaze slides from a smaller piece of furniture to a larger one, without stopping at any object.  The sizes of the comfortable spacious beds, stylish semi-chairs and tables are consistent with the surrounding living space.  A safe is provided in each room for free. </p><p>  The lighting in the hotel rooms is balanced and provides a soft, even diffusion of light.  As a result, objects do not cast sharp shadows, which does not bother the eyes. </p><h2>  Central hotel pool </h2><p>  Despite the small area, it is a favorite vacation spot for hotel guests (we will talk about the beach later).  Especially during those hours when the seasonal cool wind blows (for Egypt this is essential).  All hotel buildings are built radially, protect the development center from the wind.  In the middle is a pool, protected by their walls from the wind.  It is constantly heated to a temperature of +24 <sup>0</sup> C. Therefore, Tropicana Azure Club 4 (Sharm el-Sheikh) spa residents prefer to spend the morning hours there after breakfast.  And in windy weather, when the wind makes swimming impossible at sea, the pool remains a comfortable, pleasant place to relax. </p><p>  As you know, the best for the Country of the Pharaohs is a vacation in October - November, when the hot south-westerly wind carrying desert sand (Hasmin) is replaced by a cool northeasterly wind, giving moderate coolness.  In the winter months, starting in December, the cold east wind blows levant.  Note that the restrictions on the local holiday season are imposed precisely by the wind (the Red Sea always has a constant temperature: from +23 <sup>0</sup>  to +24 <sup>0</sup> .) </p><h2>  Pool landscape design </h2>

    <p>  However, let us return to the central pool of Primasol Tropicana Azure Club 4 - an oasis of hotel relaxation.  Visitors to the hotel are attracted by its aesthetics: the man-made pond has rounded outlines, two artificial capes are created inside it.  Chic royal palms are artistically planted on them, arbors with textured roofs imitating bungalows are built. </p><p>  Its exterior attracts: always neat, cleanly tidied terraces, bridges, <span>fountains, decorative</span> stones. </p><p>  It is multifunctional, the pool depth is also combined: from 45 to 185 cm, it is zoned for children and adults.  Around it are trestle beds with umbrellas, here you can always get a towel.  The bar is open from morning until sunset.  Here you can often hear good music.  In the evening, the beautifully illuminated Primasol Tropicana Azure Club 4 buildings are reflected in the water. </p><p>  To the left of the main pool is unheated, with two slides.  Children from 12 years old are allowed to ride the slides.  Before lunch, slides operate from 10 <sup>00</sup> to 13 <sup>00</sup> , and after it - from 15 <sup>00</sup> to 17 <sup>00</sup> .  Not far from artificial ponds are areas for recreation and sports.  Here, for sports enthusiasts, classes in water aerobics and gymnastics are held.  Volleyball and tennis are popular. </p><p>  The hotel has a fitness room. </p><h2>  Road to the beach </h2><p>  However, of course, guests do not come here because of the pool.  They are attracted by the beautiful colorful and rich fauna and flora of the Red Sea and, of course, a <span>beach holiday</span> in Egypt.  As we mentioned above, the Tropicana Azure Club Hotel (Egypt) does not have its own beach.  However, its guests use the beach of the five-star Tropicana Grand Azure Hotel for free.  This is not altruism.  The reason is that both hotels are owned by the same person.  Until 17 <sup>00,</sup> guests covered by this article of the hotel can walk to the beach through the territory of the aforementioned five-star. </p>

It will be useful to them for presenting to the bus driver, regularly, every 15 minutes, making flights to the beach.  According to the recommendations of regular hotel guests, it is better to go to the beach after 11 <sup>00</sup> , when the wind over the sea is less cool.  Note that it is not necessary to go to the beach: if the bus takes the vacationers to it in five minutes, then the walk will take about fifteen minutes.

    <p>  Moreover, on foot following, as we already said, the path will pass through the territory of the aforementioned five-star Tropicana Grand Azure.  His guard will pay attention to the presence of badges, so you can get through.  Here you will see pools and slides.  However, you cannot use them: formally they do not apply to your hotel and the bracelet pass you received at Club Resort Ex Tropicana does not give you the right to use them.  Note that this nuance is diplomatically silent on hotel sites.  However, you are sure to come across it.  Alas, this is an Egyptian marketing peculiarity: declare more than they offer.  Experienced tourists know: this is typical for many hotel complexes. </p><h2>  Sea holiday </h2><p>  The beach where you arrive is well equipped.  There is always free space, trestle beds, umbrellas.  Partitions-screens protecting from the wind are equipped (a feature of beach holidays in Egypt).  There is a buffet on the beach.  If you are not going to return to dinner at the hotel restaurant where you live (Hotel Tropicana Azure Club 4 *), then you will not stay hungry.  However, we recommend that you dose the sunbathing.  The Egyptian sun is very active, and due to the breeze, which, in turn, creates the impression of coolness, the unlucky tourist will not understand for the time being that he was burned in the sun.  Most of the tourists return to the hotel territory by lunch time and, having lunch, get sunbathing by the pool, which we have already talked about. </p><h2>  Red sea </h2>

Firstly, hotels in Egypt often demonstrate a unique level of management (we will talk about this later). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  And secondly, do not forget that the Red Sea is called coral, it has significant features.  You can walk along it for hundreds of meters (i.e., enter the water), and the water will reach your ankles.  In addition, you should in any case walk along the bottom in slippers, which will protect your feet from cuts, because at the bottom there are many sharp corals.  And the last: at least without a mask you will also be bored in the Red Sea (after all, his whole ‚Äútrick‚Äù in the picturesque underwater world: bright corals, exotic fish, shells). </p><h2>  Pontoon </h2><p>  The bracelet at the Tropicana Azure Club will give you the opportunity to use a fairly long wooden pontoon, along which you can walk 900 meters.  Then the depth begins abruptly.  Approximately in the middle of the pontoon there is also entry into the water.  Here to the left is the lagoon, where the waves are always smaller and the depth is suitable for bathing children.  Real divers and connoisseurs of diving go to the end of the pontoon.  At depth, the underwater world is richer.  Only about 250 species of coral live here!  And for the "fish" should not show familiarity.  The jaw is not aggressive, but the predatory madder is not weaker than that of a bulldog.  Do not provoke her reflexes.  Inspect this fish should keep a distance. </p><p>  Note that the peculiarity of a beach holiday, characteristic of the hotel - a round-trip walk along the pontoon - for some reason upsets some vacationers .. Some of the reviews whine (let us call it by their names) that you need to go "under the scorching sun."  It's all nonsense.  Most vacationers perceive the local path along the pontoon as an indispensable requisite of relaxation, and in their reviews of the rest they describe their impressions of the Red Sea. </p><p>  There is a diving school on the beach.  For a fee you can take courses and even get the appropriate diploma.  Note that buying a scuba gear in local stores will cost you less than in Moscow.  That's what many guests of the Tropicana Azure Club do, the photo of their ‚Äúunderwater odysseys‚Äù upon arrival home adequately illustrates their stories about their vacation in Egypt. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2>

The disco itself lasts from 23 <sup>00</sup> to 3 <sup>00</sup> .  This is a really cool, professional world-class disco.  Hotel guests are happy to visit her. </p><p>  If we talk about more specific excursions (Egypt, as you know, is called the Country of the Pharaohs), then the typical situation for the hotel considered in this article is typical: the prices of excursions from the hotel are higher than from specialized travel agencies.  At least not far from the hotel, agents can purchase discounted tours if you buy them for the company. </p><p>  However, especially prudent tourists in advance, have not yet left for Egypt, by paying on the Internet, they buy several excursions for themselves at once.  But then they have a rich excursion program at a reasonable price. </p><p>  The most popular excursions to the Valley of the Pyramids, as well as to Israel, the cradle of the Christian faith. </p><h2>  Catering </h2><p>  A wide range of food features four-star hotels in Sharm El Sheikh.  Reviews of tourists indicate that it is established no worse than in Turkish five-star hotels. </p><p>  2 restaurants of the Tropicana Azure 4 * hotel operate on the principle of "buffet" and provide basic food at a high level.  Even from the outside, it is noticeable that when catering, both the cook and the leadership act as a single team.  Surprising professionalism and versatility of cooks.  Every day, the restaurant is dedicated to a particular national cuisine.  The dishes corresponding to this kitchen are prepared, and the serving waiters are dressed in national clothes.  This brings a sense of novelty and freshness to the service. </p><p>  The other two Sharm el-Sheikh 4 * restaurants we are considering are working by appointment: Chinese and Italian also serve hotel guests using the all incusive system (i.e., at no extra charge).  It is enough to sign up for services in them in advance.  Agree, this is rare, and for four-star hotels this is a unique experience. </p><h2>  Dishes and cuisine </h2>

For lunch and dinner there is always an assortment of meat and fish dishes.  However (and this, obviously, is a sign of a four-star hotel) all types of meat and fish are not cooked daily.  However, throughout the week they are all on the menu.  From time to time, seafood dishes are prepared for guests.  For breakfast, guests can enjoy a selection of delicious chicken and beef sausages and sausages.

    <p>  Local chefs cook lamb, veal, duck, chicken in a proprietary way.  Note that many (and this is rare) cooked chicken like even more than beef. </p><p>  And for breakfast, lunch and dinner, there are many salads and vegetable dishes, as well as a wide variety of pastries: cakes, cakes, tartlets (at least you can‚Äôt try it all physically). </p><p>  Even the most persistent guests of the hotel, who at home adamantly follow a diet, cannot refuse truly wonderful pastries and sweets. </p><p>  There are a lot of fruits in the hotel guests ‚Äôdiet; oranges, bananas, grapes, pomegranates, grapefruits, guava, melon, dates are always present. </p><p>  For guests who prefer restaurants by appointment to buffet restaurants, the Tropicana Club Azure 4 has also prepared its own chips.  The Italian restaurant has excellent pizza.  This is recognized even by the gourmets of this dish from Italy, guests at the hotel.  A Chinese restaurant is worth a visit because of the Peking duck, seafood, rolls. </p><p>  Of the free alcoholic drinks (we mean those offered by the <span>all inclusive</span> system <span>):</span> vodka, beer, three types of wine, gin, and tonic.  However, sometimes the beach bar refuses guests with alcohol.  The bar located in the lobby - the hotel zone - works around the clock, but according to the all inclusive system - from 10 <sup>00</sup> to 24 <sup>00</sup> .  Bars operating on the beach and pool - from 10 <sup>00</sup> - to 17 <sup>00</sup> . </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p> Should I visit the Land of the Pharaohs?  Of course.  The resort business of this country offers truly competitive services in the global market.  Egyptian hotels are attractive for tourists with fairly affordable prices and quality services.  At the same time, staying at Tropicana Azure Club 4 *, tourists will be able to get a guaranteed high level of service at reasonably reasonable prices. </p><p>  However, on the road, it is advisable to take into account climatic features.  This will prevent possible disappointments.  It is best to go on a voyage during the local velvet season - from October to November.  At this time, the sun's heat is optimally compensated by a cool gentle breeze.  Relaxing on the beach and pool at this time is most comfortable. </p><p>  Of course, you should focus on getting impressions of the nature of the Red Sea.  Naturally, you need to visit the Valley of the Pyramids and go on an excursion to Israel. </p>
