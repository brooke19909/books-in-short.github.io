    <p>  Near the pool in the hotel is equipped with a small relaxation area with sunbeds, but without umbrellas and a solarium. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Checkin Garbi 3 * (Costa Brava, Calella) is located on the coast.  You can get to the coast by crossing, since the complex separates the road from the sea. </p><p>  The hotel does not have its own plot on the coast, like any other hotel complex in Europe.  However, guests can use the nearest municipal beach equipped with umbrellas and sunbeds. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  Calella is a resort and municipality in Spain, part of the Maresme region of the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.  The city is quite democratic and perfectly suits completely different categories of tourists.  A huge number of modern hotels, <span>restaurants, cafes,</span> shops have been built here.  The developed infrastructure gives vacationers the opportunity to actively have fun and engage in water sports, ride on yachts and take part in other resort activities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="checkin garbi 3 calella" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1546880.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Calella for a reason has gained popularity among tourists.  Its gorgeous beaches with golden sand and clear water regularly receive the Blue Flag for cleanliness and amenities, which is a high indicator. </p><p>  Calella dates back to the first century BC.  Already at that time there was a village that had an agricultural focus.  Calella acquired the status of the city only in 1925, and until that time it was simply considered a fishing village.  Tourism here began to develop only in the second half of the twentieth century.  And now Calella has the status of a famous resort, attracting many tourists every year. </p><p>  Calella is located in a zone of wonderful climate (Mediterranean tropical) with warm summers and cold winters.  In summer, the average temperature is +28 degrees, and in winter it almost never drops below +15 degrees.  The season at the resort lasts from April to October. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel? </h2><p>  Hotel Checkin Garbi 3 * has a good location, making it easy to get to.  There are regular flights from Russia to Barcelona.  And during the peak season, many charters are added.  From Barcelona to Calella is very easy to get, a comfortable train will take you to the resort in just an hour.  A ticket for an adult will cost you only 6-8 EUR, and for a child - 4-6 EUR.  The train station is located near the hotel.  Therefore, tourists may not arrange a transfer at the hotel, but will get to their destination on their own. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="checkin garbi 3 spain calella" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1546884.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Resting in Calella, you will certainly want to see Spain.  For independent travel, it is best to rent a car.  However, you should know that for this you will need international rights and, of course, a passport (to confirm your age).  The cost of renting a car is very different, but on average it is about thirty dollars a day.  By the way, you can rent a car right at the airport.  Such a service is very common in Europe. </p><h2>  Resort beaches </h2><p>  Calella attracts tourists with its stunning beaches.  The sandy coast from the embankment is limited by a beautiful shady walking alley that stretches along the entire city (more than three kilometers), and then goes into a rocky, picturesque stretch of the coast.  Local landscapes are secluded coves with sharp cliffs.  The coastline is very similar to the scenery of the Costa Brava. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="checkin garbi 3 reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1546886.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The beaches of Calella are beautiful and clean.  Moreover, the coast is far from one beach.  There are a sufficient number of them.  The largest is the central one, but it is always crowded with people.  Therefore, in search of a more peaceful place, you can walk in the direction of Sant Polu, where there are very sparsely populated bays.  But with all this, the entire coast is landscaped. </p><h2>  Checkin Garbi 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking of the complex, I certainly want to discuss the reviews of tourists who rested in it.  Why is the hotel Checkin Garbi 3 * good?  Reviews of tourists about this hotel are very positive, although, of course, there are some nuances that we want to discuss. </p><p>  According to guests, the hotel has a great location and is located on the first line.  It would seem, what else can you dream of at a seaside resort?  Indeed, the complex was built near the sea, and therefore to the beach go no more than two minutes.  But such a close location to the embankment has its negative aspects.  There is a nightclub near the hotel, where music rattles until the morning, and European youth after the disco behaves quite noisily.  All this prevents tourists from resting at night.  It is impossible to sleep with an open door to the sounds of the surf, but closed windows and doors do not contain much noise. </p><p>  The rest of the hotel is quite decent.  Rooms overlooking the coast have stunning sea views.  Although the hotel is not new, it is in good condition.  Maids clean the apartments very carefully daily.  There are never any problems with the replacement of towels and bed linen, they are changed according to the schedule.  The maids are very friendly and always perform quality work. </p><p>  Although the hotel is positioning itself as multilingual, few staff speak English (just a few), but they don‚Äôt know Russian at all.  There is only one maid who understands our speech.  Therefore, sometimes it is problematic to explain something.  As a rule, tourists switch to sign language. </p><p>  The food in the local restaurant is quite acceptable, daily guests are served with fish, poultry, pastries, and sometimes seafood.  The hotel has an elevator, but it does not reach the ground floor, where the restaurant is located, so it is not very convenient to walk with small children.  Guests are welcome to use the free Wi-Fi in the lobby area.  The hotel has a small pool at the entrance, but it has pretty cool water.  And the recreation area near it is equipped with sunbeds, but has no umbrellas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="checkin garbi 3 costa brava calella" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1546888.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The municipal beach near the complex is very clean and beautiful, sand is sifted daily in the morning.  Sunset at sea is gentle, but the depth begins rather quickly.  However, this does not stop the kids from splashing around. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  In the city, new beautiful neighborhoods are adjacent to the old streets.  There is something to see here.  Local excursion programs necessarily include a visit to the ancient Iglesia de Santa Maria church (16-18 centuries), palaces and a park, which is a green array of tropical plants, which is a real oasis during the heat of the day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="checkin garbi 3 spain costa brava calella" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1546889.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In Calella you definitely need to walk, there are many hiking trails that cover the entire historical part of the city.  It is no less interesting to walk along the shady alley on the embankment, along which an incredible number of shops and cafes are located.  And late in the evening, numerous discos and night clubs begin to work here.  An incredible number of German youth come to rest in Calella.  However, the city is also known as a cultural center, as it hosts folklore, sports and other events.  They are of interest to spectators of all ages, so you can safely go to Calella on vacation with your whole family. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Checkin Garbi 3 * (Spain, Costa Brava, Calella) - this is a great place for a budget holiday in a beautiful resort of European level.  The hotel has a lot of advantages.  Tour operators offer trips to this complex at very attractive prices, so the small nuances in the form of extraneous noise from the street at night can in no way spoil the rest and the general impression of the complex, located on the very shore of the beautiful sea. </p>
