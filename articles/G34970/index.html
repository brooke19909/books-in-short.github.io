Tax authorities require that <span>financial documents</span> be protected from the possibility of loss and forgery.  Documents, such as balance sheets and journal orders, do not have such requirements, since they are, in fact, secondary. </p><p>  But the primary documentation must necessarily undergo a bonding procedure.  Be sure to flash the cash book and income book.  But how to stitch a book if the law does not prescribe the rules? </p><p>  A cash book is considered to be a significant tool in the field of cash flow management, so it must be kept within strict discipline.  The cash book is compiled in a single copy, and it should be at all enterprises, as well as at individual entrepreneurs, if they work with cash. </p><h2>  General Cash Book Maintenance Issues </h2><p>  If the company has several divisions, then the originals of cash books are stored at the place of work with cash.  Only the primary documents are provided to the head unit.

Order numbers begin annually with a unit.  End-to-end numbering is used.  The responsible person must print the sheets in duplicate - for the cashier‚Äôs report and the cash book.  Each sheet must be numbered. </p>

    <p>  It is necessary to fold all the sheets in order, attach the properly executed title on top and pick up: </p><ul><li>  a needle; </li><li>  awl; </li><li>  hole puncher. </li></ul><p>  Which tool to use depends on the thickness of the bundle being fastened.  Threads are used harsh.  If they are not strong enough, then the book may crumble. </p><h2>  How many holes do you need? </h2><p>  As to how many holes to make in a book, there are different opinions.  In principle, if you are not sure that the brochure will be reliable, you can pierce 5 holes.  But it is not forbidden to make 3 holes.  Many organizations get by with two holes made by a hole punch.  However, such a design makes it possible to easily replace the sheets in the book, so it does not meet the enthusiasm of the inspectors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  So, the sheets need to be folded in an even pile so that the book has an ordered look.  Holes are made on the left side vertically.  Then a thread or twine is stretched into the holes twice so that the tips are on the wrong side.  A sample of how to sew a cash book can be seen in the photo above.  The ends of the threads are tied with a strong knot several times so that everything is held securely. </p><h2>  How to staple what is stitched </h2><p>  In Word or any other equivalent, a sticker is created on the wrong side of the book.  The content of the sticker should be as follows: "in a pack, numbered, laced, fixed with the signature and seal of _____ sheets."  The line below describes the transcript of the position and signature of the authorized person and chief accountant. </p><p>  The sticker should not be too big or small.  Its size should be enough to close the knots and part of the threads.  The ends of the threads stick out a little from under the sticker.  It is advisable to use good <span>stationery glue</span> so that it is difficult to change the label.  After the number of sheets and the signature of the authorized person are affixed to the sticker, a seal is placed on top so that part of the print is on the book and on the sticker. </p>

    <p>  How to sew a cash book if it is not maintained in the accounting program?  The procedure will be the same, only you have to independently number each sheet by hand and fill out the title.  When you need to sew a cashier's report, you need to remember that not only the sheet with the turnover at the cash register is numbered, but also all orders with applications. </p><h2>  If the book is kept manually </h2><p>  If the cash book is maintained without the help of a computer, then a typical magazine is bought for these purposes.  The question of how to sew a book that is filled in manually does not arise, since the magazine is already flashed.  All sheets are numbered and sealed at the beginning of the book.  Inside the magazine are a tabbed sheet and a cashier report.  Before starting the recording, the cashier‚Äôs report is opened and the records on it are duplicated from the carbon copy insert.  Of course, the cashier‚Äôs report will have to be flashed independently. </p>
