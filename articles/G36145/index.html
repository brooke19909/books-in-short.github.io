    <h2>  The main book of the scientist </h2><p>  From Maslow's work ‚ÄúMotivation and Personality,‚Äù however, not only students and luminaries of psychology will draw information.  She will be interested in teachers, businessmen, sociologists.  In general, this work will attract anyone who asks the question of what lies at the basis of a person‚Äôs motivational-need sphere. </p><p>  This publication was released more than half a century ago.  But despite numerous concepts of motivation, it still retains its relevance.  Personal interest, questions that are haunting - these are the reasons why an American scientist of Russian origin Abraham Maslow took up writing this work.  Motivation and personality are the two main concepts he studies.  They are also displayed in the title of his book. </p><h2>  Maslow's childhood and youth </h2><p>  I must say that the childhood of Abraham Maslow was not at all cloudless.  The scientist's parents emigrated to the United States before his birth.  The family was constantly in conflict.  In addition, the boy inherited a Jewish appearance from his father, so he had to experience firsthand <span>what anti-Semitism is.</span>  <span>Despite the fact</span> that Maslow's academic success was very high, his youth passed in solitude and oppression. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Acquaintance with psychological knowledge </h2><p>  Subsequently, Maslow, on the recommendation of his father, decides to devote himself to the study of jurisprudence.  But, having become acquainted with psychology, leaves already from the first course.  He was educated at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, and then began working as a teacher in college.  He also worked as an assistant with the renowned behavioral scientist Edward Thorndike.  He was promoted to president of the American Psychological Association in 1967.  Maslow was very encouraged by the work of <span>John Watson.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Basic concept </h2><p>  Maslow‚Äôs book ‚ÄúMotivation and Personality‚Äù examines the structure of needs, their basic properties, and the impact on the motivational sphere of a person.  <span>Maslow's pyramid</span> consists of blocks, each of which reflects a specific need - from basic to higher.  This model is very easy to explain with an example.  The <span>basic human needs</span> are physiological needs such as hunger and thirst.  Experiencing them, hardly anyone will think, for example, about the philosophy of postmodernism.  Therefore, in the first place, the vital needs of the body must be satisfied. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Then follows the need for security - both physical and emotional.  It is important to have a roof over your head, to live without a threat to existence. </p>

    <p>  When these needs are met, a person begins to seek satisfaction of the needs of a higher class - social recognition, sympathy.  The need for friendship is followed by the need for self-esteem, that is, a person now wants autonomy and leadership. </p><p>  The pinnacle of the Maslow pyramid is the need for self-actualization.  When all other needs are satisfied, a person can begin to freely realize the potential inherent in him. </p><p>  So, at every point in time, unmet needs control the behavior.  And more often than not, they are never completely satisfied.  That is why people who have reached the level of self-actualization in their lives are about 2%, as stated in Maslow‚Äôs book ‚ÄúMotivation and Personality‚Äù. </p><h2>  What is the difference between Maslow's theory? </h2><p>  Practicality and realism - these are the main qualities that the <span>theory of personality</span> and motivation possesses.  A. Maslow, initially carried away by the ideas of behaviorism, then comes to the conclusion: these concepts are well reproduced in the laboratory, but have little to do with a person‚Äôs real life style, his philosophy. </p><h2>  The main problem of psychology </h2><p>  In general, it should be noted: the gap between theory and practice is the main problem of psychological science.  Unfortunately, for those people who turn to psychologists for help, no one opens the curtain.  And no one can answer them the question of whether this or that specialist will be able to provide assistance. </p>

    <h2>  The separation of psychology from reality: an example </h2><p>  One of the main qualities of a good psychologist, as well as a serious psychological theory, is practicability in order to help people.  This directly relates to Maslow's theory.  This example is well illustrated by the reviews of people who turn for help to psychotherapists of various categories on the treatment of addictions: alcoholism, gambling, smoking.  Many psychotherapists use a substitution technique to get rid of such difficulties, according to which one addiction can only be replaced by another - in this case, more productive.  Bypassing one or two steps of the Maslow pyramid, they recommend that their patients replace addiction, starting to engage in self-realization.  For some reason, the unmet needs of the lower level still make themselves felt: a former alcoholic or casanova is very poorly able to ‚Äúreplace‚Äù their dependence with other activities, say, beadwork.  And how can an addict understand exactly what business will take a place at the top of his needs until his needs for love, respect, sympathy, friendship, warm emotional ties with people are satisfied? </p><p>  People are disappointed in psychotherapy, giving a lot of money for it.  The picture would be different if all psychologists used Maslow's work ‚ÄúMotivation and Personality‚Äù in their work.  Reviews, one must assume, would become much better both about psychologists and about the possibilities of psychotherapy in general. </p>

    <h2>  Maslow's book Motivation and Personality Summary </h2><p>  The first part of the book is devoted to the study of the essence of needs, how their satisfaction affects the development of a person, the formation of his character, and the concept of instincts is once again reviewed.  Maslow says that this construct is applicable to humans to a small extent.  Despite the fact that instincts are the basis for all his actions, genes and the environment also influence the behavior to a large extent. </p><p>  The next part discusses the concept of mental health, the role of frustration in meeting needs, the question of the acceptability of aggressive behavior.  Maslow says that a positive attitude will almost neutralize aggression: therefore, it is always necessary to consider environmental conditions when considering any type of behavior, including destructive behavior. </p><p>  Next, Maslow considers the actual self-actualizing people, the features of their character.  In addition, the third part focuses on issues of love, as well as creativity and its manifestations. </p><p>  The last part of Maslow‚Äôs book ‚ÄúMotivation and Personality‚Äù examines the role of creativity in science, methodological issues, and the importance of a holistic approach. </p><p>  Maslow urges us to consider a person not only in the context of comparing the mentally healthy with the neurotic.  Anyone who is interested in issues of self-actualization can safely recommend the fundamental work that Abraham Maslow created - ‚ÄúMotivation and Personality‚Äù.  Feedback from numerous readers of more than one generation has shown: this work will help to reach the best heights and understand each person. </p>
