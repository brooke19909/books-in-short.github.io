    <h2>  Comfortable stay for guests </h2><p>  Hotel-park "Kulibin" is focused on the segment of business tourism, that is, on guests with high requirements for comfort and service.  It is relatively small, since the creators were primarily interested in status and comfort, and not in the number of rooms.  The hotel has 64 rooms of various categories.  Below we will take a closer look at each of them.  The hotel-park "Kulibin" opened relatively recently, only in June 2016.  This is the first five-star hotel in the city, next to which is the park of the same name. </p><h2>  Walking area </h2><p>  Many guests note that it was the proximity of this green massif that attracted their attention in the first place.  It is very convenient that you do not need to go anywhere, just leave the hotel and walk for your pleasure.  Kulibin Park is a landmark of the city, and he also gave a name to the hotel itself.  It is located between the streets of Gorky and Belinsky, on the site of an old cemetery.  The date of its foundation was 1940.  Since then, he, of course, has changed a lot, but the recognition of the townspeople has remained the same. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today the park is spread over 24 hectares, it is not just a walking area.  There is a small church, a night club, a bar and an entertainment center.  Shady alleys are equipped with benches and tables where you can play a game of chess.  The hotel-park "Kulibin" was not in vain founded here, as the park infrastructure completely solves the issue of leisure for guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Park hotel Kulibin Nizhny Novgorod" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1366202.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel-park "Kulibin": how to get there? </h2><p>  The easiest way is if you are taking a taxi, all drivers know this hotel well.  But what about those who travel by personal transport?

Maxim Gorky, 121, and this is the main street of the city.
