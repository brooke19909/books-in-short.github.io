  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Leningrad Oblast of St. Petersburg - surprisingly even a name</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The largest port of the country (more than 20% of all sea freight), the historical capital of the Russian Empire, the uniquely preserved city located on 42 islands, the cultural capital of Russia throughout its history, the industrial giant - this is how you can briefly describe the city located in Leningrad Region - St. Petersburg. </p><h2>  Geography </h2><p>  The European part of Russia - St. Petersburg and the adjacent region - is a border zone with Finland and Estonia on the west side, with the Vologda region in the east, in the north with Karelia, in the south with the Pskov and Novgorod regions. </p><p>  Water resources are also unique: the Gulf of Finland, giving access to the Baltic. </p><p>  The region of St. Petersburg is divided into 17 administrative districts, where there are 16 regional centers, 10 regional and 41 urban settlements.  But these figures are increasing every year in connection with the pace of construction that has not decreased during the crisis and the internal migration of the country's population. </p><p>  Throughout the territory of the region of St. Petersburg, although it is characterized by a temperate continental climate, it is severe.  With insignificant temperature differences during the season, quite often the winds increase to squally, which discourages those who want to move closer to Europe.  But there are significant and most beautiful natural resources, forests, rivers, lakes, minerals that will not end long, flora and fauna. </p><div class="photo" data-original="megaribolov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The majestic Lake Ladoga" class="if uuid-2246828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2246828.jpg"></div><p>  There are more than 1800 lakes alone, and Ladoga Lake is the largest in Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the region there are unique natural monuments numbering more than 30.  These are mainly exposed geological rocks, glacial ridges, etc. </p><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  Mechanical engineering, metalworking, power engineering, electrical engineering, radio engineering, machine tool building, shipbuilding, instrument making, light industry and woodworking.  The list can be continued a little, but it is better to mention that the Leningrad region is an important agro-industrial region.  With emphasis on the first half of the word.  This is due to the needs of the nearest sales markets - European and St. Petersburg directly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="subseatech2014.smtu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg, port" class="if uuid-2246821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2246821.jpg"></div><p>  Here the level of salaries is lower than in Moscow and the Moscow region, but higher than in other regions.  The unemployment rate is quite high, possibly due to the popularity of alcoholic beverages among the indigenous population.  Indeed, in such dank weather, not everyone will want to work.  The average wage revolves around the figure of 26,000 rubles. </p><p>  But the crime rate in such a climate is falling uncontrollably.  This fact has a positive effect on the attractiveness of the region for foreign investment. </p><p>  In the Leningrad region there are 2 unique economic zones with tax and customs benefits, low rental rates, guaranteed access to highly qualified personnel and loyal management.  These are ‚ÄúNeudorf‚Äù in Strelna and ‚ÄúNovoorlovskaya‚Äù in the Primorsky region economic zones. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  For the North-West of Russia, the <span>Leningrad Region</span> and St. Petersburg are the largest <span>hub of transport</span> routes.  11 road and 12 railway tracks, 5 stations: </p><ul><li>  Finnish </li><li>  Ladoga; </li><li>  Moscow; </li><li>  Vitebsk; </li><li>  Baltic. </li></ul><p>  Air gate of the city: </p><ul><li>  Pulkovo-1 and Pulkovo-2; </li><li>  ‚ÄúBull Harbor‚Äù - a private airfield near Kronstadt; </li><li>  2 military airdromes - in the Levashov area and not far from Pushkin. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.aviateka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Air gates of the city" class="if uuid-2246827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2246827.jpg"></div><p>  Inland navigation (river) with ports of Leningradsky and Podporozhsky is actively working in navigation. </p><p>  You can come here and leave from here in many ways.  It would be a desire. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Well, talking about all the <span>interests of St. Petersburg</span> and the region is not enough space even on the Internet.  Not just palace ensembles (one Peterhof will take at least a week to visit), even villages are unique here.  History was made literally on every centimeter of the earth. </p><p>  From time immemorial, well-known figures of literature and arts, the color of the Russian nobility and many other crooks and geniuses have sought to settle in the region of St. Petersburg and in the city itself. </p><p>  Representatives of the imperial family lived here, and, of course, a financial magnet attracted everyone.  It was believed that there was more money in the capital.  But it was an illusion.  And thanks in many respects to the exaltation of the so-called color of the nation of past centuries, in 2017 in Russia St. Petersburg and the region adjacent to it were recognized as a tourist Mecca.  Many dream of being here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nesiditsa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vyborg, historical center" class="if uuid-2246824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2246824.jpg"></div><p>  The natural uniqueness of both the Leningrad Region and St. Petersburg is white nights.  The phenomenon is due to the high latitude position of the city and its environs.  The name of the phenomenon of nature is rather arbitrary, since it is rather twilight turning into dawn, and indeed the duration is actually somewhat longer. </p><p>  The unique period of white nights really lasts 2 months and 19 days - from May 12 to July 31.  Instead of officially announced from June 11 to July 2. </p><p>  Tikhvin, Sosnovy Bor, Vyborg, Sestroretsk, Petrodvorets, Lomonosov, Kolpino, Kronshtadt, Sertolovo, Kingisepp, Vsevolozhsk, Pushkin, Pavlovsk, Gatchina - it's just worth a trip and look at the amazing places of these cities of the Leningrad region. </p>
