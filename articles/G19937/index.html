    <p>  An industrial revolution is the transformation of manufactory, due to manual labor, into factory production.  The process is based on the widespread use of machines.  <span>The industrial revolution</span> in Russia began in the 19th century, in the 30s-40s, and ended in the 80s of the same century. </p><p>  The industrial transition began with those industries in which manual labor was most common.  The first was the cotton industry.  Machines began to be introduced in paper, cloth and other production.  Machine-building enterprises in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and other cities also began to be created. </p><p>  The industrial revolution in Russia at the first stage was characterized by the active development of transport, railway and shipping, first of all.  In 1837, the first railway was created.  She connected Tsarskoye Selo and Petersburg.  And in 1851, rails were laid between St. Petersburg and Moscow. </p><p>  The industrial transition in the country began later than in the European countries, more developed economically.  So, for example, in England already in the sixties of the 18th century the first factories began to be created. </p><p>  The industrial revolution in Russia began in the conditions of a feudal economy.  This, of course, had a very negative impact on the pace and geography of the industrial transition.  As a result, industrial enterprises are rather unevenly distributed throughout the country. </p><p>  The industrial revolution in Russia at its very beginning was also characterized by some slowdowns in the creation of large capital.  Being from serfs, many entrepreneurs were not endowed with legal rights.  In this regard, they could not own factories, remaining dependent on the power of the landowners. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The industrial transition in Russia did not contribute to the development of new classes - the industrial proletariat and the bourgeoisie.  This was due to the preservation of the economic feudal system.  Workers in factories and factories were peasant migrants.  In this regard, the composition of the workers at the enterprises was not constant, and the workers themselves had a rather low level of qualification. </p><p>  The second <span>industrial revolution</span> began at the turn of the seventies and eighties of the 19th century.  At this moment, more than half of all industrial goods were produced by enterprises that were equipped with equipment and <span>steam engines,</span> which powered this equipment. </p><p>  The industrial transition affected (except for the cotton, paper and beet sugar industries) the metalworking and mining, cloth and textile, machine-building and woolen industries.  At this point, factory production prevailed over artisanal and manufactory. </p><p>  The industrial revolution in the second stage had its own characteristics.  The transition continued under the new conditions: <span>serfdom</span> was abolished <span>,</span> <span>peasant reform was</span> carried out <span>.</span>  All these transformations removed many obstacles to the formation of the capitalist system in the state. </p><p>  In addition, new industrial sectors began to form: petrochemical, engineering, chemical and others. </p><p>  The industrial transition led to the emergence of regions (Baku, Krivorozhye, Donbass), free from the traditions of serfdom and rapidly developing in the new socio-economic and technical conditions. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, the industrial revolution had important social results.  New classes began to form.  After the reforms, the industrial bourgeoisie began to replenish immigrants from officials, peasants, merchants, and nobles. </p><p>  The working class was also actively forming.  At the same time, the proletariat continued to be in a difficult position.  Working conditions were unsatisfactory, the working day was very long, lawlessness reigned, there was no labor legislation, medical insurance.  As a result, in the eighties and nineties, the first workers rallies took place (for example, the Morozov strike in 1885). </p>
