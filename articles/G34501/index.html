This city in Central Vietnam is suitable for various categories of vacationers: families with children, romantic couples of lovers, noisy youth, and surfer athletes.  Accordingly, hotels in Nha Trang exist for every taste, budget and solvency. </p><p>  There are luxurious fives and budget hostels here.  But it‚Äôs better, tourists say, to choose a middle ground, that is, a four-star hotel.  Some of these hotels are not inferior to the "five" in terms of quality of service, and accommodation in them is more democratic.  One of the hotels of this category is the Legend Sea Hotel Nha Trang 4 *.  In this article you will find the most detailed description of this hotel, based not on advertising brochures, but on real reviews of guests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Legend Sea Hotel Nha Trang 4 * (Vietnam)" class="if uuid-3224450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3224450.jpg"></div><h2>  Is it possible to go to Nha Trang in the month of March? </h2><p>  Vietnam stretches a long and narrow strip from north to south along the Pacific coast.  Therefore, despite the small area, the country's territory is divided into three climatic zones.  Vietnam in March is still ongoing cold rains in the north (in the vicinity of Hanoi) and the end of the high tourist season on the southern tropical island of Phu Quoc.  And what is the weather like in the first month of spring in Nha Trang? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Due to its central location, the resort is experiencing the most favorable period in March.  Downpours, and even short ones lasting from 10 minutes to an hour, will overshadow your vacation at most once or twice.  But also there is no suffocating heat, as in the summer.  The temperature during the day is the most pleasant: +28 degrees.  And nights are not cold either (+ 24-25 ¬∞ ).  The wind still raises high waves in the first decade of March, but at the end of the month the water element calms down.  In any case, due to the indented coast in Nha Trang, you can always find a beach where there is no storm.  In this case, the leeward side of the island is ideal.  All tourists say: in March it‚Äôs worth going to Nha Trang.  The weather will not let you down. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.vietnam-guide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vietnam in March" class="if uuid-3224475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3224475.jpg"></div><p>  If you evaluate the hotel on a ten-point scale, then all tourists gave 10 points to the location of the Legend Sea Hotel.  Entertainment resort located within walking distance.  Right at the gates of the hotel is the No. 4 bus stop, which takes you to the Wharper Wharf.  Around the hotel building there are many cafes and shops.  There is also a pharmacy, and currency exchange, and numerous excursion bureaus. </p><p>  The hotel is not on the first line, but from the rooms facing the coast, the ocean is clearly visible.  This is the very center of the city, but the hotel is located on a fairly quiet street.  So the hotel is suitable for all tourists without exception: families with young children, and those who wish to be in the epicenter of Nha Trang nightlife.  Camran International Airport is 35 kilometers away. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.235528" data-lng="109.19547699999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/6/2/3/17623.png"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Legend Sea Hotel opened its doors to its first guests in February 2015.  This is a very new, stylish, modern building of 20 floors.  Since the hotel is urban, its territory is small.  Many tourists say that because of this the hotel has only 4 stars, because in other respects (rooms, food, service) it "pulls" to a full "five". </p><p>  The triangular building is located on the corner of two streets.  Therefore, the only thing that a hotel can afford from the territory is a small flowerbed in front of the entrance.  But the restaurant and pool are located on the roof.  This circumstance is very popular with guests.  It is nice to swim or drink coffee and at the same time overlook the ocean and the city from a bird's eye view.  The pool is highlighted in the evening, which makes it a great backdrop for a photo.  Tourists notice several elevators in the building, so getting to your floor is not a problem. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.legendseahotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Legend Sea Hotel - Lobby" class="if uuid-3224462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3224462.jpg"></div><h2>  Legend Sea Hotel: room description </h2><p>  In a high-rise building, guest rooms are located starting on the 4th floor.  The rooms are divided into categories: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  superior </li><li>  deluxe </li><li>  prime minister </li><li>  Suite </li><li>  luxury. </li></ul><p>  Inside each category there is also a division according to the view from the window (with a view of the ocean they are more expensive).  Several rooms have all facilities for people with disabilities.  Tourists say that if the hotel is not full enough, they can give you a room of a higher category than the one you paid for.  But in principle, superior, deluxe and premieres are not much different, except that the last two have more area, panoramic views and a huge balcony.  Suites and suites include additional services for guests. </p><p>  What do tourists say about the rooms in the Sea Legend?  Everyone remembered parquet floors and floor-to-ceiling windows.  All rooms have balconies.  Surprisingly for the Quartet, but guests are offered bathrobes and slippers.  A pleasant surprise is the presence of a kettle and replenished bags with drinks.  The beds in the bedrooms are large and comfortable.  The rest of the rooms have a standard 4 * hotel set of amenities: TV, air conditioning, minibar, safe, hairdryer, toiletries, drinking water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Legend Sea Hotel: room description" class="if uuid-3224445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3224445.jpg"></div><h2>  Breakfast </h2><p>  The concept of food in the hotel Legend Sea Hotel - BB.  But you need to see these breakfasts!  The Vietnamese love to eat soup in the morning and generally recharge with calories until the evening.  Therefore, breakfast includes such unusual dishes for a morning meal as stewed duck, fried pork and beef, potatoes, and hot vegetable dishes.  You can try pho soup - a visiting card of Vietnamese cuisine.  Breakfast cannot be called very diverse, but something is constantly changing - either pancakes instead of pancakes, then noodles instead of potatoes. </p><p>  Constantly on the tables there are at least three types of fruits, many vegetables.  Breakfast time suits everyone - feed at the Sirena restaurant starts at 6:30.  Tourists who intended to go on an excursion managed to eat before departure.  Whenever you come for breakfast, always the same assortment of dishes, and everything is enough. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Legend Sea Hotel Nha Trang" class="if uuid-3224448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3224448.jpg"></div><h2>  Where tourists ate throughout the day </h2><p>  The rooftop Legend Sea Hotel, by the pool, has a bar.  There you can order not only drinks, but also light dishes.  There is also a bar-cafeteria in the lobby, where tourists are assured that they serve delicious desserts.  But mostly guests ate outside the hotel.  Immediately near the hotel there is a cafe "Ali Baba."  They feed delicious homemade dishes, the portions are huge, prices are low. </p><p>  Nostalgic for their homeland should visit the restaurant "Moscow".  It is located on a parallel street, a five minute walk.  Not far from "Moscow" is another restaurant - "Armenia", with Caucasian cuisine.  Near the hotel there is a fruit market.  March is the season of mango and papaya!  There are also many Vietnamese cafes and inexpensive eateries in the hotel area and on the beach.  So you will definitely not stay hungry in Nha Trang. </p><h2>  Legend Sea Hotel: beach, sea, pool </h2><p>  Hotel "Legend of the Sea", although it is not on the first line, it‚Äôs five minutes to walk from it to the embankment at a slow pace.  You just need to pass a small shady street where the silk museum is located.  The beach does not belong to the hotel, but admission to it is free.  Money are only sunbeds and umbrellas.  If there is no excitement, then the water in the sea is clean.  A storm on the sandy shore raises turbidity and causes various debris.  But the servants immediately clean it. </p><p>  Some areas of the beach have showers and toilets.  Most of the tourists who rested in March went to the sea only in the morning and in the evening, since it becomes very hot at noon.  The guests spent their days near the pool.  It is located on the roof, clean and very beautiful.  Sun beds by the pool are free.  Beach towels are provided at the door of the hotel and at the exit to the roof.  They can be changed during the day as much as you want. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.legendseahotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Legend Sea Hotel - Beach" class="if uuid-3224464" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3224464.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel Facilities </h2><p>  All tourists agree that the service at Legend Sea Hotel is at the highest level.  They clean the rooms twice - in the morning and prepare the bed for bed.  And not just like that - they wiped it in the middle and spread the veil, but very carefully.  Bed linens of the highest quality, new and clean towels, bath, white, beach, blue.  If you book this hotel in advance, you can indicate which diet you follow (vegetarian, lactose-free and so on), and for you breakfast will be prepared with separate dishes. </p><p>  Travelers with a small child will be put in a cradle in their room, and a high chair for feeding the baby will be provided in the restaurant.  The hotel has a small spa area consisting of a sauna, hammam and massage services.  Smiling and helpful staff is trying to help you with everything.  At the reception staff speak excellent English.  Unfortunately (and maybe, for someone, fortunately) there are few Russian tourists here, so a language barrier may arise.  The hotel has a laundry service.  Free Wi-Fi perfectly draws in all rooms of the hotel, and not just at the reception. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.qantas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Legend Sea Hotel Nha Trang - service" class="if uuid-3224473" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3224473.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Tourists urge you to actively travel around the city and its environs.  Moreover, Legend Sea Hotel is located in the very center of Nha Trang.  You can go on some excursions on your own.  For example, it is worth visiting the entertainment island of Winperl, the hot springs of Baho, the mud bath Thap Ba, the waterfalls of Young Bay.  Around the hotel there are many excursion bureaus.  Their staff will organize a trip to you both to the excellent beaches of Kamran, Zoklet, to the North or South Islands, as well as longer trips.  Many praise for excursions to the mountain resort of Dalat.  If you are not pressured and want to get acquainted with the sights of all of Vietnam, then tourists recommend that you go to Ho Chi Minh City, to the capital of Hanoi and to the most beautiful bay on the planet - Halong. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  All guests were pleased with their stay at Legend Sea Hotel.  In the reviews they praise the good soundproofing of the rooms, comfortable beds, quality of cleaning.  Many liked the rooftop pool - it does not smell like bleach, and there are always few people around it.  For the location of the hotel tourists rated it the highest.  Everything is within walking distance, there are many objects of urban infrastructure around (market, cafes, shops, public transport stops). </p><p>  But at the same time, tourists noted cons.  The shower cubicle in the bathroom does not have a door, so water splashes on the floor.  During the arrival of Chinese groups in the restaurant hall becomes crowded.  But for many tourists, these little things did not spoil the rest.  Travelers admit that they would love to come to the Legend of the Sea hotel again. </p>
