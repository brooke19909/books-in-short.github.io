Costa Blanca Province as it is</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you want to look at the real Spain without the tourist luster, as well as a good and budget stay in a hotel, swim in the clear sea and have the opportunity to explore Valencia, then Denia is exactly the place that suits you.  This small town is located a hundred kilometers from Alicante.  To Valencia, almost the same.  But cheap trains are what Spain boasts.  Denia is a great place to explore Valencia, especially since it takes about an hour to go there for little money.  In this regard, the most traveling European nations - the Germans and the British - bought almost all of the living space in these places.  And from here cheap ferries to Mallorca go. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain denia" class="if" height="207" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/264751.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Spain, Denia.</strong>  <strong>What's interesting here</strong> </p><p>  Firstly, it is quiet and calm, and also at your service is a huge clean twenty-kilometer beach (sandy).  You can take a walk along the promenade slowly, admiring the palm trees and breathing the sea air.  And if it becomes boring in this cozy province, we recall that the cheerful and noisy Valencia is only an hour away. </p><p>  Secondly, there is excellent cuisine.  These places argue with other Spanish territories for the right to be called the homeland of paella.  They love this local kind of pilaf so much that they even organize festivities in his honor - which quarter will make a huge portion better and treat everyone to it.  Of course, all of Spain can boast of such festivals.  D√©nia is no exception.  But back to the interesting places.  It is a pleasure to walk around this former "Saracen city."  After all, there are preserved buildings built back in the days of Arab rule. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain city of denia" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/264754.jpg" width="420"></div>

This, of course, the Toy Museum is the attraction that is closest to the train station.  It is worth visiting the city churches - especially the Church of the Assumption.  They conquer not so much with their antiquity as with the typical Spanish Baroque with his love of suffering and sophistication.  The city hall is very beautiful, which even boasts inscriptions from ancient Roman times.  But the most important thing is Castello, the former castle (now the Museum of Archeology).  Like almost all of Spain, Denia was an ancient Roman territory in the era of antiquity.  However, the castle was built by the Arabs, and still in its architecture you can see the remains of the eastern bliss.  Notes of luxury and wealth added the Renaissance.  Especially characteristic in this regard is the Red Tower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Denia Spain Attractions" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/264762.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <strong>And of course, fish</strong> </p><p>  Two more smells reign supreme over this city buried in verdure.  These are fish and citrus fruits.  Someone will say that this is an unacceptable mixture, but this is the Mediterranean, Spain.  The city of Denia attracts gourmets from around the world with its fish exchange.  Here they sell seafood all year round - huge red shrimp, squid, octopus.  And the sale of fish turns into an auction with its own rules, excitement and passions.  After all, the Costa Blanca - ‚ÄúWhite Coast‚Äù - is famous for its seafood, and ships come here every day to replenish the kitchens of restaurants with fresh precious catch.  And every evening the breathtaking aroma of grilled fish and grilled seafood blows over taverns.  This is how they live here. </p>
