In addition, rest can serve as an incentive for the child - to become more obedient and go again to where he liked to spend his holidays.  Trying to decide on a health institution for their child, adults carefully study information about living conditions, food and safety.  That is why they most often get tickets to the Atlantus camp. </p><h2>  How to get to the camp, where is </h2><p>  The territory of the children's recreation facility is located in the resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Crimean peninsula, on the first line of the southwestern coast of the Black Sea, in the village of Orlovka, which is only 20 kilometers from Sevastopol. </p>

    <p>  The Atlantus camp also has a large number of pavilions for hobby groups, an extensive library fund, a professional stage for various events and a place for discos.  On the territory of the institution, children can use wireless Internet networks (Wi-Fi) for free, there is a payphone and a luggage room. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the Atlantus camp in the Crimea occupies more than two hectares of land and makes a pleasant impression of clipped lawns and fragrant flower beds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Accommodation for children and youth, relaxation on the beach </h2><p>  Employees of the institution, first of all, care about safety and comfort, creating the best amenities for children.  So, upon arrival, young people are resettled in one-story stone buildings for 4 or 5 places.  The rooms have separate sleeping places with individual bedside tables, modern chairs, tables, hangers, as well as a combined bathroom with a hanging shower, a mirror, a washbasin and a toilet.  Upon check-in, each child is given a set of bed linen (with a pillow, blanket and coverlet), 2 towels (for legs and face) and a set of shower accessories (soap, paper, etc.).  Children can use basins for washing clothes and external dryers mounted on the wall at the entrance to the room. </p>

    <p>  The Atlantus camp boasts a modern renovation in the premises - it has the latest plumbing installed, tiles on the floor and walls (linoleum in bedrooms), double-glazed windows and shutters on the windows, plastic lining on the ceilings.  Also, all rooms, without exception, are equipped with a fire safety system. </p><p>  In addition, in Sevastopol, the Atlantus camp is one of the best because it has a very convenient access to the sea.  Vacationers can reach the wide, sandy, pebbled beach in 5-10 minutes, which is equipped with sun loungers, <span>shade canopies,</span> umbrellas, toilets, showers and changing rooms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Food in the camp </h2><p>  Even the most capricious young visitors will not complain about food, as the camp staff carefully thought out the menu, making it as useful and varied as possible.  All dishes are prepared by professional chefs with high quality, using fresh products supplied by licensed companies.  Children receive a full breakfast, set lunch, afternoon snack and dinner.  All vitamins are preserved due to the heat treatment of dishes in steam convection ovens. </p><p>  Each main meal necessarily includes yoghurts, fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, a variety of hot and cold drinks, and own baked goods.  Days of national cuisine and holidays of sweet tooth are also organized.  The guys come for the selected dishes to the distribution line of the dining room on their own, and the waiters, in turn, conduct timely cleaning from the surfaces. </p><h2>  Daily routine, activities and leisure </h2><p>  It‚Äôs not a secret to many parents who have previously sent their children to a wellness holiday that the Atlantus camp in Sevastopol is a new generation institution, as educators strive to motivate children to participate in various activities, rather than force them.  The unique program is specially designed so that everyone is busy with a busy daily routine.  The daily teamwork of the animators helps organize children with completely opposite interests and character sets.  Even the most leisurely and tired guys will enjoy spending their leisure time in creative workshops.  Everyone can take part in fun opening and closing ceremonies of the shift, modern beauty contests, exciting game quests, karaoke, etc. </p>

    <p>  Also in the camp, children can simulate and launch aircraft or swimming vehicles, issue newspapers, watch movies in the summer cinema, take part in fashion shows, quizzes and various competitions. </p><h2>  The camp always takes care of the safety of children </h2><p>  For employees of the institution, the safety of children is one of the most important priorities, so they do everything possible to ensure a safe stay in the complex.  So, the Atlantus camp is guarded by qualified specialists around the clock, and a rescue team on duty works on the beach.  Every year, SES employees issue a sanitary passport for the beach - the seabed is examined, water and sand are sent for laboratory analysis.  During bathing, all children are under the supervision of counselors, medical workers and rescue sailors.  The rest of the time, children are watched by adults and teaching staff.  Most counselors have many years of experience. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the camp has a fully equipped and equipped medical care center where children are received and the necessary assistance is provided. </p>

    <p>  There is also an insulator for 15 people.  Also, if necessary, an ambulance call is organized.  Medical staff examines vacationers daily. </p><h2>  What documents will be needed when entering the camp </h2><p>  Upon admission to the Atlantus camp, you must present a completed ticket form and a copy of the compulsory medical insurance policy (contract) (or enter its number in the medical certificate).  In addition, it is necessary to provide a certificate from doctors "For those leaving for the children's camp" (form 079U).  This document is issued in a clinic or educational institution and must be printed - it indicates the absence of contact of the child with infectious diseases.  Extradition is carried out no earlier than 5 days before departure to the camp.  The institution can be visited by children aged 7 to 17 years. </p><h2>  What is included in the price </h2><p>  The ticket price is always calculated separately for each person.  It includes accommodation, meals, the use of sports equipment, a library, recreational activities, a visit to the beach and two types of insurance (medical and accident insurance).  Also, boarding house employees can arrange a meeting and seeing off groups of non-resident tourists (from at least 30 people).  But the formation of additional soldering at check-out is carried out for an additional fee. </p><p>  It is also possible to order and pay for an excursion program in the historical center of Sevastopol.  The children will be introduced to the square of Admiral Nakhimov, the famous Count's Quay, from where a beautiful view of the bays opens, a monument to the Scuttled Ships, the Walk of Fame, Primorsky Boulevard and other objects related to the heroic past of the city.  It is possible to see the military-historical complex of Sevastopol. </p>

They are satisfied not only with eventful relaxation, but also with living conditions.  Many are impressed by the colorful views, well-groomed territories, an individual approach to each of the children and the good attitude of the staff. </p><p>  Parents note that the boarding house has a flexible system of arrivals - the customer can choose a convenient date and number of days of stay. </p>
