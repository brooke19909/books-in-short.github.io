  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pelvic organs women and men</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The pelvic organs are located in the anatomical space bounded by the bones of the pelvis, and include the ureter, bladder, rectum, prostate gland, seminal vesicle, vagina, uterus, and ovary. </p><p>  <strong>Rectum</strong> </p><p>  The pelvic organs of a woman and a man include this part of the colon, which is the terminal.  In it, digestion waste accumulates and is eliminated from the body.  In an adult, the <span>length of the rectum</span> is 15 centimeters, and the diameter is from two to eight centimeters.  Behind her is the coccyx and sacrum, in front of the pelvic organs: in the body of a woman - the bladder, vagina and uterus;  in a man, seminal vesicles with vials of vas deferens, prostate gland and bladder. </p><p>  In fact, the rectum is not such, it forms two bends in the sagittal plane, the first is the cross (corresponds to the configuration of the sacrum), the second is the perineal (located in front of the coccyx, bulge forward).  In the <span>frontal plane, the</span> bends of the rectum are unstable. </p><p>  <strong>Bladder</strong> </p><p>  It is located behind the pubic symphysis and the front surface also refers to it, being separated from it by loose fiber located in the space behind the pubis.  When it is filled, the tip of the bladder, in contact with the anterior abdominal wall, protrudes above the symphysis. </p><p>  For the most part, the organs of the small pelvis of a woman and a man are slightly different from each other according to their location in the space of the small pelvis.  This feature is well observed by the location of the bladder, in particular, its posterior surface: in women, it contacts the front walls of the vagina and uterus, while the bottom of the bladder in the body of the woman is in contact with the urogenital diaphragm.  In men - it is adjacent to the seminal vesicles and ampoules of the vas deferens, as well as to the rectum, the bottom is adjacent to the prostate gland.  The pelvic organs are adjacent to the bladder (its upper part): the woman has the uterus, the man has loops of the <span>small intestine.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The peritoneum, covering the bladder around, except for its lower part, also passes to the uterus in women and to the rectum in men.  It is connected to the navel by the median umbilical ligament, while its lower part is connected with the small pelvis by the ligaments: in women - pubic-vesical, in men - pubic-prostate. </p><p>  <strong>Female pelvic organs</strong> </p><p>  <strong>Ovary</strong> </p><p>  This female gonad is a paired organ.  In the ovaries, eggs mature and develop, female sex hormones form, which subsequently enter the lymph and blood.  The ovary has a pinkish color, ovoid, somewhat flattened in front.  The surface of the ovary passes into the convex posterior (free) edge.  In front, in the mesenteric margin, which is attached to the ovarian mesentery, where there is a grooved groove - the ovarian collar, through which the nerves and artery enter the ovary, and the lymph vessels with veins exit. </p><p>  Near each ovary there are rudimentary formations: vesicular pendants with an ovarian, appendage of the ovary, duct of the primary kidney and the remains of its tubules. </p><p>  <span>The ovarian appendage is</span> located among the leaves of the mesentery of the fallopian tube, laterally and behind the ovary.  It consists of a longitudinal duct of the appendage, as well as convoluted tubules flowing into it - transverse grooves (their blind ends are facing the gates of the ovary). </p><p>  The periosteum (appendage of the appendage) is a small formation that also lies in the mesentery of the fallopian tube, near the tube end of the ovary.  It consists of several blind tubules disconnected from each other. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <strong>Uterus</strong> </p><p>  The muscular, unpaired organ is pear-shaped, in the anteroposterior direction it is somewhat flattened.  It is located in the pelvic cavity, in its middle part, in front of the rectum, behind the bladder.  The uterus is usually distinguished into several parts: </p><ul><li>  the bottom of the uterus: the part of the uterus is convex in shape, protrudes just above the fall line of the fallopian tubes and passes into its body; </li><li>  uterine body: represented by the larger (middle) part of the organ, has the shape of a cone.  At the bottom it narrows and passes into the rounded part - the cervix.  The transition site itself narrows slightly and is called the isthmus of the uterus; </li><li>  cervix: its lower part extends into the vaginal cavity (vaginal part of the cervix), and the upper part lies above the vagina - the supravaginal part of the cervix, the uterine opening (uterine pharynx), which leads from the vagina to the cervix (its canal), is visible and has continued in her cavity. </li></ul><p>  <strong>Vagina</strong> </p><p>  The hollow unpaired organ extends from the genital gap to the uterus and has a tubular shape, slightly curved at the back (the longitudinal axis of the vagina forms an obtuse angle with the axis of the uterus, slightly more than 90 degrees).  The upper end originates from the cervix, then goes down, where its lower end opens with a hole in the vagina and passes through the urogenital diaphragm.  The vagina has a length of about ten centimeters, the wall thickness of about three millimeters. </p><p>  Since the organs of the small pelvis of women and men are located in a small volume, changes in the pathological nature may have some effect on the functions of neighboring organs of the small pelvis. </p><p>  <strong>Pelvic organs of a man</strong> </p><p>  <strong>Seminal vesicle</strong> </p><p>  This is a paired organ located behind and on the side of the bladder, from the vas deferens laterally, on top of the prostate gland.  It is a secretory authority.  There is an anterior (facing the bladder) and posterior (adjacent to the rectum) surface.  The length of this pelvic organ is approximately five centimeters, with a width of two and a thickness of one centimeter.  In the context, it looks like bubbles communicating with each other. </p><p>  The excretory duct is connected to the vas deferens, where they form the vas deferens.  Its length is about two centimeters, the width of the lumen at the beginning is one millimeter, at the urethra - 0.3 mm. </p><p>  <strong>Prostate</strong> </p><p>  Muscular-glandular unpaired organ.  In the process of life, it secretes a secret that is part of sperm.  It is located in the anterior lower part of the pelvis, on the genitourinary diaphragm, under the bladder.  Through it passes the initial section of the urethra (is the basis for it), as well as both vas deferens. </p><p>  In diameter it reaches four centimeters, the longitudinal size (upper-lower) is three centimeters, the thickness (anteroposterior size) is two centimeters.  The substance of its dense texture is grayish-red. </p>
