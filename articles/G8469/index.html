The clientele for this reason is very extensive.  Reviews about CJSC Nadezhda can be sorted into three approximately equal parts - two from customers, where there are both negative and positive, the third part - reviews of employees.

    <h2>  Statutory fund, ratings </h2><p>  Employees of CJSC Nadezhda leave reviews on the Internet, judging by the texts, most often mandatory as part of their work.  In particular, information about the company is given there, rather little is written about working conditions (except for those who quit), but a lot is written about activities and types of insurance services.  There you can find out, for example, that the authorized capital of the company is 103,000,000 rubles, therefore, reviews of CJSC Nadezhda note that the company is held among the 500 largest insurers in Russia.  Financially, this insurance company is quite stable, since the volume of insurance reserves is sufficient - 227 million rubles. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the insurance company, Russian rating agencies assigned Nadezhda CJSC a first-level rating, rather reliable - "BBB +".  This article will examine the geography of the presence of this company in Russia, and it is quite wide.  Its development began from a small regional organization with a residence permit in Krasnoyarsk, and after a while it grew into a large national insurer, represented in nine regions of the country.  Today there are eleven branches and almost eighty representative offices.  Reviews about CJSC Nadezhda Krasnoyarsk are mostly favorable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Krasnoyarsk </h2><p>  Already in the distant 1994, reviews of employees of Nadezhda CJSC noted the opening of a subsidiary of a medical focus, which began operating as an insurance medical institution under a state license for the provision of compulsory medical insurance (MHI) services.  In those days, its activities were limited only to the Krasnoyarsk Territory and the Republic of Khakassia (which, in principle, is already very much - the territories are simply vast).  For compulsory health insurance, reviews about the company NAO Nadezhda began to be received in large numbers almost immediately. </p><p>  And today MCO "Nadezhda" is the leading medical insurance institution in these territories, more than one and a half million people are insured.  Naturally, the huge amount of feedback received about the insurance company CJSC Nadezhda is due to the activities of the subsidiary.  Only one product receives more responses.  This is CTP.  The reviews of Nadezhda CJSC from employees indicate that, as the only local insurer, the company has more than twenty percent of the clientele in this region. </p>

    <h2>  Way to success </h2><p>  Very quickly, the company conquered insurance markets in increasingly distant territories.  But even now it‚Äôs still difficult to read reviews from Volgograd, Lipetsk and many other cities about the work of NAO Nadezhda, despite the fact that it is one of the leaders in retail sales of insurance products.  <span>In Volgograd, the</span> only office on Tkacheva street, house 30. We could not find reviews, apparently, the work with the employees is progressing successfully.  But quite a lot of writing in the southern regions, and a huge part of customer reviews for some reason negative. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The company strives to become not just popular, but rather - popular.  Its services can be obtained far beyond the borders of the Krasnoyarsk Territory, the republics of Tuva and Khakassia (although these territories are vast, they occupy almost half of the country's map).  Transbaikalia is already practically covered, and partly the Far East.  However, the presence of CJSC Nadezhda Lipetsk has not yet confirmed.  Reviews are not written in many other cities of the European part of Russia. </p><h2>  Credentials </h2><p>  CJSC "Nadezhda" has the right to provide insurance services of many types provided for by Law No. 4015-1 of 1992 of the Russian Federation.  This is insurance of people against illnesses and accidents, medical insurance.  This insurance covers all land transport (railway - a separate point), as well as air and water.  Insurance of various transported goods. </p><p>  Widely used is the type of agricultural insurance - crop, garden, forest, animals.  Property insurance of individuals and legal entities is very popular.  And of course, insurance for owners of vehicles, rail, air and water transport.  Also, organizations operating them can insure their hazardous industries.  Business and financial risks and much more are insured. </p>

    <h2>  Programs </h2><p>  The employees of this insurance organization are distinguished by collectivism, cohesion.  Corporate trips to the countryside, community work days, evenings of joint rest are often carried out.  For customers, this is also a good sign that this company can be trusted.  Even the name was chosen successfully.  Hope is a pleasant expectation, almost certainty that the desired will come true.  This is a bulwark, a support, from any difficult situation a favorable outcome.  In a word, just what guarantees a person an insurance policy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  New insurance programs are constantly being introduced here, and over the course of a quarter century of existence, the company gains more and more importance in the field of insurance.  For example, it was here that an insurance program called "Anticlesch" was invented and implemented.  I must say that the most relevant topics in Siberia and the Far East, most likely, are not.  This is a zone of special tick activity, and therefore the program is very necessary and useful to people and is very popular. </p>

    <h2>  Corporate culture </h2><p>  In general, judging by the reviews of employees, life is in full swing at the company: new insurance policies that can already be issued online, event marketing with interesting promotions, all kinds of flash mobs, the opening of new and new offices - further and further from the native Krasnoyarsk.  Corporate culture itself is extremely rich.  And no one will be surprised if in the near future they still receive feedback from Nadezhda CJSC of Volgograd and other cities about the opening of new offices and the bright presence of their workers in the public life of the city. </p><p>  This company is very fond of participating in charity work: employees in Krasnoyarsk donate computers to orphanages, buy reanimobiles in a children's hospital, and participate in various social programs.  It‚Äôs nice to read such reviews, although there are a number of those that talk about shortcomings. </p><h2>  Milestones </h2><p>  The year of birth of Nadezhda CJSC is 1991, it was then that in October the company was awarded a certificate stating that the state has registered this joint-stock company.  Already in 1993, a medical "daughter" appeared, and therefore the company became an insurance group serving millions of customers.  At the same time, the rating established sixteenth place in the country among fifty-eight companies involved in compulsory medical insurance. </p><p>  The following year, the active development of new areas began: property and pet insurance, voluntary medical insurance, accident insurance.  Then, legal entities began to apply to the company.  A type of cargo insurance has appeared.  In 1995, a group of companies breaks into prestigious employers.  Even before OSAGO began to be involved here, the agent network was developing very quickly - in 1995 their number exceeded one thousand. </p>

    <h2>  Campaign in the regions </h2><p>  In 1996, a large-scale development of regional networks of the company began.  Now it is one of the most extensive - in the Krasnoyarsk Territory in 1996, there were about fifty offices, covering the region right up to the most ‚Äúbearish‚Äù corners.  In 1997, new licenses were obtained.  Now it has become possible to insure the expenses of individual citizens traveling abroad, vehicles, river vessels, even construction and installation risks were insured. </p><p>  In 2003, a license was obtained allowing to engage in compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, and then real success began.  In 2007, the company first appeared on the rating procedure (NRA - National Rating Agency).  The score was decent - "BBB +", but there is still room to raise the bar.  In 2009, another license was received relating to tourism and liability insurance. </p><h2>  Subtotals </h2><p>  In 2013, the company raised 887 million rubles for insurance premiums, the volume of payments amounted to 419 million rubles.  According to the volume of all premiums, Nadezhda CJSC took the fourth place among the insurers of the region and the seventh in Khakassia.  Here you need to remember that this is the only local insurance company.  The rest are central.  In 2014, more than one and a half billion rubles were already spent on insurance premiums. </p><p>  According to Nadezhda ratings, it is now in 74th place in terms of contributions among all Russian companies, OSAGO gave 22nd place, Casco takes 41st place, 84th place holds health and accident insurance, 100th place - health insurance.  In the same year, the first certificates are issued regarding ownership of databases and insurance products for trademarks. </p>

    <h2>  "Marina of Hope" </h2><p>  In 2015, the rating changed.  Expert RA (RAEX ‚Äã‚Äãagency) has set the reliability rating of this company already at "A +".  This is a very high level.  At the same time, sales of new policies were launched online already.  This is "Reliable Rest", "Boss", "Anticlesch". </p><p>  But the most grandiose event of 2015 was the acquisition of a new real estate object in order to realize a long-held dream: to open an office center with the widest range of all kinds of services for customers.  So that everyone could buy a policy here and repair a car.  This multifunctional center was opened in 2015.  A group of insurance companies, having conferred, called it "Pier of Hope."  This event inspired all employees so much that in the new development strategy of the company until 2021 many additional points appeared. </p><h2>  New Territories </h2><p>  In 2016, the company began to open territories far beyond Siberia; it stepped into the southern and western regions of the country, having mastered fourteen new cities.  Now there are seventy-six in total.  They write reviews about Nadezhda CJSC Irkutsk and Angarsk, Barnaul and <span>Novosibirsk, Omsk</span> and Rostov-on-Don, Chelyabinsk and Minusinsk ... And the products of the insurance company interested about a million customers, including small and medium businesses, farmers, private individuals . </p><p>  Nadezhda provides financial reserves both in cash, in which the most reliable Russian banks help it, and in real estate.  Back in 2015, the company's assets amounted to 2.1 billion rubles, among which 718 million rubles were own funds.  In 2016, all numbers became higher.  Nadezhda has its own magazine - Lighthouse of Hope, a colorful, interesting publication that writes about safety, health, and people working for the company.  Insurance is a safety margin that every person needs.  This is exactly what each page of the publication tells. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Many customers complain that the phones indicated on the site do not answer employees, and therefore force them to spend a huge amount of time on kilometers-long trips (sometimes more than a hundred kilometers), waiting in long lines.  And the questions that customers come with are not resolved in one visit.  You have to come repeatedly.  Even from the hospital after operations - several such insured events are described when the client ends up in the hospital after an accident, and insurance issues need to be resolved within a few days.  The reviews on payments to the Nadezhda CJSC for the most part leave much to be desired. </p><p>  They also write about unsubstantiated refusals in compulsory motor third-party liability insurance registration; there are many such reviews.  Some cases go to trial.  Also found reviews that reveal such shortcomings in the work as disorganization and disinterest in retaining the clientele.  Apparently, according to compulsory motor liability insurance, Nadezhda has too many customers; there is not enough attention at all.  Some people write that "Hope" "jinxed", some accuse of excessive appetites.  By the way, only paid company phone numbers are always available.  Free ones seem to have died, according to customer reviews from almost all cities of presence. </p>
