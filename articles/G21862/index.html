    <p>  The property of the fund consists of shares of founders.  To create mutual funds, they must transfer the rights to dispose of their property to the management company. </p><h2>  Specialized company </h2><p>  Specialized is considered to be a company that manages a mutual investment fund.  Management should satisfy the interests of investors, and not go beyond the law. </p><p>  The investor's share is determined by the number of mutual funds.  A share in itself is a <span>security</span> certifying ownership of the property.  The share also determines the owner‚Äôs share in the fund. </p><h2>  Mutual Funds of Alfa-Bank </h2><p>  At the end of the last century, Alfa Capital became part of Alfa Bank.  Today, the company has more than four hundred points of sale, which is a great advantage of the group. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Now customers are provided with a wide range of mutual funds.  All of them can be divided into three large categories: </p><ul><li>  classic; </li><li>  industry funds; </li><li>  specialized funds. </li></ul><p>  The liquidity, risk and profitability of Alfa-Bank mutual funds together with the investment structure distinguish them from each other.  Classic mutual funds are bonds and stocks.  Portfolio reliability is determined by the number of bonds in it.  We must remember the main rule: with a large number of shares in the mutual fund portfolio, the profitability of Alfa-Bank funds will fall, but the risk of losing money will be very small.  This rule also works in the opposite direction: the higher the share of shares in the structure of the unit investment fund, the higher its profitability, which means that the risk of the portfolio increases. </p><p>  As for the industry unit investment funds, they relate to a specific sector of the economy.  For example, to trade, resources, infrastructure and so on.  Thus, if an investor invests his money in one of the funds, income will be received only if the corresponding sector of the economy grows. </p><h2>  Description of <span>mutual investment funds.</span>  Classic mutual funds </h2><p>  From the name of mutual funds, it can be understood that their target audience is conservative investors who are not very prone to risky operations.  Alfa-Bank‚Äôs classic mutual funds will appeal to those investors who wish to invest money in financial instruments that they understand, which are the components of the classic portfolio, that is, bonds and stocks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
