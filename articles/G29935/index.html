    <p>  Gentlemen, this is the Red Sea!  This is not anywhere else!  Let us explain: this is a unique natural complex of reefs.  Warm as milk and crystal clear water.  The number of living organisms per unit area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe water area in it is an order of magnitude higher than in any other sea in the world!  Even in winter, the water temperature here does not drop below +21 ¬∞ C. A real riot of life.  Multi-colored.  Bright.  Unique.  Fishes, in their original coloring, overshadow the ones you have ever seen in an aquarium.  More than 150 species are found here alone in coral reefs!  And the variety of fish is determined by the number of their species - more than a thousand! </p><p>  And you will be proud of your photographs taken under water. </p><h2>  Safety information </h2><p>  This should be kept in mind when diving.  In the magnificent underwater world, you cannot completely let euphoria take hold of you.  Novice divers should be guided by some simple rules. </p><ol><li>  Do not submerge at night.  Underwater inhabitants at this time are most active, and people, due to the limited view, can not fully control the situation. </li><li>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcorals, water should be entered exclusively in special shoes.  Why?  The small fragments of coral at the bottom are very sharp.  Also, sea urchins - fish whose body is covered with sharp needles - bring inconvenience to vacationers. </li><li>  Do not touch anything in the water.  Behind the charming appearance of a calm and non-aggressive marine essence, sharp teeth and a lightning-fast reflex reaction can be hidden. </li><li>  The instructor's instructions should be meticulously followed and ambiguities clarified directly with him. </li></ol><h2>  Breakfast </h2><p>  For breakfast for guests, the main restaurant of the Movenpick Resort Soma Bay 5 * hotel (Egypt) offers bacon, omelet, chicken sausages, milk porridge, granola, cheese, pancakes as part of the buffet.  Yoghurts, which stand here in packages, are popular among children.  Out of competition, an assortment of pastries, buns, croissants.  Honey, chocolate cream, canned fruit in syrup. </p><p>  Various juices: orange, pineapple, guava, apples are offered to vacationers. </p><h2>  Dinner and supper </h2><p>  For lunch and dinner, Movenpick Resort Soma Bay 5 * offers a more abundant menu.  Large selection of main dishes made from beef, turkey, veal, lamb, liver, chicken, fish, shrimp, squid.  Garnish of potatoes, vegetables, salads, sauces - in stock.  Mashed soups are also good.  Of course, here, according to the Eastern tradition, there are always a lot of all kinds of pastries and sweets.  Always available 7-10 items of fruit.  Cooking methods are also diverse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="movenpick resort soma bay 5 soma bay" class="if" height="269" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/509560.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Judging by the reviews, vacationers are most supportive of the main meat dishes cooked on the grill and in pots. </p><h2>  About the work of bars </h2><p>  In the framework of all inclusive, from lunch to 22 <sup>00</sup> low-alcohol drinks are free for guests: beer, white and red wine.  It is impossible to stay hungry here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="movenpick resort soma bay 5 pics reviews" class="if" height="172" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/509550.jpg" width="600"></div>  If, for example, guests are fond of beach vacations or playing water polo during the day and skip lunch, then they can grab a bite to eat at the poolside bar.  There is always delicious pizza, delicious pastries, salad, sweets, cola-fantasy sprite.

    <h2>  Excursion to Giza </h2><p>  In addition to a beach holiday, by the way, according to experts, the best in the world according to the price / quality criterion, Egypt is a country of interesting excursions, a real storehouse of history, a treasury of the oldest architectural structures of mankind.  Near Cairo, on the deserted mountain plateau of Giza, there are the most famous great pyramids in the world dedicated to the ancient pharaohs: Cheops, Chefren, Mikerin.  Here, at the foot of the plateau, stands the famous Sphinx, as well as burial churches.  The cost of the excursion to these pyramids ranges from $ 75 to $ 100.  The road to them from the Movenpick Resort Soma Bay 5 * hotel (Soma Bay), if you go by bus, takes about 7 hours.  The standard excursion time is from 1 <sup>00</sup> to 22 <sup>00</sup> .  Tourists traveling to the pyramids are advised to bring a hat, sunglasses, sunblock, water, a pillow from the room, warm clothes. </p><h2>  Luxor </h2><p>  In the III millennium BC, it was Luxor (in ancient times - Thebes) that became the second capital of Egypt.  An excursion to the City of Palaces (as the Egyptians call it) takes time from 5 <sup>00</sup> to 22 <sup>00</sup> .  A one-way trip from the hotel complex to Luxor by bus takes more than 5 hours.  The cost of such an excursion for an adult is $ 85, and for a child $ 43.  64 tsars are buried here, including <span>Pharaoh Tutankhamun</span> and Queen Nefertiti, who look at the tombs of which about 9 thousand tourists a day come.  This excursion is also popular with guests of the Movenpick Resort Soma Bay 5 * hotel. </p><h2>  Abu simbel </h2><p>  Perhaps the next most popular tourist destination after the pyramids is Abu Simbel.  It is located south of 280 kilometers from the city of Aswan.  This is a two-part temple.  It is carved into the rock during the period from 1313 to 1218 BC.  e.  This name in Arabic sounds like "Father of bread."  The fact is that from the bend of the river in the bas-relief the ancient masters carved a stone man in a stone with an apron of a pointed shape.  It was in the apron that the sailors identified some semblance of bread measure.  Hence the name ... </p><p>  The first part of the temple is dedicated to Pharaoh Ramses II.  The second (it is much smaller) is dedicated to the <span>goddess Hathor, who</span> favors the Egyptian queens.  It was built in honor of Ramses' beloved wife, Queen Nefertari. </p><p>  The rock, consisting of sedimentary fine-grained sandstone, has long been called sacred in Egypt. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up our review of the service of this five-star hotel complex, we come to understand the high quality of it is by no means the most expensive service.  Of course, this is not an economy hotel.  And tourists can easily feel it.  By the fact that their rooms are more like apartments than hotel rooms.  They will feel this in terms of the level of preventative maintenance by staff.  And, of course, in terms of quality of rest.  One-day guesthouse with a cost not exceeding $ 200, includes both proper service and food without restriction in meat, as well as in seafood. </p><p>  Vacationers are guaranteed not only a good rest, but also vivid impressions, and the strengthening of the health of Movenpick Resort Soma Bay 5 *. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="movenpick resort soma bay 5 hurghada egypt" class="if" height="172" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/509551.jpg" width="600"></div>
