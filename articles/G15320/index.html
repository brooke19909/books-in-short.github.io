Italy and its features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A small paradise that has grown literally from the waters of the Gulf of Venice is the town of Treviso.  <span>Italy is a</span> colorful, vibrant <span>country</span> , here even the smallest province can be full of attractions and architectural monuments.  Nothing like this description?  Naturally, this town is a prototype, one might say, a miniature of Venice, which, incidentally, is located in the vicinity of Treviso.  Italy in all its glory, its features and history are captured here, because we are starting a virtual tour of this area. </p><h2>  <span>How to get to paradise</span> on the water </h2><p>  Naturally, tourists from our country fly to Italy by air.  These are international public flights that land in major cities in European countries.  There are also charter flights, which just very often deliver passengers to Treviso (Italy).  The airport, which is three kilometers from this province, and also twenty kilometers from Venice, is named after the great sculptor <span>Antonio Canova.</span>  Here mainly private liners, following the routes from our country, land here.  If you fly from other European cities (London, Berlin, Paris), you can find a ticket from one of the low cost airlines that send planes to the airport of Treviso. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="treviso italy" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/612523.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The architectural beauty of the city </h2><p>  Well, we figured out the kitchen, now consider the sights of Treviso.  Italy is a country that was built up mainly in the Middle Ages.  Therefore, in the central square of Del Signori we meet chic palaces in the Gothic style.  The brightest of them is the Plazzo Dei Trecento, which was built in the 13th century.  Nearby is the town hall, designed in the same architectural style, and next to it is the Cathedral of San Nicolo.  The most picturesque corner of the city is considered to be Vicolo Molinetto.  An old mill has been built here, and the hill offers excellent views of the nearby islet of Peskeria.  Also on this square, a <span>fish market</span> often opens <span>,</span> where you can buy products of this kind at low prices to cook them at home.  The old part of the city is still guarded by defensive walls with watchtowers, which have been preserved in excellent condition.  Also in the old quarters is the Cathedral of San Francesco, where the daughter of Petrarch and the son of Dante are buried. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="treviso italy airport" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/612525.jpg"></div>
