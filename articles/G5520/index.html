Luxurious decoration impresses with a variety of forms.  The large size of the building and the wealth of jewelry make it possible every time to come and be surprised, to discover something new, unnoticed before.  Imagine if Merceau, the character of the novel ‚ÄúThe Outsider,‚Äù Camus, recalled for details not his wretched little room, but these chambers. </p><p>  The Kremlin‚Äôs Terem Palace has become an integral part of not only Moscow, but the whole of Russia.  Few from other cities or countries have not heard about him.  He deservedly claims to be the eighth wonder of the world.  This is one of the symbols of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Build history </h2><p>  The Moscow Kremlin‚Äôs Terem Palace was built in just a year, from 1635 to 1636. Although the deadlines for erecting such a scale are the shortest, this in no way affected the quality of the building.  Moreover, given that this is the first Russian stone palace, the Kremlin has refuted the proverb that the first pancake is always lumpy.  He became an example for the construction of many other stone buildings.  Firstly, the decoration of the building is traditional, as in wooden buildings.  Secondly, the strength of the whole structure was difficult to surpass at that time.  And not all modern buildings can compete with the palace.  I would like to hope, but it is unlikely that the "Khrushchevs" will stand for four centuries, not only without losing their presentation, but at least preserving the foundation. </p><p>  It was built at once by the four best architects of that time: L. Ushakov, A. Konstantinov, B. Ogurtsov and T. Sharutin.  The Terem Palace was erected in the Kremlin on the time-tested foundation of the northern tier of the Kremlin ensemble, which was laid down one and a half hundred years before.  In addition, this is the first building built of stone, and has several floors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

The first site was called the boyar, which housed the master's sleeping quarters.  She was on the first floor.  The second is intended for walks and is connected to the first floor by a staircase.  The entrance is a golden lattice, a masterpiece of Kuznetsk craftsmanship.  The third tier was called the Golden-Domed Teremok.

    <h2>  Destination of the Terem Palace </h2><p>  Today, historians argue why Tsar <span>Mikhail Fedorovich</span> ordered the construction of the Terem Palace in the Kremlin.  Scientists disagree.  Some argue that the Kremlin‚Äôs Terem Palace, no matter in which century it was built, had one purpose - to provide peace and relaxation to the tsar and his entire family.  The upper floors were built as children's rooms.  Others insist that with such magnificent decoration he wanted to show his wealth and the country.  Therefore, facilities were used to receive Swedish ambassadors and not only.  Also here, in their opinion, important meetings of the boyars were held. </p>

They determined this opinion by their resemblance to the harem <span>of the Topkapi</span> Sultan's <span>Palace in Istanbul.</span>  And today, this Turkish building is distinguished by luxury and wealth.

That is, this is the birth of Russian Baroque.  And although the direction existed in many other countries, and Russia was not its founder, it nevertheless contributed to the history of architecture.  Hence the emergence of a style that is commonly called "purely Russian." </p><p>  This style is characterized by lush decoration and decoration of stone buildings under wooden rich huts. </p>

Although the time of construction dates back to the 17th century, houses in the Russian style are extremely popular today.

    <h2>  Exterior of the Terem Palace </h2><p>  Outwardly, the Terem Palace in the Kremlin resembles an unusually beautiful pyramid.  You can even compare it with a holiday cake.  He is so bright. </p><p>  Each upper tier is slightly smaller than the previous one, which made it possible to use the remaining sites for various purposes.  For example, a platform above the second floor is the territory on which festivities were held. </p><p>  Window frames are painted white and immersed in stylized images of flowers.  The nature of the roof also reminds of wooden huts - this is a gable structure, decorated with patterns of different colors. </p>

    <h2>  The interior of the Terem Palace </h2><p>  The Kremlin‚Äôs Terem Palace has surpassed the time of construction not only in external characteristics.  The interior of the building also strikes with unprecedented magnificence. </p><p>  If you describe in three words, it is luxury, diversity, wealth.  If we describe all the details of the interior separately, then it will take a lot of time and more than one <span>printed sheet.</span> </p><p>  Each tier of the building had its purpose.  The basement was intended for storing stocks.  The queen has chosen the first floor - her workshops are located in it.  The second is the reception, in modern terms, where guests and ambassadors from different countries were met.  A large drawer descended from one of the rooms, where people put their requests and complaints. </p><p>  Immediately there were royal chambers, a bathhouse. </p><p>  The walls of the chambers are painted with floral patterns and gold.  Round arches are decorated with unusual patterns and ornaments, real sculpting, gilding, carved wood of expensive species. </p>

It was restored according to the drawings of the great artist - archaeologist, painter Fedor Grigorievich Solntsev - and his student Kiselev already in the 19th century.  Given that the paint of those times was extremely persistent, the reasons for re-applying the pattern are due to a partial or complete destruction of the wall decoration.  This could be the attack of Napoleon, and the decision to remake the interior, which was never realized.

    <p>  Such is the Terem Palace in the Kremlin.  In what century it was built - it is known reliably.  But few buildings have survived from those times.  Today it is in almost the same condition as it was almost four centuries ago. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Many believe that the legendary film by Leonid Gaidai "Ivan Vasilievich Changes the Profession" was shot in the Kremlin.  This is partially true.  But the Terem Palace in the Kremlin (photo presented in the article) has nothing to do with the film.  The film was shot in the <span>Rostov Kremlin,</span> and that‚Äôs just a chase scene.  The royal chambers are studio decorations, and the ‚Äúroyal clothes‚Äù are the skillful work of costumers. </p>

The answer to this question is known, but opinions about the relationship of architecture to the Renaissance or Baroque were divided.

    <h2>  How to get? </h2><p>  Today, the Moscow Kremlin‚Äôs Terem Palace is closed to the public.  But getting into it is still possible. </p><p>  You need to pre-register in groups to visit.  The queues are huge, therefore it is necessary to agree in advance.  But this is only half the battle.  After recruiting a group, you must obtain permission from a Kremlin representative to visit the palace.  Well, once inside, just enjoy the tour. </p>
