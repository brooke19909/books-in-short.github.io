The feat (a summary of his biography and military activity is the subject of this review) of this boy is probably known to every student.  This work describes his life and participation in battles in a partisan detachment.  His personality became an example of the courage and heroism of the Soviet people, shown during the years of the German invasion of our homeland.  The fate of the child was all the more tragic because he died at the age of fourteen, however, despite his young age, he did a lot to free his hometown, for which he was awarded the highest military award. </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  In 1930, Valya Kotik was born in the family of an employee.  The feat (a brief summary of which will be described below) of this boy was of great importance not only in practical but also in ideological sense, since his actions became an example to follow.  He was the youngest in the family and, at the time of the invasion of the enemy, was in the sixth grade. </p>

    <p>  At first, the child began to pay attention to the posts of the Nazis and distribute leaflets, agitation, calling for the fight against the invaders.  So, the student attracted the attention of the head of the local underground organization, who settled in his house.  At first, the little hero of the great war, Valya Kotik, mistook him for an enemy spy and traitor, however, having learned the truth, he became a member of his group.  They began to give him small assignments: to follow the German officers, to obtain and guard weapons.  A capable child showed courage, quickness and ingenuity, so they began to give him more responsible and serious assignments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Partisan movement </h2><p>  The boy quickly got the hang of handling weapons and explosives.  He was able to mine the roads and highways along which patrols passed.  Once, a child noticed in a passing car the chief of the local gendarmerie, who was driving to his hometown of Shepetovka.  A schoolboy threw a grenade and the car exploded. </p>

    <p>  Thus, Valya Kotik made a great contribution to the liberation of the city.  The feat (a summary of his military biography reflects the tragic fate of many partisan children) of the boy lies in the fact that he combined physical dexterity with ideological conviction, thanks to which he did not leave his detachment even at the time when he was offered to cross to safe areas of the country. </p><h2>  1942-1944 years </h2><p>  At first, the schoolboy served as a liaison in the underground group, but he soon began to participate in battles.  An important stage in his military biography was the transition under the command of Lieutenant Muzalev, who led the <span>partisan movement</span> in the occupied territories.  The teenager actively fought on the side of the Red Army and was twice wounded. </p>

    <p>  In 1943, he broke off Warsaw‚Äôs connection with the main German headquarters, Valya Kotik.  The feat, the brief content of which allows only approximately to judge the significance of this step, facilitated the actions of members of the underground organization in the liberation of the conquered territory.  The boy also took part in undermining the German echelons.  In addition to his observation skills and skillful organizational skills, he also proved to be an excellent sentinel.  One day, he, one of the entire group of partisans, noticed an impending raid on his comrades and raised the alarm in time, thus saving all people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Death </h2><p>  Valya Kotik, a feat whose biography is compulsorily studied in all Soviet schools, fought on Ukrainian territory.  As mentioned above, he was offered to move to a safer area, but he did not want to leave his native detachment.  He took part in the liberation operation to remove the occupation from the city of Izyaslav.  According to one version, the boy was sent to scout, noticed a German patrol, raised the alarm, but was mortally wounded, after which he quickly died.  Some scientists believe that the wound of the young hero was minor, but he died due to shelling during the evacuation.  He was buried in his hometown.  Many streets of Russian cities, as well as pioneer camps, schools, and squads are named after him.  He has several monuments, including in the capital of our country.  His life is devoted to a number of films. </p><h2>  Confession </h2><p>  Among the many partisans who made a significant contribution to the victory, Valya Kotik, a pioneer hero, stands out.  Heroes of Russia, the USSR have always received the highest awards and orders.  So the boy initially received partisan medals, and in 1958 he was awarded the country's main honorary title.  As mentioned above, a film was made about him. </p>

    <p>  According to the plot of the picture, the character - a young schoolboy, sacrifices his life, undermining himself with a grenade, so as not to be captured by the enemy.  It is significant that many young fighters became famous after their tragic death.  In this row, Kotik takes pride of place, as he carried out a number of actions of strategic importance.  Destroying the connection with the bet is a step whose significance went beyond local success.  Therefore, at school history lessons, attention should be paid to the importance of his underground activities in the liberation of Ukraine from German occupation. </p>
