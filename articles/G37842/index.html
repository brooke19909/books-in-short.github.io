Varieties and strategies</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Cards from the Middle Ages are very popular.  They successfully replaced the bones, backgammon and checkers.  Some of the complexity of tactics and strategies, as well as the possibilities of mathematical miscalculations are compared or even superior to chess.  Let us, dear reader, plunge into this unpretentious world in this article as a worthy representative of the sphere of entertainment.  So, the card "Fool." </p><h2>  A brief history of the game </h2><p>  Many objects and activities according to legend come from heroes and great deities, as a gift.  However, today we will talk about a simple peasant game of cards.  It is not so deeply rooted, but it has already managed to celebrate two centuries.  We can speak confidently about such an age, since Pushkin and Saltykov-Shchedrin have references to this ‚Äútrifling fun‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  Thanks to the revolution of 1917, the game became recognized in society and moved to salons.  Today it is played in many countries.  At the University of California, for example, there is even such a tradition among students studying Russian.  They gather on Fridays in an informal setting and practice communication skills while spending a short time playing the Fool. </p><p>  A bunch of different applications provide the opportunity to plunge into this atmosphere virtually.  You can spread the cards on the phone, and on a laptop or personal computer.  The main charm of this fun is that you can learn it in a couple of minutes, and hone your skills for years. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stupid fool" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23068/494462.jpg" width="480"></div>

The last two rules are straightforward, and they are less popular today.  In Japanese, for example, the difference is that peaks only beat peaks.  Trump is always a tambourine.  And the Queen of Spades can beat any card of her suit. </p><p>  Usually use the traditional Russian deck, consisting of 36 sheets.  However, in our time, more often play the more popular, the so-called "poker".  It has 52 cards, and the jokers are always put aside. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fool transferable" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23068/494466.jpg" width="600"></div>  In addition to the main four, today there are about 80 different options for the game.  Next will be announced some of the most unusual.

That is, you must give everything that is in your hands to the one sitting on the left. </p><p>  <em>Chukchi</em> </p><p>  They distributed 6 leaves, showed a trump card and removed the remainder.  We play only with what we received.  But the party quickly ends. </p><p>  <em>Poker</em> </p><p>  They looked like you, but there‚Äôs nothing to beat?  Not scary!

    <p>  Deal six cards.  You can walk in any quantity, but only one virtue.  The decision is up to the player who fights off.  He can cover or pick up.  If you play a round, then in the presence of the same dignity, if desired, throw it up.  The first one to do this is the walker.  And only if he already does not have the necessary options, other participants can come into the game in a clockwise direction. </p><p>  The only condition is that 6 cards go out in one circle, no more.  Also, you can not throw out more than the one who covers is in his hands. </p><h2>  Translated variety </h2><p>  Everything is very simple here.  The change is the same, the general meaning is similar.  The only difference is that you don‚Äôt have to beat the card you were playing with.  You can simply translate it further clockwise to the participant, putting next to the same value.  This continues until there is nothing to convey to the next. </p><p>  By the way, there is a variety where they do not always put in the translation, but simply show if desired.  The so-called "travel card". </p><p>  The latter, in front of which there are cards, but there is nothing to transmit, is considered a striker.  If he covered everything, then his next move.  Those who translate in this way simply skip the move. </p><p>  So, today we learned how to play the fool.  We got acquainted with the options for this leisure.  For those who wish, even the opportunity to become famous and earn extra money on this. </p><p>  Go for it!  Good luck </p>
