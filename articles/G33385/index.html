Unlike the times of the Soviet Union, when there were 1-2 models on sale that you still had to try to find, today the choice of washers is simply huge.  Buyers just run their eyes when they go to a household appliance store.  There are wide and compact, white and black models, with front and vertical loading, from different manufacturers and for any wallet.  First of all, such a technique is chosen by size, function and price.  But nevertheless, sooner or later the question arises: "Which manufacturer is better?"  What is the difference between the models of this company from the rest, similar in function, but released under a different brand?

    <h2>  Concern "Zanussi-Electrolux-AEG" </h2><p>  There are many firms, but one is worth talking separately.  The Swedish company "Electrolux" is familiar, perhaps, to every second buyer.  The equipment under this brand is of high quality and an extensive range of functions.  In fact, this is not one company, but a whole concern that produces electrical household appliances under three brands: Zanussi, Electrolux and AEG.  Under the name "Zanussi" is a budget technology without any frills and frills, inexpensive.  Under the brand name "Electrolux" - more functional, modern, beautiful.  The AEG equipment is considered premium products, it incorporates all the best that Swedish engineers can give consumers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Reviews indicate that the equipment sold under this brand is quite reliable.

    <h2>  Reviews about washing machines </h2><p>  Does the <span>Electrolux</span> washing machine have any drawbacks <span>?</span>  <span>Reviews</span> on this subject are mixed.  Yes, periodically, consumers complain of a high <span>level of noise,</span> vibration, weak hoses that are frayed before the machine itself fails, but these complaints are not widespread.  Perhaps only every twentieth washing machine "Electrolux" gets negative comments.  Customer reviews indicate that they are mostly satisfied with their purchases.  Of course, on the Internet you can find comments from owners who complain about the small load, lack of any functions, long washing and other nuances.  Based on them, potential buyers may think that the washing machine "Electrolux" is not good enough for them.  These reviews, however, only say that the equipment was not chosen carefully enough, without looking at the instructions, without paying attention to the technical characteristics and without comparing with other models. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Malfunctions </h2><p>  Can it be argued that the automatic machine of this brand will never break?  Of course not.  There is nothing eternal in the world, and the Electrolux washing machine is unlikely to be an exception.  Faults, albeit infrequently, make owners of this equipment nervous.  What kind of breakdowns can people who buy equipment of this brand encounter?  With exactly the same as buyers of equipment from other companies.  The pump may fail, the heating element may burn out, bearings may fly.  It happens that during power surges the electronic control module burns out, after which the Electrolux washing machine stops working.  Failures in this case can be eliminated by calling the wizard or taking the equipment to a service center.  If the machine is under warranty, then it will be repaired within 45 days, replacing failed components. </p>

    <h2>  Repairs </h2><p>  Customers who have already encountered malfunctions are primarily interested in the question of how much will it cost to repair Electrolux washing machines?  Well, if the equipment is under warranty, but if not?  Here a lot will depend on the place of assembly.  The vertical washing machine "Electrolux" is assembled in Europe, which means that all spare parts will go from abroad.  Accordingly, their price will be high.  The same can be said of compact models sold under this brand.  But most of the front automatic machines are assembled either in Russia or in Ukraine, so the accessories for them are much cheaper.  The price for the repair of washing machines "Electrolux" depends on what exactly failed.  A leaked inlet hose can be replaced for several hundred rubles, and repair of a failed electronic module will cost several thousand, sometimes its price reaches 40% of the initial cost of the machine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to identify a breakdown? </h2><p>  Modern models are programmed for self-diagnosis, they are in the form of symbols or conditional indicators capable of reporting minor current faults.  For example, after starting the wash, the code E11 appears on the display.  What is the Electrolux washing machine reporting at this moment?  The instruction states that this symbol indicates the absence of water in the tank.  A possible cause is the inlet feed valve.  Let's say another code appeared - E31. What is trying to tell its owner the Electrolux washing machine?  The instruction indicates that this code indicates a more serious malfunction - a breakdown of the level switch.  Even if there is no display in this model, some LEDs may suggest some errors.  One flashes - one fault, another flashes - another.  Error codes for the Electrolux washing machines can be found in the instructions that come with any model. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electrolux washing machine errors" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/712933.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The price of household appliances of this brand largely depends on its functionality.  As mentioned earlier, of the entire concern "Zanussi-Electrolux-AEG" <br>  "Electrolux" is designed for the middle class.  Even the budget models of this brand can not be called very cheap and simple.  Most of them come with a display, with temperature control and the ability to choose the spin speed.  The display allows you to visually see the errors of the "Electrolux" washing machine, the time remaining until the end of the wash, and also set the delay for the start for several hours. </p><p>  The concern produces models of various sizes with a load of 3 to 10 kg.  Moreover, the 10-pound unit has the standard dimensions for full-size machines 85 * 60 * 60, which allow you to place it in a conventional kitchen under the countertop.  A large load in this case is achieved by increasing not the length of the drum, but its diameter due to compaction and a more competent layout of internal components.  The 3 kg washing machine is a compact unit that can be installed under the sink. </p><h2>  Size and loading </h2><p>  By the method of laying laundry all models can be divided into front and vertical washing machines "Electrolux".  Their prices are significantly different.  Vertical models are assembled in Europe, so their cost is much higher. </p>

    <h2>  Time manager </h2><p>  Each manufacturer seeks to distinguish their products from the general series, adding new features and expanding its capabilities.  The company "Electrolux" was no exception.  The modern multi-functional units that it produces are equipped with the Time Manager (or time manager) function.  This option allows you to adjust the duration of the wash, depending not only on the temperature and type of fabric, but also on the degree of soiled laundry.  The time manager sets the cycle time separately for each program in three categories: heavily soiled, medium and lightly soiled.  Thus, the maximum washing time will be more than 2.5 hours, and the minimum - 14 minutes. </p>

    <h2>  Programs and Features </h2><p>  Unlike some other brands of washing machines, Electrolux are equipped with a large number of programs.  These include not only standard ones: for cotton, synthetics, wool and delicate fabrics, but also special ones, such as <span>prewash, washing</span> pillows and sportswear, jeans, lingerie and others.  The spin speed of some models of this brand starts from 1600 rpm and decreases to 400. If necessary, you can simply drain the water after washing by turning off the spin completely. </p><p>  If there is vertical loading in the unit, the Electrolux washing machine will turn the drum with the loading hole up - this function is called auto parking. </p><p>  It is also worth mentioning the delayed start, which allows you to start the car not immediately after turning on, but after a few hours, when the period of preferential energy consumption comes. </p>

    <h2>  Steam system </h2><p>  Steam system - under this name a series of expensive new generation Electrolux luxury washing machines has been released.  As the name implies, in addition to ordinary washing, the technology provides for the processing of linen with steam.  Steam allows you to remove odors from things, smooth wrinkles and jamming.  Another feature of this series is the MyFavouritePlus program, which allows you to remember what type of washing with what parameters the hostess most often uses and enter it into the memory of the washing machine.  Some SteamSystem models are equipped with a weight sensor that allows you to accurately calculate the amount of powder you need.  It can also be noted that the cars of this series work very quietly, the noise level of these devices does not exceed 49 dB, which is comparable to a normal conversation in an apartment.  Such a model can be safely launched at night, without fear that it will wake residents or interfere with neighbors. </p><h2>  Dryer drum </h2><p>  Washing machines are not the only products manufactured by Electrolux.  In order to provide things with comprehensive care, in addition, you can purchase a tumble dryer.  This device can be trusted with the most delicate fabrics, including silk and knitwear, because it has received the Woolmark certificate - the recommendation of one of the most respected hair care companies in the world.  The maximum load of the drum reaches 9 kg, while its design and sophisticated control system allows you to carefully dry any amount of laundry.  Built-in sensors constantly monitor the residual moisture level, stopping drying as soon as things are dry, so the risk of overdrying disappears.  Programs are set using a convenient touch panel, with one click with a minimum amount of effort.  For the most popular modes, there is a MyFavouritePlus button.  Like a washing machine, it remembers the drying parameters that will be used most often. </p><p>  The company "Electrolux" is constantly updating its products, introducing new options and additions, seeking to increase the competitiveness of its products. </p>
