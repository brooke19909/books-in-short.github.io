Baghdad: information about the city, attractions, description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The city, which is located in the very center of the Ancient East, which now rises above the ruins of the world's oldest architectural monuments, is Baghdad.  The capital of Iraq, translated into Russian, sounds like a ‚ÄúGift of God.‚Äù  Indeed, being there, you understand that the atmosphere, every street and square, every building - everything here has its own special aura, which seems to connect the most distant past and present in which we live now. </p><h2>  General information about the city </h2><p>  In the deserts of Mesopotamia, on the banks of the biblical <span>Tiger River, there is</span> now a huge city of Baghdad.  The capital of which country can still please us with such an abundance of architectural and cultural monuments that are rooted in the distant past?  Perhaps no.  This city is located in the geographical center of the country of Iraq, in the valley of two rivers mentioned by the Bible itself - the Tigris and the Euphrates.  Besides the fact that the city is full of ancient architectural monuments, today it is also the main transport hub of the state.  There are international airports, train stations, as well as a riverport, from which ships often go along the Gulf to the waters of the Persian Gulf. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baghdad capital" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/534641.jpg" width="550"></div>

It was here, in Mesopotamia, the first communities appeared on the planet, which very soon transformed into cities and countries.  The people who previously inhabited these lands bore the name of the Sumerians.  They own the invention of the famous cuneiform tablets, with the help of which current archaeologists were able to restore many pages from the history of those times.  Even in the 2nd millennium BC.  e.  in these territories the Sumerian-Akkadian kingdom was formed.  The first ruler to be mentioned in written sources is Uruinimgina.  Years and centuries passed, and gradually the <span>most ancient people of the</span> Earth (that is, the Sumerians) began to die out.  Mesopotamia was completely chosen by Akkadians.  According to their external data, they have much in common with modern Arabs, who now inhabit Baghdad.  The capital that grew up on these lands during their rule is known to the whole world, and its name is Babylon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baghdad is the capital of which country" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/534642.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kingdoms that still live </h2><p>  The center of the <span>Babylonian kingdom,</span> the city of the same name with its legendary tower was built 100 kilometers from modern Baghdad.  The megalopolis of the Ancient World, which was equipped with an irrigation system, had a clear structure and plan of streets and squares, which, incidentally, were lit by torches.  The city, which at that time was the largest port and center of shipbuilding, is now completely covered with the sands of the East.  Excavations are being conducted on the territory of Babylon, thanks to which historians have already found out that the city survived three falls.  It was rebuilt and literally resurrected from the ashes after numerous wars and raids.  During the period of his last era - the New Babylonian kingdom - local residents tried to get to God by building the famous tower.  The outcome of history is known to all, and now, apart from the foundation of this huge building, we have nothing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baghdad city islam art" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/534643.jpg" width="600"></div>

And Iraq is no exception in this regard.  This is one of the few cities that is very different from traditional Islamic settlements.  He seemed to have absorbed the atmosphere of all those religions and traditions that reigned on his lands earlier.  So, in 762, the city of Baghdad, which has survived to this day, appears on the banks of the Tiger River.  <span>The art of Islam,</span> it is worth noting, came to these lands much earlier, namely, a hundred years.  The city itself was built as a capital, which was to become a stronghold of the new religion, new traditions and rites, which, in fact, it became.  Officially, the founder of Baghdad is a certain caliph Al-Mansur.  Under his leadership, the largest ports and fortresses were erected here, and an army was gathering.  During the 9-10th centuries, Baghdad was not only the largest port in the Middle East, but also one of the most beautiful cities where people came from all over the world.  In the 20th century, it was decided and officially fixed that the city of Baghdad is the capital of Iraq, as well as the cultural center of the entire Islamic world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baghdad is the capital of Iraq with a rich and difficult fate" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/534644.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  Going on an excursion to any new place, it is important to initially know what weather awaits you there.  After all, a feeling of comfort during travel and travel is the most important thing, otherwise all impressions will be spoiled.  So, the capital of Iraq is Baghdad, a city that lies in a desert zone, in an area where strong winds, droughts very often happen, and very rarely rainfall occurs.  Due to the fact that the city is located far from the sea, the climate here is a little tropical, a little continental.  In winter, the air temperature can drop to 10 degrees during the day, and even up to 5 at night.  In summer, the sun is hot, and the air warms up to +44 ¬∞ C and above.  December and January is the time when rains and fogs completely cover Baghdad.  The capital of the entire Islamic world at this time is cold and damp, therefore it is not recommended to go here in winter.  It is best to visit this city in the fall, when the heat subsides, or in the spring, when the warm days are just beginning.  As for the summer, in addition to the heat, there are also Hasmins - sandstorms, which can be life-threatening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baghdad sights history" class="if" height="246" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/534645.jpg" width="530"></div>

    <h2>  Legacy </h2><p>  Everyone knows that Baghdad is the capital of Iraq with a rich and difficult fate.  You can trace the history of the city by looking at its architectural monuments, among which the overwhelming majority are mosques built in different eras.  The main one is the Golden Mosque of Musa al-Kadima, in which there is a mausoleum.  This architectural monument is located in the city center, so it will not be difficult to find it.  Outside the old part of the metropolis, no less beautiful <span>Muslim temples are located:</span> the Bunnie Mosque and Ramadan Mosque, Al-Kadimayn, Umm al-Mahar, Al-Javaat, Al-Rahman and many others.  Along with them there are mausoleums in which rulers and religious figures are buried.  Baghdad also boasts Christian memorials.  Information about the city and its history contains the fact that Armenians and other residents of neighboring countries have repeatedly created their communities here.  Therefore, an important monument is the Church of St. Virgin Mary, as well as the Catholic Church of Saint Thomas. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baghdad city capital of Iraq" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/534647.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <h2>  Modernity and its prints </h2><p>  A very peculiar, original and non-standard modern Baghdad.  The capital of the Iraqi state today is a city with many narrow, even streets, which are surrounded on all sides by adobe low houses.  A notable feature are also noisy markets where you can buy almost everything.  Like all capitals of the world, Baghdad boasts luxurious residences in which the most famous politicians lived.  Among them, we highlight the palace of Saddam Hussein Ar-Rihab, where today you can get just on a tour.  Along with it in the city there are eight more palaces that belonged earlier to this ruler, they are scattered in different areas.  Equally luxurious are the buildings of the Parliament and the Government of the country.  Also in the capital of Iraq there are many museums.  Among them, you can find a military, archaeological, museum of ancient Arab artifacts, a museum of modern art and ethnographic.  Their visit costs very little, and impressions remain more than enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baghdad city information" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/534648.jpg" width="539"></div>

    <h2>  Local kitchen </h2><p>  Knowing whose capital is Baghdad, everyone can draw conclusions, albeit very approximate, about what kind of food is here.  In the city there are a lot of restaurants, quite decent, which can perfectly familiarize every visitor with Iraqi cuisine.  The composition of the dishes includes mainly lamb, veal, poultry, goat, but in no case pork.  Vegetables, most often steamed or pickled, can be added to meat snacks.  A characteristic feature of the fact that a particular dish belongs specifically to Iraqi cuisine is the presence of a huge amount of spices.  Among the side dishes in Baghdad you can find wheat or corn grits.  Of the latter often make cakes (very tasty), which are called "AESh."  For dessert, be prepared to get dates, halva or candied fruit.  We also note that from drinks here either tea made on dried fruits or coffee is served.  It is customary to dilute milk with water, and from alcohol you can find only the traditional Iraqi drink - arak. </p><h2>  Things to do in Baghdad </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this city is purely Islamic, and they do not tolerate various liberties, you can still find entertainment to your liking.  Amusement parks, wildlife corners, zoos, picturesque alleys and bustling markets - Baghdad is famous for such treasures.  <span>The capital of Iran,</span> Tehran, is also one of the centers of Muslim worship, but we note that things are much more boring in that city.  Tourists often confuse these two countries, and mistakenly believe that Iran will present them with more surprises, but in fact it is just the opposite.  Here you can relax with children, ride the rides, taste local sweets, and then take a walk along one of the picturesque green alleys surrounded by date palm trees.  An equally worthy way to have a great time is going to the zoo.  Baghdad presents the rarest and most exotic inhabitants of the tropical fauna. </p><h2>  In conclusion, let's say ... </h2><p>  Not so gloomy, scary and depressing, as we are often described in the news, is actually the city of Baghdad.  Not everyone knows the capital of the state where it is located and what it is famous for, but if you delve into its history, study the traditions and visit it at least once, you can see the opposite.  This is a real Islamic museum, which combines the features of the ancient beliefs of the Arabs, and the prints of modern events. </p>
