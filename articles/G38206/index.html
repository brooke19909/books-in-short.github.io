Its size is quite modest.  In addition to everything, it is ‚Äúadded‚Äù to the help that is paid when going on maternity leave.  So, the unemployed (with the exception of those who have been fired from their jobs) or students in a full-time university will not be able to get it.  In order for it to be accrued, a certificate from the antenatal clinic must be presented at work.

    <p>  Separately, it is worth noting that in the capital there is another payment for registration.  Those who got on it before the 20th week of pregnancy can get it.  To obtain it, however, it will be necessary to contact the RUSZN. </p><p>  What are the benefits for pregnant women in addition to the above?  The largest of all compensations is due to the moment of leaving on <span>maternity leave,</span> which occurs at the <span>30th week of pregnancy</span> (the exception is those who expect twins, then this period comes earlier).  This is the so-called maternity leave.  By default, its duration is 140 days.  During this time, a woman has the right to receive compensation equal to her salary for the same period of time, but not more than 186,986.80 rubles.  In the case of complicated births, the duration of this leave is increased by sixteen days, and in the case of the appearance of several babies, by forty days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the baby appears before 30 weeks, postpartum leave will last 156 days, not 70, as in normal cases.  Additional days are paid according to the same scheme as the main part of the vacation. </p><p>  Unemployed maternity benefits are not paid (even to those on the labor exchange).  Students are paid a scholarship during this period. </p><h4><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Maternity allowance" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10434/90037.jpg" width="529"></div>  What are the benefits for pregnant women who do not work? </h4><p>  If a woman is not employed while waiting for the baby, due to the fact that the company where she worked is liquidated, she does not lose her right to benefit.  Payment will be made from the federal budget. </p><p>  If the expectant mother is registered at the labor exchange, then before the gestational age of 30 weeks she is entitled to receive <span>unemployment benefits.</span>  Prenatal and postpartum leave will not be paid. </p><h4>  What can I expect after childbirth? </h4><p>  The appearance of the baby gives parents the right to receive a <span>one-time allowance,</span> which is paid at the place of work.  By the way, if a young mother does not work, and her husband is employed, he can receive a payment. </p><p>  If both parents are not officially employed or are students, they should contact the Social Protection Center. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  These payments can be obtained by living in any region of the country.  In certain constituent entities of the Russian Federation, young parents are entitled to rely on local compensation as well. </p><p>  So, in Moscow, parents whose age does not exceed thirty years, are entitled to a fairly serious <span>financial assistance.</span>  This applies to those who have not the first baby born. </p>

    <h4>  Payments for children </h4><p>  When postpartum leave is completed, another sets in - for child care.  It lasts until the child is three years old, but is paid up to one and a half.  <span>The amount of payments</span> depends on the salary that the mother received before the decree (40% of it).  The maximum payment for this vacation is limited to 16,241 rubles. </p><p>  For non-working mothers, the allowance for the baby is also relied on, albeit in a minimum amount.  For the first child, it is 2454 rubles, for the second - twice as much. </p><p>  Well, well, after this moment and before the baby is 3 years old, you can only rely on compensation, which is enough for a couple of bags of kefir, since it is 50 rubles. </p><p>  Knowing what payments are due to pregnant women and those who have already become a mother, you can get a solid increase in the family budget, which is so in need. </p>
