Therefore, for any holiday homemade monkeys will be in place.  A handmade gift was always valued more than what was bought.  Think about which material you work the easiest, and get started. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="homemade monkeys" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41737/1297334.jpg" width="450"></div></h2><h2>  Polymer clay </h2><p>  Polymer clay is a good material for beginners of needlework.  It easily takes any form, and if you know how to work with plasticine, then cope with the task.  Clay monkey will turn out in the presence of: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Polymer clay of brown, yellow and black colors.  This is to create the animal itself.  Any shade is suitable for a scarf and hat. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Acrylic paints in black and white. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Brushes. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Stacks or improvised materials such as forks, knives, and other items with sharp edges. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Knife. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Magnet. </p><h2>  How to make a clay monkey </h2><p>  1. Take the brown polymer clay and make an oval for the body and a circle for the head.  These are the main details.  Press the top of the oval with your fingers so that you can easily stick a circle there. </p><p>  2. Connect the parts together. </p><p>  3. Slip the two tabs together.  These are ‚Äúsausages‚Äù that narrow downward. </p><p>  4. Make a tail. </p><p>  5. From the yellow polymer clay, sculpt the face.  It can be just an oval, half the size of the head or tapering down. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  6. Make a small circle for the eyelet and squeeze it slightly from the bottom.  Using the same principle, create a second ear. </p><p>  7. Eyes can be made of black clay.  If you have black beads, then use it. </p><p>  8. Make a small brown triangle - this is the nose. </p><p>  9. Stack draw a monkey smile. </p><p>  10. Using a needle, depict the monkey's hair, drawing strokes. </p><p>  Homemade monkeys are molded by this principle.  Then they need to be decorated </p><h2>  Decorating Ideas </h2><p>  From different colors of polymer clay, you can create jewelry for a monkey: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Blind a wreath for the animal. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Put a branch, banana, or other fruit in the monkey‚Äôs legs. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Blind hat and scarf. </p>

    <p>  Paints will help to complete the work, draw details.  Carefully read the instructions on the packaging with polymer clay and bake the craft. </p><h2>  Beads </h2><p>  Beadwork is a simple and very entertaining task.  Basic knowledge will help you create not only figures, but also jewelry, decoration elements.  A bead monkey can be made even without using fishing line.  Draw a picture of the animal on thick paper.  Calibrate the beads of the desired color.  This is important because all the details will be visible.  Now you just glue the necessary colors on the cardboard.  A good option for those who can draw. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To weave a monkey from beads, you will need: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Beads of red, black, orange. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Fishing line. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Scissors. </p><h2>  Making a bead monkey </h2><p>  1. String 13 red beads on the wire. </p><p>  2. The second end passes approximately through the center of all beads.  The ends of the wire should be directed towards each other. </p><p>  3. Now string one orange, five red and another orange bead.  The second end of the wire goes through them. </p><p>  4. The fourth row of weaves in this order: red, yellow, black, yellow, black, yellow, red bead. </p><p>  5. Fifth row: red, two yellow, black, two yellow, red. </p><p>  6. At one end we put on eight beads.  We fix between the second and third row, then we pass the wire down.  Same thing with the second end.  It turned out ears. </p><p>  7. Now, by the same principle, we continue to weave the torso.  First comes a row with six red beads, then with eight. </p><p>  8. On one end string 11 beads and pass through them back without grabbing the last.  Same thing with the other hand. </p><p>  9. Then follows two rows of eight red beads. </p><p>  10. The next row is four red, one black and four more red beads. </p><p>  11. Then nine red. </p><p>  12. On one end, string 19 red beads and do the same as with the paws. </p><p>  13. Now, on the end on which the tail was, we string two beads, and six on the other.  The first end we fix four beads of the second. </p><p>  14. It should turn out that there are two beads on each side to the wire. </p><p>  15. String 15 beads on each end and return without grabbing the last.  The legs turned out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Homemade monkeys from beads can serve as a keychain, which will always remind of the symbol of the New Year or the giver.  The color scheme can be changed. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bead monkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/1297371.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Salty dough </h2><p>  We make a monkey from the dough called salty.  This is a special mixture that can replace gypsum or clay.  You can create an animal in the same way as it was made from polymer clay.  Only in the end will have to be painted manually. </p><p>  You will need: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Salty dough. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Paints. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Stack. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Thick thread. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Glue. </p><p>  Working process: </p><p>  1. Blind a small oval, which will play the role of the body. </p><p>  2. Now make an oval for the head and another smaller one for the face. </p><p>  3. From two circles the size of a muzzle make ears. </p><p>  4. Correct the muzzle and make an heart out of an oval. </p><p>  5. Roll up three small balls for the eyes and nose. </p><p>  6. Stack out the mouth. </p><p>  7. Make a tummy in the shape of a circle.  In size, it is equal to the ears.  And glue a circle on it. </p><p>  8. Make a hairstyle. </p><p>  9. Draw a muzzle, creating a strip between the nose and mouth. </p><p>  10. We depict the wool in stacks, drawing strokes. </p><p>  11. We sculpt a butterfly. </p><p>  12. For the paws on the legs, form a triangle, slightly bend the edges, make the fingers a match.  For the paws on the hands - the same thing, only smaller. </p><p>  13. Paint the details. </p><p>  Now connect the legs to the body.  But it will be much more interesting if the thread plays the role of legs and arms.  Homemade monkeys from salt dough are ready.  It remains to wait until the work hardens. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a monkey" class="if" height="201" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41737/1297331.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><h2>  Wool </h2><p>  Wool monkeys are very similar to living ones and look good in the interior.  For work you will need: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Wool brown, white, yellow, sand, bright yellow and light yellow. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Felting needles (No. 36, 40, 38). </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Glass eyes, felting mat. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Wire. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Artificial eyelashes. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ Super glue. </p><h2>  Create a wool monkey </h2><p>  1. Roll the oval and circle together.  You should get a head shape. </p><p>  2. In the shape of an oval, make a body, roll it to the head. </p><p>  3. Add volume to the body. </p><p>  4. Tint everything except the muzzle with brown hair.  Muzzle should be sand.  Draw a smile. </p><p>  5. Make nostrils and rest against the muzzle, form eye openings. </p><p>  6. Shade the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe nose bridge. </p><p>  7. Glue the eyes. </p><p>  8. Roll the blanks for the eyelids and insert them into place. </p><p>  9. Around the eyes, tint with light yellow hair. </p><p>  10. Make your eyes sharp with white wool.  Roll a little to the bottom of the eye. </p><p>  11. Correct wrinkles on the face. </p><p>  12. Bare your ears. </p><p>  13. Add some body hair to the abdomen and chest. </p><p>  14. Coat the wire with wool, make the shape of arms and legs, roll them to the body. </p><p>  15. Create fingers from the wire. </p><p>  16. Add some fur to make your fingers voluminous and more realistic. </p><p>  17. Sand the legs with needles. </p><p>  18. Roll them into place. </p><p>  19. Treat the monkey with the No. 40 reverse needle. </p><p>  20. Tint with dry pastel. </p><p>  2nd.  Create a banana.  Do it yourself fruit and four pieces of peel.  Then unite together and put in the claws of a monkey. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="we sculpt a monkey from the dough" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41737/1297332.jpg" width="413"></div></h2><h2>  Other materials </h2><p>  Homemade monkeys are made from different materials.  The most accessible to everyone is paper.  You can work in different techniques: quilling, scrapbooking, origami, modules.  The first is especially noteworthy, because you can create almost any picture, and there are no difficulties in this.  A technique commonly used to decorate postcards.  Find a beautiful image of a monkey, pick colors and create. </p><p>  With a monkey, you can even entertain a child.  Dip your baby‚Äôs pen in brown paint and attach to a sheet of paper.  Now imagine that the thumb is the head and the rest are the paws that hold onto the branch.  Finish the composition or glue it. </p>
