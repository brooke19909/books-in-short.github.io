    <h2>  Toshiba </h2><p>  Continuing to study the best brands of TVs, we will return to Japanese quality again.  This time, it is proposed to consider products sold under the Toshiba brand.  Devices stood out with modern equipment.  The company develops the technologies used independently.  Of particular note is the Toshiba Places smart system.  It allows you to create multiple accounts, thanks to which you can restrict access to certain functions.  This application is ideal for monitoring children, since you can put a ban on some content.  The devices are also equipped with quick access to social networks.  You can set the necessary settings in your account. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Which brand of TV is better, everyone can decide only individually.  Of course, there are certain criteria that it is recommended to pay special attention to, but buyers can designate their importance on their own, based on personal preferences.  Indeed, at the time of purchase, as a rule, a lot of decides the ratio of price and quality, since not every domestic consumer is able to pay a fortune for a TV, even if it is equipped with the latest technologies.  And, as you know, world-famous brands are slightly overpricing their prices. </p>
