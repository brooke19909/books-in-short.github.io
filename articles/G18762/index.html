    <p>  Why do all lovers of good fishing strive to get into the "Big stones"?  The recreation center is located near Lake Vuoksa, which is rich in fish.  The depth of the reservoir reaches 25 meters.  There is practically no vegetation at the bottom.  Pike, burbot, perch, roach, bream and zander are well caught in the lake.  You can get a good catch if you sail away from the coast by boat. </p><p>  Big stones are also good for hunting.  The recreation center is surrounded by a pine forest.  It is better to bring equipment for hunting with you.  By agreement with local rangers, you can find out the places most suitable for hunting. </p><p>  To get to the base is not difficult.  You need to get to the village of Krotovo, behind which is the recreation center "Big stones".  Reviews about the complex can be found very different.  But mostly travelers note a special cozy atmosphere and friendly local service.  Well, fishing in these places is generally a pleasure. </p><p>  In the Far Eastern part of Russia is another region that is quite promising in terms of tourism.  The natural beauty of Primorye, the proximity of the Pacific coast make this region popular among tourists who want to relax away from civilization. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In Primorye there are many recreation centers that provide the opportunity to relax in comfortable conditions.
