    <p>  The focus of this article is the Sven MS 3000 system. Technical specifications and owner reviews, as well as a small overview of the functionality will allow the reader to get to know some of the best speakers on the domestic market better by the criterion of ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù. </p><h2>  First meeting </h2><p>  Sven never saved on packaging its products, so the speaker system was no exception.  The speakers are delivered in one box, which has gigantic dimensions and the same considerable weight.  Accordingly, buyers have many questions to the manufacturer regarding the large dimensions of the package.  On the other hand, the Sven MS 3000 speakers are well protected from shock and falls during transportation. </p>

    <p>  As for the configuration, it will satisfy even the most demanding customer.  Indeed, in addition to the speakers, the control unit and the remote control for it, in the box the user will find a power cable, interface audio connectors for connecting to a sound source and a cable for connecting speakers to an amplifier.  Also in the package there is an informative instruction.  It not only explains to the user how to make a connection, but also fully describes the work with the control unit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Sven MS 3000 speakers - worth 10,000 rubles - have very interesting indicators for their price category.  Firstly, the housing of the satellites and the subwoofer is made of wood and has magnetic shielding.  The second interesting factor is the size of the speakers themselves.  The low-frequency element has a diameter of 165 millimeters, and 22 and 90 mm speakers are installed in the stereo system. </p><p>  Both the speakers and the subwoofer have a bass reflex.  Satellites deliver 20 watts per channel, and a subwoofer is able to demonstrate 40 watts.  The owner will be pleased with the frequency range, it is 35-25 000 Hz.  As for the distribution, the subwoofer is given a range of 35-150 Hz, and all other frequencies are assigned to the satellites. </p><h2>  Speaker functionality </h2><p>  The portability of multimedia speakers is due to the presence of USB 2.0, which the manufacturer has placed on the body of the control unit of the Sven MS 3000 system. Owner reviews claim that the built-in audio player copes with any type of data.  In addition to the USB interface on the case, you can also find a card reader, however, it only understands the SD format.  But no one forbids the owner to use adapters. </p>

    <p>  For the entertainment of the user, an unusual FM tuner is also present in the <span>speaker system</span> .  In addition to playing music, he can record the broadcast on memory modules (USB or SD).  Quite an interesting solution from the company SVEN.  As for the built-in equalizer, it works efficiently, but most users prefer to independently adjust the high and <span>low frequencies</span> during playback. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Usability </h2><p>  The working area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe speaker control unit Sven 2.1 MS 3000 is convenient and quite functional.  <span>The volume control</span> seems huge compared to other components of the front of the panel, but its large dimensions only add convenience to the user, because it is easier to adjust the volume.  The manufacturer also made the frequency control regulators comfortable and dimensional, although their size is half that of the volume control panel.  On the front panel, the owner will find 4 buttons.  They are designed to control music playback.  The size of these buttons is small, but it is quite convenient to cope with acoustics without a remote control. </p>

    <p>  The rear panel is designed to connect speakers and a subwoofer to the amplifier.  The manufacturer simplified the user‚Äôs work by installing spring-loaded contacts.  This solution allows the owner to independently calculate the cable length and install speakers at any distance from the <span>head unit.</span>  <span>The line input</span> for connecting to the playback device is made in the form of RCA contacts. </p><h2>  Remote control </h2><p>  Acoustics Sven MS 3000 comes complete with a remote control.  It may look inconspicuous, but users, judging by their reviews, have no questions about it.  A small device is capable of turning speakers on and off, adjusting the volume, or completely turning it off.  You can select the sound source (line-in, USB, SD or FM) from the remote control.  Accordingly, for each mode there is a functional, which is controlled by the same buttons. </p>

    <p>  Also, the remote control is equipped with ten numbered keys.  Their purpose is not clear to all customers, but the manufacturer assures in their instructions that ease of use is obvious - you can choose the position of the desired composition, manually enter the broadcast channel of your favorite radio wave and configure the built-in clock. </p><h2>  Visual inspection </h2><p>  Regarding the appearance of acoustics Sven MS 3000 Cherry user reviews have no negative.  The build quality is decent, with a visual inspection it will not be possible to detect any defects or distortions in the joints of wooden surfaces.  The color "cherry" is the best suited to these columns. </p><p>  The speakers are equipped with removable pads that protect the speakers from damage and dust.  They dress and take off easily, so that the user can radically change the look of their acoustics at any time.  Music lovers will also like the speakers themselves: </p><ol><li>  They can be easily removed from the wooden case of the column (you need to unscrew a couple of screws). </li><li>  The tweeter is made according to the Hi-Fi standard - the emitter is fabric, not plastic, as is often the case in low-cost devices. </li><li>  The huge emitter of the subwoofer also has a fabric base and does not jump at the base of the enclosure during operation. </li></ol><h2>  Sound rating </h2><p>  The quality of music playback speakers Sven MS 3000 reviews are different.  The fact is that the manufacturer, unlike competitors, did not pursue high volume.  The emphasis was placed on sound quality: the subwoofer has no inserts or holes.  Because of this, the bass sounds harsh, without vagueness.  Convenience for many users is that the subwoofer can be installed in any room without fear for resonances and extraneous vibrations of the surrounding furniture.  On the other hand, in comparison with similar competitors' products that have the same power, the SVEN representative sounds 20-30% quieter. </p>

    <p>  As for the frequency range, here the speakers are able to fully reveal their potential - the subwoofer reproduces only its frequencies, and stereo speakers claim only their own range.  This will really please all music lovers.  To improve the sound quality of the speaker, it is recommended to set it at the level of 0.7-1.2 meters from the floor (the manufacturer supplied them with loops for wall mounting). </p><h2>  Feedback </h2><p>  Many owners believe that the Sven MS 3000 <span>subwoofer</span> is the key to playing high-quality <span>speaker</span> music.  His work is compared with subwoofers, which are equipped with 5.1 systems.  An interesting analogy, because these are different classes of sound systems.  As for the potential of the amplifier and the speakers themselves, there is an additional power reserve and it is about 20%.  Apparently, the manufacturer has set the volume limiter to extend the life of the speakers. </p>

    <p>  The tuner FM deserves negative reviews.  He plays the radio station without complaints, but with the search for waves he has obvious problems.  In the case of a poor coverage area or in the presence of metal structures in the room, the owner needs to think about a decent antenna that will help solve problems with a low signal.  Some users also have a problem with the electronic clock that is present on the control unit - the battery runs out quickly and the time freezes.  The problem with the contacts inside the case is already known to the manufacturer, so this is a service case. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The Sven MS 3000 speaker system worth 10,000 rubles will certainly attract the attention of many music lovers.  Indeed, in terms of sound quality, she does not have many competitors in the budget class.  Beautiful appearance, high-quality assembly, functionality and convenient controls only add appeal to these columns.  There are several drawbacks that relate to the sound volume and the operation of electronic devices, but this, according to many experts, is a secondary factor that does not affect the interests of music lovers.  After all, all acoustics are primarily purchased on the basis of the ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù criterion, and with this the Sven product is in full order. </p>
