Crochet thread</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A necessary step in crocheting is the ability to create a variety of cords.  They are a rather important part in a variety of products.  They are used both as a functional part of wardrobe items, and as a decorative finish.  For the design of embroideries, pillowcases for pillows for sofas, this skill is also useful.  Crocheted cords are easy to perform, the work on their manufacture takes very little time, and the result will pleasantly surprise you. </p><h2>  For what purposes is it used </h2><p>  As mentioned above, a lot of applications have been found for cords of yarn: from ties on cardigans and hats to simple fringing.  For example, caterpillar cords are the favorite of almost all knitters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="caterpillar cord" class="if uuid-2948446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2948446.jpg"></div><p>  It is with their help that a beautiful <span>Romanian lace is created,</span> otherwise called "lace".  They also make up the main part in the patterned fabric when knitting with Irish technique. </p><p>  Having connected the "caterpillar", you can make belts, straps, handles of bags or covers for cell phones.  From it you will create designer exclusive hair clips for hairstyles, jewelry, etc. </p><p>  The surface of such a lace is embossed, dense, the edges are rounded, and the elasticity is completely absent. </p><p>  Cord Ai-cord.  Its surface is similar to facial knitting.  This is not just a smooth lace, it is very elastic because of its texture.  It is perfect for decorating knitwear. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Flat cords with a decorative purpose are knitted to decorate clothes, for example, the straps of swimsuits, tops, belts, as well as handles of bags, decoration of any things.  They are knitted from yarn of almost any kind: it all depends on the purpose. </p><h2>  Popular views </h2><p>  Creating a cord with a hook and yarn is an absolutely easy process.  Crocheting cords according to the schemes and description is within the power of everyone.  You can even start teaching needlework with them.  But there are many methods for their manufacture, which are not at all easy. </p><p>  The most famous and simple: </p><ul><li>  Cords connected by a set of air loops.  Thick yarn is ideal for them. </li><li>  Complicated cords, when previously knit a chain of the desired length from air loops, and then complement it with half-columns.  Such a lace is not much thicker, but much denser. </li><li>  Openwork cords - a chain of air loops, tied with a combination of single crochet columns or crocheted columns.  How to knit such a product, you can understand using the attached patterns and descriptions. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.sheruknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorative cord" class="if uuid-2948431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2948431.jpg"></div><p>  Simple cords are easy to make, even with your eyes closed, but sophisticated options require some practice. </p><p>  We suggest you crochet several cords according to the schemes and description added below in the article.  Here we give different ways: from simple to more complex. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Yarn suitable for work </h2><p>  The most important question will be to decide which yarn is best for work and how to choose a hook.  Naturally, you could tie the cord from any material, from plastic ropes to twine, the final goal is important: why do you create it? </p><p>  Mercerized cotton yarn is amazing, its texture is pronounced, and its elasticity is very small.  Therefore, if you need a tight, inelastic cord, take it. </p><p>  For delicate, delicate products and cords should be appropriate.  Threads like Iris, Chamomile, Violets, etc. </p><p>  To work with a hook, the yarn is twisted, smooth, elastic.  Otherwise, the thread will split into fibers, fluff and spoil the appearance of the products. </p><p>  You can also take wool yarn for knitting cords. </p><div class="photo" data-original="weefolkart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="yarn for cords" class="if uuid-2948578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2948578.jpg"></div><p>  Another wonderful type of yarn is blended.  As the name implies, these are several types of threads connected into one: woolen and acrylic, cotton and acrylic, wool with microfiber, etc. </p><p>  As you can see, almost all <span>types of threads</span> are suitable <span>.</span>  The only exception is mohair.  Very fluffy, it does not highlight the virtues of weaving, but hides them.  In case of an error, the product cannot be dissolved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hooks for the cords are selected, focusing on how thick the threads were chosen.  A thick thread is a thick hook, and vice versa.  If you are tormented by doubts, take a look at the label: the numbers of hooks and knitting needles for which it is suitable are written on the yarn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stitch-story.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="half-string cord" class="if uuid-2948420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2948420.jpg"></div><p>  The diameter of the cords is affected by the thickness of the yarn.  From a thin one you will knit the corresponding product, and a thick one will give a larger dimension in the section. </p><h2>  Crocheting a cord: thin "caterpillar" </h2><p>  To get it, at the beginning of the work you need to make a free loop and knit another one.  Now in the first we stretch the thread and get 2 loops.  They need to be knitted alone. </p><p>  Turn the work and find the double loop on the side.  Pull the thread through it, creating a loop.  Knit them together again. </p><p>  We turn the knitting again and again we find a double loop - here we enter the hook and pull the thread.  We got two loops - we knit them together.  So repeat until the length becomes what you need. </p><h2>  Creating a wide caterpillar </h2><p>  Knitting a thick cord goes almost the same way as a thin one, it is only slightly complicated. </p><p>  First, pick up three loops.  We hook through the loop 2 and hook the thread at work, pulling the loop, and then into the loop 3 and also form a loop.  We have 3 loops on the hook.  We pick up the thread and knit them all together. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rensfibreart.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting &quot;caterpillars&quot;" class="if uuid-2954172" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2954172.jpg"></div><p>  We turn the knitting and continue on.  We enter a crochet into a double loop, which is formed when knitting the last loop, pull the thread.  Next, we enter the double loop on the side of the cord and pull the thread.  Again, we knit three loops together. </p><p>  We expand the product and continue to work according to the above scheme.  Tie your cord this way until you reach the required length. </p><h2>  Crocheted elastic cord </h2><p>  Ai-cord is considered the easiest to create.  The end result is excellent: a round cross-section, a surface indistinguishable from knitting with needles and greater elasticity. </p><p>  How to crochet a cord?  At the beginning of the work, a chain of three air loops is dialed.  We enter the hook into the second and pull the thread - two loops on the hook.  Now we pull the thread through the first loop in the chain - three loops on the hook.  We will remove two of them by holding them with our fingers, and then we will knit them: first the first, then the second, and then the third, which is on the hook.  We got three loops again.  Take off two of them again and do the same manipulations as before. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jodegenhart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cord ah - cord" class="if uuid-2948423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2948423.jpg"></div><p>  After tying the cord to the desired length, fasten all the loops with a knot, and tighten the tail of the thread inside the product. </p><p>  Teach your child to knit such cords, and he will be able to create unique accessories for himself with his own hands! </p><h2>  Decorative flat crochet cords: diagrams and description </h2><p>  More difficult to create are flat products.  To crochet such a cord according to the scheme and description, some skills and abilities are needed. </p><p>  As always, first you need to connect a chain of air loops (four is enough).  In the loop number 1, we knit 1 crochet post.  How to knit it, you can see in the photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet" class="if uuid-2948508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2948508.jpg"></div><p>  Next from the top we knit a chain of three air loops.  In the resulting ring, knit 7 double crochet.  Now three air lifting loops, a single crochet column knit in an arch and turn around.  Three more loops of lifting and knit 7 double crochets in the arch, knit three loops and fasten the single crochet in the last stitch of the previous row.  Continue to get the required length. </p><h2>  Cord with "hearts" </h2><p>  This decorative lace is made up of lush hearts.  It has a very large volume and is used to decorate things.  Relate this work to a more complex one, therefore we give a detailed description of the stages. </p><ol><li>  First, we knit a chain of four loops and put on a working thread.  Insert the hook into loop 1 of the chain and make a loop, pulling it to the fourth in a row. </li><li>  Again, the crochet, the hook goes into the same loop, and pull another loop.  We do such loops four more times. </li><li>  In total, we get five loops and five elongated loops forming together a bundle. </li><li>  The next step is to knit these loops, grabbing one by one in two and stretching the working thread through them.  So repeat four times.  Thus, we connect one side of the link. </li><li>  Let's turn the work and repeat all the manipulations already done on the one hand: we stretch long loops, alternating them with crochets, and then knit in two. </li><li>  At the end there are three loops - we connect them one.  All, one "heart" tied. </li><li>  To move on to the next, dial three air loops. </li><li>  We form a new link-heart by introducing a hook and pulling long loops from the loop that connects the last three previous ‚Äúhearts‚Äù. </li><li>  We continue knitting in the same way as in the first case. </li></ol><p>  Tie the required number of links and break the thread. </p><p>  This is how you can tie a wide variety of cords.  Easier or harder, wider or narrower - choose for yourself! </p>
