More precisely, how to connect certain services and refuse them.  In fact, many users of the MTS network are asking this question.  After all, you have to pay for all connected packages and offers.  And the information that comes to the phone is sometimes useless.  Therefore, now we will need to study the possibilities of "News" and "Weather".  How to disable "MTS-info" in this case?  What do you need to connect?  How much does this or that service cost?  All this will be discussed later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable pay info" class="if" height="246" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130649.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Immediately discuss the cost of "MTS-info."  The thing is that any service in this service at the current time costs 6 rubles.  This is including VAT.  In principle, it‚Äôs not very expensive if you consider a day subscription.  And a tidy sum runs up a month.  And this is not very pleasing to subscribers. </p><p>  Therefore, instead of paying 6 rubles for 1 offer per day, it is better to think about how to disable MTS-info.  All the necessary information like interesting news and weather forecasts can be easily found somehow differently.  And absolutely free. </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  But first you need to connect yourself to paid subscriptions.  Without this, disconnecting them simply will not work.  How to realize the idea?  MTS-info has its own USSD request for each service package.  You need to know them.  Or you will have to work with the Mobile Assistant service for a long time, which helps to enable and disable the MTS-info functions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To subscribe to the "News", you must dial the combination * 111 * 4766 # from your mobile device.  After sending the request, you will be charged 6 rubles for the upcoming day.  And after that a message will come with interesting news.  True, it is not a fact that they will be to your taste. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable the mts info service" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130650.jpg"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <p></p>
    <p>  "Weather" is connected via * 111 * 4761 #.  In response, you will receive daily weather reports the next day.  But pay attention - information is provided only within the area where the SIM card was registered.  The weather forecast does not depend on your current situation. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of the MTS-info service is that with a one-time connection, the subscription fee will be automatically deducted from the account until you fill out a request to refuse one or another service.  It turns out that there are no conditions for disabling functions as unnecessary.  Not very convenient, but that's how the system works.  You should independently think how to disconnect "MTS-info". </p><h2>  Call Failure </h2><p>  You can offer a rather unpopular, but very effective method of refusing one or another paid subscription.  It's about calling the operator.  To reach MTS, you need to dial 0890 and wait until they answer you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next, inform the operator that you want to unsubscribe from the "News" and "Weather".  The employee will check for connectivity.  In the case when the subscription is really issued, the employee will fill out a request for disconnection.  The answer is not long in coming - you will receive an alert.  This process is absolutely free.  But he, as already mentioned, does not enjoy the huge love of the subscriber.  After all, sometimes it‚Äôs easier to unsubscribe from paid services on your own. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable pay info weather" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130648.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  For news </h2><p>  How to disable "MTS-info" ("News")?  There is a special USSD request for this.  As already mentioned, similar features are available on all paid subscriptions.  And just this layout is more popular with all users. </p><p>  In order to once and for all cancel the MTS Info news messages, you will have to form the command * 111 * 1212 * 2 #.  If you send this request for processing, then after a while the problem with the subscription will be resolved.  In response, you will receive a notification about the successful processing of the operation.  Just what you need!  So we learned how to disable MTS News-Info.  But that is not all. </p><h2>  For the weather </h2><p>  How to disable "MTS-info" ("Weather")?  In the same way as in the previous case.  That is, with the help of a special team that will be sent from your phone.  This process does not require a fee and is extremely fast. </p><p>  To refuse the Weather service, dial * 111 * 4751 #.  And all problems will be solved very quickly.  In addition, this subscription can be removed using the SMS request.  To do this, write 2 in the text of the message and send it to 4741. If you are in roaming, you will be charged as for regular SMS.  If you are within a city or region, then, as already mentioned, the process will be free.  In the end, you will receive a message in which the result of the operation will be indicated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable pay news info" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130647.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  We leave for the office </h2><p>  If you don‚Äôt know how to turn off the MTS-info service and don‚Äôt really want to think about this task, you can contact the nearest MTS office for help.  There you will quickly be helped to unsubscribe from the package or to connect some new function. </p><p>  Go to the MTS mobile phone salon, where you inform about your intentions to abandon the Weather and the News.  Ask your operator for help.  Next, you will have to give your mobile employee to the office for some time.  He will fill out an application for "unsubscribing" and return the device to you.  By the way, this process also does not require any kind of payment.  Keep this in mind. </p><h2>  Through the site </h2><p>  Still wondering how to disable the MTS-info service?  Then the MTS page may come to the rescue.  There is a "Personal Account", which allows you to manage all services connected on the SIM card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable messages mts info" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1130646.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In order to squirm from "News" and "Weather", go through the authorization on the site and click on the inscription "Services".  Find relevant subscriptions there.  On the right side of the screen, click on "Disable".  In the window that appears, enter the request confirmation code, which will be sent to your mobile phone as an SMS message, and then click on "OK."  The result is not long in coming.  From now on, we know how to disable MTS-info messages. </p>
