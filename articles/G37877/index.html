    <h2>  What is subcutaneous fat? </h2><p>  Under the skin layer, fatty tissue creates something like a soft lining, which provides not only cushioning, but also thermal insulation.  In addition, the fabric performs other, no less important functions.  However, some of them can do much harm. </p><p>  It has long been established that subcutaneous fat is formed by a certain type of <span>connective tissue.</span>  This is its main feature.  It is known that a huge amount of fat can be contained in the human body.  This figure sometimes reaches tens of kilograms. </p>

    <h2>  How much body fat is there? </h2><p>  It should be noted that subcutaneous fat is distributed unevenly throughout the human body.  In women, it is usually located in the buttocks and thighs, as well as in a smaller amount in the chest area.  In men, fat accumulates in other places.  This includes the area of ​​the abdomen and chest.  It was found that in relation to body weight, the weight of fatty tissue is: for women - 25%, and for men - 15%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The greatest thickness of the tissue is observed in the abdomen, thighs and chest.  This indicator in these places can reach more than 5 centimeters.  The thinnest subcutaneous fat in the genital area and eyelids. </p>

    <h2>  Energy function </h2><p>  What are the functions of subcutaneous fat known?  First of all, it is worth noting the energy.  This is one of the main goals of fatty tissue.  It is for this function that this fabric is needed. </p><p>  During fasting, the body must receive energy.  Where to get it if there is no food?  Fat is an energy-intensive substrate.  He is able to give the body energy for normal functioning.  It is worth noting that 1 gram of subcutaneous fat can give a person 9 kcal.  This amount of energy is enough to overcome several tens of meters at a fairly fast pace. </p><h2>  Heat insulation </h2><p>  A tissue containing fat is very poor in transmitting heat that comes from the human body.  This is very important for the body.  Subcutaneous fat in this case performs a heat-insulating function.  Such capabilities of our body are relevant when lowering the temperature. </p><p>  However, experts have found that similar functions of subcutaneous fat can have a negative effect.  A large amount of fat can spoil not only the appearance, but also cause the development of diseases such as deforming osteoarthritis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Protective function of subcutaneous fat </h2><p>  Subcutaneous fat is developed in every healthy person.  This tissue is very important for our body.  After all, it performs many functions, including protective.  Fat is located not only under the dermis, but also envelops internal organs.  In this case, it protects them from tremors and softens impacts, and also protects them from exposure to sufficiently high temperatures.  The thicker the layer of adipose tissue, the more energy it will take away from the hot object. </p><p>  In addition, fatty tissue provides mobility of the skin.  This allows you to compress them or stretch them.  This ability protects the tissue from tears and other injuries. </p>

    <h2>  Accumulation </h2><p>  This is another function that subcutaneous fat performs.  However, in some cases, this ability of the tissue can harm the body.  It accumulates not only fat, but also those substances that are easily dissolved in it, for example, estrogen hormones, as well as vitamins of groups E, D and A. On the one hand, this is not bad.  However, in men who have a sufficiently large layer of subcutaneous fat, their own testosterone production is significantly reduced.  But this hormone is important for their health. </p><h2>  Hormone-producing function </h2><p>  Scientists have proved that subcutaneous fat can not only accumulate estrogens in themselves, but also produce them independently.  The greater the thickness of a given tissue, the more hormones it synthesizes.  As a result of this, a vicious circle is created.  Men are at risk.  After all, estrogens are able to suppress the production of androgens.  Which, in turn, leads to the appearance of a condition that is characterized by a decrease in the production of sex hormones, since the work of the sex glands is significantly impaired. </p><p>  In addition, in the cells of adipose tissue there is aromatase - a special enzyme that is involved in the synthesis of estrogen.  The most active tissue in this regard is located in the buttocks and thighs.  It is worth noting that subcutaneous fat is also capable of producing leptin.  This substance is a unique hormone responsible for the feeling of fullness.  With leptin, the body is able to regulate the amount of fat located under the skin. </p>

    <h2>  Varieties and structure of fatty tissue </h2><p>  <span>The structure of subcutaneous fat is</span> unique.  In the human body, two types of this tissue are distinguished: brown and white.  The latter variety is found in large quantities.  If you look at a piece of subcutaneous fat under a microscope, then without much difficulty, you can consider slices clearly separated from each other.  Between them there are jumpers.  This is connective tissue. </p><p>  In addition, you can see nerve fibers and, of course, blood vessels.  The main structural component of adipose tissue is adipocyte.  This is a cell that has a slightly concave or rounded shape.  In diameter, it can reach 50 - 200 microns.  In the cytoplasm, it contains accumulations of lipids.  In addition to these substances, proteins and water are present in the cell.  Adipocytes (fat cells) also contain lipids.  The amount of proteins from the total mass of the cell is from about 3 to 6%, and water - not more than 30%.  Among other things, the hypodermis contains a large number of lymphatic vessels. </p><p>  Subcutaneous fat is an important component of the human body, performing a lot of useful and necessary functions. </p>
