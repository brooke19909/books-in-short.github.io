Crossing the Alps</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the Russian Empire is full of various trials and tipping points.  Many true heroes and real men were ready to give their lives for the well-being of their homeland.  One of the Russian commanders, the founders of military art was Alexander Suvorov.  Everyone knows that this is a real fighter who was strong in spirit and did not lose a single battle, even when the number of enemy troops was significantly greater than his own.  At the end of the XVIII century, Alexander Suvorov made the transition through the Alps.  The Russian emperor instructed the commander to transfer troops to Switzerland in order to connect them with the corps in which compatriots were.  Three weeks later, the hero of Russia went on a campaign. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Suvorov crossing the alps" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/322212.jpg" width="385"></div>

    <h2>  Tells a story </h2><p>  Many are still debating whether Suvorov did the right thing.  Was crossing the Alps really necessary?  But the commander carefully planned everything and carried out the order of the emperor himself.  It should be noted that this campaign played an important role for the Russian-French war and was a continuation of the Italian offensive.  In addition to the fact that Russian troops came from the north of Italy, a part of the Austrian soldiers also went with them.  <span>Suvorov crossing the Alps</span> (year 1799) was carried out in order to inflict a significant blow on the flank and rear of the French troops.  Alexander was always famous for the speed of his decisions, surprise, onslaught and ruthlessness, so for this case he chose just such methods.  His main goal was to overcome the path so soon as to take the enemy by surprise and deliver a decisive blow.  In this regard, the passage through the Alps was carried out through the heavy pass of Saint-Gotthard.  The whole operation took place in difficult conditions.  On the one hand, cruel nature, adverse weather conditions, and on the other - the treacherous behavior of the Austrians, constant disputes, battles, skirmishes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Legendary event </h2>

    <p>  Suvorov finished crossing the Alps on October 8, 1799, exactly 18 days after it began.  The skillful commander still managed to suddenly attack the French and inflict great damage on them, which was many times higher than his own losses.  It was because of the Swiss campaign that Alexander Suvorov became a real hero.  It was a turning point in his life and military service.  It should be noted that the French general admitted that he was ready to give all his campaigns only for the Swiss epic of A. Suvorov.  Arriving at home, the Russian commander received the rank of Generalissimo of all Russian troops.  In honor of the successful operation that Suvorov made (crossing the Alps), a granite cross twelve meters high was carved in Switzerland.  Alexander himself called his army ‚ÄúRussian bayonet‚Äù, which was able to gather all its forces and deliver a decisive blow, unexpected, strong and irreversible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crossing the alps" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/322417.jpg" width="368"></div>

    <h2>  What happened next? </h2><p>  Summing up, we can say that thanks to Suvorov‚Äôs campaign, the battle of Adda took place.  This event is a real feat.  Then the Russian army won for the first time during the campaign, perked up, believed in themselves and tuned in to new, absolutely incredible victories. </p>
