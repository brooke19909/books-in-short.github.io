  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The importance of photosynthesis for the existence of life on Earth</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The value of photosynthesis in nature for a long time was not fully estimated.  At the initial stage of the study, many scientists believed that plants emit as much oxygen as they absorb.  In fact, thorough research has shown that the work being done by plants is tremendous in scope.  With their relatively small size, green spaces perform a number of useful functions that are aimed at maintaining life on Earth. </p><p>  The most important value of photosynthesis is to provide energy to all living things on the planet, including humans.  In the <span>process of photosynthesis</span> in the green parts of plants under the influence of sunlight, oxygen and a huge amount of energy begin to form.  This energy is used by plants for their own needs only partially, and unspent potential is accumulated.  Then the plants go to feed herbivores, receiving due to this the necessary <span>nutrients,</span> without which their development will be impossible.  Then herbivores become food for predators, they also need energy, without which life will simply stop. </p><p>  A little away from this <span>food chain</span> is a person, therefore, for him, the true significance of photosynthesis does not immediately appear.  Just many people are trying to prove to themselves that they are not part of the animal world of our planet.  Unfortunately, such a denial will not lead to anything, since all living organisms depend to one degree or another on each other.  Several species of animals or plants should disappear - and the balance in nature will be greatly disturbed.  To adapt to new living conditions, other living organisms will be forced to look for alternative sources of nutrition.  True, there are cases when the extinction of some species leads to the extinction of others. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The importance of photosynthesis lies not only in energy production, but also in protecting the <span>ozone layer</span> from destruction.  Scientists have long tried to figure out how life began on our planet - and created a fairly plausible theory.  It turned out that the diversity of living organisms became possible only due to the presence of a protective atmosphere, which was formed due to the intense work of a huge number of plants.  Of course, with the size of modern forests and individual plants, one cannot believe in such a miracle, but ancient plants were of gigantic magnitude. </p><p>  The old giants of the plant world have perished, but even after death they benefit all of humanity.  The energy that has accumulated in them now comes into our homes in the form of coal.  Today, the role of this type of fuel has significantly decreased, but for a long time, mankind has been saved from the cold with it. </p><p>  Also, do not forget that ancient plants passed their baton to modern trees and flowers that support the preservation of the atmosphere.  The more green spaces on our planet, the cleaner the air we breathe.  The destruction of <span>tropical forests</span> and the increase of harmful <span>emissions into the atmosphere have</span> led to the appearance of holes in the ozone layer.  If humanity is not aware of the true role of photosynthesis, it will lead to self-destruction.  It‚Äôs just that we won‚Äôt survive without oxygen and protection, and the number of rainforests continues to decline rapidly. </p><p>  If people really want to save life on their planet, they must fully understand the meaning of photosynthesis.  When each individual person recognizes the importance of plants, when we stop thoughtlessly cutting down forests, then life on Earth will become better and cleaner.  Otherwise, people will have to learn to withstand the scorching rays of the sun, breathe smog, harmful emissions and receive energy from alternative sources. </p><p>  Only what is our future will be curled from us - and I want to believe that people will make the right choice. </p>
