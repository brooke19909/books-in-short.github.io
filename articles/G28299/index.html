    <h2>  Restaurant and Bar </h2><p>  As for food, this issue almost always causes a lot of controversy among guests in a variety of hotels in Turkey and other countries.  We could not pass this fate and the Kemer Botanik Resort Hotel 4 * hotel under consideration (Kemer).  So, some tourists in their comments say that the food in the hotel is neither quality nor a special variety.  However, most vacationers claim that in reality everything is different.  In their opinion, dissatisfied guests may have simply been to more expensive five-star hotels before.  Many guests are sure that the food in the Kemer Botanical Resort is consistent with the category and cost of the hotel.  According to them, the menu always had dishes of fish, meat, poultry, salads, snacks, sweets, fresh fruits.  However, a number of guests attributed the drawbacks to the fact that the tables with dishes in the restaurant were not very comfortable.  Therefore, with an influx of visitors, queues are often formed, which could have been avoided by setting tables a little differently.  Some of our compatriots expressed these considerations to the receptionists in the hope that this information will reach the hotel manager and the situation will change for the better.  Otherwise, most tourists had no complaints about the restaurant. </p>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Most tourists in their reviews note that Kemer Botanik Resort <span>Hotel 4 * (Turkey,</span> Kemer) has at its disposal a very good beach.  However, on the way to it you need to walk a couple of hundred meters along the road.  According to our compatriots, there is no sidewalk yet, so you have to go along the roadway, which is not entirely safe.  However, according to hotel employees, next year there will be a sidewalk, so there is nothing for future travelers to worry about.  As for the beach itself, it is small-pebble, quite large, with a gentle entry into the sea.  There is a bar, but most drinks are paid.  There is a sufficient number of comfortable sun loungers and parasols on the beach.  By the way, guests are warned that <span>beach towels</span> are available at an additional cost.  Therefore, if you want to save money, then grab them from home or purchase them upon arrival in Turkey in one of the many shops. </p><p>  A number of our compatriots also mention in their comments that the hotel beach is sometimes not very clean.  But they do not blame the staff responsible for cleaning the shore, but the vacationers, who often do not bother to throw cigarette butts, empty glasses and other garbage into the bins available in sufficient quantities. </p>
