    <p>  In fact, there is nothing complicated in knitting.  How to tie tracks like slippers?  Start with the basics.  Having connected your first scarf, you will want to create something more complicated, with a picture.  This article will discuss indoor moccasins that can be done in just a couple of evenings.  <span>Knitted slippers, slippers</span> require less time to manufacture.  Unlike socks, they are knitted much faster, and much less thread will be required. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By adding imagination, you can associate slippers of completely different shapes, sizes and colors, with or without a pattern.  You can also decorate in different ways: bows, rhinestones, beads, embroidery, buttons, pompons.  Moreover, you can pleasantly surprise with charming, soft and warm tracks not only yourself, but also your loved ones, friends, girlfriends. </p><h2>  Knitting needles </h2><p>  Let's study the knitting needles that you will need to tie the tracks (slippers).  Beginners should pay special attention to the choice of tools with which you plan to work.  Otherwise, your product may not look the way you want. </p><p>  To knit slippers on the knitting needles, of course, you need the right tools.  If you are going to tie tight, thick footprints, choose thinner knitting needles.  If the products are planned to be made airy or openwork, then the tool needs a thicker one.  As you can see, the choice of knitting needles depends on the type of knitting.  However, this also needs to be able to understand. </p>

    <p>  If you don‚Äôt know how to knit <span>slippers-traces</span> (tight, viscous or delicate openwork), then remember that the number is written on the yarn so that you can choose the optimal size of the tool.  We advise beginners in knitting not to experiment and follow the manufacturer's recommendations (the number of yarn should match the number of knitting needles). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sizing </h2><p>  Asking the question of how to tie the tracks as slippers, you first need to decide on the size of them.  How to do it right?  There is a very simple way that our grandmothers used: </p><ul><li>  Stand with one foot on a sheet of A4 paper. </li><li>  Circle the outline of your foot with a pen or pencil. </li><li>  Now you need to measure the distance between the most protruding points from the bottom and top of the foot in the resulting figure with a centimeter ruler.  Usually it is on the second or first finger (each person has a different way). </li><li>  After measurements, we determine the size.  Usually the 36th corresponds to a foot length of about 23 cm. Sizes 37-38 correspond to a mark of 24 cm. And the 40th will be equal to 25 centimeters. </li></ul><h2>  Choose the threads </h2><p>  Now there is a huge selection of threads for your creativity.  For each thing you need to be able to choose the right type of yarn.  The quality and general appearance of your future product directly depend on this.  In order to make slippers (footprints) knitted with needles, it is better to choose a dense, pleasant to the touch, soft yarn.  Great for slippers, wool with the addition of acrylic and pure wool.  Such products are the warmest and most comfortable to wear.  However, before using such a thread, we advise you to make sure that you or the person you are knitting for is not allergic to wool. </p>

    <p>  Otherwise, it is worth choosing cotton products.  How to tie footprints like slippers from material that does not stretch?  Everyone knows that a product that is related in size can turn out to be large due to the ability of the thread to stretch, and traces made of such material can shrink during washing.  In our case, mohair is perfect, as it is soft, light, warm and pleasant to wear. </p><h2>  Threads for kids </h2><p>  And for kids it is best to use a special children's acrylic.  It is definitely hypoallergenic and environmentally friendly.  This is important because children have especially delicate and sensitive skin.

    <p>  So: </p><ul><li>  We collect 56 loops on the needles. </li><li>  The first row: we knit 27 facial loops, after which we make a crochet (extra loop).  To do this, simply thread the needle.  Then we knit 2 front loops, again we crochet and we knit 27 loops.  Do not forget that the first loop in the row is not knitted, but simply removed on the knitting needle, and the last is always knitted as the wrong one.  This rule must be observed when knitting any thing. </li><li>  Second row: we knit all the <span>loops wrong.</span> </li><li>  Third row: we knit 28 front loops, then we make 2 crochets, we knit 2 front loops and we crochet again, then we again knit 28 loops. </li><li>  Fourth row: we knit all the loops as purl. </li></ul><p>  In this order, tie another 10 rows.  In the center of the front row, do not forget to make increases (double crochet, then 2 facial and double crochet).  15 row tie without increments.  16 row contains only the wrong loops.  17 row tie to the seventh loop of the front, not reaching the middle. </p><h2>  Getting started knitting the soles of our track </h2><p>  On an extra knitting needle, dial 14 loops and knit as follows: remove 1 loop (we already know that the first loop in a row is always removed and does not knit), then knit 12 facial loops, 1 loop from the sidewall and 1 central knit together. </p>

    <p>  Now flip your knitting to the other side.  Gradually collecting from the sidewalls of the loop, continue to knit.  There must be 14 stitches on your knitting needles.  Tie them in a 16 row pattern (described above).  Tie (sew) the footprints to the sidewalls. </p><p>  This is not the only way showing how to knit slippers-footprints.  Next, we will consider an alternative. </p><h2>  2 way </h2><p>  We present to your attention one more master class explaining how to knit slippers-footprints with knitting needles, for beginners.  It is lightweight and easy to understand.  <span>Handkerchief</span> is the main pattern in this description.  Its essence lies in the fact that all rows are knitted with facial loops.
