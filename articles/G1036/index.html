    <h2>  Reviews of tourists about the hotel itself, its territory and room stock </h2><p>  Our compatriots found the territory of Lavris Bungalos very well-groomed and well planned.  So, there are beautiful green lawns, bright flower beds, comfortable swings for adults and children, cute flashlights and much more.  Here you can not only take a walk, but also have an excellent photo shoot.  A playground is equipped for the youngest guests on site. </p><p>  As for the rooms in Lavris Hotel Bungalows 4 * (Heraklion), their travelers found it quite spacious and decorated simply, but very nicely.  According to our compatriots, it is noticeable that a renovation was recently carried out here.  The apartment has everything you need: a TV, fridge, hairdryer, etc. Air conditioning and other equipment are working properly.  The safe in the room can be used for a fee (about 20 euros for 7 days).  Wi-Fi access (EUR 4 per hour) is also available at an additional cost.  But many guests found this cost excessively high and chose to go to the next bar, where you can use the free Internet unlimitedly, ordering a cocktail or any other drink.  Experienced travelers also recommend those guests who want to go to bed early to check in when they check in without a pool view, since there is quite a noisy animation here until midnight.  Tourists also warn that in Crete there are a lot of mosquitoes in the summer.  Therefore, it is recommended to stock up on funds from these annoying insects in advance. </p><p>  As for cleaning the apartments, it is carried out very high quality and regularly.  Towels maids will change only if you throw dirty on the floor. </p><p>  The contingent in Lavris Bungalos (Heraklion, Crete, Greece) is mainly represented by Europeans.  Guests from the Russian Federation and other countries of the former Soviet Union can not be met here often. </p>

    <h2>  Impressions of travelers about the hotel staff </h2><p>  According to the vast majority of tourists, one of the advantages of Lavris Hotel Bungalows 4 *, undoubtedly, is its staff.  So, all the staff here are friendly, pleasant and attentive.  They are always ready to listen to you, answer any questions and help in any situation.  The only minor drawback for our compatriots was the fact that the staff here do not speak Russian.  The explanation is very simple - the main contingent of holidaymakers at the hotel is represented by Europeans.  However, this will not be a problem, since you can always easily communicate in basic English or German. </p><h2>  Guest reviews of beach vacations and entertainment </h2><p>  Since the Lavris Hotel Bungalows 4 * hotel is located at a sufficient distance from the coastline, it does not have its own beach.  The nearest municipal beach can be reached in 10-15 minutes by leisurely step.  Sun loungers and umbrellas are provided for a fee.  The beach is pebble and very clean.  Entering shallow water.  However, according to our compatriots, in the midst of the holiday season it is quite crowded here.  If you are not too lazy to walk about 500 meters along the coastline, you can settle down on a very clean and not crowded beach.  In addition, experienced travelers greatly praise the beaches in Hersonissos.  You can get to them both by bus and by rented car. </p><p>  There is a number of entertainments in the territory of the Lavris Bungalos hotel.  So, on its territory there are two swimming pools and sun terraces.  Near the large pool there is a bar with a wide selection of drinks for every taste.  However, according to some guests, they would recommend <span>the hotel administrator</span> to hire another bartender, since with a large influx of tourists, one cannot cope, as a result of which queues are formed. </p><p>  The hotel also has daytime and evening animations.  So, during the day, various fun games and competitions are held near the pool, and in the evenings themed dinners, shows and discos are organized. </p>
