    <p>  Before going to this beautiful place, you should familiarize yourself with some of the features of relaxation on Lake Balkhash. </p><h2>  Main advantages </h2><ol><li>  Amazing mild climate.  In these places, almost never rains.  The heat of 35 degrees is very well tolerated thanks to the light breeze that blows constantly. </li><li>  Great fishing.  Zander, roach, and common carp, and even catfish, live in the waters of the lake. </li><li>  Low prices for fruits in the summer. </li><li>  Residents of the Russian Federation can stay in the territory without registration for 30 days.  As a rule, this time is enough for a good rest. </li><li>  Housing prices are relatively inexpensive compared to holidays in the Black and Azov Seas. </li></ol><h2>  disadvantages </h2><ol><li>  The place is famous for its sandstorms.  It is impossible to predict them.  But I am glad that they last no more than 2 hours, after which there is complete silence. </li><li>  At night, the temperature drops to 15 degrees. </li><li>  Water temperature does not rise above 26 degrees, although there are exceptions, but very rarely. </li><li>  Mosquitoes can attack in the evening, but this issue is decided by the purchase of protective equipment. </li><li>  If you drive your own car, you can spend a lot of time going through customs. </li></ol>
