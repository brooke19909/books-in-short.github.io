    <p>  The territory of this region is located in the central part of Russia, in the southeast of the West Siberian Plain. </p><p>  The flora of the region is diverse.  Many species from Central Europe and North Asia are found here.  More than 20% of the region is forest and 17% is swamps.  The swampy taiga, consisting of coniferous forests, is located in the north of the region.  Mosses, lichens and ferns, many berries grow here.  In the forests south, birch, aspen, and pine prevail. </p><p>  Rest in the Novosibirsk region involves spending time in the bosom of amazing natural landscapes.  The region is characterized by a forest-steppe relief with pegs, where small birch-aspen forests are found in open areas.  In Siberia, you can find many medicinal plants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most of the marshes and swampy meadows are in the Baraba Lowland.  In the south-west of the region steppe drought tolerant plants prevail.  Here, at the border with Kazakhstan, the Kulundinskaya plain begins. </p><p>  But especially in the landscape of the region, the black taiga of the Salair ridge, consisting of mixed forests, stands out.  Priobsky pine forests are rich in berries, mushrooms and have lush grass cover.  Many plots are occupied by agricultural land. </p><p>  Vacation in these places is recommended to be planned in advance.  Especially popular with tourists, for example, with.  <span>Borovoe (Novosibirsk</span> region).  Recreation facilities here almost never experience a shortage of visitors.  Among other things, it is impossible not to mention that in these places there is also a dendrological park with introducers introduced from different parts of the world. </p><h2>  Section 2.

    <p>  A visit to the recreation center (Novosibirsk region), the prices for a daily stay on which very vary from high to the economy option, is impossible without acquaintance with local attractions.  And there is really something to look at here. </p><p>  On the banks of the Urop River, near the village of Barsukovo, there is a cave of the same name, where hundreds of bats of various species, many of which are listed in the local Red Book, found refuge from the cold.  This is one of the largest winters in the region.  The main bat colonies hide in places inaccessible to humans.  Marmots live in burrows near the cave. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The cave belongs to the corridor-labyrinth type and has karst origin.  The depth of the dungeon is about 20 m, the total length is 195 m. The entrance to the cave is located on a slope.  The passage inside is quite narrow, and you can only move along it crawling.  At a depth of 15 m, the manhole abuts against a fork.  One branch goes into a small cavity, and the other enters a large grotto 5 m high and about 8 m long. There are several circular passages leading to other parts of the cave and to the exit.  There are almost no streak forms in the form of stalactites and stalagmites.  Small cracks can be found in cracks. </p><p>  In order to protect the wintering of bats and the local ecosystem, the cave is a natural monument of regional significance.  You cannot visit it on your own, so organized groups of tourists are often brought here.  For example, in sec.  Zavyalovo (Novosibirsk region), the recreation center arranges such excursions in the summer on average once a week. </p><h2>  Section 3. Belovsky Falls </h2>

    <p>  In the Iskitim district, near the village of Belova, there is Belovsky waterfall.  It differs in that it is located on the plain.  The source of the waterfall is a lake, which was a quarry for coal mining.  Over time, it was flooded with groundwater, and workers built a dam.  Gradually, water broke a stone, and a waterfall appeared.  Now, according to travelers, this is one of the best places to relax.  The water in the summer is very warm and great for natural hydromassage.  Who will refuse such pleasure?  True, as many have noted, it is inconvenient to walk barefoot here, since the coast is dotted with small sharp stones.  Recreation facilities (Novosibirsk region) located nearby are proud of such a neighborhood. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Section 4.

    <p>  The Salair ridge is a low-mountain hill in southern Siberia, similar in height to a green island.  Its main ridge and slopes located in the center are especially distinguished.  The ridge itself stretches from south to north for almost 300 km and originates in the upper Neni, and ends with the Bugotak hills.  Its average height reaches about 400 m above sea level.  The highest are the mountains of Kivda (618 m), Husek (590 m) and Fir (585 m). </p><p>  There are no snowfields and mountain lakes on the ridge.  But despite this, the riverbeds flowing east and west originate here.  The bowels of the Salair Ridge are rich in minerals.  There are marble deposits in the vicinity of the village of Peteni.  Ridge is famous for its gold-bearing rivers.  The local population in these places has long been engaged in gold mining. </p><p>  In some areas of the ridge, still dense forests, called black taiga, have been preserved.  To preserve this unique nature, nature reserves have been created, which everyone is recommended to visit.  In the vicinity of the village of Kotorovo, a natural monument ‚ÄúThe Black Forests of Prisalairya‚Äù was organized. </p><h2>  Section 5. Lake Karachi </h2>

Legend has it that it was named after the first adviser to Khan Kuchum - Karachi Kadyr-Alibek, who tricked Yermak and destroyed his squad.  Initially, the lake was called Achu-Tabis, which translates as "bitter-salt water."  The southern shore of the reservoir is decorated with birch trees, and a fruit and berry garden has been planted on its northern side. </p><p>  Mineral mud of Karachi have healing properties and are used for treatment and recovery.  Water and brine of a salt lake also have a healing effect. </p><p>  What is impossible without rest?
