    <p>  First of all, you should decide on the terminology.  Under the legalization (legalization) understand the official recognition of the state or giving something legal force.  It should be noted that it is often accompanied by decriminalization of some actions. </p><h2>  Legalization of documents </h2>

    <p>  What is it?  This term refers to a series of actions that must be completed in order for it to become legally binding.  Consider the example of the state.  The State Duma adopts a law according to a certain procedure.  Then it is passed on, and the president can reject it if something does not suit him.  If satisfied, then he signs the law, and it is published.  From the moment of publication (or immediately in individual cases) it takes effect.  This is the way an ordinary document goes through until it is legalized as a law. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Legalization of documents on the example of the enterprise </h2><p>  There are quite a few such examples.  Another option: when the director of the company signs something, then the documents are legalized.  What is it, we have already found out, move on to the money. </p><h2>  Legalization of income </h2>

    <p>  But the most interesting for you is probably the legalization of criminal proceeds.  It involves <span>money laundering</span> for their subsequent use for completely legitimate purposes.  Only those entities that engage in illegal activities or hide part of their income from the state use legalization of income.  But not everything turns out as easy as you want.  The opposition to legalization is quite large; there are many authorities and bodies to combat fraudsters.  They are engaged in the collection and analysis of information of interest. </p><h2>  Legalization schemes </h2>

There are quite a few different possibilities that allow you to whiten your income.  It is not possible to consider all of them due to the tremendous ingenuity and resourcefulness shown by the criminals.  But still, several schemes will be considered in the framework of this article: </p><ol><li>  Work with offshore companies.  This action is very popular among representatives of large businesses.  Its mechanism is that states and offshore countries have tax treaties.  They stipulate that money that is related to one and the other party to the agreement (thanks to a company that operates in both countries) can be taxed only once.  And everything is done, of course, where the interest rate is lower.  But it is rather <span>tax evasion.</span>  How are things actually with legalization?  When money is illegally withdrawn from the country and credited to the account of a company registered in offshore in order to return in some way to the original owner in the future, this is money laundering. </li><li>  Work with real estate with the participation of dummies.  This scheme provides that dummies (usually citizens of another state) buy real estate.  Then they give it to the criminals, who quickly sell it and get clean and legal money, actually received already legally. </li><li>  Work with shell companies.  This scheme provides for the creation of fake companies for one day, which disappear immediately after completing their tasks. </li><li>  Schemes with earnings in other countries.  Provide travel abroad and return with amounts of money that are indicated as earned there.  As evidence, <span>fake documents</span> on earnings and payment of tax in the territory of another country are used. </li></ol><p>  We have already received the basic information and we know what legalization is.  What is this from other points of view?  Is it always understood that it is something negative? </p><h2>  What other types of legalizations exist? </h2>

    <p>  Is there anything else to say about a process like legalization?  What is this from a different perspective?  We have already figured out what legalization is, what it is in practice and in what manifestations it is most common.  Now let's talk about what might fall under this definition: </p><ol><li>  Legalization of drugs.  Recognition that the use, storage, production and transfer to all of all or only certain narcotic drugs to others is not a crime.  Examples of this can be seen in Holland or parts of the United States of America. </li><li>  Legalization of pornography.  It implies the removal of any restrictions on the distribution of products of this content. </li><li>  Legalization of software.  Making a decision to stop using "pirated" software and switching to official programs. </li><li>  Legalization of the mat.  Yes, even that is.  The process implies the recognition that all <span>obscene words</span> are a component of a certain language, and therefore, they are no different from the usual literary speech. </li><li>  Legalization of prostitution.  It implies a refusal of administrative and criminal prosecution of persons who are involved in prostitution.  Legalization may be partial or complete.  So, prostitutes proper can be exempted from prosecution, but owners of brothels, pimps, recruiters and the like who are involved in criminal activity are criminalized. </li><li>  Legalization of <span>gay marriage.</span>  Includes recognition that people of the same sex can officially tie the knot. </li><li>  Legalization of weapons.  This includes recognition of the right of citizens to own cold steel or firearms, as well as use it.  There are a number of nuances - for example, it may be allowed to carry pistols, but at the same time it is forbidden to have machine guns.  Or you can wear anything but hidden. </li><li>  Legalization of alcohol.  This name was given to the process of repealing prohibitions in a number of countries. </li><li>  Legalization of migration.  Under this, granting foreign citizens the right to work, live, receive medical services and so on. </li><li>  Legalization of gambling establishments.  Recognition that they are a legal <span>form of leisure for</span> citizens of the state. </li></ol>
