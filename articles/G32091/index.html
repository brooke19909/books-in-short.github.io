  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smartphone "Samsung J3" (2016): features and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, more and more people say that the technology provided by Samsung is not as good as before.  But such unflattering reviews do not stop the manufacturer, and every year new gadgets appear on the world market.  So, the Samsung J3 smartphone appeared on the shelves of numerous stores in 2016. We will consider the characteristics and reviews about this miracle of engineering. </p><h2>  About the title </h2><p>  When Samsung smartphones have the sixth letter of the English alphabet in their name, everyone understands that it is significantly lower in class than similar models from the A-series.  Such devices are simpler and cheaper.  Therefore, some are perplexed why take the Samsung J3 phone (2016), the characteristics and reviews of which are not much different from Chinese devices with lower cost.  However, already in 2017, an updated version of the same device was released. </p><p>  Nevertheless, Samsung has long been recognized as a classic, and many want the device of this particular brand.  Perhaps that is why Samsung continues to attack the global market, annually offering new models </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.knowreviewtip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung j3 2016 specifications" class="if uuid-2427114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2427114.jpg"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  To start a gadget review is to study how the device is packaged and what is attached to it.  So, the Samsung J3 smartphone (2016), reviews of which we will consider later, if ordered from an online store, comes in a small and simple white box.  It says the name of the brand and the specific model, as well as some information about which gadget is in the container.  In fact, the package is unremarkable: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Smartphone. </li><li>  Battery. </li><li>  1 A charging unit </li><li>  Classic USB cable. </li><li>  Brief instruction. </li><li>  Warranty card. </li></ul><p>  There is nothing else in the package.  Those who are not the first time to purchase a gadget of this brand were outraged by the fact that the manufacturer was greedy and did not provide the kit and headset, as was done before.  But headphones are not put in the box for reasons of economy, and other equally well-known brands. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  All reviews about the smartphone "Samsung J3" (2016) practically do not contain complaints about the appearance of the device.  And there‚Äôs nothing to complain about.  This is a classic candy bar with a rather restrained design.  Most likely, when the developers were engaged in creating the appearance of the device, they focused on the modern flagships of the same company.  In principle, this is not surprising.  Samsung has always been conservative in design and style. </p><p>  However, the smartphone is not presented only in black and white.  There is a more ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù shade.  The golden case has long been warmly received by the weak half of humanity, and Samsung did not miss its chance to visit the peak of fame. </p><p>  If you take the gadget in your hands, it will not slip.  Why?  The fact is that the back cover and side faces of the device have a favorite soft-touch coating for everyone.  According to reviews of Samsung J3 (2016), this coating is not erased even after a few years. </p><p>  Metal in the case is present, but in a very limited amount.  To be specific - then on the button located at the bottom of the front of the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The smartphone itself has attractive shapes.  Its sides are rounded and the device really looks smaller and neater than its predecessors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="consolebang.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung j3 2016 reviews" class="if uuid-2427119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2427119.jpg"></div><h2>  Case Feature </h2><p>  If before everyone was genuinely enthusiastic about non-separable cases, now more than ever in the price of a device with a removable back cover.  By the way, the Samsung J3 2016 smartphone is just one of them. </p><p>  The removable cover is made of fairly dense plastic.  Therefore, when it is removed in order to insert a SIM card, there is no fear that it will crumble or crack. </p><p>  As with all other models of this brand, there are no creaks or backlashes.  The Home button is also not satisfactory.  It is executed with high quality, does not hang out and does not look out of place. </p><p>  Interestingly, reviews often come across the idea that for such a price it would be nice to give the gadget a diode to indicate notifications.  In addition, most modern models almost always have this small light somewhere in the upper part of the device.  It allows you to receive notifications not only without sound, but also without vibration in principle.  So it is strange that at a relatively high cost, the device does not have such a cheap highlight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Moreover, the buttons have absolutely no backlight.  This, of course, will not surprise anyone, but we want to know what the owners think of the gadget.  In fact, the backlight is not really needed, but it would be nice even at night to easily find the keys, and not look for them from memory. </p><h2>  About dimensions </h2><p>  Owner reviews of the Samsung J3 (2016) are often filled with laudatory words in the direction of the size of the smartphone.  Although the gadget has a classic five-inch screen, there is no feeling that the device is bulky or large.  Everything in it is so tiny and so neatly arranged that you do not want to scold him.  On the contrary, I want to admire them. </p><p>  If you use the language of numbers, then 7.9 * 71.0 * 142.3 millimeters - these are the dimensions of the device.  The phone is lightweight and comfortable enough.  Some users say that they initially even suspected it was a different model.  The gadget seemed too small. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidworld.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone samsung j3 2016" class="if uuid-2427140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2427140.jpg"></div><h2>  Controls and Connectors </h2><p>  In general, Samsung J3 2016, reviews about which differ little on different resources, is rather ‚Äútypical‚Äù in questions of buttons and holes for various purposes. </p><p>  So, if we consider the front of the gadget, it can be noted that a speaker is located at the very top above the logo.  We‚Äôll talk about how good he is later. </p><p>  On the right side of the speaker is the front camera and proximity sensor.  Theoretically, somewhere there should be an indicator, but it is not there.  Like a light sensor. </p><p>  Bottom on the front of the smartphone is a mechanical Home button.  There are buttons on both sides of it, but they are touch-sensitive.  Usually, they are made in gray paint.  The right button is responsible for the function of returning to the previous page, while the left one has more advanced functionality. </p><p>  The back of the case has a large logo in the center.  Above it is proudly located a small square of the camera, a flash and an external speaker.  There is nothing else to find. </p><p>  Consider the side ends.  On the right side there is only one button - on.  She is also responsible for unlocking.  On the left side is the volume rocker. </p><p>  On top of the smartphone is a classic 3.5 mm jack for a mini-jack plug.  It is suitable for ordinary headphones as well as for a headset.  And below, in addition to the conversational microphone, you can find the micro-USB port. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Consider the characteristics and reviews of the "Samsung J3" (2016 release) in terms of image and screen in principle.  It is believed that for a budget device - this is a pretty good option.  But who, when buying a new smartphone, wants to think that something is not good enough in him?  Perhaps that is why it is worth finding out what is remarkable about the screen of this device. </p><p>  It‚Äôs worth starting with the fact that it is made using a special technology.  It is called Super AMOLED.  These displays are deep black.  In their creation, technology is used, which implies the use of organic LEDs and an active matrix consisting of thin-film transistors.  In the people it is customary to call the matrix TFT. </p><p>  If we consider this screen from the practicality side, then almost all reviews emphasize that this smartphone is ideal for watching movies.  It correctly conveys colors, and the image practically does not distort. </p><p>  However, looking at the gadget from different angles, you can see the pixels.  True, for this it is necessary to choose the desired brightness.  So we can assume that the screen is more than good for those who are not prone to skepticism. </p><p>  Some are indignant that the gadget does not have an oleophobic coating.  Such an outrage is justified, because even cheap Chinese smartphones have this coverage.  It is because of its absence that the smartphone screen perfectly remembers your fingers, which visually makes it cheaper.  Traces of sweat were never attractive. </p><p>  The viewing angles of the smartphone are quite wide.  This means that no matter how you twist the device, on any side the image will be pleasing to the eye. </p><p>  It is strange, of course, that the screen is not protected by a special mineral glass, as it is in many other models, considered to be "non-flagships."  And even more surprisingly, the gadget does not have automatic brightness control. </p><p>  Talk about the numbers.  According to the manufacturer, the screen resolution with a diagonal of 5 inches is 1280 x 720 pixels.  This means that the average density of dots is 294 units.  For a smartphone of this class, this is an excellent result. </p><p>  According to test data, the screen has a strange imposed restriction.  It consists in the fact that the maximum number of touches of the display is two.  For a modern smartphone, this is very strange, because most, if not all models of this class, are designed for 5 touches.  Why such an artificial reduction was made is incomprehensible. </p><p>  There are few satisfied screen settings.  You cannot select a work profile.  Therefore, the screen itself is not bad, but in order to justify its price, the manufacturer, apparently, deliberately worsened this model. </p><div class="photo" data-original="manualsuserguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="design samsung j3 2016" class="if uuid-2427135" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2427135.jpg"></div><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  And what about this option?  The specs and reviews of the Samsung J3 (2016) regarding the camera are also controversial.  Almost at all times, gadgets from the manufacturer were famous for their cameras.  What happened to this gadget?  Yes, he takes pretty decent pictures, but cann‚Äôt they be better in the light of recent developments? </p><p>  The front camera is only 5 megapixels, and the main one is 8 megapixels.  Of course, for the latter there is an LED flash.  But this deliberate attempt to make the phone cheaper than its more expensive version is somewhat frustrating. </p><p>  As for the application for working with the camera, it‚Äôs the most standard one.  Everything in his work is intuitive.  How to use filters, turn on video and what to do to switch modes is something that even a child can master. </p><p>  What was pleasantly pleased was the ability to adjust white balance, exposure, and even ISO sensitivity.  The main rule of a good shot in this smartphone is lighting.  If it is not there, the picture will turn out, but you cannot vouch for the quality. </p><p>  You can shoot video in Full HD quality.  For a smartphone in this price segment, this is normal.  And numerous reviews are proof of this. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Consider the owners reviews about the battery "Samsung J3" (2016).  According to the manufacturer, a battery is hidden under a hard plastic cover, the volume of which should be enough for several days of active work.  What is there in fact? </p><p>  Surprisingly, the smartphone honestly fulfills its 2600 mAh.  The power controller is working correctly.  Due to the fact that the battery is removable, it can always be replaced.  True, buying a new one is only in company stores.  Fakes are inflated at best, and at worst, they cause an explosion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.picquery.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="2016 Samsung j3 smartphone" class="if uuid-2427136" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2427136.jpg"></div><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Unfortunately, according to reviews, the specifications of Samsung J3 (2016) are rather weak.  This unit is suitable for surfing the Internet and watching movies.  You should not expect more from him. </p><p>  The gadget does not pull heavy games because of the processor, which by today's standards is already weak.  And in principle, any action in a smartphone is accompanied by a rather long mental work.  But why? </p><p>  The device does not have the best Spreadtrum SC9830 chip.  Yes, at the time of the release of the smartphone it was one of the ‚Äúyoung‚Äù representatives of its generation, but even then users were not enthusiastic about it.  However, for which everyone was grateful, it was for supporting LTE. </p><p>  However, the processor has the same kind and outdated Cortex-A7 cores with a frequency of up to 1.5 GHz.  The situation is only brightened by the fact that they were shoved by as many as four pieces. </p><p>  If we continue the tour of the inside of the Samsung J3 smartphone (2016), the characteristics of its video card did not go far from the outdated cores.  The device is Mali-400 MP4.  To use this miracle of 2012 was a very strange idea. </p><h2>  Shell </h2><p>  It‚Äôs worth starting with the fact that in the smartphone of 2016 builds Android 5.1.1.  This is very strange, especially in light of the fact that at the moment the update on the gadget has not arrived.  Everything is also aggravated by a shell, of which only lazy did not speak.  We are talking about TouchWiz from Samsung. </p><p>  Previously, this shell was famous for being full of services and buns.  Nobody needed all this, except for those who put those same buns there.  It is because of this that the shell constantly hangs and slows down.  It is nice to understand that now in Samsung J3 (2016), the characteristics and reviews of which we are considering, there is a revised version that can function normally even on cheap models.  She perfected by time and brought almost to the ideal. </p><p>  If we look at the desktop, then the icons are always pleasing to the eye.  They are qualitatively drawn, have rounded sides and just look attractive.  In this shell on the desktop, you can create separate folders.  Moreover, they can add a large number of shortcuts to different applications, and make the folder itself a certain color.  This will systematize the application and hide what is needed from prying eyes. </p><p>  The curtain is worthy of special praise.  Although it is quite similar to the classic Android curtain, TouchWiz redesigned it quite qualitatively.  It contains everything you need.  Moreover, the user himself has the right to determine what exactly should be there.  That is why the curtain takes up less space, it is more compact and visually pleasing. </p><p>  Most of all, the shell appreciates how the work with the phone book is implemented.  As in the very first smartphones of this brand, to make a call you need to make a swipe to the desired contact.  Moreover, if you make it from left to right, a call will be made, and if in the opposite direction, you will be taken to the message sending section. </p><p>  But everything is spoiled by the fact that, according to reviews, the characteristics of the <span>Samsung Galaxy J3</span> (2016) are very weak.  Users often complain about it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sammobile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung j3 2016" class="if uuid-2427129" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2427129.jpg"></div><h2>  Communication and wireless technology </h2><p>  The budget gadget from a well-known manufacturer, despite its relatively low cost, has received a full set of necessary modules, which makes it convenient to use it for everyday tasks.  So, this model supports 4th generation networks, which is a necessity in modern conditions, when high-quality Internet is needed not only for entertainment, but also for using all kinds of instant messengers with the ability to make voice and video calls. </p><p>  You can connect additional peripherals to the device, such as fitness bracelets or wireless headsets using Bluetooth version 4.0.  The module installed in the smartphone supports the ability to transmit high-quality stereo audio, which will allow you to use a suitable headset not only for conversations, but also for listening to your favorite music. </p><p>  A lot of users in their reviews of the characteristics of the <span>Samsung Galaxy J3</span> (2016) note the confident operation of the GPS-receiver in any conditions.  So, even in rooms it is often possible to catch a signal that will be enough to determine the approximate location of the user.  In addition, the gadget can navigate according to cellular and Wi-Fi networks. </p><h2>  Positive aspects of the device based on reviews </h2><p>  In order to understand how successful this model is, it is not enough to consider only the characteristics of the Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016).  Reviews about this smartphone will help to see its strengths, which are manifested in the process of everyday use.  So, among the most often mentioned positive features, the following can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  High image quality.  The display really conveys the picture without distorting the color.  It has a sufficient margin of brightness so that the operation of the smartphone in the summer sunny days does not cause any special problems. </li><li>  Pleasant appearance.  A rather thin body, light weight and thoughtful arrangement of controls make the model interesting for any generation and gender.  And the choice of color allows you to emphasize your personality. </li><li> Availability of accessories.  Models from well-known manufacturers are appreciated for the fact that in any store you can buy a variety of covers for them, original cables, chargers and other peripherals. </li><li>  Capacious battery.  The system, optimally improved in terms of energy saving, undemanding hardware and a high-quality battery allows you to use your smartphone without recharging up to 2 days in average load mode.  If you use it actively, then the charge will still be enough to easily survive until the evening. </li></ul><p>  These are the main advantages noted in user reviews about the Samsung J3 (2016).  However, unfortunately, this model still has an impressive list of minuses, some of which have already been discussed in detail above.  Nevertheless, it is worth reminding them for yourself so as not to regret the purchase after its completion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sammobile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="review samsung j3 2016" class="if uuid-2427132" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2427132.jpg"></div><h2>  The negative sides of the model </h2><p>  The main disadvantage of the model at the moment is the already outdated version of the operating system.  While the 8th Android is coming out, the manufacturer still has not provided an official update until at least the 6th.  And it is unlikely to do this in the future, because the model is quite old.  Namely because of this, some users are faced with the fact that modern applications are not supported by this gadget. </p><p>  However, these are not all the shortcomings of Samsung J3 (2016), and the reviews of the owners note at least three more unpleasant features.  The first of them is a small amount of memory, both operational and internal.  There is practically no space to save user programs and files, so installing a memory card is a must. </p><p>  The second minus is the low quality of the pictures.  Although the cameras on Samsung phones have long been famous for their thought-out optics and good post-processing of photos by the system itself, this model is not so simple.  Many users note that the images are blurry, without focus or with overexposed areas. </p><p>  The third negative feature is manifested if you have to repair the device due to a fall or other damage.  Parts are very expensive, and it does not make sense to change a broken display and sensor, since together with the cost of work, almost the price of a new smartphone is obtained.  In competing manufacturers, for example, Xiaomi, the cost of such work and details comes out many times lower. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  After reviewing the specifications, photos and reviews of the Samsung J3 (2016), we can conclude that this model is intended primarily for those who are fans of the Korean brand.  It is more expensive than the proposals of competitors, and has an impressive list of disadvantages.  However, despite them, a nice design and reliability may be to the taste of some people who want to get a branded device for a small price. </p>
