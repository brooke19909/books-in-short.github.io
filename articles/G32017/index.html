    <p>  Numerous reviews from grateful tourists confirm that this is a great hotel.  And the main plus of this place is a perfectly thought-out food system.  Although there are some disadvantages.  So, one of them is not a very large selection of children's entertainment.  The guests also regret the relatively long way to the sea (if you go with the child in the heat). </p><h2>  About rooms </h2>

    <p>  The standard rooms have a balcony with scenic sea views.  But these apartments are slightly more expensive.  Each room has an old but working air conditioning, a hairdryer, an electric kettle, a bottle of water, coffee, tea, a TV and a paid safe.  On the balcony there is a table with chairs. </p><p>  Pleases guests and the availability of new plumbing.  Electricity and other equipment, according to their reviews, works without interruptions.  A slight minus is a small window opposite the bed, the light from which prevents sleep in the morning. </p><h2>  About nutrition </h2>

    <p>  Those who choose the All Inclusive system will not regret it at all.  Meals include breakfast, lunch and dinner.  You can also drink juices and alcoholic beverages for free at any time.  Snacks at the bar are served with sandwiches and ice cream.  At each meal, you must say the room number. </p><p>  Breakfast consists of dry cereal with milk, sausages, eggs in various variations and delicious fried bacon. </p><p>  Lunch and dinner consists of meat or fish dishes - to choose from, a side dish (pasta or potatoes) and fresh vegetables.  The food is not very diverse, but, according to tourists, everything is very well and deliciously prepared. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The hotel staff is very friendly.  Many speak Russian.  Bar workers even remember the rooms of regular customers, and there is no need to constantly tell them. </p><p>  Even without tip guests are served very well.  Bed linen and towels are changed once a week, but more often on request.  Cleaning is carried out daily when there is no one in the room.  If necessary, they can issue a spare key. </p><h2>  About entertainment </h2><p>  During the day, guests are entertained by animators.  Little but fun.

    <p>  The hotel is located in a small area.  This is rather a plus for those who come with children.  The complex is surrounded on all sides by green spaces.  There is even a small waterfall.  The pool is spacious, and for lovers of swimming there is where to take a walk.  The right part of the water zone (when viewed from the side of the hotel) is intended for children.  But for them there is also a separate round pool.  Kids can play here at their pleasure, splashing out of <span>water pistols</span> and diving under water in masks. </p><p>  Unfortunately, this hotel does not have its own mini water park.  But in the complex "Anastasia", located on the road to the sea, there are wonderful water attractions.  On a special flyer, you can even get a discount of several euros.  Children will definitely like it here.  And adults will find a lot of extreme entertainment. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  As experienced travelers warn, depending on the time of year, water in the sea can change the temperature.  Sometimes in the evenings it cools down very much, and swimming is almost impossible if you are not a seasoned person.  The beach here is sandy, which is ideal for families with children.  The road to the sea takes about 10 minutes of a leisurely step.  Along the way, you can peek into local retail stores.  The beach itself is equipped with changing rooms, and for an additional fee, you can use sun loungers and umbrellas. </p><p>  If desired, you can go to the central beach with a sandy bottom and a gentle entrance to the water.  Within walking distance are many other beaches and there are even wild places with chic nature.  But the sea is almost equally beautiful everywhere.  The beach is covered with soft sand.  But many children still prefer to spend time in the hotel pool. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  A tour desk is located near the hotel.  The cost of trips ordered here is much lower than that of a tour operator.  But it‚Äôs better not to go anywhere with young children, especially in the summer months when unbearable heat reigns. </p><p>  Pleasure boats depart from the pier.  Traveling on each of them has its own characteristics.  If possible, you should rent a car and go to the zoo.  Children here will be very interested.  The zoo is home to many amazing animals, as well as a viewing platform. </p><p>  Be sure to visit Cape Greco with its unique caves, the Bridge of lovers and other picturesque natural attractions. </p><p>  Near the Smartline Protaras 3 * hotel is the Church of St. Elijah.  The temple is located on a mountain, which leads to a convenient staircase.  You can even go with a child here.  Also nearby are colorful music shows.  For those who do not like to walk, buses go.  The stop is located just a few steps away. </p><p>  In general, the Smartline Protaras 3 * complex (Cyprus) is perfect for families with children.  It has everything that the soul of a Russian tourist seeks: picturesque area, comfortable rooms, a large swimming pool, the azure sea, delicious food and a lot of entertainment.  Especially vacationers like to spend time in the bar, where delicious drinks are poured, and it‚Äôs completely free.  Children here will be no less interesting.  For them, even a disco suit. </p><p>  Almost all rooms offer scenic views of the coast.  The beaches here are just wonderful.  In addition, there are a considerable number of them, so you can visit places that have not been previously known at least every day. </p><p>  Those who wish can rent a car and go to amazing places in Cyprus in search of new sensations. </p>
