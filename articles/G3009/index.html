This is partly due to stereotypes about the limited entertainment offered in Turkish resorts.  It is believed that the rest here is suitable only for lovers of daily idle pastime on the beach, and an abundance of food contributes to weight gain.  However, this is not the case. </p><h2>  Goynuk Village - a quiet paradise for a budget tourist </h2><p>  This article will discuss the benefits of a holiday in the small village of Goynuk in the province of Kemer, on the Mediterranean coast. </p><p>  Tourists visiting this paradise can explore the unique canyon in <span>the Taurus Mountains.</span>  The area in and around the village is rich in exotic plants.  Pomegranate and orange groves grow here.  You can find palm trees, cacti and many other exotic plants.  The abundance of conifers provides an unusually healing air. </p><p>  Local hotels are exceptional examples of artistic craftsmanship combined with a unique landscape design.  Guests will not remain indifferent from the contemplation of unique masterpieces in the form of majestic castles or tourist complexes in the form of a huge ship.  The variety of architectural configurations in the design of local hotel complexes is truly amazing.  Most hotels are either built relatively recently or undergone major repairs. </p><p>  We should also mention the famous all-inclusive service.  Guests will undoubtedly be delighted with the truly fabulous abundance of dishes and all kinds of drinks.  For vacationers are available SPA salons, a visit to a traditional Turkish bath.  Everything is aimed at distracting tourists from everyday worries.  Nothing should tear them away from a leisurely rest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The attractiveness of staying in the village of Goynuk is due to the proximity of the sea, whose temperature reaches twenty-seven degrees.  Indeed, what could be nicer than lying on a sandy and pebble beach enjoying the sun and the turquoise blue clear sea water?  You can consider all the details of the underwater kingdom.  However, there are some disadvantages.  Despite the huge number of sunbeds, they are constantly not enough for everyone who wants to visit the beach.  At the pier there are several showers with fresh water.  Taking a dip in the sea, before going to your room, it's nice to stand in the shower, and under the warm sun you can quickly dry out. </p><p>  Wonderful conditions created for families with children.  Especially for younger guests, local hotels offer a special menu and a wide selection of animation programs.  In order for parents to be able to spend time quietly while enjoying their holidays, each hotel has children's rooms with qualified staff who can find an approach to any child. </p><h2>  Hotel Boran Mare Beach Club </h2>
