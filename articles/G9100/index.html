Of course, it is unlikely that anyone will change their sensor to buttons, and smart phones have long begun to solve our problems, nevertheless, devices like Nokia 7210 Supernova are still on sale, as they are a symbol of reliability and indestructibility. </p><h2>  Why buy? </h2><p>  Why do you think some still buy phones like the Nokia 7210 Supernova?  This is largely due to ease of use.  If young people quickly got used to the sensor, learned all the functions of a smartphone and plunged into the use of social networks, the older generation did not immediately adapt to touch screens.  Someone just did not want to use the touchscreen, someone really could not accustom themselves to such devices. </p><p>  Therefore, push-button phones did not disappear from the market.  Moreover, some manufacturers release a couple of new models a year to maintain demand.  But many continue to give preference to some cult models, and someone even nostalgic for those times. </p><p>  The popularity of push-button phones is largely due to the rare problems that occur with them.  What happened to your button mobile?  Perhaps one button stuck, most often - the "Menu" button.  The rest is hard to find obvious flaws. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www2.marjinal.com.tr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Push-button phones" class="if uuid-3136525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3136525.jpg"></div><p>  Yes, these devices can‚Äôt talk to us, like smartphones do, almost every one of them has no Internet, and the camera shoots badly.  But if we are talking specifically about the "dialer", then these are perhaps the most reliable options. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About phone </h2><p>  Nokia 7210 Supernova was launched in 2008.  Now it is still available for sale.  It will cost you 500 rubles.  The manufacturer, when releasing the model, positioned it as a budget.  She was the first in the Supernova line.  It was worth 120 euros at the time of issue. </p><p>  The appearance of the device hinted at the fact that this is a purely female model.  Although the color scheme contained more restrained options.  It was planned that the device will become mass, although it is difficult to imagine which man would buy a white-pink phone. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The Nokia 7210 Supernova was shipped in a bright corporate box.  At that time, Nokia was especially fiercely committed to white packaging.  But this model was available in a box with a white background, but with a lot of bright elements. </p><p>  The model of the device and its photo were displayed in front.  On one of the ends there was a sticker on which the basic parameters of the phone were indicated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="latestone.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Charger" class="if uuid-3136530" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3136530.jpg"></div><p>  Inside the box was blue.  One could notice two sectors: in the first there was a telephone, and in the second there was a charger.  The Nokia sector was decorated in the same way as the box.  Opening it, one could also find headphones and instructions.  The headset is branded, white with a microphone and clothespin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.matarinternational.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Headset for Nokia 7210 Supernova" class="if uuid-3136521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3136521.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance of the device </h2><p>  Description Nokia 7210 Supernova should start with the design, since it was the manufacturer who focused on it. </p><p>  This model is represented by a monoblock.  For its manufacture used plastic.  There are very few metal parts here: the frame of the main button and the camera.  An interesting solution was the choice of colors. </p><p>  For example, there is the most popular model, which is made in milk color on top, and then a gradient is used, which turns into gray.  Unfortunately, this is done only in front, since the back cover is made in milk color. </p><p>  The device is compact, has rounded corners.  It is convenient to hold it in your hands: it does not slip out, but also does not cut into the palm of your hand.  On the sides there are colored inserts that become thicker in the middle, and on them you can see the logo of the manufacturer. </p><p>  The front panel cannot be changed, so the manufacturer provides: white with pink accents or gray with blue.  But the cover can be changed.  Sometimes interchangeable options are available in the kit.  On the market there are: brown, blue, yellow, green and gray panel. </p><h2>  Details </h2><p>  The block with buttons on the Nokia 7210 Supernova seems monolithic.  The keys are recessed into the body.  They are not island type, so the buttons will not fall out or break.  If something fails, you will have to change the entire keyboard at once. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Above the display is a wide frame with a silver company logo on it.  A sensor is hidden right there, which reacts to changes in lighting conditions.  The device cover is made of plastic.  At the top you can see the camera, it is framed by a metal frame.  Under the lens, the manufacturer is again indicated, and below the number of megapixels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="paisaybachao.pk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone Nokia 7210 Supernova" class="if uuid-3136504" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3136504.jpg"></div><p>  At the bottom of the cover you can see the speaker holes.  On the left side you can see the hole for the 2 mm charger, which quickly became popular.  There is nothing on the right side. </p><p>  On the bottom edge you can see a hole for attaching a lace or keychain.  All the most important is located on the upper end.  There is a headset jack - standard, 3.5 mm.  There is a hole under the plug in which you can install the microUSB cable. </p><p>  On the upper edge, you can also find a special button that helps remove the housing cover.  To do this, just drown the key inside and pull the lid.  Thus, it will be possible to get to the device‚Äôs battery and SIM card slot. </p><h2>  Control buttons </h2><p>  Button phones "Nokia" always differed among themselves, but nevertheless something in common gave out to them "relatives".  In this case, it is a joystick.  It has a classic metal frame. </p><p>  The keyboard itself has a standard set of keys.  According to the classics above, on the sides of the joystick, you can find four control buttons: receive and reset a call, as well as two soft keys. </p><p>  They work according to the classical scenario.  The joystick can be pressed left, right, down and up.  All this allows you to navigate the menu.  The left soft button is responsible for the "Active" or the quick access menu.  Right - opens the phone book. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  About half of the Nokia 7210 Supernova's front case is occupied by a screen.  The second half is occupied by the keyboard.  Due to the rather compact size of the phone: 106 x 45 x 10.6 mm, only two inches are occupied by the display.  In this model, a screen with a TFT matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãinstalled.  This is the most budget option that is now used in cheap smartphones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oldcasing.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Housing Nokia 7210 Supernova" class="if uuid-3136506" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3136506.jpg"></div><p>  Screen resolution - 240 x 320 pixels.  For a diagonal of 2 inches, this is enough for a good image.  The matrix can reproduce about 262 thousand colors.  In order for the user not to suffer from glare, the screen received a special coating.  The brightness level is enough to use the device even on the sunniest day. </p><h2>  Camera: photo </h2><p>  Push-button phones "Nokia" budget class rarely had really cool cameras.  This model is no exception.  The user can use a camera with 2 megapixels.  By 2019, this figure seems negligible, especially if the camera is in principle important to the user. </p><p>  Such a lens is not able to create good pictures.  It will be possible to take some general photos, although in theory it is possible to adjust more or less high resolution and photo quality. </p><p>  The camera can shoot vertically or horizontally.  There is no need for a numeric keypad to navigate in this menu, just a joystick and keys nearby.  Unfortunately, there is no button on the case that would launch the camera.  To do this, you will have to go to the appropriate menu. </p><p>  The camera does not work with autofocus, so you will have to do this manually.  During shooting, the screen displays useful information: the selected mode, resolution, the number of possible shots and digital zoom. </p><p>  The camera has a number of functions: </p><ul><li>  two shooting modes; </li><li>  vertical and horizontal orientation; </li><li>  self-timer up to 10 s; </li><li>  shooting a series; </li><li>  effects (similar to current filters); </li><li>  white balance setting; </li><li>  image quality setting; </li><li>  image size adjustment (160 x 120, 320 x 240, 640 x 480, 800 x 600,1152 x 864,1280 x 960, 1600 x 1200). </li></ul><p>  It should be prepared for the fact that after you take the picture, you have to wait until the phone processes it.  Sometimes this process takes 15 seconds. </p><h2>  Camera: video </h2><p>  Of course, for the price of the Nokia 7210 Supernova one should not expect that it would be possible to shoot video as well, but don‚Äôt rejoice very much, the quality of the videos is not the best.  The format of the finished clip is 3GP at a speed of 30 frames per second. </p><p>  In the settings, you can turn the microphone on or off, set the duration of the video (but note that the video will interrupt when the memory runs out on the phone), set the resolution and adjust the quality. </p><h2>  Device specifications </h2><p>  The specifications of the Nokia 7210 Supernova are pretty mediocre.  You should not expect performance and support of all modern functions from this phone.  But the ‚Äúfillings‚Äù are enough to freely talk and chat with friends and family. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pdair.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Elements of Nokia 7210 Supernova" class="if uuid-3136518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3136518.jpg"></div><p>  The phone runs on Series 40 5th Edition.  Menus can be configured in four modes.  You can install new topics.  The device supports mobile Internet.  You can use the built-in browser for this. </p><p>  There is not much internal memory - only 30 MB.  All this volume can be filled with personal data.  If this is not enough, you can install a memory card up to 2 GB. </p><p>  The phone can work with Bluetooth and a huge number of universal communications.  For example, network access, speakerphone, remote access, file transfer, access to the phone book, etc. </p><h2>  Programs </h2><p>  Nokia 7210 Supernova is a universal phone.  It has all the necessary applications.  In the organizer you will find an alarm clock and a calendar, you can immediately note things and leave notes. </p><p>  Also, a stopwatch, voice recorder, web browser, world clock, converter, timer, calculator and much more are available to the user.  For music lovers there is an ‚ÄúMP3‚Äù player with a convenient interface.  If you do not want to fill up memory with unnecessary files, you can use the radio to listen to music. </p><p>  It will not be boring for those who like to play mobile games.  There are three of the most popular puzzles that can ‚Äúkill‚Äù time: Sudoku, Sea Battle, and Snake. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Nokia 7210 Supernova turned out to be a good phone.  Of course, the demand for it will now be perhaps the smallest since its release.  This is due to the fact that many people of age are now happy to switch to smartphones, because they support video communication with loved ones and help to use instant messengers. </p><p>  But it cannot be denied that this is definitely a solid model for those who want to get a push-button telephone.  Nokia 7210 Supernova received positive reviews. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bukalapak.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.bukalapak.com/p/handphone/hp-smartphone/l8hpni-jual-nokia-7210-supernova"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nokia 7210 Supernova Reviews" class="if uuid-3136508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3136508.jpg"></div><p>  Users noted an interesting design and good build quality.  We were pleased with both the size of the screen and its reliability.  The workspace turned out to be convenient for use: the buttons are medium in size, so mislations rarely occurred. </p><p>  The phone works for a long time.  For example, in normal mode, it can last without recharging for 3-5 days.  If you want to listen to music, you can do it for 19 hours.  Worse things are with active conversations.  The phone can be discharged in 2.5 hours of continuous communication. </p><p>  They spoke negatively about the quality of the pictures taken by the camera.  The case received a rather peculiar colors, which not many liked.  The lack of a volume rocker upset some. </p>
