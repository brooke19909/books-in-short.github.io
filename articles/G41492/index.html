Holidays in Greece on the island of Kos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Greece, they often dream of visiting the leaders in the resort business of Mykonos, Crete or Rhodes.  It is noisy during the day, fun at night, and the rest flies by like an instant.  Tourists who are more attracted by peace and tranquility are suitable for tours to Greece on the island of Kos.  Here the nature is buoying, no one and nothing prevents to enjoy the sunsets, and the days flow measured and leisurely.  The island of Kos is one of the smallest resorts in the country.  He was lost among the same "kids" in the Dodecanese region, which means "12 islands."  Even the Greeks do not know why this group is called 12, because even the inhabited islands there are almost three dozen.  O. Kos lies near the Turkish coast, to which less than 4 km.  In clear weather, Bodrum is perfectly visible without binoculars.  Distinctive features of Kos are its unique nature, plenty of attractions for such a small piece of land and frequent winds.  We invite you to relax here from the bustle of the city, enjoy the purity of the sea, air and wonderful beaches.  A nice hotel Pyli Bay 3 * will do everything to make you want to come to Kos again. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The island of Kos has an elongated shape.  Its length is slightly more than 45 km, and its width is about 11 km, but there is a place where it is only 2 km.  In the Aegean, Kos is "deployed" from the northeast to the southwest.  Its southern part is more mountainous, but the sea there is calmer and warmer.  The northern shores are mostly flat-hilly, covered with vegetation and open to the ‚Äúseven winds‚Äù.  Here is also the capital of the islet, the city of Kos of the same name.  7 km west of its borders on the coast itself a small fishing village Marmari came across. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pyli bay 3 kos reviews" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1574594.jpg" width="501"></div>  This is where the 3 star Pyli Bay Hotel is located.  I must say, Greek villages are not at all like our Russian ones.  There are areas more or less built up and crowded, and there are deserted, notable only for earthen plots, separated by fireplaces (in our reed) or planted with olives.  Among the fields, quite decent roads are laid, along which shops and wonderful villas flaunt.  Low mountains fringe all this beauty, in some places stony, in some places decorated with vegetation.  These are the landscapes that await those who come to Pyli Bay 3 * (Kos).  Guest reviews report that a road passes near the hotel, there is a shop and a bus stop nearby, fields are spread around where you can see grazing goats and cows, and in the distance are the houses of local residents.

It is called "Hippocrates" and is located near the village of Antimachia, southwest of the Pyli Bay Hotel for about 15 km.  The capital of.  Kos lies 22 km northwest of Antimachia.  The island's airport receives flights only from Athens year-round, and in season planes arrive here from all over the world, including Russia.  It is most convenient to get to the hotel in question by tourist transfer.  Travel time is about half an hour.  If you arrived in Kos on your own, it is best to take a taxi. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The territory is one of the highlights of Pyli Bay 3 * (Kos).  The reviews of guests describe with admiration how well-groomed she is, how many various evergreen and deciduous trees are here, even pomegranates and bananas grow, and the flowers here are a real living sea.  Tourists can not only admire such beauty, but also relax under the canopy of olives or rhododendrons on comfortable benches.  The territory in the hotel is not only beautiful, but also functional.

Reviews of tourists note that there are as many as three buildings here - the central three-story building, located parallel to the main road, and two two-story buildings, very long, standing at an angle a little to the side.  Parallel to them, there are also roads, but local roads, there are almost no traffic on them.  The reception is located in the main building.  Employees do not know Russian, but speak English well.  There are several seating areas in the lobby.  One, furnished with Viennese armchairs with pillows, overlooks the garden.  Other areas are furnished with modern furniture.  There is a large TV, wireless internet.  Nearby are <span>public toilets, a</span> games room with billiards and tennis tables, a gym, a bar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="about Kos" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1574572.jpg" width="511"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  For accommodation of guests has 220 rooms Pyli Bay 3 * (Kos).  Reviews about their condition are positive.  Their category is single - ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù.  The design of the rooms is designed in the style of "minimalism", which allows to make their area more functional.  Among the furnishings, only the most necessary furniture - ordinary and bunk beds, bedside tables, a table, a wardrobe, chairs.  Electrical equipment is provided by air conditioning, safe, refrigerator and TV.  Each room has a comfortable balcony.  The hygiene rooms have a small bath with shower, toilet, washbasin.  Maids issue hygiene products regularly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Very good food reviews at Pyli Bay 3 *.  <span>Greece,</span> including the <span>island of</span> Kos, is famous for its traditional cuisine, where delicious olives, cheeses, sweets are present, where they can cook vegetables and meat in a special way, where they like to fry octopuses, fish, lamb and even grilled bread.  We call it barbecue.  Tours at this hotel are sold with breakfast-only, breakfast-dinner, all-inclusive or no-meal systems.  Each tourist chooses what suits him best.  I must say that there are no taverns in the immediate vicinity of Pyli Bay 3 *, so it‚Äôs not very convenient to order tours with ‚ÄúBB‚Äù here or without meals.  Such tourists will have to go to Marmari every time, where you can eat tasty and cheap.  But the road to the cafe will take from 10 minutes or more. </p><p>  Taking tours with HB food is beneficial for those tourists who plan not to sit still, but to walk around the island.  Then you can have breakfast and dinner at the hotel, and dine in any city on the island where their tour will take place.  This will undoubtedly bring a pleasant variety to your vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Pyli Bay 3" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1574569.jpg" width="509"></div>

    <p>  For tourists who want to avoid the hassle of <span>daily bread</span> and fully devote themselves to a carefree vacation, it is more profitable to take tours with Al meals. </p><p>  In Pyli Bay 3 * there is a simple restaurant in design, where everyone has enough space.  It is divided into two parts - indoors and outdoors.  The waiters work great, the dishes and tablecloths are always clean, there are no queues, but breakfast time is quite early, which does not suit tourists who like to sleep in the morning. </p><p>  The breakfast menu, according to tourists, is wonderful and includes cottage cheese, yogurts, granola with milk, potatoes, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãsalads and vegetables, cheeses, sausages of different varieties, bacon, eggs, a lot of pastries and cookies, bread, butter, honey, jam, fruits ( 5-6 species).  For lunch and dinner there are Greek soups, side dishes, meat, seafood, fish, salads, fruits, vegetables, sweets, ice cream.  Often a barbecue is served at dinner. </p><p>  The hotel has two bars, one in the lobby and one by the pool.  Here you can take beer, wine (not diluted), crayfish, ouzo, coffee, water, sprite and cola. </p><h2>  Service for children </h2><p>  In Pyli Bay 3 *, the kids are sincerely happy.  For them, a playground was built here, in one of the pools a fenced area with a shallow depth was allocated.  Baby cots are available in the rooms.  And older children should be placed on comfortable bunk beds (the upper one has a fence).  In this case, the charge for a cot is 5 euros per day, and for an extra bed for an adult child is 12.5 euros per day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pyli Bay 3 Greece Marmari Kos" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1574574.jpg" width="509"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure at the hotel </h2><p>  Even if you spend most of your vacation in Pyli Bay 3 *, Greece, the island of Kos will still be remembered.  There are two large pools that employees clean daily.  Around both pools there are many sunbeds and umbrellas.  For active guests, the hotel has a tennis court, a place for playing volleyball, and a fitness room with several exercise machines in the central building.  There is no animation at Pyli Bay, but a barbecue and performance by local artists is organized twice a week in the garden near the pool.  Greek folk music and songs to those who do not know the language seem mournful.  This is because in Greek folklore the main emphasis is not on the motive, but on the semantic content of the songs.  They seem beautiful to those who understand what is sung in them.  But for our tourists, these evenings are also interesting, because they allow you to touch the real Greek life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pyli Bay 3 stars" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1574575.jpg" width="507"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  It is thanks to the crystal clear Aegean Sea that many people like the island of Kos.  Greece, whose beaches are mostly perfectly clean, is considered a country with the best sea resorts.  Kos also boasts clean and beautiful beach areas.  The coating on them exists for every taste - with yellow sand, white, black and pebbles of different sizes.  An important feature of the northern coast of the island, just where the village of Marmari is located - there is almost always a wind.  Sometimes, especially closer to the fall, it is so impressive that it is difficult not only to swim in the sea, but also to sunbathe.  But for surfers this is a paradise. </p><p>  The beaches of Kos have a second feature regarding water temperature.  Here, even at the coast in July or August, it can be somewhat cool (up to +22 ¬∞ C), regardless of the fact that the air temperature at this time reaches +35 ¬∞ C and higher. </p><p>  Pyli Bay 3 *, according to guests reviews, is located from the nearest beach no more than 500 meters.  The path to it lies along the road through the village, past a stream with turtles.  This beach is urban, sunbeds and umbrellas are paid, but you can sit on your own towels under the canopy of trees.  Entertainment is available a little away from the recreation area.  At 4 km there is another nice Tigaki beach.  If you rent a car, you can go the beaches of the south coast.  The winds there are slightly quieter, and the sea is warmer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kos island Greece beaches" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1574573.jpg" width="510"></div>
