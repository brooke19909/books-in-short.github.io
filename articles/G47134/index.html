  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best of smartphones</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is no secret that the iphone is a symbol of quality, prestige and advanced technology.  In the modern world, it is difficult to do without a smartphone.  The best assistant for life in the city has not yet been created, because the phone has long ceased to be just a ‚Äúdialer‚Äù.  When choosing a phone, users expect from it the functions of a navigator, camera, gadget for surfing the network.  And the iphone meets all these requirements and more. <br>  The latest model of smartphones from Apple at the moment is iphone 5s.  It is a fast machine with excellent technical characteristics and recognizable design.  Iphone is not just a phone, it is a Brand.  That's right, with a capital letter.  After all, many things in everyday life become cult objects, therefore it will not be a surprise that many dream and decide <noindex>  <span>buy iphone 5s 32gb</span> </noindex>  .  After all, this multifunctional tool is not only a tool in the hands of the owner, but also an object of envy, a symbol of dynamism, openness to the new, well-being. <br>  Apple's story is a story of innovation.  And iphone phones have become the best of the products of this company, its most successful brainchild.  The severity of the lines repeated by competitors, a reliable operating system, thousands of diverse applications in the Appstore - this phone compares favorably with others.  You can describe it for a long time, but just look at the statistics: iphone is the most popular of smartphones in the world.  People spend more and more time with the phone in their hands, solving a variety of problems with it, and such trust in the Apple brand says a lot. <br>  If you want to be in the center of the life stream and do as much as possible without wasting extra effort, a reasonable choice - <noindex>  <span>buy iphone 5s 64gb</span> </noindex>  .  After all, this phone has: <br>  the best display with a resolution of 640x1136, which makes any graphic tasks - from games to watching your favorite series - comfortable, <br>  glass and metal inserts resistant to damage and fingerprints, <br>  8 megapixel autofocus camera with many functions, including FullHD video recording, as well as a front camera for video communication, <br>  excellent audio player, fast processor and a large number of operational cameras. <br>  All materials from which the telephone is made are environmentally friendly.  And this is another argument in favor of the fact that the iphone is a symbol of advanced technology and promise.  Everything is fine in it, from filling to decoration, its reputation speaks for itself.  Iphone can rightfully be called a symbol of modernity.  In conclusion, as popular wisdom says, "we are not so rich as to buy bad things." </p></div></article>
