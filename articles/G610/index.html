    <p>  <span>Christopher Columbus,</span> whose biography is interesting to many contemporaries today, is known in history as the discoverer of the New World.  He was born either in Genoa - a city-republic - on October 27, or in Corsica on October 9 of the same 1451.  The personality, fate of the <span>great traveler</span> and navigator today is not fully understood.  There is also an opinion that he was born in Spain. </p><p>  The biography of Columbus has many white spots covered in the dust of history.  Most likely, they can no longer be filled.  But some sources say that since childhood, he dreamed of going the way of Marco Polo and repeating his feat.  Marco Polo two centuries earlier became the first European to visit India and China.  He brought to Italy a large number of interesting stories about distant lands, customs and people.  And the main value was exotic fruits, spices, clothes and other goods brought by him.  But Christopher intends to get to the Asian shores not by land and not through the east, but by sea, through the west. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Columbus‚Äôs biography has preserved evidence that his idea was not accepted in his native Italy, so the sailor leaves the country.  The Spanish monarchs provide financial assistance in organizing the expedition, but in return they take the promise that he will bring them silk fabrics, various spices, and gold.  In 1492, he set off on his most famous journey, which went down in history as the <span>discovery of America.</span> </p><p>  After two months of sailing, the travelers descended to the earth.  Columbus was sure that he had reached India, so he called the locals the Indians.  In fact, it was the Bahamas - islands without busy trading cities with countless treasures.  As the biography of Columbus further says, the expedition sailed to Cuba, firmly believing that it was Japan.  No one could have imagined that a continent unknown until now could exist outside the <span>Atlantic Ocean</span> . </p><p>  Christopher never found out about his mistake, although he made four more expeditions to the shores of the New World, that is, America.  He devoted all his future life to these lands.  Dying, he considered himself a follower of Marco Polo and his student, continuing the path of a great teacher.  He died in the Spanish city of Valladolid on May 29, 1506, surrounded by his loving family.  The significance of the discoveries of this man was appreciated only by the following generations, who surged into the development of new territories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="short biography of Columbus" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/303234.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A short biography of Columbus cannot tell about the difficulties he experienced in his travels.  She cannot tell about the islands that the brave navigator discovered, about the colonies founded by him.  However, she perfectly demonstrates that even a small person, passionate about craving, can change the world. </p>
