    <p>  "Illusion Park" (Vladivostok) on September 9, 2016 was opened by the famous showman Sergei Svetlakov.  He brought the film "Groom" to the audience, where he plays the main role.  The actor was also given the honor to cut the red ribbon for the audience. </p><p>  Fascinating contests were organized for all those present and interesting entertainments were prepared.  It seemed that on this day in the center gathered all of Vladivostok.  "Illusion Park" met the most daring expectations of visitors. </p><h2>  Movie premieres </h2><p>  The opening of Illusion Park in Vladivostok took place with the premiere of the film, where S. Svetlakov played the main role.  In the film "Groom" he also worked as a screenwriter and performed producer functions. </p><p>  True, only the elite who had invitations could get to the premiere of the comedy on the opening day.  As Svetlakov himself said, the heroes of his film have very real prototypes.  He emphasizes with his plot that you do not need to look back at the West or America, but just look around.  It was in the Russians living in the outback that the mentality was preserved in which humor, kindness and many other qualities were combined. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Before the show, S. Svetlakov talked with the audience, admired the city (while his wife was in Vladivostok for the first time). </p><p>  You can watch the film, but without meeting the star actor, in the cinema halls of the Illusion Park institution (Vladivostok).  Tickets were not sold on September 9, but now any premiere can be seen in the forefront. </p><p>  Beginning September 10, 2016, the latest news from Russian and foreign cinema was included in the network of displays.  For the convenience of the audience and taking into account the different wealth of visitors, tickets are divided into categories: regular and VIP. </p><p>  Illusion Park holds various events.  Films included in the program of the Pacific Pacific Meridian International Film Festival were shown at its base. </p><h2>  More about entertainment areas </h2><p>  For residents of the city and its guests, the complex is equipped with as many as five auditoriums, which are combined by the Illusion Park (Cheryomushki).  Vladivostok first received cinemas in the premises of the trading premises. </p><p>  Fans of watching films under the rustling of popcorn appreciated the self-service cinema bar, unique for the city.  Here you can buy your favorite treat and various drinks on your own. </p><p>  According to the founders of Illusion Park, they wanted to put the entertainment center on a whole new level of perception.  For this to happen, completely different areas of leisure were gathered in one place. </p><h2>  Any trifle is important </h2><p>  Those who first get to Vladivostok, ‚ÄúIllusion Park‚Äù is one of the first to visit.  It is considered a landmark of the city, where everything is thought out to the smallest detail.  When designing, architects took into account all the possible nuances.  Zones are clearly demarcated, flows of visitors never collide in one place.  The design is unique and does not repeat any similar object. </p>

Here you will find something to your liking both the older generation and the smallest visitors. </p><h2>  Innovation for Vladivostok </h2><p>  The founders tell why the shopping and entertainment center was chosen as the site for the opening of the center.  Modern man does not have time to devote time to entertainment.  Therefore, entrepreneurs are trying to combine different types of services in one place, and a shopping center where people make purchases is an ideal option.  If such formats are familiar to many large cities, then for Vladivostok this is an innovation. </p><p>  "Illusion Park" allows people to relax after hard work, escape from everyday hustle and bustle, amaze children and diversify leisure activities for teenagers. </p><p>  Currently, the institution organizes large-scale film festivals, holds interesting events.  The halls of cinemas are equipped with the most modern equipment, which allows showing films in any accessible format. </p><p>  In addition, there are entertainment areas, the uniqueness of which is recognized throughout the <span>Far Eastern District.</span>  Despite <span>this, the park is</span> developing and striving to give its visitors even more.  For this, the founders and employees attract new partners and introduce the most fashionable innovations. </p>
