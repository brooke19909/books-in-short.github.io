Therefore, in the framework of the article, various formulations that have been expressed by numerous scientific personnel will be considered.  Moreover, two main approaches can be distinguished: identification and differentiation.  All this has its own characteristics, which we will consider in the future.

    <h2>  About terms </h2><p>  So what is competency and competency?  The differences between them will help to bring a few definitions.  So <span>competency is</span> : </p><ol><li>  The quality of a person who has comprehensive knowledge in a particular field.  Thanks to this, his opinion is credible and authoritative. </li><li>  The ability to carry out vital, real action.  At the same time, the qualification characteristic of a person at the moment of achievement allows you to turn a resource into a product. </li><li>  Potential willingness to tackle problems, proceeding with knowledge of the matter.  In this case, a person must have all the necessary knowledge and skills.  In addition, it is necessary to understand the essence of the problem under consideration.  To maintain the qualification level, it is necessary to constantly update knowledge and possess new information in order to apply them in all possible conditions. </li><li>  Possessing certain experience and knowledge that will make the right decisions. </li></ol><p>  But what is competency?  Under it is understood: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Knowledge, experience, skills and preparedness for their use. </li><li>  The range of issues in which a particular individual boasts a good knowledge. </li><li>  The set of problems regarding which a person has wide knowledge and experience in solving. </li></ol><p>  That is what competence and competence are.  The differences between the two are not overly substantial, however. </p><h2>  Use of terms </h2>

Speaking about what competence and competence are, looking for differences in the formation of these concepts, it is impossible not to mention that even among scientists there is no unity on this issue.  And the analysis of these concepts and situations of use is supported by a very significant number of studies that have been conducted by different people.  So, to resolve the contradictions that were proposed, the introduction of the only correct term was proposed in order to avoid negative effects, but so far no consensus has been reached.

Particular emphasis is placed on the fact that knowledge is at the core, as well as the ability to use it.  The overall picture is complemented by a psychological willingness to cooperate and interact to solve a wide range of problems.  At the same time, actions are carried out with an eye to certain moral and ethical attitudes and personality traits.  What, then, in practice is the difference between competence and competence?  Let's take a look at that too. </li><li>  Competence is understood to mean actual personal quality, which is formed on the basis of existing knowledge.  Moreover, this is based on the intellectual and professional characteristics of a person.  The competence is based on an integrated model that includes four levels of development: knowledge (and their organization);  skills (and their use);  intellectual and creative potential of a person;  emotional and moral relations with the world.  The latter is often controversial, so the information needs to be supplemented.  So, by this we also mean emotional intelligence - that is, the ability to self-discipline and self-motivate.  In addition, resistance to disappointment is also included in this concept.  An integral part here is control over emotional outbursts and the ability to give up pleasure.  Mood control skills are also helpful. </li></ol><h2>  About competency </h2>

Moreover, this is based on existing knowledge and experience.  They are acquired through training.  It should be borne in mind that these personality traits are interrelated.  This allows us to say that competence is a person‚Äôs willingness to mobilize his knowledge, skills and external resources in order to act effectively in certain life situations.  That is, it is all in a ‚Äúfinished form‚Äù and you just need to collect a bizarre mechanism of knowledge and skills at the time of the implementation of something.

Don‚Äôt worry, reader!  As previously written, this feature of this article, which examines competence and competence.  Differences between different authors, although they exist, but they are insignificant.  Each individual judgment lends its interest.  And so that it is not lost, you have to provide information in full. </p><p>  So, back to the topic of the article.  Competency is the result of education.  It also provides for a certain set of competencies.  This concept also includes the personal attitude of a person to the subject of his activity.  It should be recalled that many scientists were engaged in the study of these terms. It is not possible to bring all of their developments within the framework of this article.

Differences, according to A.V.  To the farmstead, here are:

    <ol><li>  Competence is understood to mean a certain range of issues in which the individual has a good knowledge, knowledge and experience.  This is a set of interconnected qualities that a person possesses in relation to certain objects and processes.  They may be knowledge, skills, methods of activity.  Subject to all conditions, quality work is possible. </li><li>  Competence is when a person has the necessary competence, which also includes his personal attitude to the subject of activity. </li></ol><h2>  Interpretation of V.D.  Shadrikova </h2><p>  This scientist offers a slightly different vision: </p><ol><li>  So, V.D.  Shadrikov argues that competency requires a range of issues where a person is knowledgeable.  A feature of this concept is that it refers not to a specific subject of activity, but to the issues that accompany it.  In other words, under competence it is necessary to understand functional tasks that can be successfully solved.  If we talk about the educational process, then we can observe that a certain dialectic is being formed. </li><li>  Competence is a feature of the subject of activity.  Thanks to her, a person can solve a certain range of problems. </li></ol><h2>  We say a word about education </h2>

Now let's pay attention to the educational sphere.  Before us there is a "spherical" teacher who is engaged in what sets out jurisprudence.  So, if he has knowledge of the subject, the skills of applying legislation in law enforcement agencies, the ability to defend his rights (to search for the information necessary for this) and the fortitude that will help to survive difficult moments - a person has competence.

    <p>  We can say that if a person is also interested in what he is doing, improving his communication and presentation skills, then he is also competent.  Of course, this is all a little exaggerated, but, nevertheless, this small example will allow us to understand what constitutes the subject of the article in reality. </p><p>  We have considered the difference between competence and competence, there should not be more questions on this aspect.  But in order to finally consolidate the material, let us also consider the situation with other areas of human activity. </p><h2>  Other areas </h2>

His task is to create new machines that will have all the necessary functional spectrum.  Does competency and competence differ here?  There are differences between them, but in general, the scheme looks like it was presented earlier.  That is, if he has the knowledge, skills and abilities necessary for work, then a person has competence.  And if there is also a desire to go beyond what has been achieved, to work out of interest and for the good, when there is interest in the result and the person wants to work on his own, then this means that he has competence.

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We cannot but note the fact that both society itself and each individual are interested in ensuring that each person possesses the maximum possible competence in resolving certain issues.  In this case, we could say that society is working as efficiently and expediently as possible. </p><p>  Is it possible?  Yes.  But before talking about everyone, you need to start with an individual.  To change the world for the better - just start with yourself.  Moreover, you can work not only on the quality of skills, but also on culture and relationships.  As a starting point, you can take your appearance.  Then you should begin to monitor your home so that it is clean and comfortable.  When a person appreciates himself, he is more attentive to the environment, and to people, and to what he does. </p>
