A traditional trip to Turkey takes several months.  But for some time now, for the inhabitants of the Northern capital, a long wait has become optional.  A very simple visit to the water park in St. Petersburg in a sense represents a good alternative to the popular Turkish resorts. </p><h2>  Water parks in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  The oldest and most famous water park in St. Petersburg, Waterville, exists since April 2006.  Until recently, it was actually the only complex of water attractions of this level in the whole city.  But at present, residents of the Northern capital have a choice.  Since 2012, ‚ÄúWaterville‚Äù has a serious competitor.  We are talking about the <span>water park "Peterland".</span>  Of course, for such a large metropolis, which is St. Petersburg, two water complexes are not enough.  And there is reason to believe that in the future their number will increase. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/452584.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <h2>  Waterville </h2><p>  This first large-scale water park in St. Petersburg managed to gain a stable positive reputation from its public.  Located on Vasilievsky Island, a water entertainment complex provides its visitors with a wide range of opportunities for a good rest.  The slides of the water park are pleasantly surprised by the variety of their spatial configuration and differences in height.  This allows everyone to find their own here.  And for lovers of thrills, and those who prefer something more calm.  Children are also not forgotten - separate pools with small slides are equipped for different age groups.  This makes the first water park in St. Petersburg optimal for families. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park in St. Petersburg prices" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/452945.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Peterland </h2><p>  <span>This conceptual</span> design of a complex of water attractions makes even those who have seen a lot and have the opportunity to compare attract attention.  In a relatively short period of its existence, he managed to gain popularity with the most demanding public, which is characteristic of a city like Peter. </p><p>  Waterpark "Peterland" corresponds to the declared level.  The developers of the water entertainment complex were guided by its creation to the highest world standards, developed over many years in this area.  And to a large extent this succeeded.  According to the occupied area, the water park "Peterland" is the largest on the entire European continent.  It is simply impossible to get around it in one visit.  With its spatial and volumetric layout, it resembles a giant shopping mall.  And in addition to a very wide range of water attractions, it offers its visitors many other opportunities and services.  First of all, these are baths of various national traditions, from Finnish to Russian inclusive.  <span>Tennis courts are available.</span>  And after visiting the water park, the public is expected by the service structures located here - massage parlors, night clubs, restaurants and other <span>catering establishments.</span> </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peter water park peterland" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/452946.jpg" width="590"></div></h2><h2>  What to choose </h2><p>  Of course, the choice of a water park substantially depends on its location.  But other factors also matter.  Most experts agree that, by most comparison criteria, Peterland is by far the best water park in St. Petersburg.  The prices here, although not much, are higher.  But at Peterland there are more attractions, and they are more diverse.  And there are more various additional services.  But even the oldest Waterville water park in the city has its followers.  They find this water sports complex more comfortable.  On ordinary and <span>public holidays</span> , there is less fuss in it.  The tariff for visiting approximately corresponds to the prices in Peterland, but here for the same money you can stay for unlimited time and not look at the clock. </p>
