It is not surprising that these heights are called Meteora, because in Greek the word means "soaring in the air."  Six monasteries are comfortably located on the cliff tops - this is the largest and most important monastery complex of the state.  The attraction is impressive and looks exciting, which is why it is popular not only among Orthodox tourists.  What monasteries are located on the peaks of Meteor in Greece, how are they attractive, and is it possible to visit them? </p><h2>  What are Meteors? </h2><p>  The monastery complex is a mysterious, bewitching and spectacular phenomenon.  Meteors are huge masses of sandstone and conglomerate.  This is a residual phenomenon, a consequence of river erosion and earthquakes. </p><p>  When looking at the monasteries, only one question arises: how were they built?  Indeed, the construction of temples on the tops of cylindrical stone pillars was carried out in terrible conditions.  The lack of roads and any construction equipment forced the workers to do everything manually.  There were not even horses.  The materials were first brought to the Meteors in Greece, then they were already raised up by means of nets and baskets.  All this was done by hand.  Even the monks rose in the nets, because there were no other options. </p><h2>  Where is the monastery complex located? </h2><p>  Meteors are located in the Thessaly Valley, near the Greek city of Kalambaka, which, in turn, is 300 km from Athens.  In order to more accurately find out the location of the attraction, just look at the map. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="39.85121522184561" data-lng="21.623925758593828" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="8"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/2/6/1326.png"></div><h2>  How to get to Meteor in Greece? </h2><p>  It is most convenient to plan a trip from such large cities as Athens or Thessaloniki.  Consider each option.  So, you can get from Athens as follows: </p><ol><li>  <em>By bus.</em>  Transport runs from Terminal B from 7:30 to 15:30 daily.  The interval between shipments is a couple of hours.  Travel time is 4.5 hours. </li><li>  <em>By train.</em>  Depart from Larissis train station.  You will need train number 884, and back - number 885. The journey time will be 5 hours. </li><li>  <em>By car.</em>  This option is the most difficult, since there are practically no signs on the road, and the long path is 400 km.  It will be necessary to drive through cities such as Lamia, Domokos, Karditsa and Trikala. </li></ol><p>  It is recommended to immediately buy tickets back.  It is believed that this trip will be cheaper.  In the first case, a one-way road will cost about 30 euros, and in the second - about 25. </p><p>  It is much easier and cheaper to get to Meteor in Greece from Thessaloniki.  A train ride takes 3 hours and a ticket costs less than 20 euros.  From the train station you should go to Kalambaki, then you just have to go a bit to the Plateia Dimathiou fountain - and you can see the bus station.  From there, twice a day (at 7:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. on weekdays, and at 8:20 a.m. and 1:20 p.m. on weekends), a bus leaves for the village of Kastraki.  There you need to transfer to another bus, which will take you directly to the monastery of the Transfiguration of Christ. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Do not forget that from Athens, and from Thessaloniki, and even from the village of Kastraki can be reached as part of an excursion group.  The trip will turn out to be more informative and interesting, accompanied by the stories of the guide.  You can buy a ticket for an excursion to Meteora in Greece at any travel agency. </p><h2>  From the history of the creation of the Meteor </h2><div class="photo" data-original="edition.cnn.com" data-author=": Alesha Bradford, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meteora Monasteries in Greece" class="if uuid-2314588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2314588.jpg"></div><p>  It is impossible to imagine, even on the assumption level, how much effort has been spent on the construction of monasteries.  People have done the unreal.  Legend has it that the very first construction of the complex was the Great Meteor.  It was laid by Saint Athanasius, who flew up to the top on the back of an eagle.  But this is only a legend. </p><p>  There is also a second tradition that seems more real.  Residents of the village of Staya (now Kalambaka) had good dexterity, and therefore had the opportunity to help the monks to equip the monastery, climbing the rocks.  By the way, the rocks are very complex structurally and dangerous, so not even every climber will dare to climb them. </p><p>  Historically, Meteors in Greece were first inhabited at the end of the 10th century.  The territory was subordinated to religious communities.  Hermits in groups and one by one settled in natural caves formed in the rocks.  In 1336, Athos monks Gregory and his disciple Athanasius arrived here.  Soon, the first returned home.  Athanasius was left on Meteora with a sacred mandate - to establish a monastery.  Actually, ten years later, this happened.  With or without magical power, a monastery was built. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Then Athanasius painted a code of laws.  All the monks had to obey these rules.  Asceticism began to flourish, as the Meteors organized ideal conditions for life in prayer and solitude.  Therefore, very soon newfound monks arrived here.  Among them was, for example, John Uros Paleolog, who abdicated the Serbian throne, as well as many other personalities in whose veins royal blood flowed.  This, in turn, contributed to good funding, that is, the monastery was generously ‚Äúrewarded‚Äù with donations for the shelter.  This made it possible to build more and more new temples on the empty peaks of rocks, both well accessible and those that were difficult to reach.  Decades later, the whole Meteor monastery complex in Greece was formed here. </p><p>  The heyday of monasticism in the rocks falls on the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent.  Reigning over the territory from 1520 to 1566, he helped in the construction of temples, and therefore, by the end of the reign of the Sultan, there were only 24 of them together with monastic monasteries. The largest were sponsored by offerings and other incomes, as a result of which they became rich. </p><p>  Today there are only 6 monasteries.  Looking at them, one can feel the sadness and decline that temples are now experiencing.  The eternal and fierce debate about power over the Meteors led to the fact that the monasteries ceased to receive proper care.  Lack of funding did not allow timely restoration of buildings; they began to deteriorate and collapse.  Moreover, many large monasteries remained empty.  By the end of the 50s of the last century, only 4 churches remained active;  Today, only 2 of them pursue a true religious goal.  The remaining monasteries became objects of tourism, a tourist attraction that has earned fame thanks to the cinema and literature. </p><h2>  The Great Meteor (Transfiguration Monastery) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitmeteora.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Great Meteor Monastery, Greece" class="if uuid-2314600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2314600.jpg"></div><p>  The very first temple founded by Athanasius Meteors.  The Convent of the Transfiguration Monastery is the largest religious site in the Meteor complex in Greece, the photo of which can be seen above.  He is the highest located.  The Preobrazhensky Monastery contains the largest number of ancient manuscripts and valuable icons.  The main cathedral has a cruciform shape.  This is a whole complex consisting of residential buildings, houses for old monks, kitchens, a dining room and a hospital.  There is also a crypt and a tiny chapel. </p><h2>  Varlaam Monastery </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitmeteora.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Varlaam Monastery, Meteora, Greece" class="if uuid-2314609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2314609.jpg"></div><p>  In 1350, a monk settled on the top of one of the rocks and built a church here, a cell for himself, and also made a water tank.  His name was Barlaam, and he dedicated the temple to the Three Saints.  Much later, in 1517, a temple was erected in this place in honor of Varlaam by the monastic priests Theophanes and Nektarios.  The interior of the monastery is decorated with a fresco, it houses a collection of valuable icons, rare manuscripts, carved wooden crosses, handwork and shirts embroidered with gold.  Today, there are 7 very welcoming monks who are always glad to welcome visitors. </p><h2>  Monastery of St. Stephen </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitmeteora.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Stephen's Monastery, Meteora, Greece" class="if uuid-2314620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2314620.jpg"></div><p>  This temple is considered the richest on Meteors in Greece.  From the photo of the map you can find out the location of the monastery - right above the city of Kalambaka.  Once there was a tiny chapel, which also bore the name of St. Stephen.  It was built by hermits in the 12th century.  Subsequently, on the site of the chapel, a large monastery grew up, consisting of two main cathedrals - the Old and the New.  The first is decorated with earthy-red artistic compositions, and the second is dedicated to Saint Charalampos.  It has a large collection of icons, regularly holds educational events aimed at studying Byzantine music and iconography. </p><h2>  Monastery of St. Nicholas Anapavsas </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitmeteora.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monastery of St. Nicholas Anapavsas, Meteora, Greece" class="if uuid-2314624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2314624.jpg"></div><p>  Of all the temples, this one is the most unusual and the smallest.  The cliff area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMeteor in Greece, where the monastery is located, is small, so the monks were forced to erect the necessary buildings at different levels.  The result is a temple with a unique design.  It was erected in the early 1300s by Metropolitan Larisa Dionysius.  On the first level there is a small chapel dedicated to St. Anthony, as well as a crypt, where manuscripts and various relics are stored.  The second is the Cathedral of St. Nicholas.  The third level consists of the chapel of St. John the Baptist, a dining room decorated with a fresco, and a crypt for storing relics.  Today, a relatively convenient staircase leads to the monastery. </p><h2>  Rusanu Monastery </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitmeteora.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rusanou Monastery, Meteora, Greece" class="if uuid-2314628" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2314628.jpg"></div><p>  No one knows the exact date of the appearance of the temple and the history of its origin.  So among all the Meteor monasteries in Greece, this can be called the most mysterious.  There is an assumption that the temple was founded in the late 1200s by Rusanos, but no evidence of this was found.  It is also called the monastery of St. Barbara, because on the territory of the preserved complex there is a temple of the same name, decorated with amazingly beautiful fresco, and also having a wooden carved iconostasis covered with gilding.  The main monastery was restored in the Byzantine style in the XVI century. </p><h2>  Holy Trinity Monastery </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitmeteora.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holy Trinity Monastery, Meteora, Greece" class="if uuid-2314633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2314633.jpg"></div><p>  The temple is located on top of one of the most picturesque rocks.  This is a man‚Äôs monastery, to which 140 steps leading directly to the rock lead to the rock, so the climb is difficult, not everyone can do it.  This feature makes the monastery the most peaceful, since there are very few people, and therefore asceticism has the opportunity to flourish in full. </p><h2>  What do tourists say about the Meteor monasteries in Greece? </h2><p>  The oldest religious Greek attraction will forever remain in the memories of those who managed to visit this unique and mysterious place, giving an amazingly beautiful view, a sense of calm and lightness.  Each of the tourists is trying in his own way to describe the delight that can only be experienced here.  Peace and tranquility - this is what is ensured to a person who has visited the Meteors.  In addition to peace of mind, tourists manage to capture unique picturesque pictures. </p><p>  Travelers recommend coming here at any time of the year.  Even in winter, when the peaks of Meteor are covered with snow and are dominated by foggy haze, the area has its own charm.  Some emphasize that in the cold season the impressions are much stronger than in the summer.  Only it should be warmer to dress. </p><p>  Tourists write exclusively positive reviews about Meteor monasteries in Greece.  Even a person who is far from a religious theme will appreciate the beauty of the country's most ancient cloisters.  True, there are several recommendations that should be considered: </p><ol><li>  Each temple is closed to visitors one day a week.  All monasteries have their own day.  Some of them are also unavailable for lunch - from 13:00 to 15:00.  The Transfiguration Monastery is open from 9:00 to 13:00 and from 15:15 to 18:00, except Tuesday.  The Temple of St. Varlaam is open on the same hours, except Friday.  The monastery of St. Stephen also works, and it is closed on Monday.  From 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. the churches of the Holy Trinity, St. Rusan and St. Nicholas Anapavs are open. </li><li>  Given the mode of operation of the monasteries and their location, it is worth noting that visiting all 6 churches in one day is unrealistic, you should not even try.  It is very hard physically.  If you have a desire to visit all the monasteries, you should divide the visits into 2-3 days. </li><li>  Be sure to consider the type of clothing in which you plan to visit the monasteries.  Men and women should have their shoulders and legs closed (shirts with sleeves, long skirts and trousers, closed shoes).  The heads of the fairer sex are covered with scarves. </li><li>  You should behave properly, do not talk loudly and do not laugh. </li></ol><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="CbVuxETtHBg" data-url="https://youtu.be/CbVuxETtHBg" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/3/2/4/1324.jpg"></div><p>  In the video presented above, you can admire the beauties of Meteor and see the monasteries from different angles. </p>
