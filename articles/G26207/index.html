The main advantage of this option is the location of the hotel (Pereslavl-Zalessky) in the Chkalovsky district of the city, that is, in the center, close to many attractions.  In their reviews, guests praised the work of the administration and staff, the cleanliness of the rooms.  The level of comfort and convenience is maintained at an average level.  The hotel is, according to the guests, one of the best in its price range. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Some guests have claims to the suite, speaking of it as inappropriate to the declared category: old furniture and carpet, poor insulation, lack of a hairdryer (indicated in the description).  Meanwhile, it makes sense to consider this accommodation option when planning a trip to the city of Pereslavl.
