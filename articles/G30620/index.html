Exotic nature combined with the sea is a real paradise for vacationers.  The most popular and famous resort of Thailand is Pattaya, which has long been loved by travelers.  An incredible number of hotels of different levels have been built on its coast.  Among them, you can find not only fashionable establishments, but also more budget options.  In our article we want to talk about the three-star hotel in Pattaya "Green Park". </p><h2>  A bit about the complex ... </h2><p>  Green Park Hotel (Pattaya) is located in the heart of the resort.  It was built in 1995 and has been open to visitors since then.  The hotel complex is designed in modern Thai style and offers accommodation in comfortable rooms.  The city center can be reached on foot in just ten minutes.  Near the hotel there is a reserve and a park. </p><div class="photo" data-original="greenparkpattaya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Green Prk &quot;" class="if uuid-2559658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2559658.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel is built in an exotic garden with many palm trees and other tropical plants.  The beautiful area has a relaxing holiday.  The complex consists of three three-story buildings and 18 one-story cottages.  The last repair in the hotel was carried out in 2014.  In total, the hotel covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã20.8 thousand square meters.  m </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The number of rooms at the Green Park Hotel Pattaya is represented by a variety of apartments of several categories: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.itravel.rs" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Number of rooms" class="if uuid-2559721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2559721.jpg"></div><ol><li>  The single rooms (33 square meters) are equipped with a safe, Wi-Fi, a balcony or a terrace, a living room, a sitting area, a telephone, a bathroom, toiletries, a coffee maker, a kettle, a minibar, a refrigerator, a radio and a TV. </li><li>  Two-bedroom apartment with pool or garden view. </li><li>  Single rooms. </li><li>  Triple apartments. </li><li>  Suite with a bedroom.

The snack bar serves snacks and drinks throughout the day.  As the hotel is located in a busy place, there are many cafes nearby where you can eat well. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="greenparkpattaya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Restaurant" class="if uuid-2559661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2559661.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, all hotel rooms are equipped with kitchens, which makes it possible at any time to cook food yourself.  In the immediate vicinity are grocery stores and a small market.  350 meters from the hotel there is a restaurant-bar "Mantra" and the institution "Copacobana", which tourists recommend visiting. </p><h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  The Green Park Resort Hotel (Pattaya) has a good infrastructure for a comfortable stay.  A restaurant and poolside bar are on site.  In the evenings, live music is available.  The hotel has a fitness room, currency exchange, free parking, conference room, sauna. </p><p>  A public sandy beach is 200 meters from the hotel. </p><h2>  Guest Services </h2><p>  Green Park Hotel (Thailand, Pattaya) offers the following services for its guests: dry cleaning, room service, daily cleaning, laundry, newspaper service, and ordering excursions. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Pattaya is an incredibly lively and dynamic resort in Thailand.  On its territory you can not only plunge into the night life, but also relax in a quiet secluded place, as well as admire the amazing Thai temples and other beauties.  Pattaya is the place where you can find everything you want. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.itravel.rs" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel lobby" class="if uuid-2559723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2559723.jpg"></div><p>  The famous resort attracts tourists with more affordable prices than <span>Samui or Phuket.</span>  Just a few hours away is the airport, from which low-cost airlines fly to all parts of Thailand, which allows you to see the whole country. </p><p>  Pattaya is divided into several areas.  Green Park Hotel is located in its northern part near Naklua Beach.  Rest here is more calm than in the central part, since there are fewer entertainment venues.  This area is preferred by couples. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Continuing the review of The Green Park Resort 3 * (Thailand), I want to pay attention to the reviews of tourists who have already visited it.  Should I recommend it for a vacation? </p><p>  It is worth noting that the positive reviews about the Green Park Resort Hotel (Pattaya) characterize it from the very best side.  Of course, the institution has its drawbacks, but they are not so significant.  In general, guests of the complex highly recommend it as a budget vacation spot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apartment Interiors" class="if uuid-2559730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2559730.jpg"></div><p>  One of the main advantages of the hotel is its good location.  It is located in a quiet area, not far from the center of Pattaya.  Near the hotel there are cafes and shops, massage parlors.  By bus you can quickly get to other areas. </p><p>  The room fund of the <span>Green Park Resort 3 *</span> hotel in Pattaya (the description is given in the article) is represented by different apartments.  Tourists can choose for themselves rooms in buildings or one-story bungalows.  Here you need to focus on your own preferences.  However, guests of the complex recommend booking standards, as they are much larger in size and more beautifully decorated than superior apartments. </p><p>  The rooms located on the first floor of the buildings have a view of the pool.  Bungalows are located in the back of the garden.  In general, the hotel itself is built in a tropical garden and is surrounded by greenery.  During the rest, the impression is that you are surrounded by a jungle.  Going out onto the balcony you can admire squirrels and birds that are not at all afraid of people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bergerreisid.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The territory of the complex" class="if uuid-2559742" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2559742.jpg"></div><p>  The rooms have all the necessary furniture.  But air conditioners do not always cope with the work.  All apartments have balconies or terraces.  Bed linens and towels are of good quality, they are changed daily by maids.  Detergent supplies are also regularly replenished.  The rooms have kitchenettes with utensils, which makes it possible to cook something from food. </p><p>  The hotel is cleaned daily, its quality differs depending on the building, the human factor is likely to affect.  The only significant drawback of the rooms and the hotel itself is the poor quality of the Internet.  This service is declared as a free service.  But in fact, it is almost impossible to use the Internet in a hotel, as evidenced by numerous reviews. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Food always remains a very important point for all tourists, especially when it comes to exotic countries.  It is the quality of food that always causes many complaints.  But this does not apply to the Green Park Resort hotel, the reviews confirm this.  Upon request, guests of the institution can choose for themselves half board, breakfast or full board.  Tourists note that the choice of food is sufficient.  Perhaps someone lacks variety, but it is worthwhile to understand that the hotel has only four stars on the sign.  And therefore you should not count on delights. </p><p>  Near the hotel there are wonderful places where you can eat deliciously.  Tourists recommend not limited to the hotel restaurant to fully appreciate Thai food.  By the way, in the hotel cafe you can make a menu order.  Such dishes are much tastier and more interesting than the assortment of the buffet. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  Numerous tourists recommend the hotel as a budget place to stay.  If you want to economically relax in Thailand, you can pay attention to the Green Park Hotel in Pattaya (reviews and prices are given in the article).  The cost of renting rooms in a hotel starts from 2600 rubles per day.  According to the spa, the hotel is fully consistent with the ratio of "price-quality", which means it can compete with other similar institutions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In-room kitchenettes" class="if uuid-2559735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2559735.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel complex has its advantages and disadvantages.  Therefore, the choice must be made based on your preferences.  Pattaya is an incredibly noisy and crowded resort, because many guests seek to find an oasis of calm on its coast.  That is Green Park.  On its shady territory it is always quiet and calm, and the atmosphere is conducive to relaxation. </p><p>  It features a large and clean pool, which staff clean every morning.  The water in it is always very warm, due to the fact that it is in a sunny place.  In the restaurant, guests can order food that the waiters will serve in a recreation area near the pool.  Due to its convenient location, you can visit all the most interesting places in Pattaya. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bergerreisid.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the night hotel" class="if uuid-2559741" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2559741.jpg"></div><p>  The municipal beach is a 7-10 minute walk from the hotel.  Many people prefer to get to other parts of the resort by bus.  A representative of a local travel agency who can offer you various sightseeing trips is always on duty at the hotel reception. </p><p>  Guests note the friendly hotel staff, who are always happy to see visitors. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Pattaya is able to offer a lot of interesting things to its guests.  Here, depending on your own preferences, you can find entertainment for every taste.  Families with children should go to the Caton Netwok Amazon or Ramayana water park.  Fans of nightlife are advised to spend time on the colorful Walking Street, which is the embodiment of the exotic resort.  For couples, you can recommend a trip to the elephant park, the Khao Keo zoo or a crocodile farm.  Shopping enthusiasts will love the floating market and night Jomtien. </p>
