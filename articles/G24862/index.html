This applies to both humans and animals.  Homo sapiens have more opportunities to stand out from the crowd.  One easily hammers nails with his hand, the other can eat a hundred burgers at a time, and the third is proud of having huge ears or the longest tongue in the world.  For people who want to prove and show the world their uniqueness, there are a huge number of shows and competitions.  What is the Guinness Book of Records!  This annual meeting presents a collection of mind-blowing achievements of man, science, technology and nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the longest tongue in humans" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10494/346974.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Language will bring to the cinema </h2><p>  Sometimes your personality trait can be a pass to the world of show business.  Which, for example, happened with Nick Afanasyev.  Its highlight is practically the longest language in the world.  Once, a young American of Russian descent living in the territory of hot Philadelphia decided to share his "wealth" with the world.  The length of the tongue of Nick Afanasyev is 9 cm without one millimeter. </p><p>  So, the young man shot a short video and posted it on YouTube.  In this video, the main "character" is the language.  What only <span>this prankster</span> does not get up!  Nick easily scratches his chin, picks his nose, licks his elbow without any problems and ... tickles his eye.  And the latter, by the way, seems to be impossible up to this point.  But the resourceful American proved that you should never underestimate your capabilities.  A huge number of people watched the ‚Äútongue-out‚Äù video in a short time.  Among them were Nickelodeon channel producers.  The completely relaxed young man, and especially his language, made a huge impression on the employees of the TV channel, and they offered him a role in the series iCarly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="longest photo language" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10494/346976.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h2>  British record holder </h2><p>  But Nick Afanasyev didn‚Äôt get into the famous annual Guinness Book.  In the nomination "The longest language in the world", the award was received by a resident of <span>Misty Albion</span> Stephen Taylor.  At the time of fixing the first record, the length of his tongue was almost 98 mm.  After some time, it was decided to conduct a second test, and what was the surprise of the judges when they saw that the mentioned organ of Stephen had grown by five millimeters!  As Taylor himself jokes, this metamorphosis could occur due to his constant participation in various television shows and programs.  This glory has its positive, albeit slightly sensitive, moments: not everyone, even a famous person, is invited to kiss actress Bridget Nielson (wife of Sylvester Stallone).  But Stephen received this honor.  The woman was terribly interested in what it was like to kiss the owner of such a language. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the longest language in the world" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10494/346975.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Female lovely feature </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that before Stephen Taylor, the owner of the title "The Longest Language in the World" was a Ukrainian rural resident.  The length of this given part of the body was 10.1 cm. However, not only men can boast of the presence of such a feature.  Among the representatives of the weak and beautiful half of humanity there are also ladies who flaunt with a long tongue.  For example, the American Chanel <span>Taper.</span>  <span>This</span> dark-skinned beauty lives in California.  At first glance, a cute, laughing girl is not unusual.  However, it is the smile that hides the longest tongue.  Photos of the girl, where she licks ice cream, went around the <span>globe.</span>  A huge number of jokes and jokes fell on Chanel.  However, she is proud of her feature, whose length is 97.5 mm. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Our smaller brothers </h2>

    <p>  Of course, language is that part of the body that animals also have.  Who said that the longest language is in humans?  Cute Pekingese Puggy proves the opposite.  The length of his tongue is 11.43 mm.  Due to this, the miniature dog appeared on the pages of the annual collection of world records, which is the Guinness Book of Records. </p>
