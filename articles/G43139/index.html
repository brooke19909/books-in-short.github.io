  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pyramids in Cairo: history, description, tours, photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Ancient Cairo, which received the poetic name "the city of a thousand minarets," gathered the best achievements of ancient civilization.  The modern metropolis, attracting crowds of tourists, surprises with its riddles.  Egypt‚Äôs unique assets are the magnificent pyramids, which have become the hallmark of the state that arose on the banks of the Nile.  They remind descendants of the former greatness of local rulers. </p><p>  The greatest architectural monuments of antiquity, located near the capital of Egypt, to this day inspire awe.  Looking at the monumental pyramids in Cairo, photos of which excite the imagination of any traveler, you begin to think about how much time and effort was spent on the construction of mysterious structures. </p><h2>  The funeral cult in the religion of the ancient Egyptians </h2><p>  The religion of Ancient Egypt, which shaped the worldview and culture of the people, was a collection of various cults that underwent numerous changes.  It was characterized by an abundance of gods, including the pharaohs - the lords of the state, who, according to ordinary people, were intermediaries between heaven and earth, were subject to deification.  The ascension to the throne of the new ruler was the beginning of a new era.  The kings responsible for the welfare of the country received the greatest heritage - the Egyptian land, which they had to keep as a priceless treasure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.safagashoreexcursions.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Unique archaeological and historical sites" class="if uuid-3168353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3168353.jpg"></div><p>  In the religion of ancient Egypt, it is no coincidence that a memorial cult held a special place.  People believed that death was the beginning of the afterlife.  In order for it to be prosperous, certain conditions must be observed.  The main thing is to preserve the body, which was the receptacle of the immortal spirit of the deceased.  A unique embalming technique was invented, which, supposedly, was taught to the priests by the patron of the dead - the god Anubis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Royal tombs </h2><p>  After the physical death of the pharaohs, their bodies were mummified, because only in this case the spirit that came out of the body would connect with it and continue to live.  If ordinary tombs were built for ordinary people, then for the governors of God on the earth erected giant pyramids that symbolized the ascent of the heavenly stairs.  Inside the labyrinths, in hard-to-reach chambers, both a sarcophagus with a mummy and objects that were useful in the afterlife were placed. </p><p>  The giant pyramids, which were a kind of "stairs" on the way to the sky, were not built at all to show the creative abilities of the masters of that time.  The tombs of the kings, always distinguished by their size, symbolized the high rank of the pharaohs in relation to all other people. </p><p>  Often the tombs were empty, and the mummies of the pharaohs were buried in places inaccessible to the robbers.  This fact did not prevent the pyramids from fulfilling the function of ascending to heaven rulers gaining immortality.  And after death, the kings received divine status. </p><h2>  Landmark included in the list of seven ancient wonders of the world </h2><p>  The most famous tourist attraction of Cairo - the Giza pyramids, located in the suburbs of the capital of Egypt.  This is a whole complex of monumental structures, consisting of important monuments of civilization.  Included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, it is located on the Giza plateau - part of the virgin desert, in the sand of which hides a unique evidence of the greatness of the culture of the ancient Egyptians. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Dwellings intended for the posthumous life of the pharaohs have long been the hallmark of the country.  These are the oldest buildings in the world that have been reached for posterity in satisfactory condition, and each visitor will be able to touch the history of mankind, while feeling the connection of time. </p><h2>  The most interesting tourist site </h2><p>  The complex of ancient monuments includes the tombs of Mykerin, Chefren and Cheops, the second pharaoh of the 4th dynasty of Ancient Egypt.  It is known that this was a cruel ruler, who directed all the resources of the state to the construction of his "home after life."  The Cheops Pyramid in Cairo, created from several million smooth blocks, is the most interesting object of this place.  It was built in three stages over several decades and, according to historians, the construction was completed in 2560 BC. </p><p>  In a large-scale building of antiquity there are three burial chambers, one of which was supposed to become the tomb of the king.  Modern archaeologists have discovered a sarcophagus made of pink granite, without a lid.  The mummy of the pharaoh was absent, and this was a huge disappointment for the ministers of science, who concluded that the ruler was buried elsewhere. </p><div class="photo" data-original="holeinthedonut.com" data-author=": Young Artist in the Village of El Kab, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cheops Pyramid (Khufu)" class="if uuid-3168375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3168375.jpg"></div><p>  The height of the monumental structure is more than 146 meters, and its weight is about 6 million tons.  It is considered one of the largest structures erected in the entire history of mankind.  Over five thousand tons of limestone and eight thousand tons of granite were spent on the construction.  It is curious that three small companion pyramids are located around it, which, most likely, were intended for the wives of the pharaoh. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Mysteries of monumental construction </h2><p>  You can talk about the Pyramid of Cheops for a long time, but any narration will be incomplete, since it holds many unsolved secrets.  This seems unbelievable, but the ancient Egyptians knew geometry about the so-called golden ratio, which was reflected in the proportions of the pyramid in Cairo and its angle of inclination.  And to this day, the method of its construction is not unraveled, as well as who exactly acted as a labor force in those distant times. </p><p>  Scientists have found that the top of the gigantic structure is directed to the North Pole and "looks" at the North Star.  There is even a version according to which an amazing monument of antiquity is actually an astronomical observatory.  It is not clear how the ancient builders were able to calculate everything so accurately, because they did not have special devices.  It is no coincidence that supporters of mystical theories claim that gigantic structures are the work of representatives of alien civilizations. </p><h2>  Tomb and its secrets </h2><p>  The pyramid of the pharaoh Chephren (Khafra) is the second largest.  With a height of more than 136 meters, it immediately catches the eye thanks to the remains of the lining at the very top.  Tourists cannot get inside the pyramid in Cairo, so you can get to know it only from the outside.  She was plundered 4 thousand years ago, and the mummy of the pharaoh disappeared along with the jewels.  Although some researchers suggest that she simply was not there. </p><p>  Inside the structure there is only one burial chamber with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã71 meters, in which there was a sarcophagus.  Two tunnels leading into the room are connected to each other near the entrance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chefren's Pyramid (Hafra)" class="if uuid-3168382" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3168382.jpg"></div><p>  Its main feature is the good preservation of the memorial temples built near the tomb and covered with sand.  In one of them, archaeologists discovered a unique statue of a ruler of diorite - igneous rock.  Pharaoh sits on the throne, and behind him is depicted the falcon god of Horus.  In total, about 200 sculptures of Chefren of various sizes were found, thanks to which contemporaries know how he looked. </p><p>  Here you can look at a limestone slab weighing more than 400 tons and admire the craftsmanship of ancient builders.  It is difficult to imagine how they moved a gigantic block. </p><h2>  Tomb of Pharaoh Mikerin </h2><p>  The smallest building located on the Giza plateau, in the suburbs of Cairo (Egypt), is the Mykerin pyramid, where tourists are not allowed to enter.  Due to its modest size (height 61 meters), it does not cause much interest among tourists, and once it was called the most beautiful of the three.  Lined with red granite and white limestone, it made a huge impression on people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Mycerin Pyramid" class="if uuid-3168384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3168384.jpg"></div><p>  The architectural masterpiece was covered with sand, which ensured its good preservation.  Next to it are three small pyramids, one of which was intended for the wife and sister of the pharaoh.  And the rest were unfinished. </p><p>  Archaeologists have found several statues depicting a ruler.  But the most curious was the composition, called the "triad" - a sculpture of the formidable king, surrounded by two goddesses (Bat and Hatkor). </p><div class="photo" data-original="it.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mycerinus and 2 goddesses" class="if uuid-3168393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3168393.jpg"></div><p>  The only entrance to the pyramid is at a height of only 4 meters.  Scientists are not interested in the burial chamber itself, but in a nearby building with six niches.  About his appointment and now there is not a single assumption. </p><h2>  Several ways to get to the pyramids in Giza </h2><p>  Since the greatest architectural monuments are located within the city, you can get to them from anywhere in Egypt.  How to get to the pyramids in Cairo?  Travelers who prefer to independently explore the sights of a colorful country can take buses 900 and 997, which run from the administrative center towards ancient Memphis.  However, for tourists, urban minibuses are considered unsafe. </p><p>  It is best to take the metro (second line) and get off at the Giza station, and from it you will have to walk 10 kilometers or take a taxi. </p><p>  Tourists are interested in how much to travel from Cairo to the pyramids?  If you rent a car, which will allow you to freely manage your time, then after half an hour you can admire the unique sights.  A rental day costs about $ 40 / 2,600 rubles. </p><h2>  Cost of visit and opening hours </h2><p>  An entrance ticket can be bought at the box office located at one of the entrance to the complex.  Its cost is 80 Egyptian pounds / 300 rubles.  To get into the pyramid of Cheops, you will have to pay another 100 pounds / 371 rubles. </p><p>  Participants in organized excursions to the pyramids in Cairo buy a one-day tour (approximately $ 85/5500 rubles), the price of which includes only an entrance ticket.  A visit to the interior of the complex is paid separately.  The ticket must be kept, as it may be useful in some cases. </p><p>  The pyramid complex in Giza daily receives visitors from 8.00 to 17.00.  The Ramadan, the holy month for Muslims (the month of obligatory fasting, which in 2019 will begin on May 5 and end on June 3), will be closed to tourists at 15.00.  Opening hours in winter - from 8.00 to 16.30. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  Those who suffer from cardiovascular diseases and claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces), hypertensive patients, asthmatics are best to refrain from exploring the pyramids in Cairo. </p><p>  You can spend the whole day visiting the entire complex.  However, for tourists who want to go around only the tombs, one hour is enough. </p><p>  It is worth remembering that only 300 people a day can visit the Cheops pyramid.  Therefore, those who dream of getting inside should come here early in the morning, when tickets have not yet been sold out.  Tourists are allowed in small groups, and you will have to wait about half an hour at the entrance. </p><h2>  Pyramids of Cairo: reviews </h2><p>  According to tourists, I don‚Äôt feel like leaving an amazing architectural masterpiece.  The magnificent creations of man‚Äôs hands are striking in their scale.  Hundreds of thousands of lovers of beauty visit a unique complex that makes a great impression on them.  The most famous tourist attraction must be seen with your own eyes. </p><p>  Of course, the greatness of the pyramids cannot be felt until you are near them.  In order to touch the greatest wonder of the world with their hands, people have come a long way. </p><p>  There are also dissatisfied tourists who are nostalgic for the past.  They remember the archaeological complex by what it was when it had not yet turned into a tourist area.  At the greatest structures of antiquity, you could sit in silence, thinking about the eternal.  And now, according to travelers, peace is only a dream. </p><h2>  Pyramid with a romantic name </h2><p>  The complex in Giza is not the only pyramids located within the capital of the country.  In total, there are about 118 monuments of ancient Egypt, but many of them have not been preserved and now represent a shapeless pile of stones.  Fortunately, time spared an architectural work invaluable to world culture, unique in its form and construction technology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.godayuse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pink Snofru Pyramid" class="if uuid-3168369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3168369.jpg"></div><p>  The design of the Pink Pyramid in Cairo, located 26 kilometers from the administrative center of the country, in the village of Dakhshur, looks the same as the masterpieces of Giza.  However, it has a low inclined degree of the walls.  A regular isosceles triangle has a height of 104 meters, and the size of its base is 220 meters.  This is the first attempt to build a classic pyramid. </p><p>  Above the burial chamber of the pharaoh there are 5 discharge cavities, between which stone slabs lie.  This is done to evenly distribute the weight of the powerful structure. </p><h2>  The grandiose creation of human hands </h2><p>  The majestic historical monument, which occupies the third place in its height, is faced with limestone, which, during sunset, acquires a beautiful pink hue.  It is for this that the pyramid got its romantic name.  It is believed that the construction of the building, shrouded in a halo of mystery, is connected with the king Snofru, who ruled in the 16th century BC, since inscriptions were found on the plates, where his name appears.  It was a wise pharaoh who strengthened the borders of his state.  However, the ruler‚Äôs sarcophagus was not found inside the Pink Pyramid in Cairo, so the question of the ownership of the tomb remains open. </p><p>  The entrance to the grandiose creation of human hands is located on the north side, a wooden staircase leads to it, through which visitors get inside.  Admission is free, however, people should be careful because there is a very high concentration of ammonia, and you won‚Äôt be able to see the attraction without a gauze bandage.  Strong odor can even lead to loss of consciousness. </p><p>  The burial complex in Dakhshur is not very popular among tourists.  Each guest will be able to calmly get acquainted with the perfectly preserved monument of antiquity both outside and inside. </p><h2>  What do tourists say? </h2><p>  According to visitors, there is nothing to fear when observing safety rules.  Just do not go inside those who are afraid to be in a confined space.  The pyramid is completely open to the public, including the burial chamber.  According to travelers, in silent mysterious galleries you experience absolutely incredible sensations. </p><p>  It is best to come here as part of an organized excursion.  This, according to visitors, is the cheapest and safest way.  The cost of the tour is 33 dollars / 2150 rubles.  The price includes a transfer from the hotel, as well as the services of a Russian-speaking guide.  How much do you need to get from Cairo to the pyramid on a comfortable bus?  According to travelers, the trip takes no more than an hour. </p><p>  You can take a taxi, but in this case you will have to pay the driver to wait for passengers, since it will be very problematic to catch the car back.  This is a rather deserted place, representing a potential danger to foreigners. </p><p>  One hour is enough to see all the most interesting inside and out.  And visitors to the country who are interested in ancient history are never disappointed. </p><h2>  New find </h2><p>  In 2017, Egyptian archaeologists announced the discovery, whose age is approximately 3700 years.  The pyramid found near Cairo in Egypt is in good condition.  According to scientists, a monument of ancient architecture, which is older than the famous necropolis in Giza, will present many more surprises. </p><p>  Researchers who have discovered a passage leading into the structure and connecting the ground premises hope to find other parts of the ancient Egyptian necropolis. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Great masterpieces of world culture" class="if uuid-3168414" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/3168414.jpg"></div><p>  The pyramids in Cairo are a monument to human labor and the knowledge with which monumental structures appeared.  The mysteries of amazing masterpieces will excite the minds of scientists for a long time, prompting them to new research. </p>
