    <p>  In early 2014, the United States hosted a worldwide exhibition of gadgets, where new televisions were presented.  Their features were UHD format, color rendering depth and high detail picture.  And they were distinguished by an ultra-modern screen.  And the Samsung TV, the curved screen of which made a splash, became the flagship model.  As representatives of the company noted, this is a striking design solution that has a lot of advantages.  However, the very first TV of this type was the model from Sony, which was introduced back in 2013. </p><h2>  What is the point? </h2><p>  Viewing on a curved <span>TV is good</span> because the eye completes the picture, and the screen seems even larger.  The viewer thinks that he is maximally immersed in the action and is among the events taking place on the screen.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a solution is to repeat the shape of the human eye with the screen, which ensures equidistance from the pupil.  Such an image is easier to perceive, and its clarity level will be higher compared to conventional TVs.  The curved screen introduced in Samsung TV is an innovative solution that gives the viewer only a pleasant experience.  What are the advantages of the new product, and is it worth choosing such TVs? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Be in the middle of an event </h2><p>  If you like 3D effects and appreciate the involvement in what is happening on the monitor, then you will definitely like the curved screens.  A similar effect is achieved due to the fact that this design uses <span>peripheral vision,</span> which creates the feeling of complete immersion in reality, and the picture is panoramic.  Many people like to be involved in what is happening, so curved screens attract so much attention. </p><h2>  <span>Contrast colors</span> and high resolution. </h2>

    <p>  Modern TVs with a <span>curved screen,</span> and so far there are not so many, are equipped with innovative systems and technologies.  So, Peak Illuminator is the technology responsible for intelligent backlighting.  Its task is to reduce the power consumption of the TV in dark areas, increasing the brightness of bright areas.  Accordingly, this provides excellent contrast against a deep black background. </p><p>  Another technology is UHD Dimming.  It is responsible for the high quality of the image, however, for the perfect display of details on the screen, the image must be further processed.  The essence of technology is that the screen is divided into sections.  For each of them, contrast, color and level of detail are selected, which together allows you to improve the image.  Such cropping significantly improves the quality of the picture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  4K UHD is a completely new format that only curved screen televisions have.  Due to the crystal clear image and amazing detail on any screen, this format looks simply gorgeous.  No less striking is the incredible color palette, because Samsung PureColour technology focuses on a harmonious combination of shades that create a gorgeous image.  Another technology responsible for the saturation and naturalness of colors is Nano Crystal.  So if a harmonious combination of contrast, brightness and clarity is important for you, then you will definitely like the curved screens. </p><h2>  SUHD TV: what's so special? </h2>

    <p>  For many of us, the old technique is familiar, and we perceive various modern trends, if not negatively, then with a fair amount of doubt.  The same view is caused by many curved TV screen.  Of course, he has pros and cons.  Let's try to group them all in one section, in order to finally conclude whether the screen is good or bad.  The main advantages include the following: </p><ol><li>  The increased viewing angle.  A curved screen, especially if its resolution is 4K, allows you to see many small details. </li><li>  High sharpness and its depth create a sense of volume, which is visible in several planes at once. </li><li>  Thanks to the curved shape, the screen area visually becomes larger. </li><li>  Stylish design that can become a bright accent of any room. </li></ol><p>  On the other hand, it has a curved TV screen flaws, and they are very significant.  To begin with, we note the dimensions: far from every room you can put such a device.  Secondly, experts note that the curved screen distorts the picture, especially when observing horizontal lines.  So it‚Äôs unlikely that you can watch any movie in comfort.  Another ‚Äúdisease‚Äù of such screens is glare, which is peculiar to just concave surfaces.  An even more significant drawback of curved-screen televisions is their high cost: few can afford models from 70,000 rubles. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  It turns out that TVs with a curved screen are new, modern.  True, this is rather a prestigious purchase than rational and profitable, since the cost of the equipment is too high, and the designs themselves do not differ in great ease of use.  Let's just say: curved screens are most often a tribute to fashion, and not a convenient technique that would be useful in everyday life.  Many buyers do not even see the difference between curved and flat TVs. </p>
