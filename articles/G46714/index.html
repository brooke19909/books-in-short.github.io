    <h2>  How does this system work </h2><p>  How to install Samsung Pay, we figured out, now it remains to understand how to use it.  In this case, there is nothing complicated, you just need to bring your smartphone to the terminal. </p><p>  It is worth noting a rather important fact, it consists in the fact that this application works not only on specially equipped terminals, but also on ordinary ones that have a magnetic strip.  As a rule, cashiers do not know about this innovation and can come up with many reasons to prevent you from using this system.  But this application exists and shows its work.  Soon everyone will know about him. </p><p>  You need to know that at the checkout there are no signs about the receipt of such a means of payment.  The terminal itself recognizes your smartphone and perceives it as a card, after which you just need to enter the code and pay in such a way without the participation of the card and cash. </p><h2>  Safety of this innovation </h2><p>  The process of obtaining information on how to install Samsung Pay, we went through.  But is this service safe?  Today in Russia there are quite a few smartphones that could accept this program.  In addition, these are smartphones of one company. </p><p>  Undoubtedly, the security issue of such an innovation is of concern to many consumers today, but Samsung experts assure that all payments are protected quite reliably and provide three reasons: </p><ol><li>  When making a payment, the system does not use your card number, but a specific code that you know. </li><li>  Each purchase can not do without entering a password on your part or a fingerprint. </li><li>  In order for the payment to pass, the system uses special cryptograms.  These cryptograms are directly responsible for the security of the smartphone and payment. </li></ol><h2>  Consumer benefits </h2><p>  Samsung Pay when using will not charge the consumer money as a commission.  In addition, the entire system of accumulating bonuses and other similar nuances is the same as when applying a standard card.  Everything is made exclusively for your comfort.  Much depends on the bank, because everyone has their own rules.  This program also holds certain promotions in which the consumer can get movie tickets or those or other trips, discounts on goods in stores.  Offers of this program and manufacturers are constantly changing to please their customers. </p>
