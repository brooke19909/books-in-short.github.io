There is a legend that Zeus the Olympian with lightning destroyed a rock, forming a canyon in it in order to punish Prometheus, chained him to the mountain because he gave people fire that was previously available only to the gods.  After many years of torment, Prometheus freed by Hercules descended to the sea and washed his body, covered with wounds, in the waters and was healed. </p><p>  So now, the sea water around Utrish is considered healing, and the huge stone wall is called Prometheus.  The number of local residents ranges from one and a half hundred families.  All of them work in the tourism industry and mainly receive income from vacationers, stopping at a stop and visiting attractions.  Big Utrish, or rather its attractions and memorable places, collect a huge number of travelers. </p>

Located in the village, it has several advantages: close enough to places of residence and amenities that are equipped for tourists.  In particular, showers, bathrooms and cabins were installed here to change the wardrobe to a beach one and vice versa.  Waste containers were placed in an amount that allows them to not be filled in full, and they also clean the territory during the day, which allows residents to relax on a clean beach.  And those who are not very friendly with the sun's rays can take refuge from them in the shade of trees growing on the beach. </p><p>  There are also enough attractions, due to which the natives replenish the budget: you can fly by parachute, ride the so-called ‚Äúbanana‚Äù, jet skis and other attractions demanded by tourists. </p><p>  The central beach smoothly goes into the wild, which was chosen by people trying to get as close to nature as possible by refusing clothes, as the inscriptions in front of him inform. </p><p>  If you prefer a more secluded vacation away from worldly bustle, you have the opportunity to settle in a lagoon, of which there are several, and they are indescribably beautiful with their purest water.

    <p>  You can admire the Cape Crocodile, so nicknamed by the locals.  It looks like a hill on the top of which juniper grows, but from the side of the sea it is a steep rock, similar in shape to the head of a crocodile.  And yet this cape limits the area of ‚Äã‚Äãlegal recreation for tourists. </p>
