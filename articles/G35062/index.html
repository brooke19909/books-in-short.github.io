But today, boys and girls are presented with an arsenal of modern sources from which it will not be difficult for them to find out what his biography was.  Frunze Mikhail Vasilievich is a revolutionary, a statesman, an army commander, and a military theorist. </p><p>  Many historians are inclined to believe that the life of this hero of the revolution resembles a novel with a fascinating plot.  Mikhail Vasilyevich Frunze, whose brief biography was known to all pioneers and Komsomol members, was sentenced to death twice, but reckless daring saved him from this terrible fate.  However, the halo of mystery covered the death of a revolutionary that occurred in 1925. </p>

    <p>  Political scientists and historians put forward the most odious versions of his departure from life.  Some believe that this is the work of the ‚Äúleader of the peoples,‚Äù others believe that Mikhail Vasilyevich Frunze, whose brief biography has long been carefully studied by scientists, was mortally wounded in the hunt, while others say that one of the doctors unsuccessfully made the anesthesia poisonous during the operation. "chloroform.  One way or another, but the point in this matter will not be set soon.  So who is he, Mikhail Vasilyevich Frunze, whose brief biography has been described in full detail by historians today?  Consider this issue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Years of childhood and youth </h2><p>  So, Mikhail Vasilyevich Frunze.  It will not work briefly about him, since all stages of his life contain many remarkable and interesting facts. </p><p>  He was born on February 2, 1885 in Kyrgyzstan (Pishpek settlement).  The father of the future revolutionary worked as a simple paramedic in Turkestan.  Secondary education Mikhail Vasilyevich Frunze, whose brief biography of modern youth is little known, received in today's capital of Kazakhstan (then the city of Verny).  Moreover, for special diligence in his studies, the young man was awarded a gold medal. </p><h2>  Student time </h2><p>  In 1904, Frunze went to the city on the Neva and became a student at the Polytechnic University. </p>

    <p>  It was then that the young man began to form his views on the political system in the country.  Frunze Mikhail Vasilyevich chose the path of the romantic idealist, who generally supported the theory of populism.  However, he interpreted it in his own way: it is not necessary to be useful in the village or to work for the good of the village, work can also be carried out in the city, the main thing is to actively contact the workers in the factories. </p><h2>  RSDLP </h2><p>  And after a while, Frunze‚Äôs political views underwent significant changes.  Mikhail Vasilyevich transformed into an ardent anti-state, becoming a radicalist with a clearly "left" bias.  The young man soon dropped out of college, focusing on revolutionary propaganda. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1904, Frunze Mikhail Vasilievich, whose photo was previously published in textbooks on the history of the USSR, became a member of the RSDLP.  He participated in the events of the First Revolution in Russia and received a wounded arm.  After that, Mikhail Frunze was firmly assigned the pseudonym "Comrade Arseny" (many associates knew his other "callsigns" - Vasilenko, Trifonych, Mikhailov). </p>

    <p>  The revolutionary began underground work to overthrow tsarism in Russia.  Soon he initiates a textile strike in Ivanovo-Voznesensk, rallying a fairly large team of like-minded people around him.  In the same city, Frunze Mikhail Vasilievich (the real name in the "party" milieu is Mikhailov, Vasilenko) creates the Council of Workers' Deputies.  Subsequently, he will repeatedly use this political platform for pickets, demonstrations, marches. </p><p>  At the end of 1905, Mikhail Vasilievich, together with his associates, took part in an armed uprising that broke out in the capital on Presnya.  Soon, fate encounters Frunze with the leader of the world proletariat, Vladimir Ulyanov.  Their acquaintance takes place at the next congress of the RSDLP, which was organized in the Swedish capital. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Terror and Link </h2><p>  Carrying out revolutionary work, Frunze often resorted to terror.  For example, in early 1907, Mikhail Vasilievich launched an attack to capture the Shuya printing house, as a result of which the law enforcement officer was injured.  The sentence for the revolutionary turned out to be more than severe: twice he was sentenced to death.  But justice prevented the public.  Some of its representatives considered the punishment to be excessively cruel; in the end, the authorities made concessions, mitigating the punishment of Frunze.  Mikhail Vasilievich was exiled to hard labor, and then sent to Siberia in exile status (Irkutsk province). </p>

    <p>  Moreover, he had to stay in it until the end of his days. </p><h2>  Return to the underground work of the revolutionary </h2><p>  In 1916, he escapes from exile.  First he ends up in Irkutsk, then in Chita, where, under the name Vasilenko, he gets a job in the local resettlement department.  But the party comrades did not forget about Mikhail Vasilyevich.  His place in the party was one of the key.  Frunze receives the task: to ensure revolutionary work among soldiers.  After some time in the army, he was able to establish himself as an experienced propagandist and revolutionary.  In the landmark for the country in 1917 "Trifonitch" fought on the side of the revolutionaries in Moscow. </p><h2>  After October </h2><p>  When the Bolsheviks were able to seize power in the country, the nature of the work carried out by Mikhail Frunze changed.  Interesting facts from his biography only confirm that he simply had to make a dizzying career in the political sphere.  Before the October Revolution, his main task was to demoralize the army and abolish bourgeois state institutions.  After the victory of the Bolsheviks, he was elected as a deputy of the Constituent Assembly from the "left". </p><p>  In 1918, Frunze headed the Ivanovo-Voznesensky Provincial Committee of the RCP (B.) And received the post of military commissar of the Ivanovo-Voznesensky province.  After some time, Mikhail Vasilyevich was entrusted with the duties of the military commissar of the Yaroslavl Military District, to which as many as eight provinces were subordinate. </p>

    <p>  Shortly before this, a rebellion broke out in Yaroslavl against the new government, so Frunze needed to consolidate around him devoted soldiers of Bolshevism, who would become the backbone of the Red Army. </p><h2>  The essence of work in the army </h2><p>  Of course, Trifonitch did not possess broad theoretical knowledge in terms of competent and flawless preparation and conduct of military operations.  However, Frunze Mikhail Vasilievich in the Civil War tried to use the knowledge and experience of military experts, albeit former officers.  He regularly contacted people competent in military affairs, asking them for advice on what to do in a given situation.  Naturally, Frunze filled his gaps in the theory of the art of warfare with the help of special literature.  One way or another, but the fact that Mikhail Vasilievich possessed leadership qualities, due to which he was able to rally and lead the numerous detachments of the Red Army, to question would be a mistake.  He himself did not hesitate to take a rifle and to show by personal example how to deal with the enemy.  And as a result of such battles in 1919, in the vicinity of Ufa, Frunze received a shell shock. </p>

    <p>  But the main merit of the revolutionary was that he was able to quickly establish and coordinate the work of the staffs and mobilize the rear in emergency situations. </p><h2>  Victories at the front </h2><p>  In 1919, "Trifonitch" led the 4th Army of the Eastern Front and began to lead the Southern Group of Front Forces, which came into resistance with the White Guard forces of <span>Admiral Kolchak.</span>  Frunze conducted several successful military operations (Buguruslan, Belebey, Ufa), as a result of which White‚Äôs positions were moved back to the Urals and then to Siberia. </p><p>  Then Mikhail Vasilievich was on the Turkestan front.  He was able to break through the blockade of Turkestan and free the province from the White Guards.  Frunze won the battles with the Separate Orenburg, Separate Ural, Southern, Semerechinskaya armies. </p><p>  At the next stage of his military career, Mikhail Vasilievich is waging war on the Southern Front against General Wrangel.  After the Civil War, Frunze gained fame as a commander in the fight against the Ural Cossacks, Kolchak and Wrangel. </p><p>  In the early 1920s, Trifonitch fought in Ukraine with criminal elements and Makhno units, where he received a bullet. </p><h2>  Further career </h2><p>  When the peak of the political confrontation between Stalin and Trotsky came, Frunze headed the Headquarters of the Red Army and became assistant chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the USSR.  After some time, he was entrusted with the responsible post of the People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs.  In this capacity, he continued to reform the army based on Trotsky‚Äôs achievements.  At the same time, Mikhail Vasilievich did not join the ranks of the Stalin group, adhering to the political confrontation of neutrality. </p>

    <p>  But in the army "Trifonovich" enjoyed great authority, which could not but alarm the representatives of the political elite of the USSR. </p><h2>  Death </h2><p>  He died in the fall of 1925 on the operating table.  Recently, Frunze has exacerbated pain in the abdomen.  Doctors repeatedly recorded internal bleeding in Mikhail Vasilievich.  According to doctors, the cause of death was a common blood poisoning. </p>
