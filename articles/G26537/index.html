The fact is that, having insured his movable and immovable property against damage or theft, a citizen can no longer worry about the occurrence of an unforeseen event.  With any scenario, a person, even having lost valuable things, can soon acquire them again for payments received from the relevant organization.  How to insure your property, protect your financial interests, will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Why do you need to insure your property? </h2><p>  Our citizens are accustomed to living in a positive way; they don‚Äôt even think about a fire, flood, or other emergency situations.  How insulting it becomes when all the property in which huge amounts of money and energy were invested is completely burned up and cannot be restored.  But you could insure him and buy a new amount paid by the insurance company. </p><p>  Of course, it is impossible to foresee all <span>emergency situations,</span> but it is possible to insure against possible harmful effects or circumstances to which a valuable thing is exposed.  That is why the number of concluded agreements with agents of such organizations is increasing every year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="property insurance of individuals" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/809452.jpg" width="600"></div>

The contract indicates either a standard set of unpleasant cases (fire, theft, flood, etc.), or those risks to which the property is subject to the discretion of the owner. </p><p>  The cost of voluntary insurance is calculated individually for each client, depending on the type of property and its life.  It is important to remember that not all valuables can be considered as an insurance object.  This is because if the owner of the property has value (for example, a thing is expensive as a memory), for the company it is just a piece of paper or a trinket.  Each <span>subject of the contract is</span> strictly regulated by the rules of a separate <span>insurance organization,</span> therefore, before choosing an insurer, it is necessary to carefully study the conditions of its work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="property insurance of individuals Rosgosstrakh" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/809455.jpg" width="475"></div>

    <h2>  Compulsory insurance of property of individuals </h2><p>  The most common object of compulsory property insurance is the protection of vehicles in case of accident.  It is mandatory for all citizens who have a car, because the likelihood of an emergency is very high.  Residential premises and houses of citizens at high risk are also subject to compulsory insurance.  For example, those buildings that are located in the seismic zone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Property insurance of individuals is strictly regulated by law, and about the objects that must be insured, you can ask the company. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="compulsory insurance of property of individuals" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/809459.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How much does it cost to insure property of individuals </h2><p>  In addition to valuing valuables, you will need to pay a tax on property insurance for individuals.  The cost will be calculated individually for each client.  However, for car insurance there are certain prices and tariffs that you can check with your company representative.  Only the CTP insurance policy, which protects the civil liability of all drivers, has a rate strictly regulated by the state.  It is the same in all insurance companies, but the cost of insuring an apartment or other valuable property of the owner should be clarified with the agent. </p><p>  In any case, insurance of property of individuals, whose rates are calculated individually, will be able to protect the interests of customers in unforeseen situations, and will come out much cheaper than, for example, buying new housing with your own money.  The companies take the estimated <span>cost of the insurance</span> object as the basis of calculation and multiply it by the tariff rate, which is equal to 0.2 to 3.1%.  The higher the probability of an emergency, the higher the percentage.  To simplify your calculations, you can use a special calculator for calculating the insurance amount, which can be found on the official website of the company. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="property insurance of individuals rates" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/809464.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  Before calling a company representative to assess the property and conclude a contract, you should call an independent expert.  He will be able to adequately assess valuables without lowering their value, as many insurance organizations do.  Property insurance of individuals is a profitable niche in this market of services.  That is why, wanting to earn even more, unscrupulous insurers try to intentionally underestimate the value of their clients' valuables.  In order to avoid such unpleasant situations in the future, it is better to show the evaluation form to independent experts and conclude a contract further. </p>
