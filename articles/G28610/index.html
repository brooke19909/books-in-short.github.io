But this is where all knowledge ends.  Few people know that the town is located in the north-east of the Vologda region.  Veliky Ustyug is a real reserve with taiga forests, snowy winters and clean air. </p><h2>  What is he, Great Ustyug? </h2><p>  According to reviews, Veliky Ustyug is a fairly small town.  Its population is only 32 thousand inhabitants.  On its territory there are more than thirty temples, as well as architectural monuments and churches.  Many of these structures are very old and dilapidated, which makes them even more valuable.  Museums of the city acquaint guests with ancient customs and crafts, the art of woodcarving, blackening of silver, weaving.  In winter, according to reviews, Veliky Ustyug is crowded with tourists, because from the end of the twentieth century, Santa Claus has officially been living here, who invites everyone to visit his possessions and see the living rooms, as well as the city residence and take a walk through this fabulous forest, send a parcel to Santa Claus and ride a sleigh in which deer are harnessed. </p><h2>  How to get to the city? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Santa Claus lives in a fabulous place, getting to it is far from easy.  According to reviews, one has to get to Veliky Ustyug with transfers, which is not very convenient.  By train, you can get to Yadriha station or Ktolas.  And then you have to change to a taxi or bus to overcome the remaining 60-70 kilometers.  Despite the fact that the city has its own railway station, it operates only a few days a year and accepts only the Winter Tourist Express. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="great ustyug reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2157178.jpg"></div>

But there are also nuances in the form of decent distances and not the best roads. </p><p>  Severstal LLC offers tourists to go to the homeland of Santa Claus on comfortable Yak-40 aircraft.  This is the fastest way to get to the city of Novy Ustyug, as evidenced by the <span>reviews.</span>  <span>Moscow</span> - Veliky Ustyug via Cherepovets - this is only one of the routes offered by the company. </p><h2>  City transport </h2><p>  The city has public transport - minibuses and buses.  There are also daily flights to Cherepovets, Vologda and Kotlas.  The city has a fairly extensive taxi fleet, since this type of transport is very popular among numerous tourists. </p><h2>  Great Ustyug now </h2><p>  Veliky Ustyug is listed in the list of the oldest cities in the north of Russia.  It was once a wealthy merchant city.  But since then a lot of time has passed.  And the provincial city did not stand out.  But in 1999 he was awarded the title of residence of Santa Claus.  Since then, crowds of tourists have come here, who leave the most enthusiastic reviews.  Tours to Veliky Ustyug in winter are incredibly popular.  After all, Santa Claus is the main character of the best holiday of the year.  There are not so many interesting and fun places in Russia.  And to visit the homeland of Santa Claus is doubly interesting.  After all, there is nothing more beautiful than plunging into the world of fairy tales and childhood. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The city has a variety of cultural and tourist centers offering all kinds of entertainment programs.

    <p>  But in the summer, the tourist life in the city does not calm down, as evidenced by numerous reviews.  Veliky Ustyug is visited by many foreigners interested in Russian culture.  After all, the city has ancient architectural monuments and simply stunningly beautiful places. </p><h2>  The estate of Santa Claus </h2><p>  And all the greatest revival is observed in Veliky Ustyug for the New Year.  According to the reviews of tourists, you can understand that taking care of a trip to the homeland of Santa Claus is in advance.  If you want to rent a good room or a cottage on the territory of the estate, then you should do it in late spring or early summer.  Since with the advent of autumn all the places, as a rule, are already scheduled. </p><p>  According to tourists, in Veliky Ustyug there is a city residence of Santa Claus.  But the patrimony is located outside the city.  By public transport, the journey takes about half an hour.  By car, you can get much faster.  If you decide to visit the fabulous homeland of Santa Claus, then you can book a room in the city.  But tourists recommend renting apartments or cottages directly on the territory of the patrimony, as this will provide an opportunity to live in a real fairy tale for several days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trip to great ustyug reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2157180.jpg"></div>

What could be better than staying right in fabulous possessions.  The complex offers rooms and cottages for accommodation.  You can choose suitable apartments depending on how big your company is. </p><h2>  Reviews about the estate of Santa Claus </h2><p>  What could be better on New Year's Eve than a trip to Veliky Ustyug?  Reviews are a confirmation of this.  The homeland of the main wizard of the country will be interesting to see not only the kids, but also their parents.  There are many entertainments on the territory of the patrimony.  Here you can watch a mini-zoo, take part in master classes, drop by the mail of Grandfather Frost and much more.  Also on the territory there is a real Russian <span>bath, a sauna</span> with a pool, a winter garden, a glacier.  According to guests, children should definitely attend a tea party with Santa Claus.  This is a very interesting entertainment that will always be remembered.  Children can recite prepared verses and communicate directly with their idol.  But Grandfather Frost will not remain in debt and will thank the guests with gifts.  There are so many entertainments on the territory of the patrimony that even a few days will not be enough to see everything.  And to highlight something important here is simply impossible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="great ugly tourist reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2157183.jpg"></div>

    <p>  On the territory of the patrimony there are apartments of various categories, among them there are more simple rooms, and very comfortable cottages, they are recommended by tourists.  Warm and beautiful apartments with river views are the best choice for guests. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Depending on what time of year you arrived, the estate of Santa Claus offers a variety of entertainment.  In summer, you can have a great time on the cascade of ponds, boating and catamarans, and then have a barbecue.  Fishing enthusiasts can rent gear and fish. </p><p>  Well, for winter, traditional entertainments are characteristic - riding on pneumosledges and snowmobiles from a hill, the length of which is three hundred meters.  And extreme lovers can try a new route on snowmobiles.  The route starts on the estate and passes through forests and fields along the villages and the Sukhona River.  This is an unforgettable journey. </p><h2>  Fabulous restaurants </h2><p>  There are several restaurants on the territory of the patrimony.  One of them is an institution with the beautiful name "Snowflake".  The chef of the restaurant always cooks deliciously for the residents of the complex.  Nearby is also a meat restaurant "Veranda".  The institution offers delicious meat dishes - steaks, dumplings, meatballs and more.  Guests of the complex are very pleased with the food, hearty and delicious dishes, as well as hot tea - this is what you need from the cold. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="great ustyug by car reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2157186.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Well, lovers of real Russian cuisine will surely appreciate the menu of the cabbage soup restaurant.  The institution is located in a real wooden hut, which gives it fabulousness. </p><h2>  Santa Claus Residence </h2><p>  Patrimony is not the only place in the city, as evidenced by numerous reviews.  The residence in Veliky Ustyug (in the city center), of course, is not as good as in the complex, but also incredibly interesting for children.  Here Santa Claus receives city guests who have not reached his forest estate.  Children are very pleased with communication with a fairy-tale hero, not noticing any small nuances. </p><h2>  Activities for children </h2><p>  A trip to Veliky Ustyug is a holiday for any child.  There is a minimum of modern entertainment centers.  But there is a real Santa Claus.  Reviews about Veliky Ustyug are so colorful that they invariably arouse the desire to go to a fabulous city.  Even adults remain completely delighted with him.  We may have grown up long ago, but I want to believe in a fairy tale, just like in early childhood.  There are a lot of master classes in the city for children that are dedicated to Russian culture.  You can go to the Museum of Local Lore, where puppet shows are held.  And then go to the Museum of Nature of the Territory, where you immediately find yourself in the world of the Russian north.  Kids will be interested in the exposition telling about bears.  Older children can be taken to the paleontological room, where it is allowed to assemble the skeleton of a dinosaur. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="moscow great ustyug reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2157187.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is also worth a visit to the Museum of Ethnography.  Here you can do crafts, as our ancestors did: weave a belt or weave linen.  According to reviews, the New Year in Veliky Ustyug is something special.  <span>A</span> variety of establishments create a <span>festive mood</span> here.  So, for example, it is worth visiting the museum of New Year's toys.  In it, year-round you can admire the decorated Christmas trees from different eras.  By the way, if you are dreaming of a real New Year‚Äôs gift, then by all means go to the ‚ÄúDedmorozovskaya‚Äù mail. </p><h2>  Holidays </h2><p>  Great Ustyug is interesting not only in the New Year.  In the city with a traditional scale, any national holidays are celebrated.  In addition, special theme events are also organized for tourists.  Therefore, people recommend making their trip a holiday.  You will get a lot of positive emotions and a great mood.  By the end of winter, the city is celebrating Maslenitsa with might and main.  Traditional Russian festivities are arranged in the best traditions, with fist fights, pancakes, scarecrow burning, contests.  And on the territory of the patrimony during this period an annual extreme festival is held. </p><p>  In the summer, the city hosts a festival of Russian nesting dolls and bast shoes, July 21 is the day of the Great Ustyug and the Prokopyevskaya Fair.  In August, all summer Spas are celebrated.  Santa Claus doesn‚Äôt even leave for the North Pole in the summer, he receives guests in the estate.  But in November, the most beloved children's wizard celebrates his birthday.  The entertainment program on this occasion includes all sorts of Russian old-time amusements and modern events, as well as fireworks. </p><h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  Veliky Ustyug is rightly called a museum city.  There are many ancient churches and residential buildings of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  For guests, it will be interesting to visit the Cathedral Courtyard, in the territory of which there are a number of temples.  The most important of them is the Assumption Cathedral.  The courtyard itself is designed in the same style, and therefore from the outside it looks like a huge tower with chapters and turrets.  The complex is especially impressive in winter when the roofs are covered with snow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tour to great ustyug reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2157188.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is also worth paying attention to the Cathedral of St. Procopius the Righteous, which was erected in the seventeenth century.  It was built in honor of the miracle worker who lived in the city at that time.  Procopius was very revered in Veliky Ustyug, he had the gift of foresight and more than once saved the townspeople. </p>
