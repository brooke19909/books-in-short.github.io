Therefore, they came up with so many types of needlework.  And in each of them there are flowers, because this is the beauty that nature itself creates.  Crochet is considered quite a popular form of creativity.  The flower in this technique is obtained as if alive.  We‚Äôll show you how to create them with a hook and multi-colored threads. </p><h2>  Concepts and conventions </h2><p>  To make the <span>crochet</span> pattern <span>for beginners</span> understandable <span>,</span> you need to understand the conventions.  The basis of this needlework is air loops and columns, which are created from a thread using a working tool (hook). </p><p>  Air loop "vp"  It turns out if you just stretch the thread through the working loop.  If several of them are connected, a chain is formed on the basis of which the remaining parts of the product are subsequently created.  In the diagrams, it is depicted by a dot or oval. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet flowers patterns and description" class="if uuid-2473084" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2473084.jpg"></div><p>  Single crochet ‚Äúst. N.‚Äù  and double crochet "st. n."  - this is a buttonhole knitted in the previous row, which does not close immediately, but by knitting "v." into it  There can be one or more nakidov.  It all depends on how long the column itself needs to be made.  It is worth noting that each yarn, as a rule, is knitted with a separate air loop.  It is obtained by wrapping the hook with a thread before pulling the loop through the previous row of the product.  In the diagrams, it is indicated by a stick with a slash, the number of which corresponds to the number of turns of the thread along the hook. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now that we‚Äôve figured out the basics, we can move on to crochet knitting patterns. </p><h2>  Five-petal flower with leaves </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet flower pattern for beginners" class="if uuid-2473086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2473086.jpg"></div><p>  Such a crocheted flower will be a great applique on clothes.  You need to create it according to this scheme: </p><ul><li>  Tie a chain of five air loops. </li><li>  Lock them in a ring. </li><li>  In the next row also tie a chain of 5 in.  P. </li><li>  Knit a column with 2 crochets. </li><li>  Reconnect the 5th century chain.  P. </li></ul><p>  These three elements are knitted under the base.  They will become the basis for the future petal.  Repeat this knitting four more times. </p><p>  In the next row you need to make a lifting column and knit 2 tbsp first.  b.  n  on the first chain.  Then, at the base of the previous column, 9 tbsp.  2 n.  The result is a lush fan.  Then we go down the next chain of 2 tbsp.  b.  n  and again climb the second petal.  We repeat the above steps four more times. </p><p>  In the last row in each column with two crochets you need to knit 2 tbsp.  1 n. The transition from petal to petal is carried out by means of half columns (loops knitted immediately after drawing them from the base without using an additional cp). </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We pass to the petiole from the leaves.  Its basis is a chain of air loops.  When its length is sufficient, half-columns need to go back and begin to form the first leaf.  It consists of a loop of loops, on the basis of which columns are crocheted and crocheted.  Their scheme is quite simple. </p><p>  Here is such an interesting crochet product.  Flowers and leaves are then joined with a needle, or sewn separately to the product. </p><h2>  Chamomile with a large leaf </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flower with leaf" class="if uuid-2473079" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2473079.jpg"></div><p>  We will not describe the creation of a flower.  This is one of the simplest schemes that even beginners will read.  In addition, if something doesn‚Äôt work out for you or you don‚Äôt like it, you can safely change some points, because it‚Äôs also creative work in order to create something new. </p><p>  We will pay a little attention to the leaflet.  It starts out of chain c.  n. It immediately forms three curls at approximately the same level.  This should be done using the connecting half columns. </p><p>  When the curls are ready, in the next row they need to be knitted with crochets.  In the above diagram, they are located as follows: 1 tbsp.  1 n., 4 tbsp.  2 n., 3 in.  item, 4 tbsp.  2 n., 1 tbsp.  1 n  But this order can be improved, for example, start with a single crochet, then 1 with 1 double crochet, followed by 2-3 with 2 double crochets, the last 3 crochets.  So the leaf will turn out more pronounced. </p><p>  As you can see, this is a fairly simple task - crocheting.  A flower decorated with the leaf described above will have a completed look. </p><h2>  For experienced craftswomen </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet flowers description" class="if uuid-2473082" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2473082.jpg"></div><p>  For those who like more complex flowers, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the scheme in the photo above.  This product has six rows.  At first, this scheme may seem rather complicated.  Crocheting flowers on it will not require special skills from you, because this motif was created on the basis of all the same double crochet columns.  Alternating, they create an unusual motif that can be used not only to decorate clothes, but also in interior decoration. </p><h2>  We leave the plane </h2><p>  Prior to this, we examined only flat motifs, but there is crochet and volumetric colors.  Do not think that it will be very difficult.  Let us prove this with the example of cloves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet flowers leaves" class="if uuid-2484111" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2484111.jpg"></div><p>  We will analyze in more detail how to make this composition beautiful. </p><p>  The flower consists of 4 motifs, which are then connected together.  Of course, experienced craftswomen can do it on one basis, but we will proceed from a simple option. </p><p>  The core is the smallest element.  It consists of 7 columns with 1 yarn and a chain of air loops.  In order to return to the base of the product, it is better to resort to half-columns, which will help to create separate long petals. </p><p>  The second element already consists of 10 petals, the basis of which is chains from the 5th century.  n. on which the half-columns go down. </p><p>  The third part fits in almost the same way as the second.  Only her base is much wider.  Its implementation is not disclosed in the diagram, but it is best to create it by knitting art.  b n  in a circle with the addition of loops in each row to make a small circle. </p><p>  Let's continue our description of crocheting a flower.  We have the last element left.  It differs from the previous one only in that its base is even slightly wider, and the petals need to be made not 10, but 20. To do this, create single crochet columns from which the petals will then be knitted. </p><p>  That's all, the product can be assembled. </p><h2>  The second version of the volumetric flower </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet flower" class="if uuid-2473074" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2473074.jpg"></div><p>  It is not necessary to do a few details to create voluminous flowers.  Crocheting gives us other ways, if a little tricked. </p><p>  In the product described above, the usual five-petal bud is taken as the basis, but it is assembled in a special way.  First you need to make lush petals.  Do not skimp on the number of columns in each of them, because the product will only benefit from this. </p><p>  When the flat flower is ready, fold the base of the petals as shown in the figure and knit them together with a single crochet.  Then hide the thread inside, and sew a beautiful bead in the place of the core. </p><h2>  Big leaf </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet flowers" class="if uuid-2473077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2473077.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes there are such ideas for which flowers and leaves are needed.  Crochet makes it possible to realize them fully.  The diagram above shows exactly a beautiful leaf, which can become both the basis of the composition and its piquant accent. </p><p>  It‚Äôs not difficult to deal with the symbols and stages of work on it, because everything is done in a circle.  Only in certain parts of the work are the main elements of the composition created, and on the reverse side, a minimal transition is made with the help of half columns, which allows not to burden the whole product with a large number of ordinary rows. </p><p>  Remember that the beginning and the end of the work is exactly the place where the stem for the flower and the petiole for the leaf begin.  In the diagram, it is indicated by points of transitional half-columns.  The stem itself can not be done if it does not play a role in the general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcrocheting flowers, because the base of the leaf will be hidden under the buds. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Creativity can captivate craftswomen for long hours.  The main interest of such classes is to create something new.  Above, we have provided crochet color patterns and descriptions.  Those who like them will create new masterpieces based on them.  After all, the most ingenious works consist of elementary things. </p><p>  Do not forget that you can experiment.  On the basis of one scheme, you can always create many new colors that will differ not only in shades, but also in the shape of the petals, their openwork, density, volume. </p>
