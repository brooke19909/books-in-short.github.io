  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Theory of Elites</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The theory of elites in classical form belongs to such figures as Pareto, Mosca, Michels.  They laid the foundation for the development of subsequent concepts.  Modern theories of elites are very diverse.  Among them there are a number of areas. </p><p>  The first group includes the theory of elites of the Machiavellian school.  The main position of the concept of this direction is grouped as follows: </p><ol><li>  Any society is recognized as elitist.  Its division into a passive majority and a ruling minority (privileged) is a natural process, the result of the natural development of man and society. </li><li>  The elite has special psychological qualities.  Education and natural talent, first of all, determine membership in it. </li><li>  There is <span>group cohesion.</span>  At the same time, unification is carried out not only according to <span>social status</span> or professional status, but also by the presence of elitist self-awareness, perception of the peculiarities of the layer whose calling is to manage society. </li><li>  The elite, with its right to leadership in the political sense, is recognized to one degree or another by the masses. </li><li>  An elitist society is structurally consistent, despite changes in personnel.  In other words, relations of domination remain basically unchanged. </li><li>  Elites are changing and forming in the process of the struggle for power.  Many people with outstanding economic and psychological qualities want to occupy a high position in society.  However, no one seeks to voluntarily give up his position or post. </li></ol><p>  The value theory of elites classifies a privileged society as a constructive basic social force.  At the same time, the position of the adherents of this concept is much softer in relation to democracy.  In general, supporters of this teaching seek to adapt it (the teaching) to the real life of the democratic countries of our time.  Among the main features of this concept should be noted: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The elite is considered the most valuable social element, endowed with high indicators and abilities in the sectors most necessary for the state. </li><li>  The privileged, dominant position of high society meets the interests of society as a whole, as it is the most productive and proactive part of the population endowed with high moral goals. </li><li>  The formation of an elite society occurs not only as a result of the struggle for power, but also due to the natural selection of the most valuable representatives in society. </li><li>  The privilege of the <span>social stratum</span> follows naturally from equal opportunities, without contradicting modern ideas about democracy.  In this case, <span>social equality</span> is understood as the equality of opportunities, and not status or results.  In the conditions of the initial inequality in the strength, intellect, and activity of democracy, they should be provided with approximately the same starting conditions.  However, at the same time, they will come to the finish line with different results and at different times. </li></ol><p>  The following theory of elites reveals the concept of "democratic elitism."  The concept is to understand democracy as a competitive manifestation of the potential of leaders for the votes and trust of voters.  In this case, the leading layer is considered not only as a group with important managerial qualities, but also as a defender of <span>democratic values.</span> </p><p>  The concept of multiplicity of elites denies this layer in the form of a single group.  According to this teaching, there are many privileged groups with limited activity for each area. </p><p>  The antithesis of this concept is the left-liberal theory.  The top leadership level, according to its adherents, is occupied by the ruling group, which does not allow the rest of the population to go to government. </p><p>  The theory of <span>political elites</span> defines a privileged society as a fairly independent minority with high political, social and psychological qualities, taking part directly in the adoption and implementation of decisions that are related to the application of state power or influence on it. </p>
