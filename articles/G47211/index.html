Let's get acquainted with the main attractions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="experitour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jesus statue in Brazil" class="if uuid-2457696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2457696.jpg"></div><h2>  Christ statue in Brazil </h2><p>  The world-famous statue of Christ the Redeemer, located at the highest point of Rio de Janeiro, is a kind of calling card not only of the city, but of the whole country.  Not a single modern film shot on the territory of a wonderful city can do without the famous panorama of Mount Corcovado and a statue of Jesus Christ with outstretched arms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The construction of the statue began at the beginning of the XX century, the main occasion was the anniversary of the independence of Brazil.  The best craftsmen from different countries worked on the future construction, since it was not possible to manufacture parts of such impressive sizes at that time in Brazil. </p><p>  The main attraction of the city of Rio de Janeiro is striking in its size, the building is about 38 meters in height.  In comparison, this is the height of a modern twelve-story building.  The statue of Christ the Redeemer is visible from anywhere in the city, because in addition to its impressive size, the height of the hill on which it is located is more than 700 meters!  In addition, this attraction of Rio de Janeiro is listed as New Wonders of the World. </p><div class="photo" data-original="parade.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the city from a height" class="if uuid-2457829" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2457829.jpg"></div><h2>  Copacabana Beach </h2><p>  <span>Copacabana Beach</span> is a very popular holiday destination in all of Brazil.  Driving the name of a city in a search engine, you automatically get thousands of different photos with the image of this attraction.  Its uniqueness lies in its length.  It stretches along the Atlantic Ocean for as many as four kilometers.  It is always crowded, because it is not only a hot tourist spot, but also a favorite place for many locals.  The history of the region begins from the moment when wealthy people began to come to Rio de Janeiro to relax and have fun, now it is an accessible beach for all with all its charms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the day, you can watch life in full swing in Rio - there are football and volleyball courts, outdoor exercise machines, diving and much more at the service of vacationers. </p><p>  Many world-famous celebrities have performed <span>on Brazil's</span> main <span>beach</span> , including Elton John and the legendary Rolling Stones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldfortravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Copacabana Beach" class="if uuid-2457701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2457701.jpg"></div><h2>  Sugarloaf Mountain </h2><p>  If there are exotic attractions in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, then this place is just one of them!  <span>Sugarloaf Mountain is</span> also the hallmark of the city and the most recognizable place in all of Latin America.

In particular, you can take gorgeous pictures during sunset.

This city was created exclusively for such purposes, luxury cars or colorful hotels do not impress anyone here, tourists prefer to watch a football game of the teenage ‚Äúyard‚Äù team on Copacabana beach or spend time on the Atlantic coast in search of themselves. </p><p>  The famous botanical garden of Rio de Janeiro is no exception.  Here are collected unique plants from different parts of our planet.  Just a walk among these "jungle" is a pleasure.  Today it is one of the main attractions of Rio de Janeiro, here you can spend a lot of time exploring unique plant species. </p><h2>  Tijuca National Park </h2><p>  The uniqueness of Tijuca Park lies in the fact that it is the largest forest in the world, located within the city territory.

At one time in Brazil, work was carried out to destroy trees to create coffee and sugar plantations.  As a result, the residents of the city decided to create an ecologically clean zone, which to this day is the Tizhuk park.  Today it is one of the most popular places in Rio de Janeiro, where you can admire not only the abundance of tropical plants and wildlife, but also picturesque waterfalls and cozy local restaurants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travellocal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tijuca National Park" class="if uuid-2457767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2457767.jpg"></div><h2>  Staircase of celaron </h2><p>  Among the popular attractions of Rio de Janeiro, it is worth noting the famous motley staircase of Celaron.  This place serves as a kind of proof that even an ordinary design can be turned into a real work of art.  The story of the staircase is very interesting.  A true professional in his field, ceramics artist Jose Selaron acquired multi-colored tiles and adorned some of the stairs, located near his house.  An interesting idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe artist was recognized by local residents and tourists, many began to bring tiles as a gift from different countries.  Thus, the seemingly ordinary staircase turned into a landmark of Rio de Janeiro. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fromwayuphigh.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Staircase of celaron" class="if uuid-2457774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2457774.jpg"></div><h2>  Maracana Stadium </h2><p>  It's no secret that all Hispanics are a sporting people, they devote most of their free time to football.
