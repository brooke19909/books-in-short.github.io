This is the easiest and surest way to get what you want.  Lending in Russia is actively developing.  Every year, people more and more turn to banks to receive such services.

Especially when it comes to a new vehicle.  But what documents are needed for a car loan?  How and where to apply for a car loan?  What requirements should a future debtor meet? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what documents are needed for a car loan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1473102.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Ambiguity </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth paying attention to the fact that there are two types of loans for a car.  The first is executed at the bank, the second - at the car dealership.  Depending on the banking organization or the seller of the vehicle, the documents provided in this or that case may differ from each other. </p><p>  Despite this, a certain list of securities is still the same under any circumstances.  So what documents are needed for a car loan at a car dealership?  And who is entitled to receive such a service? </p><h2>  About the borrower </h2><p>  Loans are not issued to everyone.  There are some limitations.  And they must be taken into account constantly.  Therefore, before you are interested in the list of securities, you need to understand whether a citizen has the right to car loans. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the moment, the following requirements are put forward to the borrower: </p><ol><li>  Age of citizen.  It‚Äôs not enough to be of legal age.  Car loans can be obtained only after 21 years.  At the same time, you cannot be a pensioner (60 or 55 years for men and women, respectively). </li><li>  Income.  The borrower must have a job and a profit.  Moreover, certain sizes.  It depends directly on the amount of the loan and the duration of payments. </li><li>  Citizenship.  Only a citizen of the Russian Federation can think about what documents are needed to apply for a car loan.  Modern Russian banks and car dealerships do not provide loans to foreigners. </li><li>  Registration.  A citizen who wants to apply for a car loan must be registered in the Russian Federation.  Moreover, registration or temporary registration is taken into account only in the city where lending is carried out. </li></ol><p>  It is recommended that you obtain more accurate information from a specific organization.  This list may be expanded.  But the items listed are binding on all borrowers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what documents are needed to apply for a car loan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1473103.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Statement </h2><p>  What documents are needed for a car loan in the salon?  The first paper is a statement.  It is presented in the form of a questionnaire, which the borrower will have to fill out.  As a rule, you do not need to bring this paper in advance.  The application form will be provided to the citizen directly in the car dealership or financial institution. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What information is written in the application?  Usually this: </p><ul><li>  <span>passport data</span> about the borrower; </li><li>  personal information about the person who applied for a loan; </li><li>  information about the car; </li><li>  loan details; </li><li>  sources of income and their amount; </li><li>  marital status of a citizen. </li></ul><p>  But this is only the beginning.  What other papers do you need to provide in this or that case, if you need to get a loan for a vehicle?  In reality, everything is not as difficult as it seems.  If you prepare in advance, then there will be no problems with the list of papers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what documents are needed for a car loan at a car dealership" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1473101.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Identification </h2><p>  The next important document is a citizen‚Äôs <span>identity card</span> .  It is necessary to provide not only its original, but also copies.  All pages that contain at least some information are taken into account. </p><p>  As an identity card, as a rule, a civil passport is provided.  Only lenders work with him.  Other identity cards are simply not accepted. </p><p>  If there is no passport at the moment, you can use a <span>temporary ID.</span>  It is likely that the loan will be approved.  But as practice shows, they usually reject it.  Therefore, it is recommended to wait for a new civil passport. </p><p>  The copies that are attached to the identification card, there is no need to certify.  At a car dealership or a bank, employees themselves will verify the conformity of the proposed papers.  Therefore, there is usually no problem with this component. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Driver's license </h2><p>  What documents are needed for a car loan?  The following paragraph is optional.  More precisely, it is absent in the requirements of some financial organizations, as well as car dealerships. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what documents are needed to get a car loan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1473100.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The fact is that a citizen can request copies and the original driver‚Äôs license.  You should not be surprised at this.  After all, banks are unlikely to get a loan for a vehicle to someone who does not know how to drive.  Driving license - a kind of confirmation of driving skills. </p><p>  In order to get it, you need to go to training in specialized schools and pass an exam.  It consists of practice and theory.  Once a driver's license is received, you can think about a loan for a car.  Without this document, as already mentioned, not everyone approves of lending.  High probability of failure. </p><h2>  Income and its sources </h2><p>  But that is not all.  Now it is worth paying attention to the most important point.  <span>What documents are needed to get a car loan?</span>  Anyway, any loan?  Citizens must submit any certificate of income.  And indicate the sources of cash. </p><p>  This is the biggest problem for citizens.  After all, with insufficient income, a person will be denied a loan.  And legally.  The following may serve as confirmation of receipt of funds on a regular basis: </p><ul><li>  certificate of work in the form of 2-personal income tax; </li><li>  bank statement; </li><li>  tax reporting on regular receipt nailed; </li><li>  rental agreement. </li></ul><p>  In any case, you will have to confirm the availability of income in certain amounts.  If the borrower, in addition to the salary, receives certain benefits, as well as scholarships, certificates of their accrual are also provided.  Moreover, in a car dealership, and in a banking company. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what documents do you need a car loan in Sberbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1473104.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Stability is the key to success </h2><p>  Then you have to confirm the stability of your earnings.  As practice shows, it is necessary to prove the time of work in the same place.  It is usually required that a citizen work for at least 3-6 months continuously in the same organization.  Or that he made a profit during the specified period on a regular basis. </p><p>  What documents are needed?  You can take a car loan if a citizen brings copies and originals with him: </p><ul><li>  labor book; </li><li>  certificate of registration of IP (if any); </li><li>  rental agreement for a property (if any). </li></ul><p>  Typically, borrowers provide employment records.  You can request them from your employer.  At the request of the owner, the document is given without any problems.  Thus, the proof of sufficient income in the family is the most problematic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what documents do you need to take a car loan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1473105.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Family status </h2><p>  What documents are needed for a car loan?  The following papers are optional, but they are often requested.  This is a confirmation of marital status.  A citizen may be asked: </p><ul><li>  certificate of marriage or divorce; </li><li>  birth certificates of all minor children; </li><li>  consent of the spouse (s) to the transaction. </li></ul><p>  The latter component often brings problems.  After all, family money is a common property.  According to the established rules, a husband or wife can complain and cancel a loan if they did not give written consent to it.  For this reason, some banks and car dealerships request written permission from the second spouse to complete the transaction. </p><h2>  Other papers </h2><p>  What documents are needed to get a car loan?  The basic list of papers is already clear.  Additionally, they may come in handy: </p><ul><li>  medical policy of VHI or CHI; </li><li>  TIN of the citizen; </li><li>  education documents; </li><li>  student certificates; </li><li>  SNILS; </li><li>  contract for the sale of a vehicle. </li></ul>
