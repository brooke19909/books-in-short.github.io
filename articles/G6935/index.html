    <h2>  basic information </h2><p>  The first undoubted advantage of the complex Aqua Hotel Resort &amp; Spa 4 * is the place in which this hotel was built.  Only 8 kilometers separate the building from the resort‚Äôs international airport and only 15 minutes drive from the famous Naama Bay.  And not far away (about 28 kilometers from the hotel) is the Old Town, which is popular among fans of visiting attractions. </p><p>  The hotel is located on the second coastline, but it is very close - approximately 700 meters from the Red Sea.  By the way, even 18 kilometers from the hotel are seaports.  So there are enough attractions and interesting places.  Yes, and get to the hotel is not difficult. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Aqua Hotel Resort &amp; Spa 4 * was built in 2010, and in the five years that have passed since the erection of the building, this complex managed to become quite famous. </p><h2>  What can the hotel offer? </h2><p>  This hotel still has certain advantages besides the fact that it is located in the very center of the resort's tourist area.  For example, guests are offered a private beach and three outdoor pools.  Plus to them - a sun terrace and a hydromassage area.  There are even two separate pools for children. </p>

    <p>  But the entertainment will be discussed in more detail later, but for now it‚Äôs worth a few words to say about nutrition.  Guests who decide to stay at the Aqua Hotel Resort &amp; Spa 4 * are served an √† la carte menu of international cuisine (three times a day - breakfast, lunch and dinner).  But also guests have the opportunity to try seafood treats or, for example, Italian dishes.  You just need to visit the company restaurant located on the hotel premises.  And it is also necessary to note with attention the fact that this resort hotel has a British sports bar. </p><h2>  Placement Details </h2><p>  The Aqua Hotel Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (Sharm) offers two types of rooms.  The first is standard (double with the possibility of placing a child), and the second is family (4-5 people). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, a standard double room for two will cost 37,000 rubles (and this is for two weeks of rest!).  It turns out only 1300 rubles per day per person.  If you book the same apartment, but with breakfast included in the price, you will need to pay 47,000 rubles already.  You can also include dinner, but then the cost will increase to 55,000 p.  And finally, if you book apartments on an all-inclusive basis, then you need to be prepared to give about 65,000 rubles. </p><p>  What are the conditions?  So, potential guests can choose a room with two single beds or with one, but large and wide.  The apartments have a balcony with a picturesque view of the pool, a telephone, a flat-screen TV with satellite channels, a safe (both ordinary and laptop), a work desk, ironing facilities, a seating area ... and this is only part of the conditions!  There is also a fan, the ability to include heating, carpet, an additional sofa, a bathroom with a shower and free toiletries, a hairdryer, towels, bed linen and even a minibar.  Also can not but rejoice the floor - it is either marble or tiled.  In general, everything in the rooms is very modern and comfortable - and this is important. </p>

    <h2>  Leisure and entertainment </h2><p>  Administration of <span>Aqua Hotel Resort</span> &amp; Spa 4 * (Sharm) guests are offered a variety of services.  For example, there is a barbecue, an outdoor swimming pool and two terraces - one ordinary and the other for sunbathing. </p><p>  And, of course, since the hotel administration takes care of its guests, they are offered various ways to have fun and distract.  If you are tired of going to the sea or visiting places with historical sights, you can play billiards or entertain yourself with table tennis.  After a tiring day, it‚Äôs a good idea to take a steam bath in the sauna or take care of yourself in the fitness room.  If you want to return home with a characteristic tan, then this is possible to do, not only lying down in the sun.  Hotel Aqua Hotel Resort &amp; Spa 4 * offers its guests to visit the solarium!  Or enjoy beauty treatments at the spa.  There is also a massage room, a hot tub and a Turkish bath. </p><h2>  Activities for active people </h2><p>  Tourists who are accustomed to constantly engage in something active (for example, any sport) will also find something to do here.  Aerobics, volleyball (both regular and beach), water polo and even futsal - all this can also be done.  So everyone will find entertainment to their taste. </p><p>  But this is not the whole list of entertainment offered.  Guests of the complex can go to karaoke or have fun in a night club - these establishments are also located on site.  Not surprisingly, one of the most suitable resorts for a real vacation is Egypt.  Hotel Aqua Hotel Resort &amp; Spa 4 * - a clear confirmation of the fact that in this country is really friendly and caring for tourists. </p>

    <h2>  General services </h2><p>  All of the above - this is by no means a complete list of services that this hotel can please its guests.  A bar with alcoholic drinks, snacks, breakfasts in the room, a restaurant with a special diet menu - all this is offered to the attention of guests.  Pleasant things like free Wi-Fi and private parking are also worth mentioning. </p><p>  At the request of guests, hotel workers can provide them with car rental, transfer to anywhere in the resort, to the airport and from there (though for an additional fee), or accelerated check-in (as well as departure - depending on the circumstances of the guest).  There is a point where you can exchange currency, buy tickets or book an excursion, receive or send a fax, make a photocopy of documents.  There is even a small souvenir shop where visitors usually buy small presents for memory and as a gift to their families.  Beauty salon, hairdresser, business center, laundry - all this is also available on the territory of the hotel Aqua Hotel Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (Egypt, Sharm). </p>

    <h2>  What can I use? </h2><p>  But this does not end with the list of services offered.  In general, everyone is well aware that in such resort states as Turkey, Egypt and, especially, Greece, excellent service.  And indeed it is.  What else can surprise the Aqua Hotel Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (Egypt, Sharm)?  For example, by delivering the press, safes and diverse shops located here on the territory, one won‚Äôt be able to amaze anyone.  But the temple is another matter.  Indeed, on the territory of the hotel Aqua Hotel Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (Sharm El Sheikh) there is a church.  This is surprising and, I must admit, many are happy. </p><p>  In addition to this marvelous and peculiar ‚Äúaddition‚Äù, there are others.  So, you can still request heating, an additional safe with ironing facilities or book an adjoining room.  The main thing is to stipulate and clarify everything in advance, because otherwise a misunderstanding could come out, and the guest will receive not what he wanted. </p>

    <h2>  Booking Details </h2><p>  So, all this, perhaps, is the main thing you should know about this hotel, deciding to stay in it upon arrival in Egypt.  Aqua Hotel Resort &amp; Spa 4 * is a good budget option for a vacation.  But what you need to know about booking? </p><p>  Check-in with departure is standard - you can check in after 14:30, and leave the room before noon.  If a person travels with children, he has the right to request an extra bed.  Moreover, if the child is under 12 years old, he is placed absolutely free - but only on those beds that are already in the apartment.  Interestingly, this rule is valid in many Turkish and Egyptian hotels. </p><p>  If the baby is younger than two years old, then specially for him they will put a crib in the room (only clarify the need for this when booking - so that everything is set in advance).  If the child is over 12 years old, or instead of 2 adults, three have arrived in a double room, then you will need to pay another 15 dollars from above (for each day).  Additionally, the apartment can accommodate a maximum of two beds.  And if we are talking about a children's "bed" - then one.  You can pay either with a Visa card or in cash.  But the majority decides to pay for the room right away - having booked it before the start of the vacation through any service. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  And what can people who have already visited the Aqua Hotel Resort &amp; Spa 4 * tell about the hotel?  Reviews from tourists are very diverse.  But with special attention I would like to note the comments regarding nutrition.  Since this topic is of concern to most.  The guests claim that the main restaurant ‚ÄúPanorama‚Äù can satisfy almost everyone.  Cozy, spacious (for 280 people!), Indoor, with a terrace, where polite waiters quickly serve visitors √† la carte menu, serving delicious, tasty and always fresh international cuisine. </p><p>  The A`la Carte institution called ‚ÄúGondola‚Äù (for 60 people) pleases with fish and Italian cuisine - this, according to the guests, will especially appeal to gourmets and lovers to enjoy delicious delicacies.  All four bars (Trevi lobby, main bar, beach bar and the one by the pool) serve wonderful drinks - as they say, taste and color.  In general, in terms of service, Aqua Hotel Resort &amp; Spa 4 * received positive reviews. </p>

    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  In general, if you take into account the description, cost and all the reviews of the guests, then we can conclude that this is a good option for a budget, but comfortable stay with good food and service.  Solid "four", in a word.  True, some people claim that they are not so lucky as the others.  However, even those who had problems on the spot (settled in an uncleaned or simply bad number, etc.), claim that they were able to immediately put all the dots on i and, thanks to the understanding staff, solve the situation.  Otherwise, everything is in order.  Of course, the hotel is not suitable for sophisticated gourmets who are accustomed to relaxing in luxurious penthouses, but with positive impressions they will definitely be able to return to their homeland. </p>
