    <p>  Sometimes the guys are not happy that in multi-bed rooms there is only one outlet.  The institution was built in Soviet times.  There were no mobile phones then, it was believed that sockets were not needed.  Today, the inability to charge a mobile phone can be a problem.  At the same time, as visitors write, there were no interruptions in cold and hot water. </p><h2>  Are cooks good or bad? </h2><p>  Children camp "Sunrise" (Anapa), reviews of which note the friendly attitude of the staff, guests characterize on the positive side.  But the guys do not always like food.  Many complain that they have to eat fast food from the store, because the dishes in the dining room are not always well prepared.  However, this is a matter of individual addiction.  For many young guests, the food did not leave unpleasant memories. </p>

    <p>  The camp has a very strict discipline.  For <span>smoking, teenagers</span> are expelled from the squad.  Older guys write that the sea is shallow, waist-high.  But for kids it fits perfectly.  Some children who love a relaxed lifestyle are not happy with the abundance of daily activities.  But these are isolated opinions, there are few such reviews. </p>
