    <p>  One way or another, Mallorca is a welcoming island with its own traditions and rules.  Not only representatives of royal families, famous politicians, athletes and actors come here.  In this city you can easily meet an ordinary tourist from Russia or Ukraine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Mallorca there are not only excursion programs devoted to architecture.  What is most impressive here is nature.  On rocky cliffs there are protected coniferous forests, mountain peaks attract climbers.  On the azure shores and beaches are all the entertainment of civilization, which allows you to return a person to the modern world after crazy and mysterious walks around the island.  To relax here, you need to stay at the Marbel 3 * hotel (Mallorca). </p><h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  To find this place of residence, you need to go to the small resort town of Can Pastilla.  It is located in the southeast of Mallorca.  By the way, the name of this resort appeared on behalf of one of the residents who had the most popular bar here.  His name was Pastilla, and thanks to his establishment in the 50s, many tourists rested here. </p><p>  Hotel Marbel 3 * itself <span>(Mallorca) received</span> positive <span>reviews</span> due to its location.  It can be found right in the center of Can Pastilla.  200 meters to the side is the village of Playa de Palma, as well as the popular beach of Cala Estancia. </p><p>  To get to the hotel, you need <span>to buy tickets</span> and head to the airport of Palma de Mallorca.  From there it will be necessary to overcome 3 kilometers.  You can use private transport or find a taxi. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, Hotel Marbel 3 * (Mallorca) is located in the resort town of Can Pastilla.  It is located on the second coastline, you will have to walk 200 meters to the beach.  There are many interesting sights around the hotel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The building has five floors.  Inside there are 61 rooms.  Nearby there is an entrance to a cafe and a bar, so if you don‚Äôt like what you will be fed at the hotel, you can easily find an alternative to breakfast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marbel 3 majorca reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1528102.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Since the building itself is located in the center, it does not have a huge private territory.  The pool is located on the top floor.  Otherwise, there is no need to look for any entertainment in the place.  All discos and restaurants are located outside the hotel. </p><h2>  Rules of residence </h2><p>  In Marbel 3 * (Mallorca), the rules of accommodation are simple.  If you arrived before 14:00, you will have to wait to be settled.  If your number has been free for several days, you will be settled immediately.  Otherwise, you can leave things and walk around the resort town.  Departure is carried out until 10 in the morning. </p><p>  Children are welcome here.  Moreover, if the baby is not yet 2 years old, he can live for free.  But if for this you need an extra bed, you have to pay extra for it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel marbel 3 majorca reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1528108.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If the child is under 12 years old, then the cost of his stay with an extra bed will be 40% of the price per day in the room.  The maximum number of extra beds is one.  If you need a crib, then you need to warn the hotel in advance or find out about this possibility.  Also, of course, you need to understand that if you need an additional service, you will have to pay for it. </p><p>  Booking rules change every time, so you need to call and clarify.  Usually, if you withdraw your reservation in a week, then the full amount will be returned to you.  You can also pay for your accommodation either immediately after arrival, or at the time of departure from the Marbel 3 * hotel (Mallorca).  Reviews regarding this are rare, which means that there are no problems. </p><h2>  Children </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the hotel can accommodate a child.  Moreover, if he has not yet turned 2 years old, free accommodation is possible.  The availability of cots is worth knowing in advance.  But in truth, the hotel is not very convenient for families with children.  Firstly, this is due to the fact that due to the fact that there is no territory, there is also no pool and children's entertainment. </p><p>  Secondly, even 200 meters to the beach, but for small children it is a lot.  In this case, it is better to choose accommodation in hotels that have at their disposal a beach.  Thirdly, problems may arise with accommodation.  The fact is that the hotel is not famous for its huge selection of room types.  Therefore, a room for three can be busy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel marbel 3 majorca" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1528107.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Otherwise, there are no additional services and activities for children.  There is no stroller rental.  Also, according to the rules of the hotel, there is no animator, so you can‚Äôt spend the evening together, as there will be no one to leave the child with.  According to statistics, Marbel 3 * <span>(Mallorca, Spain)</span> is most suitable for honeymooners and older couples.  And also for those who came here on business. </p><h2>  Animals </h2><p>  Among tourists there are many who cannot imagine their travels without pets.  Four-legged have long become for us a part of family and life.  Therefore, the question of living a pet in a hotel is always very acute.  There are hotels that not only allow shaggy people to run around the territory, they also prepare breakfasts, take care of and entertain them. </p><p>  Marbel 3 * (Mallorca) is an exception.  The fact is that pets are not allowed here.  And you will not be able to solve this issue even for money.  Therefore, those who are loved by the road will have to look for another hotel. </p><h2>  Number base </h2><p>  The hotel is quite compact.  Despite the fact that there is a 61 (!) Number inside, from the street it looks like a small residential building.  The maximum number of people in a room is 3.  Moreover, two-room apartments are not found here.  The hotel has a single room, double and double +1. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marbel 3 majorca can pastilla" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1528105.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The hotel rooms are quite comfortable.  Some have a compact balcony that opens onto huge glass doors.  Depending on the cost, air conditioning, a TV and a telephone will be available to you.  There is also a separate bathroom with a shower.  Each room is standardly equipped with a desk, chair, nightstands, as well as a mirror.  The rooms are cleaned daily, the price is included in the price of the room. </p><h2>  Sea beach </h2><p>  Cala Estancia Beach is the closest swimming option.  It is in common use.  Hotel Marbel 3 * (Mallorca, Can Pastilla) has nothing to do with it.  There you can find all the standard entertainment such as inflatable accessories.  Also for money you can ride on a <span>water scooter</span> and other attractions. </p><p>  Not all tourists like this city beach, so many people choose to play the village of Playa de Palma.  It is much more comfortable and cozy to relax with the whole family.  In addition, the shore is cleaner there. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel tries to take maximum care of visitors.  Of course, for many it will turn out to be too small and underdeveloped.  On the one hand, it is.  Inside there are no special entertainments for children.  The pool is located on the roof of the building.  If you arrived by your car, then there is no place to leave it here, since there is no parking. </p><p>  Of the common services, free daily housekeeping is available.  You can also contact the reception, which is open around the clock.  It is possible to visit the tour desk.  After all, it is known that the island itself is a rather interesting tourist attraction, and the room is too boring.  Therefore, ordering a tour for two will be the best solution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marbel 3 majorca spain" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1528106.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For those who come here on business, even a small conference room is available.  Nearby you can dine at the banquet.  It is very convenient that the staff can speak five languages.  Of course, they have not learned Russian yet, but in English you can easily communicate with them.  You can also try to speak their native Spanish, as well as German, French and Italian. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  Hotel Marbel 3 * (Mallorca) annually hosts hundreds of tourists.  Someone is satisfied, someone does not like something.  Mostly those who came here more often praise the hotel.  The main advantage to this day is the location.  Despite the fact that this is the center of the resort, still silence is ensured here.  After all, most often all the noisy entertainment is located on the seashore. </p><p>  But there were complaints.  The fact is that the proximity to the airport is palpable.  Despite the fact that you can get to the hotel by bus, travel only three stops, the noise of the aircraft is still noticeable.  Especially for those who previously lived in a quiet area.  If suddenly you are brought to a neighboring area, there you can already meet in the evening and noisy drunken companies. </p><p>  Satisfied with the tourists that is in the room.  In addition to heating, there is air conditioning for hot days.  There is also satellite TV for those who are already too lazy to travel around the island.  There is also a hairdryer, you can leave your own at home, an excellent comfortable table, a spacious wardrobe and comfortable beds.  The only thing visitors complained about was the pillows.  They say they are uncomfortable, although an individual matter.  The question with the TV remained incomprehensible.  It seems to be there, but the remote from it is given on bail 10 euros. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel marbel 3 majorca" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1528104.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Despite its size, many also liked the pool.  Its accommodation on the roof of the hotel tourists like.  There are umbrellas, sunbeds, a shower and a bathroom.  For residents, everything, of course, is free.  As mentioned earlier, the hotel has five floors, so those who got a room at the top will be comfortable going down and up using the elevator, which they never let down during the season. </p><p>  Things are somewhat controversial with breakfast at Marbel 3 * <span>(Mallorca) Mallorca.</span>  The hotel provides half board.  In this case, the tourist eats in the morning and evening.  The breakfast is varied, here you can find scrambled eggs, and fried bacon with sausages and sausage.  There is not enough milk, although there are cereals to choose from.  Also, tourists would like more fruits and vegetables. </p><p>  If you want three meals a day, at the reception you can ask for a ticket to a neighboring hotel, where <span>full board.</span>  In addition, despite the fact that there are paid drinks for dinner there, it is still somewhat cheaper. </p><p>  There are those who were unhappy with the cleaning.  Moreover, this is due to rooms that have access to the balcony.  The table and chairs are rarely cleaned there, so you have to demand it yourself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="marbel 3 majorca mallorca" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1528103.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, the Marbel 3 * hotel (Mallorca) remains a cozy and peaceful place.  Of course, children will be very bored here.  But for young or old couples the hotel is what you need.  There are a couple of cafes around, also a popular supermarket.  The beach is close, and there you can find more noisy and extreme entertainment. </p>
