  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RC "Rumyantsevo-Park": location, description, developer</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Moscow is a huge metropolis.  But even he is not able to accommodate everyone who wants to live in it, who come here to work and have a permanent place of residence from all over Russia.  In 2012, the territory of the capital was officially expanded due to the accession of the Moscow region to its western part.  <span>New Moscow</span> entered the city of Moscow and the village of Rumyantsevo, where the construction of the Rumyantsevo-Park residential complex is currently underway. </p><h2>  Location of the residential complex </h2><p>  A little more than two kilometers separate the <span>residential complex</span> under construction from the Moscow Ring Road.  In a few minutes by personal transport on the Kiev highway you can reach the village of Rumyantsevo, where the construction of the residential complex “Rumyantsevo-Park” has been launched on Rodnikova Street. </p><p>  And those future residents who are accustomed to getting home by public transport will be able to use the Rumyantsevo and Salaryevo metro stations located a little more than a kilometer from the complex.  Such an arrangement makes the residential complex very promising for living, combining the possibility of living in the fresh air, convenient transport accessibility and urban living conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroykin.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Project LCD Rumyantsevo Park" class="if uuid-2424367" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2424367.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  After the construction is completed, the Rumyantsevo-Park residential complex will consist of three multi-section residential buildings with a total area of ​​386 thousand square meters.  In each house, the project provides for up to 21 sections.  The floors of the houses will also be different: from 13 to 22 floors.  In the residential complex for sale will be exposed 4246 apartments, which will be able to move in about five and a half thousand inhabitants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroykin.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="layout of the residential complex" class="if uuid-2428825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/2428825.jpg"></div><p>  Since the construction of buildings is carried out in several stages, the first of them is being prepared for delivery in the second quarter of 2020.  There is a lot of time before the completion of construction, and apartment sales have not yet begun.  On the official website of the developer there is no information about the planned completion date for the construction of the entire facility.  They will be provided later. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Due to such a good location of the land allocated for the development of the residential complex “Rumyantsevo-Park”, its residents will not experience inconvenience due to the lack of necessary infrastructure.  So, within walking distance from the complex is the district of the capital Solntsevo, where there are schools, kindergartens, hospitals, clinics and other social infrastructure facilities.  In the village of Rumyantsevo itself, shopping centers, shops, and cafes are abundantly represented. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pronovostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Rumyantsevo Park upon completion" class="if uuid-2424370" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2424370.jpg"></div><p>  As for the internal infrastructure of the complex, an underground parking for 1748 cars will be built for residents owning personal vehicles.  In addition, 597 guests or residents of the complex will be able to park their cars on the ground parking. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For children will build children's playgrounds and sports grounds.  Adults will be able to walk and relax in specially designated and equipped areas for this.  The first floors of residential buildings are reserved for non-residential premises and the subsequent placement of infrastructure facilities in them. </p><p>  The developer of the residential complex “Rumyantsevo-Park” also provided for a barrier-free environment for people with disabilities in his project.  They will be able to freely enter the entrance groups located at ground level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroykin.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Construction progress of the residential complex Rumyantsevo Park" class="if uuid-2424369" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2424369.jpg"></div><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The developer of the residential complex “Rumyantsevo-Park” is “Lexion Development”.  This is an organization that not only develops construction projects, but also implements them, subsequently managing ready-made facilities.  Engaged in the implementation of large-scale projects in the capital and its region, the company sets itself goals - timeliness and quality of work.  The efforts of the highly qualified specialists working in the company are aimed at fulfilling these tasks. </p><p>  For the period 2011-2016  the organization built the Nekrasovka-Park microdistrict with 25 residential buildings located in the southeast of Moscow.  And in 2017, a new project was launched - RC “Rumyantsevo-Park”, the layout of which will be presented by a non-standard architectural solution.  This makes the project a business class complex. </p><p>  The described residential complex is ideal for those who are tired of the hustle and bustle of the city, who want to live in the fresh air and at the same time not experience any inconvenience, being torn off from the big world.  Well-developed infrastructure, excellent transport accessibility, good location - all this makes the project promising for future residents of the complex. </p>
