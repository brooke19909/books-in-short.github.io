    <h2>  Acquaintance </h2><p>  In fact, the famous Lyubertsy quarries are a complex of sand quarries of the Lyubertsy <span>GOK (Mining and Processing Plant)</span> - Maly, Bolshoi Dzerzhinsky and Lesnoy.  They are located near the town of Dzerzhinsky (Moscow region), on the outskirts of the Tomilinsky forest park.  Today, the Lyubertsy quarries are flooded with water (groundwater). </p><p>  Two large picturesque ponds are interconnected - a neighbor, a worker, with a dredger, which is also called the Dzerzhinsky quarry, and a distant one, known as the Bolshoi, or Forest Quarry (previously it was called the Bolshoi Kotelnichesky, as well as Lyubertsy).  The ponds are separated by a narrow soil embankment 10 meters wide, on which dump trucks pass over the sand. </p><p>  Behind the Forest Quarry, about six hundred meters away, there is another pond called the Small.  According to numerous reviews, Lyubertsy careers are beautiful and amazing places that are pleasing to the eye. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Landscapes, relief, vegetation of the Lyubertsy quarries are unusually beautiful, many reviewers share.  Everyone who falls into these places admires their exotic picturesqueness.  Forest pond is very deep, ten years ago there were many crayfish.  Today it is the most popular of all reservoirs in Dzerzhinsky.  Lyubertsy careers, in particular Lesnoy (the second name is Bolshoi), are favorite places for diving. </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Ponds were formed artificially.  Once in these places sand was mined for industrial needs.  After the workers dug up groundwater, the quarry was flooded with water. </p><p>  In the middle of the Forest (Big) quarry is a rocky island.  More recently, it was a peninsula, from which a ridge stretched to the shore, which went under water in 2012 due to a rise in the level of the reservoir.  Nearby was a small island.  Active extraction of sand using a dredger in the early 2010s led to a sharp increase in water levels at the Forest Quarry.  Part of the stone island with the isthmus connecting it to the shore, as well as a small island went under water.  When the dredger was removed, the water level in the quarry rose, as a result, part of the coastline was flooded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Career today </h2><p>  Today, the middle part of the peninsula is occupied by a large stone plateau, composed of layers of sandstone, which did not have time to destroy during development.  The second part is fine-grained light sand, randomly littered with scattered blocks and slabs of very strong and dense sandstone.  Springs continue to beat from under the ground, and there is more and more water in the quarry.  The length of the Dzerzhinsky ponds is up to 1 km.  There is enough space here not only to swim and sunbathe, but also to ride a jet ski. </p><h2>  Water </h2><p>  The authors of the reviews share that the water in the Lyubertsy ponds is always colder than in other reservoirs near Moscow.  The reason for this is their great depth and beating springs, because of which the water warms up slowly.  But this does not stop vacationers: in the swimming season it is very crowded. </p><h2>  Lyubertsy quarry: beach </h2><p>  In Moscow and the Moscow Region there are not so many places where you can swim in clear water and lie on a warm sand.  One of the favorite beaches for many locals is the Lyubertsy quarry.  Those who decide to come to Dzerzhinsky Ponds on a warm summer day are pleasantly surprised by the extraordinary beauty of the local landscapes.  The beach with fine white sand, turquoise water, which does not let bathers out of its arms for a long time, reminds many of the South Russian or Bulgarian resorts. </p>

    <p>  The beach with numerous water and near-water entertainments occupies the part of the Big Quarry closest to the city.  After the mining of sand stopped here, zones for summer relaxation and swimming were created in it.  From the tower of the ski lift you can admire great views.  Bypassing the quarry on the right side, you can find several more relatively civilized beaches. </p><p>  In good weather, a variety of people sunbathe on the beach of the Lyubertsy career.  In particular, these places attract the most exotic part of vacationers - traveling nudists.  Mostly family naturists come here, sometimes with children, but, as some users report in their reviews, here you can also stumble on vacationers alone gays and exhibitionists.  Be that as it may, the main rule for everyone on the beach is not to create discomfort for others and to clean up the trash. </p>

    <h2>  Sad nuance </h2><p>  I must say that not everything here is so good.  The authors of the reviews note that in the swimming season, visitors, unfortunately, literally fall asleep with garbage in Dzerzhinsky.  Lyubertsy careers - alas!  - like no other place of leisure, revealing the flagrant lack of culture and bad manners of some vacationers.  Nearly every bush you can see the traces of unhappy tourists: heaps of food debris, plastic, paper, bottles.  Network users urge guests to preserve the unique nature of these places, be sure to clean up after themselves.  It is best to visit here in the spring or fall, when there are not so many visitors in these places, the authors of the reviews share. </p><h2>  Lyubertsy quarry: how to get there? </h2><p>  Motorists should know that driving here is not a good idea: it‚Äôs very difficult to park near a quarry, and driving inside is not allowed. </p>
