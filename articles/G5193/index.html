    <h2>  Haier Company </h2><p>  The legal entity appeared in 1984 in China.  Among the products you can find different types of equipment: televisions, refrigerators, computers, and washing machines.  "Hyer" in fact was formed in the early 20s of the XX century.  And at that time, only the assembly of refrigerators was carried out.  Already closer to 1984, it became known that the company was starting a bankruptcy process.  It was then that the idea came to give it to the Chinese leader.  And then she got her current name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main goal of this company is to create high-quality and reliable equipment at an affordable price.  Over time, Hyer washing machines began to be assembled not only on the main conveyor in China.  Factories were opened in the Philippines, Jordan, the USA, Malaysia, etc. The Russian branch is located in the city of Naberezhnye Chelny. </p><h2>  Advantages of washing machines </h2><p>  Using characteristics from the manufacturer and customer reviews, we describe the advantages of the technology of this company. </p><p>  Many consumers talk about the economical operation of washing machines.  They consume not only electricity but also water. </p><p>  The washing quality is top notch.  Modes for children's things and down jackets have proven themselves best. </p><p>  Hyer washing machines are small in size.  Narrow appliances with great storage - what could be better? </p><p>  Noise is practically absent.  Of course, there is vibration, but it is at a minimum level.  This was achieved by directly connecting the motor to the drum. </p><p>  The engine warranty is 12 years. </p><p>  Driving a car is easy enough.  There are many interesting and useful features.  A quick wash lasts only 15 minutes! </p><p>  The software includes an option that itself determines how much powder and water is needed to carry out this cycle. </p><p>  The price is quite adequate.  Depending on the configuration and place of purchase, it varies from 25 thousand to 70 thousand rubles.  Many people like the ratio of quality and price. </p><p>  The warranty period for the car is 3 years. </p>

    <h2>  Disadvantages of a washing machine </h2><p>  Has several disadvantages of the Hyer washing machine.  The manufacturer tried to get rid of them, but still they are.  You can find out about them by reading customer reviews.  What do they write? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sometimes cars break down before the expiration of the warranty period, even with proper care. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the participation of a person in washing with these machines is reduced to an absolute minimum: there is no possibility to choose the spin power or a separate rinse mode.  The latter is simply not provided. </p><p>  After rinsing, a small amount of powder may remain.  Therefore, it is necessary to carry out the cycle again. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the spin power cannot be changed, things can deteriorate at a high torsion speed of the drum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine hayer errors" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1306579.jpg" width="480"></div>
