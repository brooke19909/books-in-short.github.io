But its territory continued to expand, and a little later began the construction of a new camp complex "Rainbow", consisting of six cottages.  After that, the medical building and the pavilion were also redone, where the guys can play a variety of games.  Last winter, a complete reconstruction of this place and all its structures was completed. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The Zubrenok National Children's Health Center is located in a beautiful pine forest on the shores of a magical lake called Naroch, which is the largest in all of Belarus and has crystal clear water.
