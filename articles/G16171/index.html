Music instead of beeps (Beeline): how to connect?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today we will meet you with a very interesting opportunity that Beeline offers its customers.  The beep on the phone can be converted using this service.  Instead of the usual monotonous sound, you will hear a song or any other melody.  This is a very interesting and useful addition from the mobile operator.  But the service “Beep” (“Beeline”) is something that should be connected automatically.  And it is for this reason that we will now figure out how to start using this feature, and also learn a little about refusing the service.  Let us begin as soon as possible with you to study our today's question. </p>

    <h2>  We connect the service: a personal visit to the office </h2><p>  The ringtone (“Beeline”) can be set in several very simple and at the same time fast ways.  For example, at a personal visit of a client to the nearest office of a mobile operator.  As a rule, in this place you can get answers to all questions. </p><p>  It is enough to appear with your mobile phone and decide on your desires.  Indeed, music instead of beeps (“Beeline”) is diverse, and the choice is not so simple.  You can find a list of possible options with the help of an operator in a communication office.  After you stop at something specific, tell your employee the choice and give him your cell phone.  He will do a few simple manipulations - and you have a ring tone set (“Beeline”).  That's all. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now, when someone calls you, he will hear your chosen track.  As a rule, the most often choice falls on classical music, as well as on “hot hits” from modern songs.  That's all the problems are solved.  But let's move on. </p>

    <h2>  Help Sites </h2><p>  The second scenario, which is likely when you activate the Beeline Buzzer service, is nothing more than the use of special directory sites.  They, as a rule, publish a wide variety of melodies, as well as prices for their use.  For each telephone operator they are different. </p><p>  This method, to be honest, can be called universal.  After all, it is suitable for any mobile operator.  Music instead of beeps (Beeline, MTS and other operators) is set after sending a special SMS message.  Thanks to this action, you can pay for the service.  Very fast, simple and reliable. </p><p>  Only here, many users try not to use this scenario.  This is all for fear of being deceived.  Indeed, quite often on the World Wide Web “left” hosting services are created, which only charge the customers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Officially </h2><p>  Well, we are moving forward with you.  Now it’s worth to find out how Beeline connects to most customers. After all, the main thing in this matter is reliability and the correct implementation of the algorithm of actions. In order to prevent users from being scared of third-party hosting, it was decided to add automatic connection to the capabilities of the Beeline official website “ Buzzer. "How is this done? Let's try to figure it out. </p><p>  First you have to visit the official site and log in to it.  After that, you can see the sections in your account.  And you can find the line "Hello!"  and click on it.  Here it will be possible to set a melody instead of beeps (“Beeline”).  It will be enough to carefully look at the list of music offered to you, and then click on “Connect”. </p><p>  A window will open where you will have to type your data (name, number), and then confirm the changes.  After that, you can try calling yourself.  You will notice how instead of the usual beep you will have the track you selected earlier. </p><h2>  Gift </h2><p>  In addition, the Beeline beep can be obtained in another very interesting way.  Which one?  As a present.  For this, of course, another Beeline subscriber should give you this present. </p>

    <p>  This is actually a very interesting approach.  True, such a call will be set only for a month.  Further, the comrade will have to either refuse to provide you with the repeated service “Music instead of beeps” (“Beeline”), or pay you the next month of use.  Quite an interesting and very original way to get additional features. </p><p>  In order to present a similar surprise to a friend, simply visit the Beeline official website, go to the “Hello!” Section, and then select the melody you like.  Then click on “Present”.  You will see an authorization window.  Go through it, and then fill in all the necessary fields in the window for selecting a friend to present a gift.  As a rule, it is enough to indicate the phone number of the subscriber.  Important: your friend should also have a "SIM" from "Beeline."  As you can see, nothing is difficult or supernatural.  Only now there is another rather interesting approach to solving the task set before us today.  The Beeline beep can be connected in one more way. </p><h2>  SMS messages </h2><p>  For example, you can try to find on the pages of magazines and newspapers a section of music and applications for phones.  The same catalog can be easily found on the Internet or on the official website of your mobile operator.  Now just pick up your music for the call, and then send SMS to the short number.  Inside the message, you should write a special command.  It will be shown opposite the selected track. </p>

    <p>  If you use the official site, then send a message with the melody code to number 0770. Make sure that you have enough funds on your balance to complete the operation.  Only in this case can we expect a result.  You will receive a message from the operator about the successful connection of the service.  But there is another question that we have not yet addressed.  He excites those who are no longer particularly eager to use the Beep.  What are you talking about?  Let's try to figure out how to disable the Beep on Beeline.  There are, of course, several ways to do this. </p><h2>  Official site </h2><p>  For example, a rather interesting, fast and reliable approach would be to access the official website of the company.  Here, each client in his personal account will be able not only to track the latest activity of his number, but also to monitor the connected services.  If you want to give up something, then no problems will also arise. </p><p>  In order to understand how to disable “Beep” on “Beeline”, just log in to your personal account, and then look at the list of services connected to the number.  If you click on the “Beep”, then you will immediately see a list of possible actions.  Select "disable" there and confirm the changes.  That's all the problems are solved.  As you can see, nothing is difficult. </p><h2>  How else? </h2><p>  Another rather effective approach is to call the Beeline hotline number and refuse the service.  Dial 0770 and wait for an answer.  There are two options for the development of events: you either talk with a voice-robot, which will inform you about all the necessary functions, or you get “on line” to a real operator.  And already with it you have to conduct a dialogue. </p>

    <p>  In addition, to turn off the Beep, it is enough to resend SMS with the melody code to number 0770 and then wait for an answer.  As soon as you receive a notification about the processing of the operation, you can rejoice at your achievements.  That's all the problems are solved.  Now you know what a Beeline beep is and how to use this service. </p>
