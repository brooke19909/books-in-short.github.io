This is a <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof military glory,</span> which is located in the south of the middle zone of the European part of our country, in the Central Black Earth Economic District.  Given the fact that 40 km from it passes the border of our country with Ukraine, Belgorod is of strategic importance.  The rich centuries-old history of the metropolis, which began with the construction of a defensive fortress, makes it attractive for cultural and educational tourism.  Industry is well developed here, since the beginning of the 20th century the city is marked on the map as a large railway junction. </p><p>  The hotel base is represented by both inexpensive hostels and two-star hotels, as well as respectable hotels.  The latter option is often chosen by business tourists who come to Belgorod for business purposes, as well as families who prefer to relax in the most comfortable conditions.  "Art <span>Hotel" in Belgorod</span> is known not only within the region, many visitors from Moscow, Yaroslavl, Novgorod and other cities of our country stayed in it.  Why is the hotel recommended as one of the best in Belgorod?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><h2>  "City on White Mountain" </h2><p>  Local historians argue about the date of its foundation.  According to some reports, the Belgorod fortress was laid in the middle of the XVI century, but on the basis of other historical and documentary data, the municipal authorities celebrated the 1000th anniversary of the city back in 1995.  Belgorod in different centuries belonged to the territory of Ukraine and even was its temporary capital during the formation of Soviet power.  Since 1922, it is part of the USSR, and then the Russian Federation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During the Great Patriotic War (1941-1945), the city was twice occupied by the Nazis, bloody battles were fought in its vicinity.  Belgorod and its population have suffered greatly over the years.  The destruction was almost total, the historical part of the city disappeared from the face of the earth.  After heroic efforts, people after the war carried out restoration work. </p>
