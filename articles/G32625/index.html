Perhaps someone does not know, but until 1990, Kamchatka was a closed territory for most Russians.  An amazing area with protected corners and a special atmosphere attracts tourists from all over the world to enjoy wonderful places, as if specially created for travel. </p><h2>  The Fiery Peninsula </h2><p>  What are the main attractions of Kamchatka?  The first association, of course, will be associated with volcanoes, of which there are about three hundred, and twenty-nine of them are active.  Sometimes the region is called the "fiery" peninsula, and for good reason - some objects are erupted to this day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Kamchatka" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1189711.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the territory formed by the active activity of volcanoes, excursions are organized, and in order to get close to the most interesting places, special equipment is used.  The peninsula is divided into several zones for the convenience of travelers, each of which has the unique sights of Kamchatka, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Caldera of Uzon volcano </h2><p>  A huge hollow located in the Kronotsky Reserve formed more than forty thousand years ago at the site of the eruption of a volcano, later destroyed by powerful explosions.  In the caldera, a colossal area of ‚Äã‚Äã150 square meters, there are thousands of powerful thermal springs of a wide variety of shapes and sizes. </p><p>  Scientists who studied the water in the volcano basin discovered a high content of mercury, arsenic and copper, and amazing archaean microorganisms live in such an unsuitable liquid.  They feel great in boiling water, and sulfur replaces them with oxygen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="all sights of Kamchatka" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1189697.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Uzon is a true phenomenon for all researchers.  It is here that in natural conditions modern minerals arise that are not found anywhere else.  Scientists consider this place the center of all that <span>Kamchatka</span> is famous for <span>: hot springs,</span> mud mini-volcanoes, full of berries of the tundra and ... geysers.  The latter are the natural attractions of Kamchatka, which you can see from all over the world. </p><h2>  Valley of Geysers </h2><p>  In the same Kronotsky Reserve, there is the Valley of Geysers, known to many, in which an environmental disaster occurred nine years ago.  A powerful <span>mudflow,</span> destroying everything living on its way, destroyed geothermal springs and basalt rocks, which were restored over time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This unique place, one of the largest geyser fields in the world, is considered an anomalous territory due to the unstable microclimate and natural conditions.  Only those companies with which a contract is concluded at the reserve are brought to the protected area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamchatka sights in winter" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1189707.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <p>  Each visitor gets acquainted with the norms and rules of conduct in the Valley of Geysers so as not to harm the ecosystem of the peninsula.  Unfortunately, not everyone can take Kamchatka.  Sights for tourists who want to come here on their own have been closed since 1967, since "wild" tourism is prohibited here.  No more than three thousand people visit the conservation area per year, which is very small, but the question of increasing the quota remains unresolved. </p><h2>  Harsh land </h2><p>  Everyone who goes to the peninsula in winter needs to familiarize themselves with the climate and weather conditions in advance, because the upcoming route will depend on this.  January is the coldest month in Kamchatka, and due to raging snowstorms, many roads leading to the sights of the region are covered with snow, so sightseeing tours reduce their program or change direction. </p><p>  Most inaccessible places can only be reached by helicopter or snowmobile, which increases the cost of excursions, and extremely low temperatures threaten long walking trips. </p><h2>  Kamchatka Attractions in Winter </h2><p>  In winter, dog sledding tours are organized, which are unusually interesting not only for foreigners. </p><p>  Descent from steep mountain slopes is an extreme pleasure that increases the level of adrenaline in the blood.  In Kamchatka, there are many snowy tracks, divided by levels, and it is important to evaluate yourself correctly so that downhill does not end in tragedy. </p><p>  The harsh region will surprise with bathing in thermal springs, but what could be more pleasant than plunging into hot water, good for health, in a piercing icy wind?  Only in winter can you feel the bright contrast between snowdrifts and warm geysers. </p><h2>  Vilyuchinsky waterfall </h2><p>  Picturesque waterfalls are Kamchatka's favorite tourist attractions related to natural monuments.  Many of them impress with an incredible beauty not only in summer but also in winter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamchatka tourist attractions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1189710.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  Vilyuchinsky waterfall, completely freezing in cold times, is loved by tourists from all over the world.  This is a favorite place for lovers of unusual photographs.  A frozen huge icicle of snow-white in the sun shimmers with blue shades.  Those who were there in the winter note that such an amazing sight is worth it to hit the road even in severe frosts. </p><p>  It is impossible to describe all the sights of Kamchatka in a short article.  The land of truly unearthly beauty will forever remain in the memory of those who are fortunate enough to be here.  On the peninsula, you admire the grandeur of Mother Nature, which created unique picturesque corners giving surprises at any time of the year. </p>
