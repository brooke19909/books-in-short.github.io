    <p>  Children's stores are full of a wide variety of clothes for kids.  Here you can also find dancing ball gowns for girls.  But the prices for such outfits are quite high.  In addition, children grow very fast.  Not everyone can afford to buy an outfit that will be worn only once.  You can save money perfectly by sewing a ball gown yourself.  If you show your imagination, the outfit will come out really original. </p><h2>  Choose a model </h2><p>  Depending on the event for which the ball gown will be made, it can be fluffy, fitted, with a high waistline or short.  Girls under three years old look very beautiful in lush dresses on the floor.  But the older princess can pick up a short dress.  Models with an asymmetrical bottom line look original: the back of the skirt can reach the floor, and in the front it can only reach the knees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In order to build a basic pattern of any children's product, it is not necessary to have special skills.  A children's item from the wardrobe will come to the rescue.  Clothing for children is characterized by the absence of tucks.  Therefore, you can get a finished pattern by circling the parts of the product already at your disposal.  It is very important to pay attention to the material from which the base is made.  If you need a pattern of a ball gown from knitwear, then a product from this material should also be taken as the basis.  It is worth noting that sewing knitted fabrics is much easier.  The material does not crumble and behaves well during operation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When making a pattern, one should not forget about allowances for seams.  Depending on the selected material, it is necessary to add 1-2 cm to the finished pattern. </p><h2>  Create a fluffy skirt </h2><p>  The main parameters when creating a pattern for the lower part of the ball gown is the waist circumference of the child and the length of the product.  A fluffy skirt can be created in several ways.  It can be a trapeze skirt or a flared sun.  The latter option will require a large consumption of fabric.  But the trapezoid is economical and looks great.  <span>The skirt-a-line pattern</span> is a triangle with a cropped top.  The upper part of the pattern in width is equal to the semi-circumference of the waist.  The bottom of the skirt can have any width.  It all depends on which mom decided to sew a ball gown for the girl. </p>

    <p>  The <span>sun-flared skirt pattern</span> is a semicircle with a cut out central part.  The center of the pattern is the place to connect the skirt to the top of the product.  To make a flared skirt, you need a lot of material.  To sew a ball gown for a girl with your own hands, you will need to multiply the length of the entire product by two.  This will be the total footage of fabric for the product. </p><h2>  Full skirt from a rectangle </h2><p>  Many mothers are in no hurry to sew an outfit on their own.  The first thing that stops them is the fact that the pattern of the ball gown for the girl seems so complicated that it will not work out without special skills.  For starters, you can try a simplified scheme.  For example, a fluffy skirt for a dress can be obtained from a simple rectangle of fabric. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  It is necessary to select medium hardness material in advance.  Too soft will not work, as it will not be possible to achieve the expected splendor.  In order to calculate the <span>consumption of fabric, you</span> should determine the length of the future skirt.  For a product 1 meter long, 1.1 m of fabric will be required.  10 cm is taken for allowances.  Most of the fabric that is offered in specialized stores has a standard width of 1.5 m. This is enough to create a fluffy skirt. </p><p>  The item is sewn very simply.  A piece of fabric connects on the sewing machine along the edges.  Next, the upper part of the workpiece is assembled.  Thus, a fluffy skirt is obtained, which can already be attached to the upper part of the dress.  A t-shirt or a blouse purchased at a store can serve as a top. </p><h2>  Tutu skirt </h2><p>  It is even easier to make a ball gown for a girl with her own hands using tulle.  This material is completely unpretentious.  He practically does not crease and does not crumble.  The choice of tulle in stores is quite diverse.  First of all, it is necessary to pay attention to rigidity.  According to this indicator, the tissue is divided into three groups.  Hard tulle is most often used to make jewelry.  But soft material will not give the desired splendor.  Therefore, it is worth choosing a tulle with medium hardness. </p>

    <p>  Tutu skirts can be made even without a sewing machine.  All you need is a pair of scissors, an elastic band and a little imagination.  Initially, the pattern of a ball gown for a girl should be studied.  From here you need to take such parameters as the length of the finished skirt and its width at the waist.  A blank for the skirt will be an elastic band that will comfortably sit on the child‚Äôs waist.  It should be borne in mind that after joining the tulle, the gum will become more dense. </p><p>  For the preparation of tulle, scissors and patience are needed.  It is necessary to cut strips of material with a width of 20 cm and a length equal to the length of the finished skirt, multiplied by two.  The more such blanks will be, the more magnificent the dress will turn out.  Strips of tulle should be at least 40. After the preparation of all parts, monotonous work follows.  Fatin neatly tied with an elastic band.  Skirts from tulle always look original.  And if you use multi-colored material in your work, the product will cheer up not only the child, but also others. </p><h2>  How to decorate ready-made ball gowns? </h2><p>  An outfit due to only splendor will not look beautiful.  Before you create it, you should study in fashion magazines ball gowns, photos.  Bead jewelry, fabric flowers, guipure decoration are great for girls.  Beadwork will require considerable physical costs.  But each mother will be able to make beautiful flowers from fabric on her own. </p><h2>  Create fabric flowers </h2><p>  In order to create a realistic product, you will need to purchase a living flower in advance.  It can be a rose or an orchid.  The plant will have to be disassembled into petals.  Just as a pattern of a ball gown for a girl is performed, patterns of decoration will be prepared.  Each individual petal should be circled on paper. </p>

    <p>  To create jewelry, it is worth choosing a material with a high degree of rigidity.  In addition, it should be a fabric that melts well, because the cut petals will have to be processed so that they do not crumble.  Parts are connected manually using a needle and thread.  In the middle of the finished flower, you can insert a button or bead. </p><p>  <span>Fabric flowers</span> can be attached both on the skirt and on the top of the product.  Such products always adorn ball gowns.  Photos for girls play a big role, do not forget about it.  The more jewelry the outfit has, the brighter the little princess will look in the picture. </p><h2>  Ball Gown Care </h2><p>  If a ball gown for a girl with her own hands is made without the help of a sewing machine, then it should be treated with great care.  Such things must not be machine washed.  Well, if there is an opportunity to take the outfit to dry cleaning.  It is also necessary to iron the product very carefully.  Fatin, for example, is very sensitive to high temperatures.  So that it does not melt, you should choose a delicate ironing mode. </p>
