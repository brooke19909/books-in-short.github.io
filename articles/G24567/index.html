    <h2>  Negative hotel reviews </h2><p>  The most significant guests considered the following disadvantages of this hotel: </p><ul><li>  hotel staff behave somehow indifferent to the guests; </li><li>  in the evening the hotel becomes somehow boring, and therefore it would not hurt to organize an entertainment program; </li><li>  breakfasts are quite modest, and therefore it is better not to overpay for them and eat in neighboring establishments; </li><li>  the restaurant premises are very cramped, and therefore, huge queues are formed during breakfast; </li><li>  a huge surprise for you may be that visiting the pool is a paid service; </li><li>  being in the room, you will hear all sounds from the street, as well as footsteps and voices of neighbors; </li><li>  just disgusting coffee is served for breakfast. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Tourists arriving in Adler quite often choose for themselves such an accommodation option as the Atlant Hotel.  The first thing that attracts this institution is its very convenient location.  Leaving the hotel, you almost immediately find yourself on the beach.  In addition, in the immediate vicinity there are many cafes, restaurants, clubs, shops and entertainment venues.  It is also worth noting the beautiful view that you can watch from the windows of your rooms. </p><p>  It is worth noting the beautiful design and a high level of comfort in the hotel rooms.  There are all the amenities that a modern tourist needs.  Nevertheless, the impression can be somewhat ruined by the cool and indifferent attitude of the staff.  There is no desire to contact employees with any requests, wishes or comments.  Breakfast is also not the best impression - they are very modest, and crowds are formed in the dining room.  It‚Äôs much cheaper to eat in neighboring establishments, especially since the cafe‚Äôs work schedule is not very convenient. </p><p>  If you do not pay attention to trifles and want to relax near the sea, in the very epicenter of resort life, then the Atlant hotel is suitable for you.  Adler, st.  Ulyanova, d.14 - the address of this institution. </p>
