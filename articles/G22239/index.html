They are called factory settings.  A similar feature is present in all tablets and smartphones.  The utility differs only in the type and version of the operating system on which it is installed. </p><p>  How to reset the tablet to factory settings, the question is interesting.  Before the advent of more modern gadget models, older versions, up to and including 2015, had a number of difficulties in the information recovery mode.  To do this, I had to use special programs, connect to a computer or laptop, or contact a service center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smartphones.gadgethacks.com" data-author=": OSAS OBAIZA, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Select an option" class="if uuid-2949137" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2949137.jpg"></div><p>  To optimize the time spent on repairing gadgets, the manufacturers decided to improve the system of the installation recovery mode.  Now in tablets it is available without restrictions, and resetting will not be difficult even for a child if necessary. </p><h2>  What is reset used for? </h2><p>  The main task of the factory settings mode is to delete all the data and settings that were previously used in the tablet.  The mode is embedded in the device chip, so there is no way to remove it.  Also, in case of a serious failure in the tablet system, it is possible to carry out the rollback procedure and restore the firmware. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.howtogeek.com" data-author=": CHRIS HOFFMAN, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Installation Choice" class="if uuid-2949087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2949087.jpg"></div><p>  Modern mobile-type operating systems are dependent on this mode.  It is not uncommon for a tablet to start to offer to restore the starting version of the settings and clean the system when a failure occurs.  In this case, the operation takes no more than 10-15 minutes, depending on the model of the gadget. </p><p>  The utility is convenient to use and allows you to try to restore the equipment‚Äôs performance without contacting the master or the service center.  There are practically no problems that the rollback mode to the factory settings would not solve. </p><h2>  When rollback can help </h2><p>  If we consider the question of how to reset to the factory settings on the tablet, it will be correct to study situations in which this mode is needed. </p><p>  It is mainly used when the tablet is completely out of order.  It is important to note that this applies specifically to software failures, not hardware damage.  In case of incorrect system settings or file loss in the operating system, serious malfunctions can occur.  Reset allows you to restore all the required files from the backup. </p><p>  In addition, a rollback to the basic settings helps in case of infection of the tablet with a virus.  As a result of malicious code, it is likely that it will not be possible to cure the tablet.  Therefore, you have to use the recovery mode.  Its feature is the complete destruction of user data on the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.talkandroid.com" data-author=": Jared Peters, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Software shell" class="if uuid-2949102" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2949102.jpg"></div><p>  Tablet owners, especially on the Android system, use the recovery utility to clean the device.  Having saved all the necessary files in the cloud storage, they carry out a complete rollback of the system to the basic settings.  Judging by the reviews on the network, this method allows you to increase system performance and get rid of excess informational garbage. </p><h2>  Operation Order </h2><p>  How to reset to the factory settings on the tablet, if there is no information on a specific model, the question is urgent.  Many manufacturers are in no hurry to lay out instructions for rolling back a new model.  Therefore, many users have to try system errors by trial and error. </p><p>  Considering tablets running on the Android mobile operating system version 5 and higher, it is worth noting that there are only four main combinations that allow you to run the utility: </p><ol><li>  Volume up button - volume down button - power button. </li><li>  Volume control up or down - power button - Home mode button. </li><li>  Sound down - turn on the smartphone. </li><li>  Sound Boost - Turn on your smartphone. </li></ol><p>  It is necessary to press the marked buttons not simultaneously, but progressively, as indicated in the list.  After fully pressing, you need to hold the combination for 4 to 30 seconds.  Next, the screen should go out and light up again. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Depending on the version of the system and the shell from the manufacturer, the mode can be in Russian or English.  Using touch on the touch screen or volume switch, select ‚ÄúReset to factory settings‚Äù.  In the case of the English version of the firmware, you will need to click on the inscription Reset or Hard Reset and confirm the selection. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.talkandroid.com" data-author=": Jack Holt, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Installer Launch" class="if uuid-2949081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2949081.jpg"></div><p>  After that, the system will roll back and delete all available user files within 20 minutes.  It is important that the tablet is fully charged.  When using the mode, it is advisable to put it in charge. </p><p>  To understand the mode in more detail, you should consider how it works on popular brands of tablets. </p><h2>  Lenovo </h2><p>  The question of how to reset the Lenovo <span>tablet</span> to factory settings is quite common.  It's not about the poor quality of the manufactured device.  Basically, the gadget is made in a budget version, which affects its performance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ifixit.com" data-author=": ZFix, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rollback on Lenovo tablet" class="if uuid-2949078" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2949078.jpg"></div><p>  Every year, programs and games are becoming more demanding of resources, which is why performance problems arise with the low price segment of devices.  Most versions use the same recovery mode activation system. </p><p>  To do this, hold down the volume control with one finger in the ‚Äú+‚Äù and ‚Äú-‚Äù positions, and with the second finger, press the gadget's power button.  In response, after a couple of seconds, the screen will blink and a system logo will appear.  Next, you need to select the recovery mode and wait for the tablet to restart. </p><h2>  Huawei </h2><p>  Answering the question of how to reset the Huawei tablet to the factory settings, it is worth noting immediately that some models have basic Chinese firmware.  Especially users of unregistered devices suffer from this.  As a result, when starting the recovery mode, the menu will appear completely in Chinese.  To determine the desired button, you need a smartphone with an online language translator installed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.samsung-android-transfer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rollback to Huawei" class="if uuid-2949100" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2949100.jpg"></div><p>  To start the rollback mode, you must press "+" and the power button.  Keep up to 10 seconds.  In different models, the combination may vary.  If nothing happens, try changing ‚Äú+‚Äù to ‚Äú-‚Äù, or pressing them together. </p><p>  After rebooting, you may need access to the Internet.  This is necessary in order to download the Russian-language shell with an updated version of all system software. </p><h2>  Asus </h2><p>  If you are interested in the question of how to reset the Asus tablet to the factory settings, then here the actions will be identical to the previous ones.  All that is needed is to press the ‚Äú-‚Äù key combination and the power button.  After holding them together for 5 minutes, you will start the installation menu, where you need to select the rollback mode. </p><p>  Asus tablets are especially sensitive when rolling back to installed memory cards.  It is advisable to retrieve them when the system is reset, otherwise the processes may be terminated with errors. </p><h2>  Irbis, DIGMA, Prestigio </h2><p>  The three brands presented in this section are almost identical.  They have the same platform and most components inside.  Next, rollback methods for each device will be presented. </p><p>  How to reset the Prestigio tablet to the factory settings: press the ‚Äú-‚Äù buttons in turn and turn on the tablet.  Wait until the boot menu appears and select Reboot System.  Then confirm the operation.  After loading the logo, the system will roll back.  It is important that when starting the process it is necessary that the gadget is connected to the charger. </p><p>  How to reset the Digma tablet to factory settings: press the Home button together and turn on the phone.  Hold the combination for 10 seconds until the screen turns on again.  In the menu, select system recovery and wait until the download is complete. </p><p>  How to reset to factory settings on the <span>Irbis tablet:</span> press in turn the ‚Äú-‚Äù buttons and turn on.  After that, a bootloader will appear, in which you need to go to the recovery menu.  Further, having chosen the inscription "factory settings", confirm the selection and wait for the system to restart. </p><p>  An important point for each of the tablets - rollback should be done only when the device is turned off.  When the gadget is on, the recovery mode does not start. </p><h2>  Possible mistakes </h2><p>  Having considered the question of how to reset the system to the factory settings on the tablet, it is worth examining the problems that may arise because of this.  A common malfunction can occur on almost every device.  It is due to the fact that after starting the rollback of the system, the <span>tablet does not load.</span>  This may be due to an interruption that occurred while unpacking files. </p><div class="photo" data-original="canacopegdl.com" data-author=": Science Team, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mode selection" class="if uuid-2949108" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2949108.jpg"></div><p>  In order to solve the problem, just restart the recovery mode.  Chinese tablet models have a problem with the proprietary shell.  On top of the basic version of the Android OS, a Russified version is usually installed that modifies the system.  After the rollback, it may disappear, and the entire menu will be in English or Chinese.  To solve this, you will need to connect to the Internet through a tablet and run the update in the settings. </p><h2>  When is it better not to reset </h2><p>  The question of how to reset the settings on the tablet to the factory ones will not always help to correct the error in the system.  One of the situations where a rollback does not help is a hardware failure.  It can occur due to factory defects or as a result of damage.  The problem is solved only by contacting a service center. </p><p>  If the data is not saved, do not immediately restore the system.  There are many useful applications on the Web that deliver extended cloud storage for free.  Utilities are easy to use and help if necessary to quickly download the desired file or document. </p>
