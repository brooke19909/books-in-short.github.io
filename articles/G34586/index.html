  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Palace Square in St. Petersburg. Metro and History</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  "And on a May night in white smoke, </p><p>  And in the howl of a winter blizzard. </p><p>  You are the most beautiful, incomparable </p><p>  Brilliant St. Petersburg! ‚Äù </p><p>  So the poet Agnivtsev Nikolay expressed his love for this unusual city, and we completely agree with him.  But what makes people fall in love with this unique city, as a person, passionately, passionately and forever?  Having fallen in love with St. Petersburg, I want to be in it, to dissolve without a trace, is it true that cities, like people, have their innermost secrets that no one can solve? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rbth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palace Square at night" class="if uuid-2282976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2282976.jpg"></div><h2>  Heart of Petersburg </h2><p>  The heart of the Northern Pearl, as Peter is also called, is Palace Square, which is also the main attraction of the city.  It is a harmonious <span>architectural ensemble</span> and at the same time so unique in its execution that there are few peers of such grace not only in Russia but throughout the world.  In our small article it is difficult to convey the beauty and completeness of this architectural structure, but we will try to describe it as accurately as possible and orient you on how best to get there by walking along Peter, or which metro will be as close to Palace Square as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.saint-petersburg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View from the General Staff" class="if uuid-2282963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2282963.jpg"></div><h2>  History of the state on Palace Square </h2><p>  The square itself is a landmark for a reason.  In January of the distant 1905, a peaceful demonstration of the workers of the city was shot at by the tsarist authorities.  After such sad events, the Palace Embankment was renamed the Embankment on January 9th. </p><p>  In the heart of the Palace Square stands the monumental Alexander Column of unusual pink granite.  Its height is 47 and a half meters.  At the top of the column is a figure of an angel with a cross.  If we recall our classic Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin (‚ÄúI have erected a miraculous monument to myself ...‚Äù), it will become clear that this is exactly the <span>pillar of Alexandria</span> . </p><div class="photo" data-original="apnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palace 1917" class="if uuid-2282971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2282971.jpg"></div><h2>  Pathways leading to the Palace </h2><p>  Many tourists wonder: "What subway in St. Petersburg with Palace Square is nearby?"  Now you will no longer hear the rumble from the chariots, you will not see beautifully harnessed horses, but other vehicles have appeared in the modern world.  In the metropolis, of course, getting somewhere is more convenient using the subway.  The nearest station, from which you will enjoy a magnificent view of the Admiralty, is Admiralteyskaya, the closest metro station in St. Petersburg to Palace Square. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But if all of a sudden you want to take a little walk before meeting the beautiful in person, then you can go from other stops: Nevsky Prospekt or Gostiny Dvor.  In general, many roads lead to Palace Square, for example, you can walk on foot from the Vasileostrovskaya station through the bridge.  You will have amazing views of the main pensive river of St. Petersburg - the Neva.  Let us give you a little advice: perhaps walking and take a little more time, but, believe me, it‚Äôs better to see a little less sights, but plunge deeper into them. </p><p>  Like it or not, the Admiralteyskaya is the closest metro to Palace Square in St. Petersburg, and it‚Äôs up to you to decide, dear readers, how to get there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.saint-petersburg.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Winter Palace Square" class="if uuid-2282967" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2282967.jpg"></div><h2>  Admiralteyskaya </h2><p>  As we have already said, the neighboring metro station with Palace Square is Admiralteyskaya.  It is rightfully one of the main attractions of the Northern capital, as is the entire St. Petersburg metro as a whole.  It is worth noting the fact that the Admiralteyskaya is on the list of the deepest underground stations in the world.  The interior of the Admiralteyskaya deserves special attention.  This is a full-fledged picture gallery located underground.  Even while <span>traveling</span> in <span>St. Petersburg,</span> be sure to look at this magnificent creation of human hands. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  For most people, Petersburg is the Hermitage and, of course, the Palace Square.  Without visiting these sights, consider that you were not in Petersburg or were passing through.  We wish you to always be in time to fulfill your planned travel plan and sincerely hope that our article has become useful and interesting for you, and most importantly - you now know all the neighboring metro stations with Palace Square in St. Petersburg.  Thank you, dear readers, let North Palmyra give you an unusual sensation of magic. </p>
