  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"IPhone 7": screen size, description of features and functions, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Presentations of the "seven" from Apple were eagerly awaited by all fans of the brand's products.  A description of the capabilities and functions of "iPhone 7" was searched in all sources in the hope of seeing something amazing and stunning.  The fact is that every couple of years the company radically changed the filling and the appearance of new gadgets, and the “seven” just should be such. </p><p>  That is why many consumers literally spammed questions on the brand’s official website regarding the exterior and interior of the new device: “What is the screen size of the iPhone 7?”, “How are the cameras located?”, “Will there be advanced sensors?”  etc. </p><p>  Alas, we did not see design updates, and, contrary to expectations, the company limited itself to only minor cosmetic changes in the appearance of the device.  Nevertheless, judging by the description of the characteristics of the "iPhone 7", the set of chipsets was carefully redesigned and a completely new smartphone was expected inside the users.  So there is something to tell here.  But first things first. </p><p>  We present to your attention the review of "iPhone 7".  Customer reviews, device specifications, as well as a description of the features will be presented in our article. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The "seven" has changed the location of the plastic inserts for antennas.  They were removed to the ends, and the appearance of the gadget only benefited from this, becoming more accurate.  Judging by consumer reviews, such a solution looks best on models in black: strictly, practical, and the inserts are practically invisible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="demo.smartbizz.ro" data-author=": " data-source="https://demo.smartbizz.ro/produs/telefon-mobil-apple-iphone-7-32gb-black/"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 7 diagonal display" class="if uuid-2962813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2962813.jpg"></div><p>  But one of the main innovations of the exterior is the body coating material.  The Seven slips noticeably less on the palm of your hand, and it pleases, because carrying the sixth generation device with you without a case was simply scary.  In addition, the diagonal of "iPhone 7" implies its placement precisely on the palm of your hand, and not holding the thumb and phalanges of other fingers, as in the case of "shovel-shaped" smartphones. </p><p>  Consumers also note that tactile sensations have also changed compared to the Six.  The gloss of past generations was replaced by a matte and velvety coating.  The case is perceived quite differently than the sixth model, even though the diagonal is the same with the “iPhone 7”. </p><p>  Users also liked the new camera format.  Judging by the reviews, it looks noticeably neater and will not cling to everything in pants, pockets and handbags if you are going to wear a gadget without a case. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gearopen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 7 Feature Description" class="if uuid-2962817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2962817.jpg"></div><p>  Pleased with the presence of moisture protection according to the European standard IP67.  The device can now be dipped in water without any serious consequences.  Of course, you should not swim with him, but he will survive steadily after heavy rain and accidental falls. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Weight and dimensions </h2><p>  For many, the question is: “How much does iPhone 7 weigh?”  - It is almost in the first place.  The usability of the gadget is largely dependent on this option.  From its predecessor, the "seven" is not far away.  The mass of the model in its pure form, that is, without covers, a headset and other accessories, is 138 grams (138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is the screen size of the iPhone 7" class="if uuid-2962814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2962814.jpg"></div><p>  After finding out how much the “iPhone 7” weighs, let's see how things are with other models of the brand.  The most difficult was the oldest smartphone of this generation 7 Plus.  Its mass is almost 190 grams (158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm).  The Six is ​​slightly lighter than the Plus - 143 gr.  (138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm).  And the lightest “iPhone” can be called a model of the SE series - 113 grams (123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6 mm). </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the owners, the mass is ideally combined with the diagonal of "iPhone 7", and it’s very convenient to control the gadget.  The hand does not get tired, like from 7 Plus, and with the phone you can work on weight for a long time. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The diagonal of the display of the iPhone 7 is 4.7 inches.  A good IPS-matrix gives a resolution of 1334 by 750 pixels, which is quite enough for such sizes.  Information from the display is easy to read, and owners do not note any discomfort during operation in their reviews.  In addition, with a decent PPI value of 326 units, no pixelation is observed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.alphr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 7 description of features and functions" class="if uuid-2962815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2962815.jpg"></div><p>  Some users complain about the low resolution of the matrix, because devices on the Android platform offer 4K for a lower device cost.  But many, on the contrary, support the company's decision not to chase pixels.  There will be not so much benefit as harm. </p><p>  It is worth remembering the transition to a new layout of the Sixes.  Most developers took almost a year to update their applications to the new screen format.  In addition, the small diagonal "iPhone 7" and well-designed fonts as comfortable as possible level the disadvantages of such a resolution. </p><p>  As for the picture, there is nothing to complain about.  The output image is clear, understandable and natural.  The stock of brightness and contrast is at a decent level, so that the screen does not fade on a bright sunny day.  Viewing angles can be called maximum for the IPS-matrix. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews, those who switch from the "six" to the "seven" feel the performance gain, and it is very noticeable.  The new iPhone received the Apple A10 Fusion base on four cores, a smart video accelerator and 2 GB of RAM. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestbuy.ca" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/apple-rogers-apple-iphone-7-32gb-smartphone-rose-gold-2-year-agreement-mn912vc-a/10484348.aspx"><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does iphone 7 weigh" class="if uuid-2962818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2962818.jpg"></div><p>  There are also familiar modifications that differ in the volume of the internal drive - 32 and 128 gigabytes.  There are no problems with games and other applications: everything works fine - without lags and brakes.  Here, unlike gadgets on Android, program optimization is at the highest level. </p><h2>  Features and Functions </h2><p>  The "seven" is running the operating system iOS 10. Reviews about it are mostly positive, but some controversial issues are still worth considering.  Many users complain about the screen unlock system. </p><p>  To get started, you must turn on the gadget screen, then hold your finger in a certain area and then click on the "Home" button.  This whole series scares and confuses users, but this system is by default and can be replaced. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shop.ee.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 7 review reviews" class="if uuid-2962832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2962832.jpg"></div><p>  If you connect the Raise to Wake function, the phone will automatically “wake up” as soon as you take it in your hand, and for complete unlocking you just need to touch your finger on the specified area. </p><p>  Also, some users did not appreciate the new message format.  If in previous OSs, to mark the reading of SMS, it was enough to lower the top curtain down and remove it back, then in version 10 you have to specifically go into the notification line to remove the active indicator. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the owners, there are no complaints to the automatic assistants, and in particular to the brightness adjustment.  Here everything works as it should.  The platform has become a little more beautiful, a little faster and a little more convenient. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  "Seven" received a rear camera with a 12 megapixel sensor and a front camera of 7 megapixels.  The maximum permissible resolution for photography is 4K.  Judging by the reviews, the capabilities of the iPhone cameras can be called a solid middling, especially considering the advanced technology in this regard on Android from the same price category.  The seventh model can not offer anything outstanding, but it copes with the usual tasks very well. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="7 iphone camera" class="if uuid-2962819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/2962819.jpg"></div><p>  All the necessary functionality for shooting is available: ISO adjustment, stabilizers, aperture settings, sensible zoom, and more.  Video shooting, which can take place at 240 frames per second, also showed itself well.  True, the resolution to support the latter indicator will have to be lowered. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Even despite the presence of a more productive set of chipsets, in comparison with the previous (sixth) generation of gadgets, the battery life remained at the usual level for “iPhones”.  And this is three to four hours in a mixed mode of operation. </p><p>  The battery capacity added a little - 1960 mAh ("iPhone 6" - 1715 mAh), which made it possible to slightly compensate for the powerful processor.  The latter, by the way, is not gluttonous and does not heat up. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  If you compare the seventh generation of “iPhones” with the sixth, and many, judging by the reviews, it is these data that guide you before buying new Apple gadgets, then you can highlight some significant points that are worth paying attention to. </p><p>  The main innovations of "iPhone 7": </p><ul><li>  rejection of a 3.5 mm audio jack (adapter included); </li><li>  new color - “black onyx”; </li><li>  transition to a sensor with feedback; </li><li>  stereo speakers; </li><li>  screen matrix with a wider color gamut; </li><li>  rear camera with optical stabilization; </li><li>  protection against moisture according to IP67; </li><li>  changed the appearance of inserts for antennas; </li><li>  double the volume of the internal drive. </li></ul><p>  Today, the seventh iPhone can be bought for 39,000 rubles in the younger version of 32 GB or give 48,000 for 128 GB.  In general, the device is worth the money, and there is practically no overpayment for the brand. </p>
