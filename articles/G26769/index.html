Not the last place in terms of tourism is Siberia.  It is on these lands that huge ecologically clean natural lands are located, where destructive human activity has not yet reached. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Virgin forests and clear clear water of lakes and rivers, combined with the cleanest air - all these components make Siberia a very attractive place not only for outdoor activities, but also for a calm and measured pastime in nature. </p><p>  Largely thanks to Lake Baikal, the <span>Irkutsk region</span> occupies a special place among those corners of nature that attract tourists from many regions of not only Russia, but also far abroad. </p><p>  Only a few kilometers from Lake Baikal is the base "Warm Lakes on Snezhnaya".  For over 30 years she has been hosting her guests.  Numerous enthusiastic reviews suggest that vacations here are extremely popular.  High-quality service and extremely diverse hiking and excursions, as well as fishing tours and a calm swim in the waters of warm lakes will leave unforgettable pleasant memories, a lot of positive emotions and beautiful photos against the background of the amazing <span>nature of Siberia.</span> </p>

    <p>  On the Irkutsk-Ulan-Ude highway, at the 182nd kilometer, there is a turn on the road leading to the foothills of the Khamar-Daban.  After driving along it for about 5 km, we get to the territory of the tourist base "Warm Lakes on Snezhnaya".  It is located right in the valley <span>of the Snezhnaya River,</span> which originates high in the mountains.  These lands belong to a natural ecological park.  <span>Indescribable beauty,</span> taiga landscapes, as well as lakes with warm water and a well-developed infrastructure made the camp site a fairly popular holiday destination in the entire Southern Baikal region. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  The name of the camp ‚ÄúWarm Lakes on Snezhnaya‚Äù is due to three lakes located nearby from each other - Teploe, Emerald and Fairytale (or, as it is also called, Dead).  Mixed forests grow around these reservoirs, which are famous for rare relic poplars.  Some of the trees are so huge that only four or five people holding hands can reach their trunk at a time. </p><p>  The swimming season here begins in June and lasts until mid-September.  In the warm season, the water in the lakes reaches + 25 ‚Å∞. </p><p>  I must say that the velvet season, which begins in September and October, amazes vacationers with an unusual transparent blue sky and a colorful variety of autumn foliage.  It quietly and smoothly falls directly onto the azure expanse of lakes, which reflect the saturated greenery of the coniferous forest, snow-white clouds running through the sky, golden foliage of birch trees and red clusters of mountain ash.  Here you can truly feel the amazing fusion with nature and complete peace. </p><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  The hostel ‚ÄúWarm Lakes on Snezhnaya‚Äù provides its customers with quality rest throughout the year.  The buildings and guest houses are located both on the banks of the Snezhnaya River, and by the Emerald Lake, right in the coniferous forest. </p>

    <p>  At the camp site, everyone can find entertainment to their liking.  For outdoor enthusiasts, various excursion programs have been developed, which include exciting camping trips and fishing.  Here you can rent any sports equipment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For people who prefer a quiet measured rest, there are many sandy beaches on the lakes and catamarans, comfortable accommodation and a varied cuisine. </p><h2>  Warm lakes </h2><p>  Ponds, which gave the name to the recreation center "Warm Lakes on Snezhnaya", photos of which simply fascinate with their beauty, were formed either by nature itself or with the help of people. </p><p>  Warm Lake formed under the influence of glacial masses, gradually sliding into the foothills.  The remaining two reservoirs - Emerald and Fairytale - can be called artificial.  They appeared as a result of the development of a sand pit, when a railway was being built in these places. </p>

    <p>  Warm Lake is located in the foothills of the Khamar-Daban.  The temperature of its water in the summer months reaches + 15-20 ‚Å∞, and in winter it drops to -20 ‚Å∞.  The greatest depth of the reservoir is 12 m. The water here is so clean that tourists who come to the "savages" use it for drinking.  There are a lot of fish in the lake, especially burbot, crucian carp and pike.  Not so long ago, crayfish were brought from Altai Lakes. </p><p>  The largest body of water is <span>Lake Emerald.</span>  Its maximum depth reaches 47 m. In summer, the water in it heats up to +25 ‚Å∞.  Lake water is very useful for swimming.  It can also be drunk, but only after boiling.  For the last 30-40 years, fish have been systematically bred here.  Now in the lake are found burbot, crucian carp and pike. </p><p>  Fairy Lake (or Dead) is named so because it practically does not have any aquatic organisms, vegetation and fish, since it is soda.  But, nevertheless, swimming in it is useful.  In summer, the water temperature reaches +25 ‚Å∞, and in winter only 0 ‚Å∞.  In the cold months, Fairytale completely freezes due to its small depth - it is no more than 2 m. </p><h2>  Mountain hikes </h2><p>  I must say that on the mountain itself, Hamar-Daban, even in the summer there can be very unstable weather.  ‚ÄúWarm lakes on Snezhnaya‚Äù is a recreation center that organizes completely safe ascents to Mount Shapka Monomakh, the peaks of Love and Taltsinsky. </p><p>  The mountain got its name due to its pyramidal shape, which resembles one of the main symbols of the Russian autocracy.  Its height is 685 m. </p>

    <p>  Ascent takes place along the eastern slope, where a special trail leading to the top of the mountain is laid.  First, the path runs along a simple serpentine site, while the rest is a rather steep climb.  The climb itself takes from 30 to 60 minutes. </p><p>  The top of Mount <span>Monomakh Hat</span> is a small observation deck.  From its height you can see how the Snezhnaya River flows, the Warm Lakes, the foothills of the Khamar-Daban, and even the waters of Lake Baikal!  This hike is one of the favorite walking routes of vacationers at this base. </p><h2>  Taltsinsky peak </h2><p>  Its height is 1806 m. The slopes are covered with lushly blooming <span>alpine meadows.</span>  In addition, lingonberries and blueberries grow in large quantities here, which attracts local residents who like to pick these berries.  The peak is located near the camp site and for 40 years it has been very popular among mountain tourists. </p>

    <p>  Recently, Taltsinsky peak was chosen by adherents of active summer recreation - mountain bikers.  In winter, it attracts mainly skiers and snowboarders in that there are significant elevations and slopes with different steepnesses of descent, as well as a large amount of snow.  All these conditions contribute to excellent skiing. </p><h2>  Accommodations </h2><p>  At the recreation center "Warm Lakes on Snezhnaya" there is a comfortable hotel "Monomakh", where 8 comfortable rooms are equipped, 4 of which are "luxury".  The second hotel is two-story and consists of an east and west wing.  There are both comfortable and ordinary rooms with private facilities on the street.  There are 3 one-story log houses where you can live in the winter.  One of them stands on the lake. </p><p>  In addition, there are well-maintained cottages, as well as 30 small one-story houses in which you can live only in the warm season. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  How to get to the recreation center "Teplye ozeri na Snezhnaya"?  A map of Buryatia, on which all major roads and railways are marked, will help in this. </p>
