  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitted beret: job description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Talk about how beautiful it takes takes, you can endlessly.  However, it is not always possible to find the desired model in stores.  Therefore, many creative people prefer to come up with a design and make a knitted beret on their own.  Especially for such young ladies, we prepared the material presented below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.knitpicks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting needles and yarn" class="if uuid-2946924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2946924.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to begin </h2><p>  Most beginner needlewomen do not dare to proceed with the study of the product, because they are afraid of technology.  But experts say that problems and mistakes can be avoided.  If you think carefully in advance.  The first thing to do is decide on the style.  To do this, it is recommended to be guided by the seasons of beret socks.  For the autumn and winter versions, you should choose models made of warm wool yarn and decorated with voluminous patterns.  For spring, you can prepare a knitted beret from mohair, angora or acrylic.  And for the summer, an openwork made of thin yarn will be an ideal option.  For example, "Iris." </p><h2>  Tool preparation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted beret knitting" class="if uuid-2946731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2946731.jpg"></div><p>  It is possible to complete the intended product both with a hook and with knitting needles.  The technology is much alike.  Also, professional masters note that it is more convenient to knit with the first tool, because you do not need to pre-calculate the number of loops for a set.  You can try on a chain as you knit.  And when it reaches the desired length, close in a ring and continue the formation of a knitted beret.  However, the masters agree in the opinion that it is better to crochet lightweight openwork accessories.  Indeed, thanks to the use of this tool, it is possible to make an airy thing, carefully add additional loops into the pattern and reduce extra ones at the end.  But a warm beret is better to knit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Taking measurements </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet knitted" class="if uuid-2946736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2946736.jpg"></div><p>  Some knitters use standard parameters for various products.  However, all people are individual and the structure of the body and head may also differ from generally accepted standards.  Therefore, it is better to independently measure the model for which you plan to knit a fashion accessory.  In addition, it is very simple to do.  It is only necessary to prepare an elastic centimeter, a piece of paper and a pencil.  Then determine the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  head circumference; </li><li>  knitted beret height. </li></ul><p>  To get the correct first value, you should place a centimeter tape in front of the eyebrows, and behind - on the most convex part of the skull.  Measuring the second parameter is even easier.  We put a centimeter tape on the crown and bring the beginning to the upper corner of one ear.  Then we determine the distance from it to the same point on the other hand.  The resulting value is divided in half.  Then we fix everything on paper. </p><h2>  Sample preparation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted beret step by step" class="if uuid-2946738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2946738.jpg"></div><p>  If the knitter plans to make a conceived product with a hook, you can start work by calculating only its height.  But if you want to perform knitted beret knitting, both parameters are needed.  In any case, experts advise knitting a pattern.  This will help to better understand the scheme and make simple calculations.  The sample implies a square with a side of ten centimeters.  The loops in it can not be closed, but we do not recommend loosening them until the end of the work.  If several patterns are planned in a beret, you will need to tie a sample of each.  And after that, calculate the parameters necessary for knitting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Loop and row calculation </h2><p>  The technology of this step is quite simple, and therefore available to beginners.  When the pattern will be connected, we count the number of loops and rows that turned out in it.  If there are several samples, it is better to stick a sticker on each and indicate the necessary parameters on it so as not to get confused in the calculations.  After that, we return to our measurements taken earlier.  And divide the length of the head circumference by the width of the sample - 10 cm. Multiply the resulting number by the number of rows in it.  The found parameter must be fixed on paper.  After we calculate the estimated number of rows in a knitted beret - female, youth or children's.  To do this, divide the beret height by the length of the sample and multiply by the number of rows in it.  Do not forget to write the final value. </p><h2>  Start knitting </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted beret female" class="if uuid-2946746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2946746.jpg"></div><p>  Professional knitters recommend starting the execution of the conceived product with elastic.  An ideal option would be a single or double.  The rest on this accessory will look too rough.  Therefore, we collect the previously determined number of loops and distribute them on circular knitting needles or hosiery.  You can choose the right tool yourself, focusing on your wishes.  If you want to make a seamless product, then we knit, moving in a circle.  In any case, we carry out the elastic band with an even cloth, without making any reductions or additions.  The gum width is variable at our discretion.  When we reach the desired size, go to the main pattern. </p><p>  Some masters recommend adding the desired number of loops at the beginning of the work.  Traditionally, this number is equal to one and a half head circles.  That is, we need to add another half of the total number of loops.  But we do it at regular intervals.  If you want to make a smooth transition, you need to perform other manipulations.  We will study them in the next paragraph of the description of a knitted beret. </p><h2>  Shutdown </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted beret trendy" class="if uuid-2946752" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2946752.jpg"></div><p>  To perform a smooth expansion, divide the number of additional loops by the number of rows remaining.  To determine the last parameter, subtract the rows that went to the elastic from the height of the beret.  After making the necessary mathematical calculations, we proceed to knitting.  We determined how many loops to add in each row.  We distribute them evenly and knit.  Having reached the top edge, we begin to reduce the loops.  We also do this using a special technology: </p><ol><li>  Divide the current number of loops by 3.14. </li><li>  The resulting value is 2. </li><li>  We get the parameter R. </li><li>  Now divide the current number of loops by parameter R. </li><li>  Thus, we find out how many loops need to be reduced in each row to make the upper part of the beret. </li><li>  Having finished counting, we proceed to knitting.  When we finish the conceived product, we break off the main thread and hide it from the wrong side. </li></ol><p>  It‚Äôs not for nothing that the studied accessory is so loved by the residents of the fashion capital.  Parisians wear it not only in the cold, but also in the heat, choosing a light knitted openwork beret.  Photos and descriptions of the necessary actions will help even novice masters to realize their ideas. </p>
