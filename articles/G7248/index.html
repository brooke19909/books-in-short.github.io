The hairpin, crab, comb and elastic from satin ribbons (made with your own hands) are indispensable accessories for all occasions.  They are suitable for creating both a romantic and playful look. </p><p>  For the manufacture of such crafts, the <span>kanzashi technique</span> is widely used <span>.</span>  She came from Japan and won the hearts of many needlewomen around the world.  In ancient times, geishas adored decorating their voluminous hairstyles with hairpins decorated with <span>unusual flowers.</span>  Their petals had to be folded in a special way, the knowledge of which has come down to our time. </p><p>  An elastic band made from kanzashi satin ribbons can be decorated with flowers, butterflies and other decorative elements.  We will examine in detail how to make the petals, combine them into a single whole and fix them on hair accessories. </p>

    <h2>  Choose the basis </h2><p>  Before starting work, you need to choose all the necessary materials correctly.  Do-it-yourself elastic band from satin ribbons should be created on the basis of the most suitable jewelry for this purpose.  There are certain rules for choosing gum for decoration.  Among the main tips are the following. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pay particular attention to the material from which the accessory is made.  This is especially important for girls with long thick hair, because they need strong and reliable elastic bands that do not tear at the most inopportune moment.  In addition, low-quality jewelry negatively affects the structure of the hair, making them brittle and weak. </p><p>  Many girls prefer to buy office gum.  They reliably fix the hairstyle and do not allow naughty locks to get out of it.  But to remove such an accessory without tearing out a considerable tuft of hair is virtually impossible.  Therefore, it is better to abandon them, choosing material for work. </p><p>  Another unsuitable option for use is coarsely lined rubber bands with metal clips.  They create too much pressure on the trunks of the hairs, because of which they significantly damage the structure.  Especially away from such accessories you need to stay with girls with dry and brittle hair.  A rubber band made of satin ribbons, made with your own hands, should bring joy, not suffering.  Therefore, choose a softer and more gentle base to create it. </p>

    <p>  For example, silicone rubber is excellent for this purpose.  <span>You</span> can make any jewelry <span>from satin ribbons with your own hands</span> for her.  It happens both transparent and corresponding to the color of your hair.  With its help, any hairstyle is quickly put in order, while the accessory is virtually invisible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Despite all its advantages, this material has one significant drawback - fragility.  You can perfectly decorate it, but it‚Äôs unlikely to enjoy the result of your work for a long time, since the accessory can break at the most inopportune moment. </p><h2>  Optimal choice </h2><p>  Another good option is rubber bands with a special hook.  They are presented in various sizes and colors, perfectly hold the hair, do not pull out strands when you loose your hair.  But they are very difficult to find both in markets and in stores.  If you are lucky enough to stumble upon such an accessory, immediately take it and boldly decorate it with crafts from ribbons. </p><p>  A simple, convenient and affordable option - ordinary elastic bands made of soft fabric.  They are usually sold in three per pack.  They are easy to get, and they do not create problems both during decoration and during further wearing. </p><p>  So, with a rubber band we decided.  Now let's move on to the selection of the remaining materials.  Depending on which decoration you want to make, you need to take the appropriate details.  Consider some of the most popular workshops on decorating rubber bands with ribbons. </p><h2>  Lush flower </h2><p>  In order to make this magnificent and elegant flower and decorate your hair style with them, you will need: </p><ul><li>  satin ribbon of three shades of the same color (its width should be a quarter of a centimeter); </li><li>  one large bead and many small ones (it is desirable that they be golden or silver); </li><li>  ruler; </li><li>  Super glue; </li><li>  circle of cardboard with a diameter of 4 centimeters; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  narrowest gift ribbon; </li><li>  and, of course, an elastic band to match the working materials. </li></ul><h2>  Work process </h2><p>  Cut the satin ribbon of each shade into pieces of 10 centimeters.  Make loops from them, folding each fragment in half and gluing the ends together.  Then attach the cardboard to the rubber band and fix the finished petals on it.  Arrange them in a circle, alternating between different shades.  You can arrange them less or denser - as you like best. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Now cut the gift ribbon into 4 fragments of 12 centimeters each.  Fix the strips according to the principle of snowflakes.  Here's how to make elastic from satin ribbons with your own hands.  The master class further advises to apply another layer of colored loops and cover them with another batch of shiny rays.  This time, cut 8-centimeter strips and attach them in the same way as before. </p><p>  Now we pass to the final stage of decoration.  To make the core of the flower and at the same time cover all the joints from fixing the ribbons, glue a large bead in the center.  And to give the craft an extra volume and unusualness, decorate the ends of the gift ribbon strips with beads to match it. </p>

    <h2>  We connect leaves to business </h2><p>  An elastic band made of satin ribbons with your own hands can be decorated not only with a separate flower, but also with leaves to it.  To work on such an accessory you will need: </p><ul><li>  plain satin ribbon, a quarter centimeter wide; </li><li>  strips of the same color, but with a pattern (they should be 1 mm larger than the main material); </li><li>  green ribbon (width - 0.25 centimeters); </li><li>  large strass; </li><li>  piece of glass; </li><li>  burner; </li><li>  iron ruler; </li><li>  Super glue; </li><li>  needle with thread; </li><li>  ordinary scissors; </li><li>  elastic in tone to the main material. </li></ul><h2>  Flower first </h2><p>  Put a satin ribbon with a <span>pattern on glass,</span> measure 5 fragments of 7 centimeters on it and cut them using a burner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself satin ribbon rubber band" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/757196.jpg" width="516"></div>

    <p>  Fold the strips in half and connect the ends of each of them so that you get triangular petals.  Lay them on top of each other and glue them so that each piece keeps its shape. </p><p>  Sew and tighten the beams at the base so that beautiful oblong recesses appear inside them.  Perform this operation with each petal individually. </p><p>  Lay out the elements in a circle and fasten them together using a thread.  Pull its ends and tie them tightly.  Then spread the resulting petals.  You should get the first flower.  An elastic band made of satin ribbons, made by one's own hands, consists of two or more of these tiers, so we will move on to work on the next one. </p><p>  Work with a plain satin ribbon by the same principle as in the previous scheme.  But this time we will need 7 cuts of 9 centimeters each.  Put the cloth on the glass, measure with the ruler the required number of parts and disconnect them using a burner. </p><p>  Bend each petal with a triangle.  Fasten the ends with glue and sew the base, tightening the thread.  Now assemble them all together and reliably tie them together.  At this stage, your gum from satin ribbons is almost ready.  The master class, which describes the process of its creation step by step, further recommends combining the two layers together. </p><h2>  Now - the leaves </h2><p>  Glue the flower with five petals on top of the just made and proceed to create the leaves.  They are made on the same principle as the previous elements.  Cut with a burner from a green ribbon 3 parts of 15 centimeters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself satin ribbon elastic" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/757200.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <p>  The tips of each of them should form corners.  Glue them each part, turn from the inside to the front side, and then combine three finished leaves into one composition. </p><p>  Attach them under the bottom flower, and on top, in the central part, attach the rhinestone.  When the glue dries, sew the craft to the elastic. </p><h2>  Bows: blanks </h2><p>  What else can be a gum from satin ribbons?  A master class (instruction) will talk about how to decorate it with a bow.  Make it even easier than a flower. </p><p>  For work, you will need three types of tape of different widths: 3.3 centimeters, as well as 0.6 and 1.3.  Each layer of crafts is made from strips of a certain type.  For the first level, you will need cuts of 18 cm each.  For the second - 28, and for the third - 4. </p>

    <p>  From the remaining cuts, make the same bow.  Sew both jewelry to the elastic.  To make your job easier, you can pull the accessory onto the deodorant cap.  So it will stretch, and fixing decorative elements will become much more convenient.  An elastic band from satin ribbons, a photo of which can be used as an example while working on new jewelry, is ready.  Wear it with pleasure! </p>
