What kind of person was he?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Brezhnev Leonid Ilyich was born in Ukraine in the city of Dneprodzerzhinsk (the old name is Kamenskoye).  His parents were simple workers.  My father's name was Ilya Yakovlevich, and my mother was Natalya Denisovna.  He also had a sister, Vera, and brother Jacob. </p><h2>  What kind of <span>person was</span> Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev </h2><p>  Leonid Ilyich was a kind person.  Over the 18 years of his reign, a lot of literature was written about him, in which not only his political activities, but also the personal life of the general secretary was retold. </p><p>  His main hobbies at leisure were hunting, watching movies and, of course, hockey.  He was distinguished by special sentimentality, when viewing a spiritual picture he could easily burst into tears.  With special love, Leonid Ilyich collected cars, guns and medals. </p><p>  Despite his fame and a long political career, few modern youth know in which year Brezhnev died.  Anyway, the new generation is not particularly interested in his personality and the era when his name was on everyone‚Äôs lips. </p><h2>  Health status, years of illness </h2><p>  Before taking office in Brezhnev in 1952, he suffered a heart attack, and in the 57th year - a serious heart attack.  But thanks to qualified doctors, for the entire period of his reign, serious heart problems no longer arose. </p><p>  Brezhnev was a man who did not like long work and loads, so he often complained of overwork.  He personally followed his work schedule: from 9 to 17 he was engaged in government affairs, rested 2-3 days a week, his vacation was 2.5 months.  People close to him claimed that he often wanted to give up everything and finally take a break from all the problems, but his love of popularity did not allow this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what year did Brezhnev die" class="if" height="473" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/387752.jpg" width="600"></div>

During this period, he preferred to eat fruits, vegetables and dairy products.  Perhaps this was precisely the reason for the problem with dentures, which made his speech slurred. </p><p>  In the 75th, on the recommendation of dentists, Leonid Ilyich quit smoking, since tobacco smoke irritated the mucous membrane of the surface of the mouth, which created inconvenience for prosthetics. </p><h2>  The death of Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev </h2>

    <p>  November 10, 1982, he passed away.  Everyone understood that Brezhnev was old, his health was not that good, but they did not expect him to die soon.  There were no essential prerequisites for this, no one in the country wondered whether the secretary general would soon die, and in which year.  Brezhnev died during sleep, calmly, without regaining consciousness, from a sudden cardiac arrest. </p><p>  The Secretary General ruled the country for many years, people managed to get used to it.  Many respected him, someone was afraid.  Today, every self-respecting connoisseur of history will easily give an answer to the question of in which year Brezhnev died. </p><p>  Lonely Ilyich was escorted by all the people, in order to say goodbye to him, huge lines lined up.  When Brezhnev died, all the country's enterprises suspended production.  The country plunged into mourning.  A lot of people attended the funeral, some of them cried. </p>
