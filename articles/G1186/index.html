    <p>  Mortgage lending is one of the main components in the system of borrowing funds for special purposes.  After transferring money to buy real estate, housing becomes a mortgage (pledge) of the bank as a guarantee of loan repayment.  What is the percentage of mortgages for secondary housing? </p><h2>  Interest rate concept </h2><p>  The Bank establishes an individual procedure for the interest on mortgages of each loan issued.  <span>Interest rates</span> are the main factor in payments, their range ranges from 7 to 12% for loans in foreign currency, and from 8 to 14% - in ruble loans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage percentage for secondary housing Sberbank" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1589619.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When calculating interest, the following nuances matter: </p><p>  1. The object.  Real estate acquisition.  This can be an apartment or a private house, as well as part of an apartment or house. </p><p>  2. Housing market.  In this case, the secondary.  That is, housing is not purchased in a new, not yet rented house. </p><p>  3. Official income indicated by Form 2-NDFL or a certificate in the form of a bank. </p><p>  4. <span>Deadlines</span> required <span>.</span>  <span>Mortgages</span> are longer than consumer loans. </p><p>  5. Down payment.  It matters when the cost of housing exceeds, when the <span>interest rate</span> decreases. </p><p>  6. Promotions and special offers. </p><p>  The percentage of mortgages on secondary housing is high, there is an overpayment.  The longer the payment period, the more funds the borrower will pay.  For example, for 20 years of a mortgage, the double cost of an apartment is paid.  But the plus is that the person will have his own room, and he will not have to give extra money when renting a room - he will spend the money on paying his own square meters. </p><h2>  Mortgage for secondary housing: interest banks </h2><p>  The percentage of secondary housing mortgages in 2017 will depend on such factors: </p><p>  1. The established size of the basic rate by the Central Bank.  Now it is 11.5% (varies up to 11.9%). </p><p>  2. Putting new <span>state programs</span> into operation <span>.</span>  Starting January 1, 2017, changes in rates are introduced. </p><p>  3. The economic situation. </p><p>  The anticipated 2017 mortgage program at Sberbank is a <span>special offer</span> about the absence of a down payment.  It is very difficult for people to collect the first amount, and additional expenses for insurance and independent expert evaluation of the real estate will be required. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Interest Rate Types </h2><p>  Fixed interest is considered common.  Their feature is that they remain unchanged for the entire term of the mortgage. </p><p>  There are also floating rates, which depend on the average value of the rates of all interbank markets of European importance.  Every six months or a year, the borrower is informed of a new percentage value. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank mortgage secondary housing what percentage" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/1589547.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is also a combined rate that remains unchanged for the first few years of the loan, and then goes into a floating one.  Such a rate is beneficial to the borrower because it allows you to accumulate funds until it moves from one to another. </p><p>  For each user of a mortgage loan, interest is calculated individually, which he will then have to pay. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, Sberbank selects different types of programs with a minimum interest rate in the interests of its customers.  Mortgage of secondary housing (what percentage in this bank - we will discuss below) is a fairly popular service that many people resort to. </p><h2>  The concept of secondary real estate </h2><p>  Secondary is the dwelling, legally adopted into operation, previously used for the actual residence of people. </p><p>  Resellers are not a new building, but a place where someone has already lived, which the owner (individual or legal entity) has the right to sell. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage on secondary housing bank interest" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/1589546.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The ‚ÄúOld Fund‚Äù is in no less demand than new buildings.  This is due to a more affordable price for an ordinary citizen.  In addition, the purchase of such housing is very fast (up to six months). </p><p>  Such housing requires less investment than primary.  It made any repairs, there are communications. </p><p>  Plus, the range of the <span>secondary market is</span> very wide.  <span>Personal preferences</span> and wishes of clients are taken into account. </p><p>  The only risks when buying such a property is the necessary thorough examination of all the documentation of the owners and utility bills. </p><h2>  Percentage of mortgages on secondary housing </h2><p>  Sberbank makes it possible to purchase secondary housing with a mortgage on the following conditions: </p><p>  1. Term.  It depends on the current program.  Early repayment rights are also granted. </p><p>  2. Initial payment (from 15 to 20%).  The larger the contribution, the lower the interest rate. </p><p>  3. The minimum loan (in the amount of 300 thousand rubles). </p><p>  4. A constant source of income. </p><p>  5. Citizenship of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  6. Good credit history. </p><p>  7. The use of the right of state subsidies (maternity capital, subsidies to a young family, special mortgage funds for military personnel). </p><p>  8. Calculation of repayment of the loan "mortgage calculator." </p><p>  According to forecasts, the state will continue to help people to improve their living conditions. </p>

    <h2>  Acquisition of finished property </h2><p>  Sberbank determines the percentage of mortgages on secondary housing from 12% with a minimum loan.  In this case, the following are determined: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ maximum subsidized amount - not more than 85% of the assessment of the cost of purchased housing; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ loan term - up to 30 years; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ first investment of 20% of the price of the apartment. </p><p>  The percentage calculation of the secondary living space is similar to the rates in new buildings. </p><p>  An approximate table of percentages on secondary housing will help to navigate in the numbers. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Credit term </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Down payment </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Interest rate </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  Up to 10 years </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  20 to 30% </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  12.5-13% </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  10 to 20 years old </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  30 to 50% </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  12.25-12.75% </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  From 20 to 30 years </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  From 50% </p></td><td valign="top" width="156"><p>  12-12.5% </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  The percentage of mortgages on secondary housing depends on some nuances: </p><p>  1. Category of the borrower.  People who do not receive wages at Sberbank pay an additional 0.5 to 1%. </p><p>  2. Registration of a mortgage loan (another 1% is added). </p><p>  3. Compulsory life and health insurance.  Additionally, the rate increases by 1%. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  What do people say about the services of Sberbank?  The interest on housing loans is always lower than on other types of loans, and the requirements for borrowers are not always exaggerated.  Even payments and a constant, fixed interest rate are always winning.  Real estate can be purchased ahead of maturity.  The percentage of mortgages on secondary housing in Sberbank is minimal (up to 13%). </p>
