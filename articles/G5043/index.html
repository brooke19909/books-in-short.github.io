Where are the most favorable interest rates?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Moscow, there are central branches of most Russian banks.  That is why everyone who wants to receive income from investment deposits will be able to find a suitable option for themselves.  What are the interest rates on deposits in Moscow banks today?  This question worries everyone who wants to profitably place their money. </p><h2>  Which bank is better to carry savings? </h2><p>  Now our country is going through far from the best times in its history.  The lack of significant economic growth can affect the stability of the financial system.  That is why it is important to determine how reliable commercial banks are.  It is difficult to give a definite answer.  Analysts advise as much as possible to study the current situation in the institution that interests the potential client, and only then make a final decision about banks, deposits, a high percentage. </p>

    <p>  Moscow is a city in which problems with a quality choice should not arise.  Today, both state and commercial banks are participants in the <span>individual deposit insurance</span> system <span>.</span>  It is this factor that guarantees the return of customer funds even in the event of the liquidation of a financial institution.  Let's take a closer look at the best interest on deposits in <span>banks in Moscow.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Foreign currency deposits in Russia </h2><p>  How profitable is it to keep your savings in foreign currency today?  The maximum interest on deposits in Moscow banks in dollars rarely exceeds 6% per annum.  We see that the rate itself is relatively low.  However, making a deposit in foreign currency, you get an absolute guarantee of the safety and augmentation of your funds.  This is not about the nominal, but about the real value of the numbers.  How to understand this?  Not so long ago, the dollar was worth about 40 p., And now it‚Äôs already 50-60 rubles.  Customers who then bought dollars and issued a foreign currency deposit will benefit today.  Firstly, they will earn on interest, and secondly, when exchanging dollars for rubles, they will receive a much larger amount than they spent on buying foreign currency. </p>

    <h2>  Interest on deposits in banks in Moscow (currency) </h2><p>  What rates can be found today in Russian financial institutions on foreign currency deposits?  For example, United Credit Bank OJSC offers a currency prestige deposit.  When placing funds for one year, the client will receive 8% per annum.  At the same time, there is no possibility of capitalization of interest, but you can <span>replenish the deposit.</span>  If the client does not come for money at the end of the contract validity period, the deposit is automatically extended for the same period at the current rate.  The same interest is offered to its customers by Arksbank.  But Vneshprombank has developed several types of deposits in US dollars.  The ‚ÄúMaximum income‚Äù deposit (interest rate ranges from 2.5 to 7.5%) implies a gradually growing customer income. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The same principle lies in the profitability of other deposits: </p><ul><li>  "Honorary customer" - the rate rises from 5.2 to 7.5% per annum; </li><li>  "Universal Management" - the profit will be from 3.7 to 6.3%; </li><li>  making a deposit "Free Access", you can get income from 4.45 to 7.00%. </li></ul><h2>  "Bank of Moscow": foreign currency deposits, interest </h2><p>  At BM Bank, deposits can be opened both at the institution‚Äôs branches and via the Internet.  This, by the way, is very convenient for people who do not have time to come to the branch.  The most progressive bank for customers is the <span>Bank of Moscow.</span>  Interest-bearing <span>deposits</span> in this institution may not have such a return as in some other structures.  The advantage of BM is its high quality customer service, many years of experience in the international banking market, and the trust of depositors. </p><p>  The minimum deposit amount "Maximum income" is 100 dollars or 100 euros.  The interest rate depends on the term of the deposit and its amount.  For example, if you place from 100 to 20,000 dollars for 91 days, then your interest rate will be 1.35% per annum.  If you deposit the same amount for 550 days, the rate will be 1.7%. </p>

    <p>  The contribution ‚ÄúMaximum Growth‚Äù is not so profitable, but no less popular.  It provides for the possibility of replenishment and capitalization of interest.  As an example, we take the same amount and the same terms.  The interest rate for a deposit of 90 days will be 1.25% per annum, and for a period of 550 days - 1.6%. </p><p>  The Bank of Moscow offers another interesting deposit in foreign currency - Maximum Comfort.  What are the conditions of this deposit?  The term of the deposit in the range from 91 to 1095 days, the client chooses independently.  The minimum amount for the first deposit in foreign currency is 100 dollars or 100 euros.  Interest is paid monthly.  At the client‚Äôs choice, this may be their capitalization or payment to a separate card. </p><p>  What rate does the bank offer its customers?  When placing funds in dollars (for example, $ 1,000) for 91 days, the client‚Äôs income will be 1.15%.  Yes, the rate is small, but still ... The conditions of the deposit provide unlimited possibilities: you can withdraw money and replenish the deposit without restrictions.  In fact, this is a regular current account, only the Bank of Moscow always puts high interest on deposits (as much as possible). </p><h2>  Deposits in national currency </h2><p>  Almost all <span>banks in Moscow</span> offer deposits in rubles <span>.</span>  <span>Deposits, the</span> best interest on them and the conditions we will now discuss. </p><p>  At the moment, City Bank has become very popular.  Under the programs "Urgent with investment products" and "Urgent with accumulative insurance" the client will receive an income of 18% of the deposit amount for the year.  However, it does not provide for the possibility of replenishment and withdrawal of funds throughout the duration of the contract.  The minimum deposit amount in rubles is 30 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  An interesting option is offered by Home Credit Bank.  The program is called "Profitable Year with Capitalization."  One of the advantages of the deposit is already visible in the name itself.  The rate is 17.23% per annum.  The conditions provide for the possibility of replenishment.  The minimum term of the contract is 12 months. </p><p>  Trust Bank deposit program ‚ÄúHonorary Client‚Äù attracts with a good interest rate (15.25%).  What else is interesting in this contribution?  The Bank did not provide for the possibility of replenishment or withdrawal of funds throughout the duration of the contract, which is at least 12 months. </p><h2>  Foreign currency deposits in other Russian banks </h2><p>  Optimal conditions are offered by many Russian banks (deposits, high interest).  Moscow is the center of Russia, not the United States, so there will never be very high rates on foreign currency deposits.  Analyzing the statistics of domestic banks, we see a not very comforting picture: one of the maximum interest rates on a dollar deposit is fixed at the financial institution Trust and it is only 6.25%.  Further, several structures offer customers to place money at 6% per annum (MDM-Leader, Russian Standard, BIN-Bank).  Other financial institutions have even worse conditions. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Of course, everyone who wants to make money on deposits should make all decisions on their own, but it is worth considering the opinions of experts.  Financiers believe that it is better to place money in the national currency and not buy at too high rates. </p><p>  Good luck with your earnings! </p>
