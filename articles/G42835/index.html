Briefly, this issue should be considered by analyzing the features of the development of the main areas that were formed as a result of the collapse of the once unified state territory. </p><h2>  The path of becoming a principality in the Northeast </h2><p>  The main political center of Russia at this time is the Rostov-Suzdal land.  It was here that the main focus of agriculture and agriculture was formed, which subsequently gave impetus to the formation of the nucleus of the future united state on this territory.  The main flow of the population went to these lands in search of new lands, pastures, and lands.  A characteristic feature of this area is the active participation of princely power in the construction of cities, fortresses, clearing pastures, wastelands, deforestation. </p>

    <p>  The latter circumstance led to the fact that a strong princely power had developed here from the very beginning, which suppressed the boyar opposition and subjugated the local population to its will.  It is not surprising that the Northeastern lands became the basis for the formation of a single Russian state.  It was around this area that the unification of specific lands began, which later became the core of a centralized national state. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Edge advantages </h2><p>  The main political center of Russia was formed thanks to the construction of new cities, which became the capitals of the new specific principalities.

    <p>  After Kiev lost its significance and ceased to be actually the capital of Russian lands, a flood of people rushed into the northern regions who were looking for protection in these forests from raids by nomads, princely feuds, and the ruin of cities and villages.  The future main political center of Russia had an advantageous geographical position, since it was covered from invasions of nomads and Mongol-Tatars by impassable forests.  In addition, this area possessed fertile lands, which were very good for the development of agriculture.  Peasants burned forests and fertilized soil with ash, which contributed to the development of arable farming, as well as a variety of crafts. </p><h2>  Some facts from the story </h2><p>  The main political center of Russia in the 12-13 centuries was formed during the reign of Yuri Dolgoruky.  This prince waged active foreign policy wars, as a result of which he even managed to seize the former capital of Russian lands and put the ruler dependent on him there.  His son and successor Andrei Bogolyubsky finally subjugated the boyars to princely power.  This predetermined the monarchical form of government in the area.  Despite the temporary weakening of the prince‚Äôs power, his successor nevertheless managed to continue the policy of his father and grandfather and achieve absolute domination.  Thus, this area became the core of the unification of Russian lands in the following centuries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The main political centers of Russia in 12 13 centuries" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1238899.jpg" width="200"></div></h2><h2>  City fight </h2><p>  The study of medieval Russian history closely rests on the analysis of the theme "The main political centers of Russia."  The Principality of Vladimir-Suzdal in this row occupies a leading place, since it was on its basis that a single national state was formed.  But this was preceded by a long confrontation between old and new cities: Rostov and Vladimir.  The first retained a leading position for a long time, since it was the holder of senior status.  However, very soon the new city of Vladimir entered the historical scene, the ruler of which, in contrast to the old concepts, declared himself the supreme ruler of the north-eastern lands.  Thus, this main political center of Russia took over the initiative to unite all the lands. </p><h2>  Other lands </h2><p>  In addition to the Vladimir-Suzdal principality, there were other areas that could also claim to be the unifier of lands.  In general, there were many destinies that essentially led an independent existence, but only three of them managed to rise to leave a noticeable trace in the people's memory.  It is their development that is the main topic for understanding what the history of Russia was in the time being considered.  The main political centers of Russia, in addition to the above-mentioned area, included Novgorod land and the Galicia-Volyn principality. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of Russia the main political centers of Russia" class="if" height="476" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1238904.jpg" width="328"></div></h2><h2>  Novgorod </h2><p>  A peculiarity of the development of the first was that boyar management was established in it, and the power of the prince was considered nominal.  The latter performed military and some administrative functions.  He was not a political head and did not take part in the legislative life of the city.  On the contrary, the boyar elite made it a rule even to expel an objectionable prince from Novgorod.  Thus, here, in essence, a republican type of government was established - a phenomenon that is essentially unique to the Middle Ages. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the main political centers of Russia briefly" class="if" height="277" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1238908.jpg" width="375"></div></h2><h2>  City Economy </h2><p>  Another characteristic feature of the development of this area was that it was economically developed and had trade relations with countries of Western Europe.  Novgorod merchants had their offices in the northern states, and foreign merchants also conducted their affairs in the city itself.  However, agriculture was poorly developed in Novgorod land, which depended on the supply of bread from the so-called lower regions.  Nevertheless, the Novgorod <span>boyar republic</span> had a high urban culture. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history table main political centers of Russia" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1238911.jpg" width="450"></div></h2><h2>  Principality of Galicia-Volyn </h2><p>  This region was located in the <span>north-west of Russia.</span>  Politically, it was a cross between the two centers mentioned above: in it, evenly power powers were distributed between the prince and the boyars.  From time to time, each of these political forces gained the upper hand, however, as a rule, a relative balance was maintained between them.  However, the struggle for supremacy led to fierce clashes between the rulers and the clan aristocracy, which periodically sought to gain lost ground. </p><p>  Another characteristic feature of the development of this region is the constant interference of the West European neighbors in the internal affairs of the state.  But the Principality of Galicia-Volyn was far from the Khan‚Äôs headquarters and therefore did not suffer so much from the raids of the Mongol-Tatars.  Located on the periphery of Russian lands, this territory has retained some independence, but at the same time, in the end it came under the influence of the West. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Features </td><td>  Vladimir-Suzdal land </td><td>  Principality of Galicia-Volyn </td><td>  Novgorod </td></tr><tr><td>  Politics </td><td>  Strong power of the prince, suppression of the boyar opposition </td><td>  The relative balance between princely power and the boyars, the struggle between them </td><td>  The Boyar Republic, the prince performs only military functions </td></tr><tr><td>  Economy </td><td>  Development of agriculture, crafts </td><td>  The development of salt production, trade, agriculture </td><td>  Trade </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  The history table "The main political centers of Russia" clearly shows the above features. </p>
