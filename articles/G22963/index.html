    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The city of Dalaman became widely known to tourists only after the opening of an international airport here.

Hotel Dalaman Lykia Resort 4 * compares favorably with others in its multifunctional infrastructure, quality of service and provided services.  It is located only 8-10 minutes from the airport (approximately 3.5 km).  It is also not far from Dalaman, about 2.5 km.  You can cover the distance on foot, by minibus or taxi.  The world famous Fethiye resort is 40 km away, while Marmaris is 95 km away.  Nearby there is a highway, along which buses run to both of these resorts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dalaman Lykia resort 4 Fethiye" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/470874.jpg" width="401"></div>

    <h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  For a short stay, for example, during a business trip or during a transit flight, the Dalaman Lykia Resort 4 * hotel is most suitable.  Fethiye, located just half an hour away, will bring a pleasant variety to the rest.  But Dalaman himself is able to give a lot of unforgettable impressions.  Its main attraction is the fast river of the same name, on which rafting is organized.  There are two routes, simple and complex, and at the end of the travelers there are magnificent beaches.  And if you book a boat trip, you can stay in one of the dozens of deserted bays of fabulous beauty.  But that is not all.  There is a turtle sanctuary in Dalaman.  The beach is located on its territory.  However, for hotel guests there is one drawback - you need to get to the sea almost 8 km.  The second drawback is the noise from taking off and landing planes, so it‚Äôs difficult to sleep at night with an open balcony.  Some tourists in the reviews indicate the rigidity of the mattresses, but this is already a matter of habit - you will not please everyone.  But the fact that drinks, even according to the ‚ÄúBB‚Äù system, must be bought for a fee, may come as a surprise.  Well, for all those who find these difficulties insignificant compared to the big advantages of this hotel, Dalaman Lykia Resort 4 * hospitably opens the door. </p>
