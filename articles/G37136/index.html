Archaeological excavations carried out in places where signs of the existence of ancient civilizations were found found evidence of smoking.  Perhaps not tobacco, but other plants.  But the process was based on the inhalation of smoke while burning dried herbs or leaves.  Images of smoking pipes were found in Indian temples, in Egyptian burials, the inhalation of smoke from burned plants is described in ancient Chinese literature. </p><p>  Despite the breadth of geographic locations for tobacco use, some researchers believe that the history of smoking begins in North America. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vokrugsveta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gift Columbus" class="if uuid-3080510" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3080510.jpg"></div><h2>  "Columbus discovered America ..." </h2><p>  Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of the American continent, confident that he had sailed to India, called in his notes the indigenous people he met the Indians, which they remained even after the seafarer's mistake was discovered.  So, in his diaries there is a description of the plant, which the natives twist into a tube, set fire to one end and inhale the smoke.  There are different opinions about who brought tobacco to Europe, but the fact that in 1492 Columbus ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù the custom of smoking, and recorded this fact in writing, is beyond doubt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At parting, the Indians gave Columbus some dried leaves.  Some historians claim that he threw the gift overboard, while others argue with them.  But even if he brought the gift to his native coast, this is not a distribution.  Few leaves are not enough to accustom even some countrymen to tobacco. </p><p>  But the Columbus team included people who tested the smoking process first among Europeans.  Rodrigo de Jerez decided to demonstrate his smoking skills in Spain.  The Inquisition, declaring him an accomplice of the devil, blowing his mouth with smoke, imprisoned him for seven years.  Cruel smoking history page. </p><h2>  Tobacco popularization in Europe </h2><p>  After the path to America was paved, Europeans began to actively explore the continent.  These were mainly representatives of Spain and Portugal.  Tobacco found its way to France, but the attitude to this plant was far from unambiguous. </p><p>  The history of the spread of smoking mentions the name of Andre Teve, a French monk who participated in a second expedition to the American continent.  It is he who is attributed the "economic" approach to a new plant for him.  Leaving for his homeland, he grabbed not a bunch of leaves, but seeds, which indicates a different scale of vision.  Previously, he studied the processes of growing, drying and storing leaves, and also described the physiological sensations of a person who tried smoking for the first time and after the addiction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.historic-uk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="First smoker" class="if uuid-3080492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3080492.jpg"></div><p>  Teve was a wonderful storyteller, and Queen Catherine de Medici, who suffered from migraine, listened with pleasure to his travel story.  Prepared theoretically, she tasted snuff, which her other subject, diplomat Jean Wilman Nico, brought from Portugal.  Medici tobacco helped.  After such an advertisement, naturally, the whole yard became addicted to the ‚ÄúQueen's Powder". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The enterprising Jean Nico, not being a doctor, made a list of diseases that the plant allegedly cures of.  The later discovered alkaloid contained in tobacco was named after him nicotine sewing l. </p><h2>  On an industrial scale ... </h2><p>  The history of smoking in the world made a breakthrough in its development after the idea was formed that it is possible to make money from the distribution of tobacco.  In 1636, the first tobacco factory producing cigars was created in Spain.  It was state property.  Following the example of the first producer in subsequent years, all countries tried to maintain the right to manufacture tobacco products in their hands, that is, to monopolize it. </p><p>  The word cigarette, like the product itself, was born in Seville.  Factory workers, in order to obtain additional income, collected scraps of leaves, chopped them, wrapping them in tissue paper.  It turned out a little cigar.  <span>Theophile Gautier,</span> visiting production in 1833, coined the name of such a product. </p><p>  The sale of tobacco products yielded huge profits, which led to the opening of factories for production, as well as specialized stores both in Europe and in America. </p><h2>  What contributed to tobacco use? </h2><p>  If we talk about the history of smoking briefly, it should be noted that the First World War caused a new round of development of the tobacco industry.  From 1914 to 1918, tobacco products were introduced into the mandatory military ration of all countries of the world and all military branches. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pointsadhsblog.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tobacco soldier" class="if uuid-3080494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3080494.jpg"></div><p>  The Second World War repeated the previous story.  Cigarettes, along with food, were included in the daily rations.  In addition, tobacco factories sent "humanitarian aid" in the form of their products to the forefront.  As a result, the entire male population who fought returned from the war as heavy smokers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But the biggest impetus for tobacco use was made under the influence of cinema.  In foreign and later in domestic cinema, ‚Äúcool‚Äù heroes expressed any emotions by lighting a cigarette.  How could you refrain from imitation? </p><h2>  The ambiguous attitude towards tobacco smoking </h2><p>  <span>The history of tobacco</span> and smoking knows many sharp turns in relation to this habit.  It ranged from the strictest prohibitions with lethal punishment to incentives and outright propaganda. </p><p>  At the beginning of the XVI century, the attitude towards this addiction was sharply negative.  Inquisition of the punishment of people, accusing them of being associated with the devil.  After a hundred years in Spain and Italy, even priests became addicted to tobacco.  Pope Urban VIII issued a decree in 1624, in which he threatened with repudiation of violators of the smoking ban.  This was a terrible punishment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.catholicgentleman.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Three monks" class="if uuid-3080491" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3080491.jpg"></div><p>  In England, at first, only sailors used tobacco, but soon Elizabeth I's yard became addicted to smoking. W. Relie, a court and seafarer at the same time, became a supplier of addiction to high society.  Jacob I, who ascended the throne in 1603, was a fierce opponent of such a craze, and the first research work, "Tobacco Protest," which he personally wrote, appeared.  When Raleigh, sentenced to death for conspiracy against the crown, was asked about his last wish, he asked for a pipe of tobacco.  From here rumors spread about his execution for smoking.  By the way, England introduced the fashion of smoking a pipe. </p><p>  By the end of the XVIII century, despite the fluctuation of opinions ‚Äúit is possible - it is impossible‚Äù, tobacco was smoked in all countries of the world. </p><h2>  The turn came to Russia ... </h2><p>  ‚ÄúSmoke‚Äù - the root with the word ‚Äúsmoke‚Äù, which means smoke, stench.  The stench potion first lands in Russia under Ivan IV the Terrible.  It arrived with the English ships caught in the storm.  How the Russian tsar, quick to kill, related to smoking, is not known for certain.  But under his rule, smoking did not spread. </p><p>  The history of smoking in Russia, its mass use begins with the Romanovs.  Tobacco addiction becomes so widespread that Mikhail Fedorovich in 1649 in the Cathedral Code, the first set of Russian laws, personally wrote: ‚ÄúIt is forbidden to smoke, drink and store tobacco‚Äù (poor people drank tobacco liqueur like tea).  In punishment - flogged, pulled out nostrils, sent to the link. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yachts.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Box of cigars" class="if uuid-3080507" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3080507.jpg"></div><p>  Under Peter I, at first the attitude towards tobacco was negative, and smokers were fined.  But, having returned from a trip to England in 1698, where he himself tried to smoke a pipe, his attitude and, accordingly, the history of smoking made a sharp turn.  In 1716, the first tobacco plantation appeared in Russia, tobacco consumption began to gain momentum.  Every tobacco was in use: snuff, pipe and wall.  Since 1844, cigarettes have become popular in the country.  This is a new era of the tobacco business in Russia. </p><p>  A.F. Miller's factory, the first tobacco production, thanks to the expanded advertising received huge incomes.  All cigarette factories were initially owned by foreigners.  In order to keep up with fashion, women became addicted to smoking, making a cigarette a symbol of equality.  Producers instantly reacted to new consumers.  Female cigarettes appeared on sale. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons </h2><p>  ‚ÄúA smoking boy may not worry about his future, he has no future‚Äù - the first anti-tobacco slogan that appeared in 1915. </p><p>  In the XX century, a negative attitude to smoking at the level of state power was shown by Germany.  Hitler could not stand tobacco smoke and was an implacable fighter against this bad habit.  During his reign, the number of smokers in the country decreased by 23%.  This result was achieved thanks to the work of the propaganda machine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pointsadhsblog.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dugout meeting" class="if uuid-3080493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3080493.jpg"></div><p>  Post-war studies that proved the harmful effects of smoking from a scientific point of view led to the emergence of filter cigarettes.  Manufacturers still claim that it reduces the harmful effects of tobacco on health.  And consumers still believe that. </p><p>  But in order to increase the market, a variety of methods were used.  The history of smoking has become cynical.  After men and women, children began to learn how to smoke.  In adolescence, one wants to be like idols!  ‚ÄúCowboys‚Äù appeared in droves on the screens in adventure films, which were visited by school students many times, both literally and figuratively.  But in his mouth, in his hands, in his teeth, everyone almost all the time had a cigarette or cigar. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fr.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Children with a cigarette" class="if uuid-3080511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3080511.jpg"></div><p>  The advertising ‚Äúfor smoking‚Äù used all possible and impossible options.  Cigarettes appeared in television programs, on sports posters, on gift wraps.  Incidentally, specialists worked hard on the packaging of the cigarettes themselves to make them more attractive. </p><h2>  Tobacco control today </h2><p>  The history of smoking goes around like a circus pony.  Today the world wants to be healthy.  Internal conviction is the most important thing in any business.  There is no ban on smoking, but a lot of restrictions make this process deprived of pleasure. </p><p>  Today, every Russian smoker, buying a pack of sharply expensive cigarettes, finds on it a warning from the Ministry of Health about the dangers of smoking with terrible illustrations of diseased organs.  Smoking is prohibited in almost all public places, and the areas allotted for this process are catastrophically small.  You can‚Äôt calmly smoke a cigarette on the street.  The smoker is forced to take a few quick puffs while hiding. </p><p>  But at home, he also does not feel comfortable.  He has no right to smoke through the window, on the stairs, on the balcony, watchful neighbors do not want to passively inhale acrid smoke. </p><p>  Those who find the strength to quit addiction - honor and glory.  The rest, according to Russian tradition, are forced to break the law several times a day. </p>
