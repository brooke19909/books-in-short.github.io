Originally called "Sandpiper".  In the summer of 1902 he was launched in Port Arthur, receiving a well-known name.  It was delivered to the east by rail in several parts.  It officially went into operation in August 1903.  Already in February it was destroyed in an unequal battle with superior enemy forces during the Russo-Japanese War.  In that memorable battle, the Stereguschiy, together with the destroyer Resolute, fought against four Japanese warships.  They significantly exceeded Russian ships in terms of crew, weapons and displacement. </p><h2>  In Port Arthur </h2><div class="photo" data-original="lemur59.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Destroyer feat guarding" class="if uuid-2907377" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2907377.jpg"></div><p>  In its short story, the death of the destroyer "The Guardian" remained the most striking event.  The situation developed rapidly.  On February 26, two ships returned to Port Arthur from night reconnaissance.  In fact, by chance they met four Japanese destroyers.  These were the Sadzans, Akebono, Usugumo, and Sinonome.  Over time, the enemy’s power intensified, as they were joined by the cruisers “Chitose” and “Tokiva”. </p><p>  Destroyer and Decisive destroyer commanders seek to avoid battle, but only one of them succeeds in breaking through to Port Arthur.  The "guardian" is surrounded by superior enemy forces, he is forced to accept an unequal battle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Unequal battle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.vitber.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Technical characteristics of the destroyer" class="if uuid-2907380" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2907380.jpg"></div><p>  While the machine was still operating, the destroyer "Steregushchiy" hoped to break into Port Arthur if successful.  But at 6 hours 40 minutes a Japanese shell exploded in a coal pit, as a result of which two adjacent boilers were damaged at once. </p><p>  <span>The destroyer</span> began to rapidly lose speed.  Fireman Ivan Khirinsky went to the upper deck with a report on what had happened.  The driver Vasily Novikov also rose behind him.  At that time, the fireman Alexei Osinin and the fireman quartermaster Peter Khasanov remained below.  Together, they tried to repair the damage that had occurred, but at that time another shell exploded in the area of ​​stoker # 2. The blast wave wounded Osinin.  Water immediately poured through the hole, which almost instantly flooded all the furnaces.  The stokers lifted their necks behind them, climbing onto the upper deck. </p><p>  There they witnessed the last minutes of this battle. </p><h2>  End of story </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.yaplakal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Characteristics of the destroyer" class="if uuid-2907378" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2907378.jpg"></div><p>  The <span>destroyer’s</span> guns fell silent one after another.  By this time, Commander Sergeyev and Midshipman Kudrevich had already been killed, who had not left their posts.  Killed Lieutenant Goloviznin, who ordered the launch of the whaleboat.  A powerful explosion of a shell threw overboard mechanical engineer Anastasov. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Finally, the guardian’s guns fell silent at 7:10.  On the water remained only the almost completely destroyed skeleton of the destroyer, on which there were no longer any masts and pipes.  The deck and side were severely mutilated, and the corpses of the heroic defenders of the ship lay everywhere. </p><p>  After that, the Japanese ships ceased fire, having gathered near the flagship destroyer "Usugumo".  The reports made by the head of the detachment supplemented the picture of what happened.  “Sinonome” and “Usugumo” received minor damage.  But the other two Japanese ships barely stayed afloat.  13 shells hit Akebono, and 8 hit Sanazami. There were enough dead and wounded on both ships. </p><p>  At 8:10, the Japanese began towing the "Sazans."  By this time, two cruisers arrived - "Novik" and "Bayan", they were commanded by Admiral Makarov.  Japanese ships did not accept the battle, it was decided to retreat.  On board, they lifted the four crew members of the dead ship, who survived. </p><p>  At 9:07, the Guardian sank.  As noted in documents of the time sent to Tokyo by the Naval General Staff, this happened seven miles east of Liaoteshan Lighthouse.  This is the story of the death of the destroyer "The Guardian". </p><p>  Four people survived from the Guardian crew.  These were the fireman of Khirinsky, the mine-machine quartermaster and the acting boatswain Yuriev, the hold operator Novikov and the fireman of the first article, Osinin.  When they returned to their homeland, they were awarded the insignia of the military order of the fourth degree, which in everyday life was called the George Cross. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><div class="photo" data-original="i-podmoskovie.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Destroyer armament guarding" class="if uuid-2907379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2907379.jpg"></div><p>  The destroyer was built at the Nevsky Plant.  Moreover, he belonged to the class of squadrons.  It was launched in 1902 at the Nevsky Plant, and in 1904 it was withdrawn from the Russian fleet. </p><p>  The vessel was about 58 meters long and about 5 and a half wide.  Among the main characteristics of the destroyer Steregushchiy, a displacement of 259 tons should be noted. </p><p>  The draft of the ship is 3 and a half meters, speed - up to 26 and a half knots, power - 3800 horsepower. </p><h2>  Armament </h2><p>  The destroyer had mine-torpedo weapons and artillery.  In particular, these were two torpedo tubes. </p><p>  In total, four artillery pieces were installed on the Steregushchiy.  Only one of them was 75 mm, and another three - 47 mm.  Such was the armament of the destroyer "The Guardian". </p><p>  The crew of the ship consisted of 48 sailors and 4 officers. </p><h2>  Lieutenant Sergeev </h2><div class="photo" data-original="dic.academic.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander Sergeev" class="if uuid-2907374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2907374.jpg"></div><p>  Until 1904, the captain of the ship was a lieutenant named Kuzmin-Karavaev, about whom virtually no information was preserved.  But already during the Russo-Japanese War, Alexander Semenovich Sergeev, who also had the rank of lieutenant, took over the reins of power. </p><p>  At the time of his death, Sergeev was forty years old.  It is known that in 1863 he was born in the city of Kursk, although initially it was believed by many that the future officer was born in the village of Stakanovo.  His parents were nobles. </p><p>  Sergeyev grew up in a family consisting of four sons of an official who was part of the local provincial government, Semyon Aleksandrovich.  Mother - Olga Ivanovna Barantseva.  Alexander was the youngest child. </p><p>  He was baptized in the Mikhailovsky Church of Kursk.  Growing up, he began to study at a local real school, and then entered the St. Petersburg Naval Cadet Corps.  He graduated in 1884 with the rank of midshipman. </p><p>  In 1890, he continued his career in Kronstadt, ending up in mine-officer classes.  There he was sent to serve on the <span>battleship Emperor Nicholas I,</span> who at that time was considered the flagship of the Russian Mediterranean squadron.  There Sergeyev rose to the rank of lieutenant.  In total, he spent about three and a half years on this ship. </p><p>  In 1893, the officers were awarded the French Order of the Legion of Honor of the Cavalry Cross during a friendly visit to the "Emperor Nicholas I" at the head of the Mediterranean squadron in France. </p><p>  After that, Sergeyev primarily served on the Baltic Sea.  In particular, he commanded small mine ships, which were the destroyers of the number of destroyers.  They were part of the St. Petersburg detachment. </p><p>  He was transferred to Port Arthur just before the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War in early 1904.  In the Pacific, he was entrusted with the command of the destroyer "Stereguschiy" in 1904. </p><h2>  Death on the Captain's Bridge </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Destroyer commanders guarding" class="if uuid-2907373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2907373.jpg"></div><p>  Faced with the Japanese ships Sergeev, when he returned from intelligence, which went on the orders of General Makarov.  The destroyer was immediately attacked by Japanese ships. </p><p>  Sergeyev withstood about an hour of unequal battle, after which he ordered the Kingstones to be opened in order to flood the ship.  By that time, he himself was seriously injured. </p><p>  It is believed that this version is in fact a legend.  According to some reports, the destroyer commander "Sentinel" Lieutenant Sergeyev was killed at the very beginning of the battle.  After that, the previous commander Goloviznin took over command.  At the same time, no one opened the kingstones - since they were absent on a ship of this type, they were not provided for by the project. </p><p>  According to a common version, the ship sank due to very significant injuries sustained during the battle. </p><h2>  Memory of Sergeev </h2><p>  At the same time, information about the heroic deed of the destroyer Steregushchiy and its commander Sergeyev quickly spread.  In 1905, the destroyer "Lieutenant Sergeyev" was even laid down, which since 1908 was part of the naval forces of Russia, based on the Far East.  Over time, he was transferred to the flotilla of the Arctic Ocean, until 1924 he was among the ships of the Red Fleet. </p><p>  In 1910, his father built a stone church in the village of Stakanovo, which today is located in the Kursk region.  She appeared in memory of the two sons of Semen Alexandrovich, who died in the Russian-Japanese war. </p><p>  Detailed circumstances of what happened on the destroyer can be found in <span>Alexander Stepanov</span> ’s historical novel Port Arthur, which first saw the light of day in 1940.  Some scenes of the work are dedicated just to Sergeyev. </p><h2>  Awards </h2><p>  Lieutenant Alexander Semenovich Sergeev was repeatedly awarded with high awards. </p><p>  In addition to the Legion of Honor, in 1895 he received the <span>Order of St. Stanislav of the</span> third degree.  This is the youngest order of seniority in the hierarchy of state awards.  Interestingly, most often they were awarded officials, but sometimes he was also given to the military. </p><p>  In 1896, Sergeyev was awarded a silver medal in memory of the reign of Emperor of Russia Alexander III.  It is known that the last significant award was presented to him in 1898.  It was the order of St. Anne of the third degree.  He was the youngest in the hierarchy of domestic orders until 1831, when the Order of St. Stanislav appeared. </p><h2>  Monument to the Guardian </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.citywalls.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the destroyer Stereuschiy" class="if uuid-2907375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2907375.jpg"></div><p>  By 1911, the construction of the monument to the heroic death of the destroyer was completed.  It was the last in St. Petersburg, built before the revolution, and also the only one in the entire city, made in the Art Nouveau style. </p><p>  The sculptor was Konstantin Vasilievich Isenberg.  And calculations important for the monument on the strength of the foundation were carried out by Professor Sokolovsky.  The sculptural composition was cast in a workshop specializing in artistic bronze.  The work was supervised by master Gavrilov. </p><p>  The Monument to the Guardian is a part of the ship’s hull and two sailors, who quickly open the kingstones.  This illustrates the widespread legend at that time that the ship was flooded by the Russian sailors themselves, realizing that the situation was hopeless.  This was done so that he just did not go to the enemy. </p><h2>  Grand opening </h2><p>  The monument was first presented to the public in April 1911.  The opening was attended by Emperor Nicholas II.  He appeared on Kamennoostrovsky Avenue in Alexander Park. </p><p>  A month later, Iskra magazine published photographs of the opening ceremony of the monument. </p><p>  Open Kingston greatly damaged the monument itself.  In the mid-30s, water was supplied through it, which actually destroyed the monument.  The same situation persisted from 1947 to 1971. </p><p>  As a result, in the 60s, concrete bowls were installed directly at the pedestal, which were supposed to collect rainwater.  But this did not affect the situation.  It was possible to fundamentally resolve the issue only after, in 1970, the City Executive Committee decided to dismantle the entire system. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that in 1954 a large-scale restoration of the monument was carried out, the work was directed by the sculptor's son Vladimir Isenberg.  For example, it was possible to restore the memorial plaque on which all crew members were listed. </p><h2>  Cultural reflection </h2><p>  The heroic death of the "Guardian" cannot but impress, which, as everyone suspected, did not drown voluntarily.  Over time, she began to be regularly mentioned in the stories of other Soviet and Russian ships. </p><p>  In Kursk, where Sergeyev was born, school number 18 is named after him.  Even the anthem of this secondary school is called “Song of the Guardian”. </p><p>  Also, the composition "Death of the Guardian" is in the repertoire of the singer, performer of the country folk genre, Zhanna Bichevskaya. </p><p>  As a result, Bitsky’s song became so popular that the destroyer mentions Valentin Pikul in his novel Cruiser.  Also, mention of him can be found in the novel "Lord officers!" </p>
