Honestly, despite all the uniqueness and uniqueness of this corner of the planet, it is difficult to call it a favorite and popular place for Russians to relax.  Why so?  Most likely, due to its some distance from famous tourist destinations.  In fact, getting here is not very easy.  Although there are positive aspects to this.  Arriving on the coast, you can enjoy the peace and quiet. </p><p>  This article will not only talk about where the Botanical Gulf itself is located, but will also introduce readers to the characteristic features of this place, its history, climate. </p><h2>  General description of the object </h2>

    <p>  As you know, the Botanical Gulf was opened in 1770 by the famous sea explorer James Cook.  This place got its name due to the many plants unknown to Europeans growing off its coast. </p><p>  It was in Botany in 1787 that the first settlement of immigrants from Europe in Australia was formed.  However, the following year it was moved to Port Jackson Bay, where Sydney's center is currently located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The depth of the Botanical Gulf is 18-31 m, and the width is 2.2 km.  The Georges and Cook rivers flow into it.  Also on the territory of the bay is the port of Botany, and about 35 thousand people inhabit it. </p><h2>  Discovery story </h2>

    <p>  On April 29, 1770, a ship called Endeavor dropped anchor in the waters of Botany Bay.  It was here that the British first descended to the shore of an uncharted continent, and in the same period of time the bay was called Botanical. </p><p>  Captain James Cook's team, which set off in search of a previously unknown southern mainland, consisted of a botanist named Joseph Banks.  The picture of dozens of plants that had not been known to science of the time, which had struck him, struck him that he had persuaded Cook to give this beautiful place such a name without much effort.  And since then, the bay has been called Botanical, which in the English version sounds like Botany Bay. </p><p>  Eighteen years later, ships of the first English fleet under the command of Arthur Philip anchored at this place.  It was here that the first batch of convicts was delivered, and a few days later the marquis de Laperouz, then famous, appeared here.  But since he sailed from these places, no one has ever seen him alive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Gulf of Botany: tragic events </h2><p>  In 1788, the first so-called British settlements appeared in New South Wales on the territory of the future Sydney.  The colony was mostly inhabited by soldiers and convicts. </p><p>  One day, one of the convicts went in search of herbs and moved far enough away from the brick stoves located in Rose Hill.  It later turned out that he was killed by <span>Australian Aborigines.</span>  Sixteen members of the gang to which the murdered belonged armed with sticks and went to Botany Bay to take revenge. </p><p>  Upon arriving at the bay, they stumbled upon a multitude of gamaraigal aborigines who attacked them with spears.  As a result, one person was killed and six or seven were injured.  A day later, the governor of the colony, known as Captain Arthur Philip, sent marines there to restore order.  At the battlefield, the infantrymen discovered the body of one killed exile and one wounded.  All the exiles were punished for not following Philip‚Äôs order to treat local Aborigines well.  They received 150 lashes immediately after recovery. </p><h2>  The climate of the area </h2>
