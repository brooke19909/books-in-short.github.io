It seems that they have already decided who is who, but no!  A new brand appears in the white light - and all over again! </p><p>  Now the troublemaker on the market is the little-known company Digma.  What kind of manufacturer is this and where did it come from?  Nobody knows for sure.  Nevertheless, the developer clearly intended to fill the entire budget segment.  Its products are cheaper than the most budget devices from Xiaomi and <span data-mce-mark="1">Meizu</span> .  This is how Digma tries to survive in the tough competition. </p><p>  More recently, the company introduced the new ultra-budget device Digma Linx A420 3G.  Reviews about it (as well as technical specifications) will be sorted in this material.  But first, let's try to understand what kind of brand this is and where it came from. </p><h2>  What brand is it? </h2><p>  Digma was founded in 2005.  Its nominal owner is a UK corporation, Nippon Klick Systems LLP.  The company is registered in London, but its products are manufactured at little-known factories in China.  It is worth noting that the main industry of the brand is computer peripherals.  Tablets, mobile phones and smartphones are new products for this manufacturer.  True, so far things are not going very well in this industry: the company's products cannot stand out among modern brands.  And dumping from Xiaomi and Meizu makes the existence of this brand problematic.  But this did not prevent the release of a relatively high-quality smartphone.  Reviews about Digma Linx A420 3G (black) have positive comments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  I must say that the range of smartphones in the company is not so big.  Perhaps this is why Digma can not yet occupy a prominent place in the global mobile market.  However, this company has everything ahead.  For example, Digma Linx A420 3G, reviews of which we will consider in this material, is quite suitable for unassuming users who do not need incredible performance or new technologies.  This is an ultra-budget smartphone, and this has to be reckoned with.  Let's take a closer look at our current instance. </p><h2>  Reviews on the design and quality of materials </h2><p>  If you are going to purchase this device due to some unusual design, then you will spend money in vain.  There is nothing special about the appearance of the Digma Linx A420 3G.  Reviews about the design of the device are eloquent.  Many users find him dull and faceless.  And that is the perfect truth.  It painfully resembles Chinese devices from unknown brands.  The case is made of cheap plastic, there is no protective coating.  Many owners note a flimsy design, but at the same time claim that it is almost impossible to remove the back cover without effort.  And what to believe?  Most likely, this is the case: some models are fragile - those that come with factory defects. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And what do the owners say about the quality of the materials?  All polls declare that plastic is used to the point of poor quality.  And what do you want, you ask, from an ultra-budget smartphone?  This is a normal state of affairs.  After all, this device was thought to be cheap, therefore, the materials used were appropriate. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews on the performance of the device </h2><p>  Now let's move on to the Digma Linx A420 3G 4GB hardware platform.  Reviews about the capabilities of the smartphone are not monotonous - they are all sharply negative.  The vast majority of owners of the device complain that it disgustingly copes with some applications.  Other commentators say that the device copes with its direct duties very badly: the contact list is loaded for five minutes, there are constant ‚Äúglitches‚Äù when receiving a call, and there‚Äôs no need to talk about the Internet at all.  This is to be expected: the gadget has a weak processor (albeit a quad core) with a clock frequency of 1300 megahertz.  RAM - only 512 megabytes. </p><p>  But the operating system was put here very modern - "Android" 6.0.  It is clear that a low-power hardware platform can not cope with this OS.  Hence the "glitches".  The vast majority of owners complain that the internal memory is disastrously small.  And really, what nowadays means 4 gigabytes?  It is possible to expand the memory with a Micro SD flash drive, but only up to 32 gigabytes.  In general, the characteristics of the hardware platform are very "budget" - to match the price. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Smartphone Camera Reviews </h2><p>  Now let's take a look at the Digma Linx A420 3G Black smartphone.  Reviews about the camera will also not please readers.  Almost all owners believe that there is no camera in the smartphone at all.  And only a few are convinced that the photomodule of the budgetary apparatus should shoot like that.  According to the manufacturer, the device is equipped with a 5 megapixel module.  But in reality, he shoots like 3.2-megapixel sensors in the first smartphones on Android.  You can take something important with this camera, but there is no question of high-quality photographs.  According to many users, the camera here is fake.  There is no front camera at all, and rightly so - in such a low-powered gadget it is absolutely not needed, because there is no certainty that even Skype will pull this creation.  Nevertheless, many people buy this device as a dual-SIM dialer.  The smartphone copes with this normally.  Although there are not without flaws, however, minimal. </p>

    <h2>  Device Battery Reviews </h2><p>  If the gadget is so weak, then maybe it‚Äôs okay with the battery?  What will please the Digma Linx A420 3G 4GB smartphone?  Reviews about the battery and battery life are mixed.  First, let's see what kind of battery is installed in this smartphone.  Here we see a 1400 mAh Li-Ion battery.  Is it able to ensure the "survivability" of the apparatus?  People say no.  In the stock (standard) firmware, without any changes, the device lives only one day in standard load mode.  And this is a device with such characteristics!  However, some users claim that they were able to minimize the "gluttony" of the device by disabling unnecessary services.  The most radical comrades completely changed the firmware, after which the gadget began to work much better and longer.  This is the whole point of ultra-budget devices.  After the purchase they will have to be ‚Äúfiled‚Äù and ‚Äúdance around with tambourines‚Äù.  Without this, they will not work normally.  And here the question arises: is such a saving in time and effort spent on refinement? </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the gadget screen.  Part 1 </h2><p>  Now let's move on to the Digma Linx A420 3G screen.  Reviews about him are also not encouraging.  All smartphone owners say that the display is just awful.  Color rendering is okay, but there are no viewing angles at all.  And apparently, this company did not hear about protective glass at all.  Even ordinary glass here is so thin that it is scratched from a simple attempt to open the back cover.  Screen resolution is frankly none.  Even to HD is far, not to mention such exotic as Full HD or 4K. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the gadget screen.  Part 2 </h2><p>  The screen does not differ in quality performance.  Inaccurate seams are noticeable in places where the display and touchscreen are glued together.  Owners complain of an inadequate sensor.  The touchscreen lives ‚Äúits own life‚Äù: it is impossible to type the text, letters pop up whatever you like, but not the ones you need.  For some users, the situation has improved slightly after updating the firmware, but it‚Äôs still far from normal operation.  However, this story is not with all gadgets.  A couple of people claimed that everything was in order with the screen.  Apparently, just the party was defective. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the operation of the device </h2><p>  Now let's talk about how Digma Linx A420 3G works.  Feedback on the work, again, is mixed.  Many users are well aware that for the money to buy a normal gadget is unrealistic.  Therefore, they say that the device completely fulfills its money.  He manages calls and SMS, sometimes he can play modern multimedia content (with luck), and is even able to hold out on the Internet for some time.  But to demand from him the normal launch of applications or games is pure madness.  Other owners are surprised to note a very good sound in the headphones.  At least something Digma did well!  In general, opinions about the operation of the device in everyday mode are rather ambiguous, a specific line is not traced. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  So, we examined the ultra-budget Digma Linx A420 3G smartphone.  Reviews about him are more negative than positive.  So what is the verdict?  The general opinion is this: the device is clearly not worth it to buy.  Digme needs serious work both on the hardware component and on optimization.  In addition, the quality of the materials leaves much to be desired.  For the money that they ask for this gadget, one could do something better.  If you need a reliable and high-quality smartphone, then it is better to dig up a bit and purchase a state employee from Xiaomi.  They have pretty decent models.  Digme needs to seriously work on its products - so far only the price tag is attractive in it. </p>
