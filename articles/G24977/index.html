    <h2>  Bali, Jimbaran: Local Market </h2><p>  Of course, the main attraction of Jimbaran is its beaches with beautiful sunsets and fish restaurants.  People come here not for architecture, night clubs or ancient history (although it is), but for relaxation and quiet relaxation. </p><p>  But lying on the beach, you see, is also a little boring.  Moreover, how, if not in the process of walking, to enjoy the surrounding beauty and local color. </p>

    <p>  The first step is to go to the fish market.  The village is the center of fisheries, and it would be an unforgivable mistake not to look at all the amazing creatures that local people are pulling in from the sea.  The bulk of buyers are representatives of restaurants, but there are tourists.  The best time to visit is early morning.  You can try a lot, and it will cost less than in a restaurant. </p><h2>  Uluwatu Temple </h2><p>  Uluwatu Temple is one of the six most significant temples of the <span>island of Bali.</span>  Jimbaran is located nearby, so you can get to the sights on your own by a rented car or moped.  What is one of the key temples of the island good for? </p><p>  Firstly, its incredible location on top of a cliff, at an altitude of 70 meters above sea level.  It offers stunning views directly to the Indian Ocean.  If you are lucky, then you can get to the magnificent festive ceremonies, which are held every six months, or to daily performances - dances "ketchak".  According to the chronicles, the temple was founded a thousand years ago. </p>

    <p>  You should be careful on the way to the temple.  The monkeys who came from the jungle are very curious and without any twinges of conscience steal glasses and cameras from gape tourists. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  The village with beaches and luxury hotels is a popular holiday destination, so there are always plenty of tourists here.  Many of them in their reviews after the trip noted that a huge flow of people from all over the world spoiled local residents, the service at times very high prices, to say the least, is lame. </p><p>  Most travelers, according to popular tourist portals, speak of Jimbaran as a paradise.  Among the main advantages include its location, clean beaches and the beauty of nature.  The admiration of holidaymakers is also caused by local gastronomic pleasures.  <span>Fish market,</span> restaurants, cafes, street food - all this is worthy of attention and tasting. </p>

    <p>  Jimbaran (reviews of tourists confirm this) is a place for a relaxing holiday, for example, during a honeymoon or a romantic trip, as well as holidays with children.  There is no that vibrant and active nightlife with parties and dancing, as in the center of the island. </p>
