  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pochinki village, Nizhny Novgorod region - a difficult past and a promising future</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The village of Pochinki, Nizhny Novgorod Region, is a small village 220 kilometers from Nizhny Novgorod, on the banks of the Rudnya River.  About 12 thousand people live here.  The village is the largest in the region. </p><h2>  The first round of settlement history </h2><p>  The settlement is located on the site of the former Mordovian village.  And before that there were <span>dense forests.</span>  In ancient sources, the village of Anudemir or Kele-ushta Nova, Pochinok Keushtanov is mentioned, all this is about the <span>modern village of</span> Pochinki. </p><p>  For a long time fierce battles were fought over this territory.  There were many who wished, these were Russian princes, Mordovian tribes and Volga Bulgarians.  But at the end of the XIV century, the princes of Nizhny Novgorod triumph and take control of the partially Mordovian lands into which the village belongs.  <span>The Principality of Nizhny Novgorod</span> is part of the Russian state.  Subsequently, the border with the warlike Nogai Tatars, who constantly raided, passes through the territory of the settlement.  Therefore, there were few inhabitants, despite the fertile black soil.  As a result, the Tatars completely devastated the village in 1628, and local residents were forced to leave their native places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sobory.ru" data-author="  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fixes, Nizhny Novgorod Region" class="if uuid-2231216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2231216.jpg"></div><h2>  Morozov and potash production </h2><p>  But after some 19 years, Boyar Morozov bought the village.  He brings here his serfs from the estate near Moscow.  And from the wasteland, the village of Pochinki, Nizhny Novgorod Region, is reborn again. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Boyarin started a potash production in the village, the products of which the boyar sold abroad. </p><p>  For reference: potash - ash, which was prepared according to a special recipe and was used in the manufacture of soap and glass products.  International exchanges highly valued Pochinsky potash, it was a kind of equivalent of the highest grade. </p><p>  In the village of Pochinki, Nizhny Novgorod Region, there was a bathhouse, a kvas, a cellar with a glacier, a hopper, two mills. </p><p>  Morozov was a rather oppressive master, had every right to judge and punish his serfs.  To increase obedience, he built a prison and a church.  After the boyar‚Äôs death, the estate was transferred to his wife, and in 1689 all the lands of Pochinki were transferred to the state treasury.  And for almost 100 years, the village was one of the largest centers of state-owned potash production.  But by 1760, demand for products subsided, and production was shut down. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=", " data-source="http://mapio.net/a/105838771/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pochinki Village" class="if uuid-2231208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2231208.jpg"></div><h2>  Stud farm </h2><p>  In the year the potash production closes in the village of Pochinki, Nizhny Novgorod Region, a stud farm opens.  By the way, it is valid to this day.  It was a large stud farm, created by decree of Empress Elizabeth Petrovna.  The horses were primarily intended for a privileged regiment.  The main goal of opening the enterprise is to strengthen the military power of Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main emphasis in making this decision was made on the fact that in the settlement district there were rich hayfields and meadows. </p><p>  The factory facilities had 4 lines of wooden stables.  The first livestock was brought from the Baturinsky plant (Ukraine), and it totaled 680 horses.  The factory specialized in trotter breeds, but later heavy breeds of horses began to be bred here. </p><p>  By 1817, wooden buildings were dilapidated, and already in 1819 the construction of new brick buildings began, by the end of 1821 the construction was completely completed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vkriusha.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://vkriusha.ru/?page_id=16"><img itemprop="image" alt="Village Pochinki, Nizhny Novgorod region" class="if uuid-2231392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2231392.jpg"></div><h2>  Modern stud farm </h2><p>  Despite the long history and vast experience in breeding horses, the company can be said to barely ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù.  Heavy trucks are kept in terrifying conditions.  Only one stable works.  And in 2008, the plant was declared bankrupt, but the administration is trying to establish business activities to this day. </p><h2>  City Status </h2><p>  In 1779, the village of Pochinki, Nizhny Novgorod Region, even received city status.  Then they approved the general development plan, so even today it is noticeable that the village was built according to the type of regular development inherent in the city.  Two years after receiving the status, the emblem was approved.  By 1922, the status of the city was abolished, but the settlement continued to develop. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  On the map of Pochinki, Nizhny Novgorod Region, you can find marks of attractions.  One of them is St. Nicholas Winter Cathedral.  The stone structure began to be erected in 1790, and earlier there was the Nikolskaya wooden church here.  According to the stories of local watchmen, Pochinok residents sold a wooden church with icons to Lukoyanovsky district (Sloboda village), namely the icon of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.  A couple of days later, a fire broke out in the village.  Then several people died and many houses burned down.  Local residents repented of their deeds and acquired in Moscow the icon of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker. </p><p>  The Church of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God is also an ancient temple of the village, built in 1793, which received Zakharyevsky parishioners.  But in Soviet times, the wooden church suffered, and later it was restored. </p><div class="photo" data-original="svyato.info" data-author=": , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fixes, Nizhny Novgorod Region, map" class="if uuid-2231255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2231255.jpg"></div><h2>  Present time </h2><p>  Today, the village of Pochinki is a modern settlement in which there are several enterprises: a creamery, an enterprise for the production of canned goods and bread, several construction enterprises and a branch of Gazprom.  There is a cultural and sports complex, a music and youth sports school.  Also in the village there are 5 springs, one of the most famous is the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God. </p>
