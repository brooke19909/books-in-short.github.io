    <h2>  Where is Davos </h2><p>  The resort is located in Switzerland, in the east of the country.  Administratively, it belongs to the canton of Graub√ºnden.  World maps designate Davos in different ways.  In the local dialect, it is called Tafaas.  In Russian, we copy the French pronunciation: Davos.  And in the Italian-speaking cantons of Switzerland, the city is called Tavate or (less commonly) Tavau.  Davos is located in the intermountain valley, at an altitude of 1560 meters above sea level.  The river Landwasser flows through the town.  The resort is part of the famous and prestigious group The Best of the Alps.  The permanent population of Davos is twelve thousand people.  This figure gives him the right to claim the title of the highest city in Europe.  The valley is conditionally divided into two parts.  The east is called Davos-Dorf, and the west is Davos-Platz.  To get from one part to another, you must use the bus.  Next to Davos is Klosters - another resort that, together with Courmayeur and Chamonix, is included in the nomination The Best of the Alps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is davos" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/611644.jpg" width="600"></div>

Russo.  The philosopher praised life in the bosom of nature, assuring that both health and morality away from corrupt civilization only grow stronger.  At the end of the 18th century, doctors recognized the air of the Alps as healing for pulmonary diseases.  Davos (Switzerland) has overgrown with sanatoriums where rich tuberculosis clients were treated.  Among them was R. L. Stevenson.  It was in Davos in 1882 that the famous ‚ÄúTreasure Island‚Äù was written.  And Thomas Mann in 1912, local beauties inspired the creation of the ‚ÄúMagic Mountain‚Äù.  Conan Doyle, a well-known author of detective stories about Sherlock Holmes, has also been here.  True, not as a consumptive patient, but as an athlete.  It belongs to him the honor of opening the first track in Davos.  In 1913, the only European championship in ice hockey was held here.  The resort gained a second wind in the middle of the twentieth century, when skiing became fashionable.  Tourist hotels, equipment rental, schools and other infrastructure for clients who prefer active recreation were added to hospitals and sanatoriums. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Davos Switzerland" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/611645.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  World Economic Forum (WEF) </h2><p>  For the majority of the public, the question of where Davos is is interesting for one reason: what do financial movers in a small alpine village decide?  And why almost every year this resort is stormed by thousands of anti-globalists?  The Davos Forum has been convening since 1971 annually, in late January - early February.  At this "summit" invited statesmen, political leaders, leading businessmen.  The name of the Forum itself involves a discussion of macroeconomic problems.  But in fact, the topics that are addressed at the meetings relate to the situation in <span>the</span> world's <span>hot spots</span> , the resolution of political crises, health and environmental issues.  The forum is one of the main events of the year, despite the fact that this symposium does not produce any official resolutions.  However, the informal atmosphere and conversations ‚Äúwithout ties‚Äù do not exclude the adoption of measures quite tangible for world politics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Davos is located" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/611646.jpg" width="600"></div>

All other railway routes will be with transfers.  If you flew to <span>Zurich airport,</span> you need to get to the city of Kura by train, then to the Landquart station, and then a regional train to Davos.  You can use the direct bus to Kura.  The approximate price for a second-class train ticket is fifty Swiss francs.  The resort has two stations: on the Platz and in Dorf.  Between them lies the 4-kilometer Promenade Street, where most hotels and shops are located.  Drivers need to take into account that driving along this main resort highway is one-way.  In the opposite direction, you can drive along Talstrasse, a quieter street. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Davos is in" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/611658.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Trails </h2><p>  Davos is surrounded by mountains, which almost reached three thousand meters in height.  These are Weissfluch (2844), Strelagrath, Schwarzhorn (Black Horn) and Jacobshorn.  All these slopes are covered with excellent ski slopes.  By the way, their total length is 320 kilometers, almost half of the routes of the ‚ÄúThree Valleys‚Äù, the famous French ski area.  The only minus of Davos is the fragmentation of the tracks, so traveling around without taking off your skis will not work.  Reviews are strongly advised to purchase a ski pass (in some hotels it is included in the room rate).  With it you can ride not only on the ski lifts and funicular, but also on the bus.  The ski area extends within the boundaries of 2844-1560 meters.  A large half of the slopes for people who are confidently skiing.  A third of the routes are for beginners.  The rest of the tracks are ‚Äúblack‚Äù, for aces.  Freestyle lovers are equipped with two snow parks. </p><h2>  Apr√®s ski </h2><p>  Where there is Davos, there is a holiday - skiers of the whole world are sure.  Because with the sunset the fun does not end.  Even those who have never been skiing and do not burn with this desire have something to do in Davos.  For desperate shopaholics, Promenade Street is a huge temptation.  Numerous baths, an indoor pool, spa treatments will improve your health.  And sledding, ice skating, snowshoe trekking in the mountains and even paragliding will be a good ski appendage.  Those who did not find enough physical exertion to day skiing can work out in the ultra-modern sports center.  Nightlife is more developed in Davos Platz.  There are casinos, night clubs, discos.  Night Davos - the photo clearly demonstrates this - it is an enchanting sight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Davos photo" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/611663.jpg" width="410"></div>

    <h2>  Summer resort </h2><p>  The peak season is in winter.  But when the snow melts, and with it the prices, a slightly different audience arrives in Davos (Switzerland).  Tourists who love mountain biking and hiking will find many well-equipped trails around the resort.  In Davos, there is a summer vacation promotion program - "Davos Inclusive".  If you stay in any resort hotel for at least one night, you will be given a Guest Card (Guest Card).  With it, you have the right to travel freely on all ski lifts and trains, not only in Davos, but also in neighboring Kloster, and you can also join guided tours in the mountains organized by a local travel agency. </p>
