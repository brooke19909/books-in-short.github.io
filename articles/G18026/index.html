This is the historically established and most well-maintained part of the protected natural area.

    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  Tsaritsyno (park), a photo of which will be presented below, is located on a mainly ravine and hilly area.  Since the ensemble is located on the territory of the former estates of the princes Kantemirov, he adopted some features of this estate.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe park is more than one hundred hectares.  The zone is limited from different angles.  From the east - the greenhouse complex, from the south and north-east - two large ravines, with the west - ponds. </p><h2>  Architectural features </h2><p>  Park "Tsaritsyno" is an important element of Russian Gothic.  The construction of the imperial residence took more than 20 years.  Matvey Kazakov and Vasily Bazhenov, the two most talented architects of their time, worked on it.  The ensemble is the largest object of the XVIII century in Europe in a pseudo-Gothic style.  Tsaritsyno Park and its unique architectural solutions had a strong influence on the new direction of Russian architecture.  Many buildings that have adopted some of its features are located in different parts of the former Russian Empire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsaritsyno park how to get" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448132.jpg" width="550"></div>

Tsaritsyno Park was one of the first such creations located outside the palace and park ensembles of St. Petersburg.  Its construction began at the end of the XVIII century.  Immediately after the empress acquired the Kantemir possessions, <span>Siberian cedars</span> and larch trees were planted in the park.  These trees were a gift for Catherine II from the miner Prokopiy Demidov.  Currently, larch trees grow in the park, however, these are already reconstructed and renewed plantings.  Vasily Bazhenov was responsible for the arrangement of the ensemble throughout the entire period of construction management.  The purposeful work of the architect has borne fruit.  The park became the crown of all the creativity of this extraordinary master.  At the same time, the activity of V.I.  Bazhenova turned out to be a great tragedy for him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsaritsyno park photo" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448133.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Reconstruction process </h2><p>  The basis of the personal park was birch trees.  It was such an avenue, as conceived by the architect, that became the main axis of the palace complex.  When working on the device of the landscape park, they tried to preserve the structural elements of those landings that remained from the time of the previous owners of the estate.  Thus, the "Geometric Garden" adjacent to the palace buildings was preserved without any changes.  It is a small classic parterre complex of low trees and trimmed bushes, has symmetrical paths.  The birch perspective and the hill plantings have also undergone minimal adjustments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The main part of the park is located south of the palace elements of the ensemble.  In it, the architect preferred to keep the composition from the interweaving of three alleys, as well as one straight and wide, which perpendicularly intersects these peculiar rays diverging from the palaces.  Two of them are still in the complex, and the avenue crossing them is now called Lipova.  The base trees of this composition were pine and birch.  These plants fit perfectly, as they do not form a dense shadow and have a light green color.  In certain places, following the then fashion, the architect decided to plant trees that had a dark color of foliage.  This category includes oaks and lindens.  Thanks to this, a contrast with light plantings was formed on the distant plans.  Vasily Bazhenov outlined the new borders with the help of birch groves, thereby expanding the park. </p><h2>  The emergence of creative conflicts </h2><p>  After almost 10 years, English gardeners Ion Murno and Francis Reed visited Tsaritsyno.  A serious misunderstanding arose between them and the <span>architect Bazhenov</span> .  They insisted on the reconstruction of the park and its partial cutting.  This proposal was based on the traditional approach to creating an English classical landscape complex, which implied the absence of dense landings and direct avenues.  Nevertheless, Russian parks of the 18th century more often maintained a regular layout structure.  It was in these elements that their peculiar features were.  A similar attribute was also considered intentional neglect of vegetation. </p><h2>  Changes made by P.S.  Valuev </h2><p>  Tsaritsyno Park turned into a popular place for festivities among Moscow privileged layers of the population at the beginning of the 18th century.  At that time, it consisted mainly of alternating numerous open lawns and clearings with light plantings.  Certain places were emphasized with the help of groups of trees with dark foliage.  Emperor Alexander I appointed Valuev to the post of head of Moscow gardens and palaces.  The fate of the ensemble was now directly related to its activities.  P.S. Valuev fell in love with these places and often came here to relax with his family in the summer.  For further improvement of the complex, the chief gardener of the greenhouse farm K. I. Ungebauer and the architect I. V. Egotov were involved.  These two masters approved the redevelopment of the park in accordance with new fashion trends. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsaritsyno metro park" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448135.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Further stages of redevelopment </h2><p>  During the reign of Emperor Paul I, the park experienced one of the periods of its withering.  There was no need to care for the plants, the garden began to dry out.  Some trees grew to such an extent that they began to close the view of the palace.  At the end of the 19th century, the complex gradually turned into a real forest.  They practically stopped caring for him.  For this reason, self-seeding thickets and bushes were formed.  Only at the beginning of the nineteenth century began work on the arrangement of the park.  However, these events were not of a regular nature.  In the 90s, the process of serious restoration of the ensemble began.  Later, the leadership of the project was taken by M.R. Morin, the complex was completely reconstructed, the landscape was restored. </p><h2>  Palace clearing </h2><p>  This is a wonderful place inside the Tsaritsyno complex, which still exists.  Over a period of time, bush planting in the corners continued to persist.  Then they were replaced by oaks.  Before the beginning of the 20th century, flowerbeds were regularly updated in its central region.  During the pond cleaning process, the bottom sludge was completely laid out in a clearing.  This significantly increased the level of its height.  For this reason, it seems that a glade hovering over buildings and landings.  In the XIX century <span>, a pine tree</span> was <span>planted</span> in its very center <span>,</span> which became a peculiar accent of the site.  Palace Glade is one of the most beautiful areas of the complex.  Often, she is honored to be called the best example of Russian landscape art. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Panda Park Tsaritsyno" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/448136.jpg" width="461"></div>
