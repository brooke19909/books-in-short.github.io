    <h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  The annual award is named after a Swedish engineer, industrialist and inventor.  Alfred Bernhard Nobel was its founder.  In addition, he owns a fund from which money is allocated for holding.  The history of the Nobel Prize begins in the twentieth century.  Since 1901, a special commission has determined the winners in such categories as physics, medicine and physiology, chemistry, literature and the defense of the world.  In 1969, a new science was added to the list.  Since then, the commission has also noted the best specialist in the field of economics.  Perhaps in the future there will be new categories, but at the moment there is no discussion of such an event. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nobel Prize Laureates" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/234047.jpg" width="364"></div>

She is associated with a very grim incident in the life of her founder.  As you know, Alfred Nobel was the <span>inventor of dynamite.</span>  When his brother Ludwig died in 1889, the journalist of one of the newspapers confused and indicated Alfred in the obituary.  The text called him a merchant of death.  Alfred Nobel was horrified by the prospect of remaining in the memory of mankind in a similar quality.  He began to think about what can be left behind, and composed a special testament.  With his help, he hoped to rectify the situation with dynamite. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the nobel prize" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13506/745570.jpg" width="515"></div>

    <h2>  Testament of Alfred Nobel </h2><p>  A significant text was invented and signed in 1895 in Paris.  According to the will, all remaining property after it, executors must exchange for securities, on the basis of which the fund will be created.  Interest from the resulting capital will go to prizes for scientists who have brought maximum benefit to humanity.  They must be divided into five parts: one for the one who discovered or invented something new in the field of physics, another for the most talented chemist, the third is for the best doctor, the fourth for the creator of the main literary work of the year dedicated to human ideals, and the fifth - for someone who can help establish peace on the planet, fighting for the reduction of armies, the destruction of slavery and the friendship of peoples.  According to the will, Nobel laureates in the first two categories are determined by the Royal Swedish <span>Academy of</span> Sciences.  The Royal Carolina Institute makes the choice in medicine, the Swedish Academy selects the literature, and the last one is a committee of five.  They are elected by the Norwegian Storting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nobel Prize, amount" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13506/745575.jpg" width="600"></div>

Initially, it was provided in crowns, the first amount was 150 thousand.  Now the size of the Nobel Prize has grown significantly and issue it in US dollars.  In recent years, it has been about a million.  As soon as the fund runs out of money, the premium will disappear.  The Nobel sum initially amounted to almost 32 million SEK, therefore, taking into account successful investments, all these years it only increased.  Nevertheless, recently, interest has not allowed to achieve a positive budget - the costs of the prize, the ceremony and the administration are too high.  A few years ago, the size of the Nobel Prize was decided to be reduced in order to ensure the stability of the fund in the future.  The administration is doing everything possible to maintain it as long as possible. </p><h2>  Family scandal </h2><p>  If history had gone differently, this award could never have been born.  The Nobel sum was so large that relatives could not reconcile with its loss.  After the death of the inventor, one of the other began legal proceedings, in which attempts were made to challenge the will.  Nobel owned a mansion in Nice and a house in Paris, laboratories in Russia, Finland, Italy, Germany and England, many workshops and factories.  The heirs wanted to divide all <span>this property</span> among themselves.  However, the Storting decided to recognize the will.  The solicitors of the deceased sold his property, the time and size of the Nobel Prize were approved.  Relatives got the amount of two million. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nobel Prize scientists" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13506/745582.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Foundation Establishment </h2><p>  The Nobel Prize, the history of which began with scandal, was first awarded only in <span>1900.</span>  The Royal Council held a meeting on June 29, 1900, at which all the details were considered and an official fund was approved.  For part of the money, the building in which it is located was purchased.  In December 1901, the first presentation event was held.  The size of the Nobel Prize of one hundred and fifty thousand became the first and most modest.  In 1968, the Swedish Bank proposed to nominate specialists in the field of economics.  <span>The Nobel Prize winners</span> for this field are selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.  It was first presented in 1969. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nobel Prize - History of Origin" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13506/745592.jpg" width="594"></div>

    <h2>  Rules of the ceremony </h2><p>  The will indicated only the size of the Nobel Prize and science, for the achievements in which scientists should be noted.  The rules for conducting and choosing it was necessary to draw up the administration of the fund.  They were developed at the beginning of the twentieth century and have since been practically unchanged.  According to the rules, a prize can be awarded to several people, but there can be no more than three.  If the applicant died at the time of the December ceremony, but was alive when the nominations were announced in October, he will receive the amount posthumously.  The Nobel Foundation does not award prizes, entrusting it to special committees for each direction.  Their members can seek help from scientists from various scientific fields.  The prize in the field of literature is given by the best specialists in linguistics.  The laureate in the world nomination is chosen with the advice of scientists in the field of philosophy, jurisprudence, political science, history, and is invited to discuss <span>public figures.</span>  Sometimes a specialist may personally offer the applicant.  This right belongs to former laureates and a member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences.  All candidates are approved until February 1 of the year when the award will be held.  Until September, each proposal is evaluated and discussed.  Thousands of specialists can participate in the process.  When the preparation ends, the committees send approved candidates to the official authorities, where the Nobel Prize scientists work, who will make the final decision.  In the field of physics, chemistry and economic sciences, the main groups are representatives of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, each of which has twenty-five people.  Fifty participants from the Caroline Institute are involved in medicine.  Literature - eighteen scientists from the Swedish Academy.  The Peace Prize is awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee.  In October, the latest statement is adopted, which is announced at a press conference in Stockholm around the world, accompanied by comments on the reasons for each decision.  By December 10, laureates and members of their families are invited to the ceremony. </p>
