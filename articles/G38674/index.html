In the Redmi lineup there are three gadgets that have attracted the attention of a domestic buyer with a modern design and a good "stuffing".  2016 was a triumph for the company.  All models made their debut successfully and literally in the first stages broke into the top sellers.  They undoubtedly deserve a detailed description, but within the framework of this article, the reader will be able to get acquainted with the characteristics of Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime.  The price of this gadget does not exceed $ 200, which, of course, is an advantage that allows you to compete with other brands.  In addition to attractive prices, the buyer will be interested in hardware.  Many users are already used to the fact that developers in budget devices use MediaTek processors, but in this smartphone the manufacturer installed Qualcomm and as many as three gigabytes of RAM.  What came of this, let's understand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi 4 prime specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2046381.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime: design review </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, the appearance of any phone plays an important role.  It is he who lures the buyer.  The designers of this model did a great job.  First of all, I would like to draw attention to the materials of the case.  The panels of the device are made of solid metal, which gives the user a sense of reliability.  The frame at the ends is polished, has beveled edges.  In these details, there is a resemblance to the "apple" products.  But you shouldn‚Äôt write down this in minuses, since today most Chinese manufacturers copy the design of the flagships of famous brands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime smartphone did not receive comments about the assembly.  All parts are perfectly fitted.  There are no creaks and crunches.  All gaps are within the normal range, so at first glance it is difficult to say that the buyer is a representative of the budget segment.  However, the most demanding users could still find a small drawback - a tangible transition between the metal cover and plastic inserts in the upper and lower parts of the case.  But you can‚Äôt call it critical, especially if you remember how much the smartphone costs. </p><p>  The manufacturer presented several colors to choose from.  For example, dark gray is more suitable for men.  The silver version can be called universal.  It looks equally harmonious in both female and male hands.  However, the beautiful half of humanity still prefers Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime Gold.  The golden case looks gentle, but majestic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi 4 prime gold" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2046384.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Not the last role is played by the dimensions of the phone.  If we compare devices with the same displays, then this model can rightfully be called compact, due to its small width and height (141.3 √ó 69.6 mm).  What about the thickness?  It is fully consistent with modern standards, equal to 8.9 mm.  Such dimensions provide maximum convenience while operating the smartphone.  Owners do not have to use two hands, since even on the go, everything can be done with one.  The mass of the phone is 156 g, of course, is not the lightest device, but you can not attribute it to the "heavyweights". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  70% of the front panel is occupied by the screen.  Above it, the developers brought sensors, a speaker and a camera.  Under the screen is a standard control panel.  It has three keys with the usual notation.  But the buyer should be aware of one thing - these buttons are not highlighted during operation.  This does not cause many inconveniences, however, attention must be paid. </p><p>  In its price category, Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime (price - about $ 180) stands out due to the rear panel.  As already mentioned, it is made of metal.  At the bottom there is a company logo, at the top there is a camera ‚Äúpeephole‚Äù, a scanner and a flash.  All these elements have a round shape, so that they harmoniously fit into the overall concept. </p><p>  In principle, no changes were made to the arrangement of connectors and mechanical keys.  A hybrid tray for SIM cards is displayed on the left side, a ‚Äúswing‚Äù on / off switch for changing the volume and a button with the help of which the device is turned on and locked.  The bottom end is occupied by a speaker, a USB port and a microphone.  On the top there is an infrared sensor and a mini-jack. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi 4 prime 32gb" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2046382.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  A few words about the screen </h2><p>  Now it's time to consider the detailed specifications of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime.  First, let's deal with the features of the display.  The screen in this model is definitely an advantage.  With a 5-inch size, the manufacturer offers the user Full HD quality, and this will undoubtedly please many.  It is worth noting that the front panel is covered with 2.5D glass.  The image is characterized by high contrast and good color reproduction.  There are no comments on density, since the resolution of the display is as much as 441 ppi.  Such an indicator in this price category is worthy of respect.  With brightness problems will not arise at all.  Its range is more than enough to work outdoors in sunny weather.  The viewing angles did not disappoint.  Even with a strong tilt, the image remains almost unchanged.  The sensor is sensitive, it works clearly.  The only thing is, some users have noticed that in winter, in the cold, you sometimes have to press twice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone xiaomi redmi 4 prime" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2046383.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Memory shots </h2><p>  The capabilities of the cameras did not disappoint the owners of Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime.  The characteristics of the main are quite consistent with modern requirements.  It is based on a 13-megapixel sensor with f / 2.2 aperture.  The highest level of detail is achieved in the center of the frame, and a faint blur appears at the edges.  But by and large, photos are obtained of proper quality.  The dynamic range is optimally maintained.  With poor lighting, the clarity of the picture decreases, but all objects are clearly distinguishable, no noise.  Most all users praise the "Panorama" and HDR.  Video recording is carried out with a resolution of 1080p.  There are no special comments on the quality. </p><p>  The selfie camera is equipped with a 5-megapixel module.  The menu has different modes.  However, it is not possible to improve the color of photos even when choosing the highest settings, they remain somewhat muffled. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime: hardware specifications </h2><p>  It's time to talk about the performance of this model.  The ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of the gadget is the chipset for eight cores of the Qualcomm brand.  The manufacturer for the smartphone chose the Snapdragon 625 model. The processor is manufactured according to the 14 nm manufacturing process.  And this indicates that the hardware platform is energy efficient and quite powerful.  Computing elements of the Cortex-A53 during the operation of the gadget are able to increase the clock frequency up to 2000 MHz, thanks to which the original firmware Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime works smoothly, without freezes and lags. </p><p>  As the coprocessor, the developers chose the Adreno 506 accelerator. It allows you to quickly launch modern games at high graphics settings.  And this suggests that in its segment the gadget is the undisputed leader. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi 4 prime price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2046386.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  It is impossible to evaluate the real performance of the gadget without indicators of the amount of RAM.  Even the best hardware will not work correctly with a small RAM.  The developers took this criterion seriously by installing three gigabytes of RAM in the Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime 32Gb.  The type of memory is LPDDR3.  The device is able to easily cope with several running applications.  Owners can play games and simultaneously watch videos, while opening, for example, five tabs in the browser.  Based on this, we can safely say that the smartphone will cope with multitasking. </p><p>  How much ROM is in Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime?  32Gb!  Well, that's pretty good.  Only, about 10 GB of storage is already occupied by system files.  The undemanding user of the remaining 20 will be quite enough for work.  And those who want to increase memory are invited to use the drive, however, then they will have to abandon the second SIM card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi 4 prime review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2046385.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  System platform </h2><p>  The Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime smartphone is under the control of the sixth Android.  It was not surprising to anyone that the manufacturer used the proprietary MIUI 8 interface on top of the system. Now the user has access to such functions as duplication of applications, screenshot of a web page, and built-in antivirus.  As for the latter, the application not only checks the system for viruses, but also monitors the condition of the battery and RAM, and also controls applications that run in the background. </p><h2>  Battery Life </h2><p>  Do not disappoint the owners of Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime battery specifications?  Definitely not!  In the device, the developers installed a 4100 mAh battery.  In the talk mode, the device can work up to 19 hours. If the user connects to the Internet for surfing, the device will need to be recharged after 15 hours. And you can watch high quality video for almost 8 hours. It is recommended to use a power supply with 5V / 2A output to charge the smartphone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi 4 prime firmware" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2046387.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  The main characteristics of the phone are considered, now it's time to find out what users think about the next "masterpiece" of Chinese production.  We draw attention to the fact that different reviews are presented on the network, but most of them highlight the advantages of the model.  A few comments still got Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime: </p><ul><li>  The firmware, although it has stable operation, but you can notice inaccuracies in the translation, and this leads to difficulties in setting up the gadget. </li><li>  Photos taken with the front camera distort color. </li><li>  The rear panel does not look monolithic, as there is a noticeable transition between the plastic inserts and the metal cover. </li></ul><p>  These shortcomings cannot be considered quite significant, since all of them are more than covered by the optimum quality-price ratio. </p><p>  What did the owners write down the strengths of this model?  It: </p><ul><li>  Long life on a single charge. </li><li>  Great performance. </li><li>  The presence of a fingerprint scanner. </li><li>  High screen resolution. </li><li>  Beautiful design and metal case. </li></ul><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Phone Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime turned out as balanced as possible.  It is sold at an affordable price, which cannot but please the buyer.  The manufacturer installed a decent ‚Äústuffing‚Äù on the device, which interested both the younger generation and older people. </p>
