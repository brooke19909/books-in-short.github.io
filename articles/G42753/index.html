First you need to decide on the color scheme, usually it resonates with the color of the decoration of the gala hall, then think over the size of the structure and the material for the decor.  Now it‚Äôs easy to find special, ready-made basics for the chest in handicraft stores, you just need to add decor to them - and the accessory is ready, but you can use improvised materials to save money.  To create a do-it-yourself chest for money for a wedding, you need the following: </p><ol><li>  Cardboard box of the required size. </li><li>  Glue gun and hot glue. </li><li>  PVA glue. </li><li>  Decorative paper for scrapbooking. </li><li>  Whatman paper. </li><li>  Satin ribbon. </li><li>  Double-sided tape. </li><li>  Decorative flowers or other elements. </li><li>  Scissors, ruler, pencil. </li></ol><h2>  Manufacturing tips </h2><ol><li>  First you need to modify the top of the box, for this you need to draw an arc on the side walls, you can circle a small plate. </li><li>  Next, you need to retreat five centimeters down and draw two parallel connecting lines along the entire length of the wide side of the box. </li><li>  The upper part must be cut exactly in an arc, to the wall. </li><li>  So that the lid can open, they make a scrolling, for this you need a non-writing sharp pen and a ruler.  On the inner side of the lid you need to squeeze out even longitudinal strips: measure with a ruler 1.5 cm from the edge, then fix its position and draw a deep line on the lid by pressing the handle.  In this way, the entire upper part is scored. </li><li>  Then it is required to cut the drawn lines on the wide part of the box to the wall, to scout a few more stripes on it. </li><li>  The next step is the fastening of the parts.  The upper and side parts must be fixed with masking tape.  All excess cardboard is recommended to be removed. </li><li>  A hole is made in the lid slightly larger than the width of the wall of a standard money envelope and a small strip of cardboard is removed, for the convenience of closing. </li><li>  Now you need to start wrapping the base of the chest with a Whatman paper.  PVA glue should be applied to the box walls, whatman stripes should be slightly wider than the base.  The sheets should be applied carefully, gently pressing and avoiding bumps. </li><li>  The next step is the decoration of the white base with decorative paper, gluing according to the principle described in paragraph 8, but you need to use hot melt adhesive, applying it to the edge of the workpiece. </li><li>  We decorate the part of the cardboard box cut in paragraph 7 with paper and glue it to the inner wall, leaving a small ledge.  This strip will help close the lid tightly.  The inside can be pasted over with white corrugated paper.  DIY wedding money box is finished!  It remains the case for the decor. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="trendymods.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cardboard box treasury with hinged lid" class="if uuid-2267841" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71487/2267841.jpg"></div><p>  To decorate the outside of the accessory, you can use flowers from satin ribbon, foamiran or silk, as well as all kinds of cutting out of thick scrap paper, greens, half beads and rhinestones.  First you need to collect the composition on the table, you can even take a photo of the final, liked option, and then transfer the elements to the chest one by one.  You can complete the decoration with a small satin ribbon bow at the bottom of the chest lid.  You can also do without decor, limiting yourself to a small element on the lid of the chest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Heart shaped wedding chest </h2><p>  The treasury does not have to be made rectangular, there are many ideas for creating an accessory of a non-standard shape.  For example, in the form of a heart.  For such a manufacture of such a chest, you will need the following: </p><ol><li>  Isolon sheet, 10 mm thick. </li><li>  Satin fabric. </li><li>  Lace or guipure. </li><li>  Ribbon "Chanel" (in tone with lace) 1.2 cm wide. </li><li>  Ready-made flowers in fabric color. </li><li>  Fatin. </li><li>  Beads and rhinestones. </li><li>  Glue gun and hot glue. </li><li>  Ruler, scissors, needle pins. </li><li>  Thread and needle. </li></ol><h2>  How to make a wedding money chest </h2><p>  First you need to print a template in the form of a heart.  Fix the workpiece with pins on the isolon and cut two identical parts.  Then, a hole in the form of a circle with a diameter of 14 cm is made in one of the blanks. The next step is the preparation of the side walls of the treasury, the length of the segment is 9.5 cm, the length is slightly more than 115 cm. The side parts should be halved and fixed with hot glue to the base with a hole moving from top to bottom.  After fulfilling the previous conditions, it is necessary to attach the remaining part of the heart and cut off the protruding, excess material.  Then you need to make a hole for money envelopes, approximate parameters: 10.5 x 2 cm, the final size depends on the postcards. </p><h2>  Stage decoration </h2><p>  Next, you need to proceed to the decor of the workpiece with fabric and lace.  The sides and hearts are cut out of fabric and glued to the base with hot glue.  To prepare the guipure details, a piece of fabric is folded in half, then halves of hearts are applied and cut out, slightly letting go from the edge.  Sidewalls cut out of lace are fixed on a pin and sewn along the edge with a seam, holes are cut.  All seams and joints are decorated with decorative braid, then a slot is processed.  For a round hole, it is necessary to prepare a round cover that is slightly larger in diameter than the hole.
