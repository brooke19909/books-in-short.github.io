    <p>  Accumulative life insurance is more developed abroad.

    <p>  It is possible to choose the insurance period (maximum - 10 years).  At the end of the contract, the client is paid the full amount of contributions with a benefit of 40%.  In the event of the death of the client, the paid contributions shall be returned to the beneficiary.  All the money that a person pays is protected from inflation.  Thus, everyone gets the opportunity to plan their financial future. </p><h2>  ASKO </h2><p>  Accumulative life insurance is becoming in demand all over the world.

    <p>  The savings program is fully protected from taxation.  Until the money is returned to the client, all contributions made are considered the property of the insurance company.  Therefore, material obligations to the state are completely absent.  The client of the insurance company can be any adult citizen of the Russian Federation no older than 55 years.  Upon termination of the contract, the policyholder receives the full amount of contributions with a fee of 17%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  "Rosgosstrakh Life" </h2><p>  The facility also offers beneficial endowment life insurance.  In the ranking of companies in 2016, Rosgosstrakh took one of the first places.  The program that the organization offers has several advantages.  The client, as well as his relatives can get financial protection in unforeseen situations (death of the insured, illness, accident).  In addition, it is possible to form targeted savings for studies, the acquisition of real estate or a vehicle.  The insurance program allows you to plan expenses correctly.  The accumulated funds are indexed annually, which helps protect them from inflation. </p>

    <p>  How can I get cumulative life insurance?  The rating of companies includes organizations with which it is possible to conclude an agreement on loyal terms.  If we consider Rosgosstrakh Life, then any adult citizen of the Russian Federation no older than 70 can become a client.  The term of the contract is from 5 to 22 years.  At the time of the transaction, the client has the opportunity to choose the mode of payment of insurance premiums - monthly, quarterly or annually.  Upon termination of the contract, the policyholder receives back the full amount with a fee of up to 10%. </p><h2>  Russian Standard Insurance </h2><p>  The institution offers a wide range of insurance programs, including endowment life insurance.  The organization added to the rating of Russian companies by chance.  An agreement with an insurance company can be an excellent alternative to a deposit.  Funds deposited by the client are reliably protected from inflation.  This means that the client can be sure that the money will not only be saved, but also increased.  In addition, the policyholder will receive payments in the event of an accident or illness. </p><p>  Any Russian citizen who has reached the age of 18 years can become a client of the Russian Standard Insurance company.  You can conclude a contract at any office of the institution.  In real time, you can also apply for a cumulative life insurance policy.  The rating of <span>insurance companies</span> for the most part includes organizations that have convenient web resources for customer service.  Clients of the ‚ÄúRussian Standard‚Äù can at any time log into their online account and specify information on savings. </p><h2>  Sberbank Insurance </h2><p>  Sberbank is the most sought after financial institution in Russia.  Offers organization and endowment life insurance.  The institution replenished the rating of companies because it represents rather favorable terms of the transaction.  In addition, several savings insurance programs are offered at once.  ‚ÄúFirst Capital‚Äù is a product that involves the accumulation of funds for children for adulthood.  The deal can be executed immediately after the birth of the child.  The heir will receive the full amount of accumulated funds upon reaching 18 years. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúHow to Salary‚Äù insurance program is also popular.  The bottom line is that the client pays the fees until he goes on a well-deserved rest.  Then the payments are already beginning to come to him.  Such endowment insurance is especially beneficial for people who work informally.  Paying an insurance company can be a great addition to a small pension.  When passing away at the accumulation stage, relatives receive the amount of remuneration. </p><h2>  "VSK insurance" </h2><p>  This institution also offers endowment life insurance.  In the ranking of companies providing services in St. Petersburg in 2016, the organization took first place.  The plus is that not only citizens of the Russian Federation can be insured, but also foreigners permanently residing in the country.  Under the funded life insurance program, a child older than 12 months can be insured.  Payment of remuneration is carried out in the case of an agreed period or before the death of the client. </p>

    <p>  At the request of the insured, an item relating to health may be additionally included in the contract.  Moreover, the amount of regular contributions will be slightly higher. </p><p>  Cumulative life insurance from the company "VSK" has its own characteristics.  The client has the opportunity to independently choose the size of guaranteed savings.  This is a profitable investment.  The funds are indexed, therefore they are reliably protected from inflation.  Contributions to the client must be made quarterly or semiannually throughout the insurance period (from 5 to 20 years).  The minimum insurance amount is 150 thousand rubles.  You can conclude a transaction in foreign currency (dollars or euros). </p><h2>  Metlife </h2><p>  For a sufficiently long period, cumulative life insurance is issued.  The rating of companies with annuity payments should be studied at least in order to be sure of the exact receipt of remuneration at the end of the contract.  It is no coincidence that many customers decide to cooperate with foreign companies.  One of the most sought after foreign insurance organizations is Metlife.  The company has been operating in the market for more than 15 years.  Offices are also located in the CIS countries. </p>

    <p>  Cumulative insurance program called Prestige is popular.  The beneficiary can be both an adult and a child.  The client has the opportunity to independently choose the insurance amount, which will be divided into equal parts.  The client can make contributions monthly or annually.  The accumulated money is paid at the end of the contract or in the event of the death of the insured. </p><p>  The Prestige program is a reliable financial foundation that allows you to prepare for important events in the future.  The calculation of the estimated cost of insurance can be made in real time on the official website of the company. </p><h2>  VTB Insurance </h2><p>  The organization also offers cumulative life insurance on favorable terms.  In the ranking of companies in 2015, the company entered the top ten.  Profitable programs for children and adults are offered.  The ‚ÄúReserve Fund‚Äù product is popular.  Already the first installment makes it possible to get the maximum financial assistance in an emergency.  In addition, each client has the opportunity to receive 13% of the invested amount back in the form of a tax deduction. </p><p>  The Reserve Fund allows you to create legal protection for financial savings.  Contributions paid by the client under an insurance company agreement cannot be withdrawn by court order. </p><p>  The Personal Plan is another popular endowment insurance program.  With the help of regular payments, the client can form personal capital, which will be paid by a certain date. </p><h2>  How to make the right choice? </h2><p>  Accumulative life insurance can become really beneficial.  Rating companies, reviews about them - this information is worth exploring before settling on a particular institution.  It is worth considering that the contract will have to be concluded long-term.  Preference should be given to insurance companies that have been operating in the market for more than 10 years. </p>

    <p>  Be sure to pay attention to the authorized capital of a particular organization.  A company is considered reliable if this figure exceeds 200 million rubles.  It is worth paying attention to the free assets of the insurance institution.  The more material assets the company has, the higher its solvency. </p>
