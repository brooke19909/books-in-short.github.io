    <p>  Most mosaic lovers choose to build standard sets consisting of 1000-5000 elements.  What about assembling a picture consisting of 18,000 parts?  It was from so many elements that the world's largest puzzle was assembled, the first to receive this honorary title.  The giant game was launched by Ravensburger, one of the world's giants among mosaic manufacturers.  The puzzle is called At the Waterhole - "At a watering hole."  The painting depicts African animals who came to a pond to quench their thirst.  These are elephants, giraffes, zebras, rhino and many other animals and birds.  When assembled, the mosaic has dimensions of 276x192 cm. The image is quite colorful and attractive.  What is especially nice, everyone can buy a giant puzzle and try to assemble it today.  Its average cost is about $ 266. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Life (Educa) </h2>

    <p>  At the Waterhole puzzle record was broken by an assembly kit released by Educa under the name Life.  This mosaic consists of 24,000 elements, and the size of the assembled painting is 428x157 cm. The picture of the puzzle can be considered indefinitely.  This is the ocean, various animals, yachts with bright sails, balloons, planets.  The painting was painted by artist Royce McClure.  The master admits that he simply combined several of his own paintings to create such a large-scale canvas.  As soon as the largest puzzle in the world received a certificate from the Guinness Book of Records and went on sale, many mosaic assembly lovers began their own competitions.  The minimum amount of time required to build this giant is 150 hours.  But since even the most avid puzzle enthusiasts devote their hobbies on average from 1 to 4 hours daily, many of them took weeks and months to assemble Life mosaics.  Today everyone can buy this giant puzzle for only $ 300. </p><h2>  Double Retrospect (Ravensburger) </h2>

The author of the picture, Kate Heyring, said that he was inspired by street graffiti in New York.  As a result, it was his work that Ravensburger chose for the serial production of the new giant puzzle.  Having correctly connected 32,000 elements with each other, you can admire 32 avant-garde paintings in separate squares, not connected in any way.  It is worth noting that a total of 6 colors were used in the mosaic, and this only complicates the assembly process.  Size of the collected picture: 544x192 cm. Free the whole room before you start collecting!  The cost of this game is only 270 dollars. </p><h2>  Wild Life (Educa) </h2>

    <p>  What is the biggest puzzle in the world today?  All mosaic size records can be safely considered a competition between competing companies Ravensburger and Educa.  While Educa wins, the last novelty from which was the Wild Life puzzle - Wildlife.  Mosaic consists of 33600 elements.  The size of the collected picture is 570x157 cm. The image is fascinating - in the greenery of the jungle we can observe a variety of animals.  There are royal lions, and majestic elephants, and mischievous monkeys, as well as whole flocks of bright tropical birds and butterflies.  This is the case when the assembled puzzle can become a real decoration of any interior.  The cost of an assembly kit is a little over $ 300. </p><h2>  Unofficial records in the world of puzzles </h2><p>  Manufacturers of giant mosaics claim that puzzle lovers themselves are pushing for the creation of assembly kits consisting of tens of thousands of elements.  People from all over the world regularly share their own achievements in assembling giants.  The secret is that you can assemble a giant mosaic from several standard ones.  The most likely success is if you purchase several puzzles of the same manufacturer of the same size from the same series.  Some lovers prefer to simply mix together several sets of 1000-3000 elements and only after that proceed with the assembly of individual paintings.  Often the results of their mental and manual labor mosaic fans glue and hang on the walls.  It is for such people that the biggest puzzles in the world are created.  How many details to choose: 18000 or 33000 is not so important.  As a result, the collector should get a full-fledged work of art, perfect for decorating your own home. </p><h2>  Is it difficult to assemble puzzles-champions? </h2>

    <p>  Getting to know the biggest puzzles in the world makes sense if you are confidently assembling sets of 3000-5000 elements.  For a novice in the world of mosaics, assembling a painting consisting of tens of thousands of parts can be an unrealistic task.  The most common two methods for assembling puzzles.  In the first case, you should start with the frame, gradually moving to the center of the picture.  The second option is to disassemble the details according to the main colors and gradually collect individual fragments of each shade.  Be prepared for the fact that the biggest picture from the puzzle will be assembled in a few weeks, if not months.  It is also important to prepare a suitable surface for assembly.  Pay attention to the size of the finished picture, usually it is indicated on the package.  To build a giant mosaic you will have to free the floor of the room, after which you can proceed to the puzzle. </p>
