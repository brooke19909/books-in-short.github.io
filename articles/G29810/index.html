    <p>  A unique symbol of the city is a monument to the <span>wife of a sailor,</span> called the Virgin Lloret, or Don Marinere.  It was established for the millennium of the city, which was celebrated in 1966.  The rock, on which you can see a sculpture by Ernest Maragall, is located on Lloret Beach.

For many centuries, men went to sea, and women waited with hope and anxiety for their return to shore. </p><h2>  Sculpture museum </h2><p>  The open-air sculpture museum is the cemetery in Lloret de Mar.  At the same time, ancient tombstones and familial luxurious crypts look beautiful and sad, many of which were created by Catalan architects Josin Puzh-i-Kadafalk and Bonaventure Conil.  The cemetery is divided into six sections.  Walking along its quiet alleys, many tourists visiting architectural monuments, made in the style of the Art Nouveau school of Antonio Gaudi.  The project of the cemetery, one of the most beautiful in the world, was created in 1896 by the architect Joaquin Artau. </p><p>  Every traveler will find a fascinating activity in Lloret de Mar.
