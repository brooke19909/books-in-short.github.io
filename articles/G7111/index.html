And for this it‚Äôs worth understanding the essence of the legend that covers these seals with a mystical curtain and creates an alluring halo of mystery.

    <p>  <strong>Seals of King Solomon.</strong>  <strong>Legend</strong> </p><p>  If you believe the legend, then this seal was created by the king, known at all times, to command the spirits that were called gins in his homeland.  And after applying this sign to the well-known signet ring made of gold, the king was able not only to command the genie, but also to talk to animals. </p><p>  Speaking specifically about the signet, then the versions diverge.  According to some assumptions, besides the seal of King Solomon, the ring also contained the name of God and precious stones.  Another assumption is that instead of the divine </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Seal of King Solomon how many triangles" class="if" height="488" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6810/220539.jpg" width="366"></div>  the name there was a star of David (we will dwell on this later).

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At all times, this seal had the most diverse meanings and interpretations, among which was the combination in the press of Hellas, Egypt and Mesopotamia, which are plainly hidden in the ornaments.  Christians said that the press depicts seven centuries of world history, which, naturally, were ruled by archangels and seven planets.  Muslims did not bother much about its meaning and simply attributed to it the properties of making a person wiser (which, in fact, distinguished King Solomon).  At all times, these seals were used wherever possible and impossible.  Books, household items, architecture, labyrinths, jewelry and much more had a hidden or explicit seal of King Solomon. </p><p>  <strong>Seal of King Solomon.</strong>  <strong>How many triangles and what drawing construction</strong> </p><p>  The structure of the seal of King Solomon in the modern version has one common element - this is the star of David, which is inscribed in a circle.  Between the rays of the star are points.  If you believe the legend, then in their place were precious stones.  Now these are either dots or other symbols, which are determined by the intentions of adepts using the seals of King Solomon.  The letters that came to us from the time of the king himself were literally in red thread.  Accordingly, there are two triangles in the star of David, and therefore, as a rule, a six-pointed star is located in the press.  But in some cases, as mentioned earlier, they used a <span>seven-pointed star.</span> </p><p>  <strong>There is no universality</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the famous seal of king solomon" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6810/220538.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <p>  Each famous seal of King Solomon was not universal.  Its purpose was directly determined by the content that the mystic put into letters and drawings.  This image is applied, as a rule, on circles made of noble metals (or metals corresponding to the planets to which the magician refers).  In the old days they were made by hand, but now they can be purchased from masters.  In this case, you will already receive specific letters, and printing can be done as decorations, goldfields or wall plates made of stone.  In general, most of the modern seals have already changed so much that it is very difficult to see the original in them, but their semantic load and strength have only increased with centuries of existence. </p>
