This is the work of bold craftswomen who can afford to show imagination, go beyond the usual and abandon templates.  This technique has turned an orderly patchwork into delicious grace and full drive.  Products in the style of crazy quilt really drive you crazy with their colors and audacity. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crazy Quilt" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41630/1363662.jpg" width="500"></div>  Patchwork miracle </h2><p>  Quilt is a product made using the patchwork technique (stitching small pieces of fabric).  Crazy quilt consists of a combination of fabrics of different colors and textures, which are combined in combinations not subject to logic.  All <span>this abundance is</span> decorated with rich decor, the elements of which are at first glance incompatible with each other.  Such a miracle cannot be entered into any framework.  <span>This is a firework that</span> does not leave anyone indifferent. </p><h2>  The history of the technology of "crazy shreds" </h2><p>  The Crazy Quilt technique has an extraordinary story.  It is known that the British newspaper The Carpet Trade and Review in 1880 officially spoke of him for the first time as an art therapy for the mentally ill. </p><p>  It was 1876 in the yard.  An event was held in America to mark the 100th anniversary of the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence.  Here, for the first time, Americans saw amazing Japanese ceramics, fabrics and kimonos.  The latter were embroidered insanely beautiful.  Graceful silk clothes were decorated with colorful patches of cloth with asymmetric motifs and embroidery.  This struck the imagination of American lovers of needlework.  They immediately wanted to try a new direction and transfer it to the quilt technique that was popular at that time, according to which the craftswomen sewed silk shreds and decorated them with unusual embroidery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  For quilt technology, this was something new, because in the traditional form of needlework, everything was regulated, and products were created according to certain schemes.  The innovative style has become a riot of lace, rags and ribbons.  Since that time, needlework magazines began to call it the "Japanese patchwork", and a little later - Crazy Quilt. </p><h2>  Combination of incongruous </h2><p>  At the dawn of development, the tone of the technique was set by the combination of silk, satin, tulle with cumbersome <span>embroidery for ribbons, ribbons,</span> lace, an abundance of buttons and beads.  The style was influenced by the complex Japanese embroidery technique ‚Äúsashiko‚Äù, as well as stereotypes about the activities of women of that time.  The ideal wife was to create masterpieces of needlework.  This has been taught to girls since childhood.  The first samples of Crazy Quilt were filled with embroidery to such an extent that the base fabric was not always visible.  This has become a kind of competition in craftsmanship between needlewomen. </p>

    <h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  So, you've seen enough of Crazy Quilt.  Embroidery, fabrics, decorative elements excite your imagination.  Many needlewomen are familiar with creative throwing when they want to create something similar, but it is not clear which way to approach work.  Create a folder on your computer desktop with samples of which you are delighted.  There should not be too many of them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Decide what exactly you want to create.  Let it be not just a test, but a small product, for example, a wallet or a fragment with which you can decorate your favorite thing.  So there will be motivation for work. </p><h2>  What do you need? </h2><p>  This technique is poetry for craftswomen who never throw anything away. </p><p>  What you need for Crazy Quilt: </p><ul><li>  all kinds of shreds and small cuts of fabrics, even edges and trimmings; </li><li>  tapes; </li><li>  buttons </li><li>  beads; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  fragments of embroidery and knitting; </li><li>  brooches; </li><li>  charms; </li><li>  needles </li><li>  sewing machine (optional); </li><li>  ruler; </li><li>  chalk or pencil. </li></ul><h2>  Selection of the color scheme of the product </h2><p>  Fabrics are the essentials for Crazy Quilt.  For beginners, any trim that is in the house is suitable.  If you want to do technology seriously, we advise you to buy a color wheel.  With information about him begin publications devoted to needlework.  These are elementary truths for the craftswomen.  You can trust intuition, but you must study this question. </p><p>  The choice of the color gamut of the product should be taken seriously.  One inappropriately added item can ruin all the work.  Never include fabric that seems inappropriate in the product due to lack of replacement. </p>

    <h2>  Pattern </h2><p>  Now there is a lot of information on assembling products in this technique.  It is difficult to fit into the framework of one article.  The most convenient option is the planned crazy quilt.  There are no specific rules, but there is freedom for imagination.  You can safely leave the slices open, and this place will be blocked by lace, ribbon, braid or other decorative element.  If desired, it can generally be left open. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For work in this technique, the base is always used.  As a rule, this is a thin calico, but there may be another fabric.  You either draw a pattern yourself, simply dividing your base into blocks, or looking for something suitable in the works of other craftswomen.  Divide it into fragments and number them.  Sew items according to the numbers on the pattern. </p><h2>  Embroidery </h2><p>  Workshops on decorative seams are also quite a lot.  Thanks to them, you can learn.  <span>Machine embroidery</span> looks good in products <span>,</span> but manual work is nevertheless more elegant. </p><p>  Before embarking on embroidery, it should be remembered that it is impossible to make fastening knots here.  Insert the double thread into the needle.  The edge on which the loop formed by the fold should be longer.  For the first time, enter the needle from the front of the work.  Start embroidering on your own.  Introducing it, do not push right through to the end, but bring its end in the same place only to yourself.  Pull the needle and thread and tip into the loop.  Pull the thread, so you fixed it on the canvas without a knot. </p><p>  What to do if the thread ends?  Enter the tip of the needle inside the product, and move in the opposite direction.  Walk it between the stitches and put the needle on the face of the product.  Do this as far as possible so that the distance exceeds the length of the remaining thread.  Spread the fabric, and the thread itself goes inside. </p><p>  The most popular decorative seams using the Crazy Quilt technique: </p><ul><li>  <em>The goat is double</em> .  To emphasize the clarity of the lines, a double seam option is suitable.  Vary the stitch size. </li><li>  <em>The chain</em> .  You can perform it with both thin and thick thread.  A great option for contour quilting, as well as for patterns that consist of continuous lines. </li><li>  <em>Chain with leaves</em> .  Diagonal links resemble leaflets.  The pattern may be narrower or wider.  Beads can be included in the work. </li><li>  <em>Plumezh</em> .  With a seam with an elegant name, you can quickly quilt the product.  It is easy to execute and will appeal to beginners. </li><li>  <em>Basting</em> .  Most likely, you came across this seam.  The easiest way to quickly overcast the edge of any product or application.  In quilting, the seam lends airiness to the work.  There is a "closed" and "open" option.  Use them depending on the desired effect. </li></ul>

    <h2>  We create a crazy quilt with our own hands: a master class ‚ÄúPatch from shreds‚Äù </h2><p>  Let's figure out what is needed for a crazy quilt.  For beginner craftswomen, to practice, any shreds that are in the house are suitable.  The main thing is their compatibility with each other in color.  You will also need cotton fabric.  She will play the role of the basis of the product.  Prepare another small piece of slanting inlay and batting.  Using the example of this simple master class, you will understand the principle of working with elements of crazy quilt. </p><ol><li>  From a white cloth we cut out the basis of the product.  We cut out the pentagon from the patch we liked and attach it to the middle.  And right away you can move on to the Crazy Quilt technique. </li><li>  We take a piece of fabric of a contrasting color and attach it face down, without cutting, directly to one of the faces of the pentagon.  This is a technique for the lazy, so we will cut in the process.  The line should go directly over the one that we did on the first patch. </li><li>  Unscrew a piece of fabric face up and use the chalk and ruler to draw the next part. </li><li>  In this way, we attach pieces of fabric until we fill them with the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe future tack.  In this case, a clockwise pattern will look good.  Crazy quilt is ready. </li><li>  We pass to tailoring of a tack.  Cut the back of the product and a layer of batting. </li><li>  We add the three elements of the future tack together.  We put the reverse side face down, batting on top, and then the part with the application facing up.  We cut the corners, rounding the product. </li><li>  We sweep a <span>slanting inlay</span> to the <span>tack</span> and sew on a sewing machine. </li><li>  We make a loop from a piece of tape.  Sew to the product.  In order to properly fasten the elements of the tack, we sew the product through and through several times.  Unusual tack is ready.  Crazy Quilt is a performance technique that will surprise guests in your home. </li></ol><h2>  Crazy quilt in the interior </h2><p>  Energetic appliances will definitely fit into your interior.  It can be a tablecloth, <span>decorative pillows, a</span> plaid on an armchair.  Such things will add zest, transform and revitalize the room.  Things decorated in this way will be appropriate in any corner of the house: in the children's room, in the kitchen, in the bedroom or in the living room. </p><h2>  Crazy Quilt Paintings </h2><p>  Crazy quilt style is often used by textile artists.  Beginners can draw inspiration from the work of Canadian resident Kirsten Chursinoff.  The girl had been fond of machine embroidery all her life, but with the advent of two kids she became interested in hand embroidery and the technique of crazy quilt.  On multi-colored patches she embroiders forest, sea landscapes and much more.  Most of all, the craftswoman loves to embroider birds.  She can consider their plumage for a long time, so that later she can accurately convey all the overflows of color in her paintings. </p>
