    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The garden was established in the 20s of the XIX century.  The main purpose of its creation was the cultivation of cocoa beans, spices and some other crops.  Then, for several decades, the need for plant breeding disappeared, and the territory was not used.  Serious work on the creation of the park began in 1859. Gradually, the plant world was enriched, seedlings from other regions began to be brought. </p><p>  In the XX century, many new species of tropical plants appeared in the Singapore Botanical Garden.  Soil studies were conducted here, new varieties were bred.  During this period, the first hybrids of orchids began to take root.  Subsequently, the garden survived the period of occupation and was not plundered.  The history of the Singapore Botanical Garden does not end there: now, it is trained biologists, they continue to ennoble the territory and develop new varieties.  This park is visited annually by a huge number of people: not only tourists, but also local residents who come here to relax, relax or exercise in the fresh air. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Walking through the Singapore Botanic Gardens in Singapore, you can see beautiful alleys, ponds and fountains.

    <p>  There are waterfalls, small sculptural compositions that fit perfectly into the surroundings.  The moss-covered sculptures give visitors the impression that they are in a fairyland.  In some pavilions, the air temperature is specially lowered to make plants comfortable. </p><p>  In 2007, the first in Asia was opened a garden for children, under the name of D. Ballas.  You can get there from a separate entrance, but this is also the territory of the Singapore Botanical Garden.  Young visitors can not only look at the plants, but also learn more about their breeding and human benefits.  There is also a games area and a separate cafe. </p><h2>  Animal world </h2><p>  On the territory of the Singapore Botanic Garden, you can find various animals.

For example, take a pond with water lilies or barely blooming flowers.  Wild birds live among the trees, and it will be lucky to take a photo of one of them. </p><h2>  What else to see? </h2><p>  You should definitely see such unique varieties of plants as dendrobiums, saraka, wax palm trees and some species of the Ginger family.  They also come to the garden to listen to music.  Concerts of orchestras are periodically held at special venues.  In 2008, a monument to F. Chopin was even erected here.  There are other beautiful sculptures.  For example, a composition depicting swans in Swan Lake. </p><p>  Travelers from other countries should visit the Garden of Evolution, which covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1.5 hectares.

Coniferous trees, ferns grow along the road, huge boulder stones complement the decor. </p><p>  Another amazing object is the Green Pavilion - a house whose roof is completely covered with plants.  It looks unusual, and inside there are recreation areas for guests.  For those interested in botany, there is a gardening library and training centers. </p><p>  Flowering plants create an extraordinary atmosphere and exude pleasant aromas.  But there is a separate area where spices are grown.  The smells reigning there will be long remembered by guests.  Another area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe garden is dedicated to wetland vegetation. </p>

    <p>  Water lilies swim in a small pond, and water-loving trees and grasses stretch around from the water. </p><h2>  How to get to the Singapore Botanic Garden? </h2><p>  Getting to the park while on the island is not difficult.  The easiest way to do this is by metro.  Exit should be at the station Botanic Gardens.  From there, signs and the entrance to the garden will be immediately visible. </p><p>  Another way to get to the sights is by taxi.  But for this it is advisable to familiarize yourself with the approximate prices in advance (Singapore dollars are used here) and think over the return route.  Weather permitting, you can walk on foot, especially if the hotel or guest house is nearby.  There are hotels located very close to the park. </p><p>  Note to visitors wishing to travel by public transport: several entrances lead to the garden.  There are several buses along the route. </p><h2>  Visitor Information </h2><p>  You don‚Äôt need to buy tickets to the park: admission is free for everyone.  The operating mode is the same for any season.  Every morning, the Singapore Botanic Garden opens its doors at 5 o‚Äôclock, and closes at exactly midnight.  The park works seven days a week and in any weather.  In separate pavilions there are cafeterias and recreation areas.  There is also a garden history museum on the territory where you can find out about the founders and famous biologists. </p><p>  In rainy weather you should take an umbrella, but there are places in the park where you can hide from the rain.  These are gazebos with shops, souvenir shops, food courts, special pavilions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Singapore Botanic Garden how to get there" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56862/2013179.jpg" width="600"></div>
