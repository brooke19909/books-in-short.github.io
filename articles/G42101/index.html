Here, each master is faced with the problem of choice, so you need to know as much as possible about each of them.  Consider one of them.  Time-lapse photography is a photo and video shooting of various processes that occur very slowly.  Such phenomena include the classic versions of a blooming flower, the growth of a child, the construction of a building, and phenomena that are more exotic in nature - melting snow, the movement of the sun, and more.  The purpose of such a survey is to fit several hours or days, and sometimes years, into a small video clip lasting five to ten minutes.  Many are very interested in observing a change in a phenomenon at short intervals. </p><p>  <strong>Time-lapse photography: basic concepts</strong> </p><p>  Time-lapse recorder is time lapse photography.  One shot is taken in a few minutes or hours, and then they are combined into a video sequence. </p><p>  Post - the processing process in a video editing program or lightroom. </p><p>  A flicker is a flicker of brightness from one frame to another.  This is the most common mistake. </p><p>  <strong>Time-lapse photography: implementation principle</strong> </p><p>  First you need to put the lens in manual focus mode.  If you do not, then on wide-angle lenses, focus can work on different objects, and even with a single focal length, the frame geometry will change from image to image.  To avoid the appearance of excess glare, you need to wear a hood.  You must turn off image stabilizers.  The camera must be switched to Manual Mode.  <span>The white balance</span> must be set to MANUAL mode, and you do not need to touch it while shooting a time-lapse. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you shoot in RAW, then you can set the white balance in lightroom or another editor by first processing the first frame, and then applying this setting to other frames.  This will take more time, but the result will be much better.  Therefore, it is worth shooting in RAW.  When working with one of the new Canon cameras, you can set sRAW mode (half resolution), since even FullHD-Video can be shot in five megapixels.  However, with higher resolution, you can have more processing options.  RAW makes it possible to correct exposure errors, remove noise and change colors.  Sorting on the post will be greatly simplified if you create a new folder on the camera during time-lapse shooting of each new time zone. </p><p>  Now we can say about the diaphragm.  It cannot be closed the same position twice in a row, so a flicker will appear on the video.  To solve the problem, there are two solutions.  The first solution is to use fully <span>manual lenses.</span>  On Canon cameras, you can set the desired aperture, and then click on the button for checking the <span>depth of field,</span> turn the lens out while holding it.  In this case, the diaphragm will be in the set position. </p><p>  Time-lapse shooting in motion should be carried out with certain parameters of the shutter speed to the interval ratio, which should be at around two to one, that is, if the shutter speed is selected at two seconds, then there must be exactly four seconds between shutter releases.  This is not a strict requirement, but this must be sought.  The average interval between frames should be set at around four seconds, but in windy weather it‚Äôs better to set it to one or two.  ISO is set to no more than 3200. </p><p>  Everyone knows that at a high temperature the cameras "make a lot of noise", which is why it is worthwhile to cover the device from the sun with a cap or T-shirt, which will save it from overheating.  But make sure that the cover is not in the <span>field of view of the</span> lens.  A tripod should be used as strong and stable as possible.  To save energy, it is better to turn off viewing after shooting. </p><p>  As you can see, time-lapse photography is a very painstaking and difficult work, but its result is simply amazing. </p>
