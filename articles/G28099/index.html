There are many ways to decorate the LD inside, we will consider the most popular and reveal the secrets of the techniques, which not everyone knows about. </p><h2>  For decor LD all means are good </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decoration ld" class="if uuid-2937486" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2937486.jpg"></div><p>  The use of colored pencils, felt-tip pens, ink, gel or fluorescent pens for making notes makes the appearance of the diary unique, bright and glamorous.  Using flavored ink pens is also a great option: a fragrant page will delight you for a very long time.  For the same purpose, you can take a little perfume and sprinkle the page.  The main thing is not to overdo it so that the smell does not seem asphyxiating.  Writing or drawing on such a sheet is not worth it until it dries completely, otherwise the inscription will blur. </p><p>  It is better to avoid the school style: emphasize, highlight in red, use the ruler, write from the red line, step back four boxes ... The similarity with the school notebook makes the LD boring, monotonous and dull.  Down with the rule - write your speech upside down, back to front (so that the text is read only in reflection in the mirror - vice versa).  Change the size of letters, handwriting, make mistakes, deliberately emphasizing them in order to focus on permissiveness.  The owner of the diary is his own artist, teacher and master.  Nobody will indicate how to decorate the LD: here you can create as you want. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Recall the lessons of Fine Arts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.videoblocks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="personal diary decoration" class="if uuid-2937479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2937479.jpg"></div><p>  How to decorate the LD to get something super original?  Some of the drawing lessons may come in handy, for example, framing a page background with a shaded pencil or wax crayon.  Background turns any picture, inscription or page into a real work, sets the mood. </p><p>  Instead of a boring notebook sheet, you can create a whole masterpiece, you just have to arm yourself with any water-based paints and a toothbrush.  Surely this technique is familiar to you in kindergarten or in fine arts classes in elementary grades.  Spraying paper with colorful droplets will create amazing patterns. </p><p>  Another technique is blotography, the name speaks for itself.  By the way, blots planted on a piece of paper can be inflated with a cocktail straw, and a unique pattern with lace and abstract spots will be obtained.  We wait until it dries and we write our favorite phrases in this original picture. </p><p>  Also unrealistically beautiful and even bewitching are the prints of leaves (maple, mountain ash, birch), previously dipped in watercolor or gouache.  And the dried flowers themselves, glued into the diary are a special chic, and if they are associated with some event, trip, sightseeing, gift, then a long memory and trembling storage are provided. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Stamps, rhinestones, hole punch </h2><div class="photo" data-original="citizenow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="personal diary decor" class="if uuid-2939717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2939717.jpg"></div><p>  Another option, how to decorate the LD inside with your own hands, is to use the improvised tools that are available in stores for creativity.  Stamps in the form of hearts, wings, unicorns and other lulliness will help to decorate your favorite pages, create a background or make a frame for an important record. </p><p>  Using one of your favorite stamps on certain pages may be your personal secret to indicate the most important events, thoughts or messages.  This is a wonderful option, how to decorate the LD inside.  Stamping can also be useful for highlighting page numbers or masking elements that are no longer relevant.  Agree - a cloud of hearts looks more interesting than a declaration of love smeared with felt-tip pens to an actor who has sharply lost his liking. </p><p>  Using decorative adhesive tapes, you can frame each page in a special style or divide it into several parts.  They are very cheap, and the variety of patterns, prints, colors makes this method a godsend for lovers of the original. </p><p>  For the most glamorous girls, the answer to the question of how to decorate LD is simple: use rhinestones, sequins, shiny stickers and even nail polish.  The latter, of course, is better not to get involved.  And self-adhesive rhinestones, sparkles and halves of beads are created specifically for creative teenagers who like to decorate their reality with their own hands. </p><p>  Curly hole punchers are a wonderful invention, which appeared relatively recently.  It opens unlimited freedom for the imagination of young owners of diaries.  Figures that remain after the hole punch work are suitable for decorating pages.  Miniature stars, hearts, flowers - everything will go into business.  Such ‚Äúscraps‚Äù of colored paper can create a confetti effect if arranged randomly and often. </p><h2>  Collages - great design and best anti-stress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="positivepsychologyprogram.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Personal diary" class="if uuid-2937494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2937494.jpg"></div><p>  Mini collages, <span>magazine</span> clippings <span>, photo collages</span> are another great idea on how to decorate your LD.  Firstly, it has been scientifically proven that collage making is very useful for relieving emotional stress.  Secondly, clippings from magazines, their layout, a combination of colors and figures is a real art.  Such a technique can be useful in drawing up a map of your cherished desires.  And thirdly, the collage can be combined with drawing with felt-tip pens, ink, or something else, which will lead to amazing results, you just have to try. </p><p>  It is also worth mentioning the tear-off applique (without the use of scissors) - decoration with scraps, torn elements, pictures from pieces.  Do not forget about bright bookmarks and decor using origami. </p><h2>  How to decorate LD: ideas for the most creative </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.guiainfantil.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="diary decoration" class="if uuid-2937505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2937505.jpg"></div><p>  When inserting your favorite poems, quotes or excerpts from works into the LD, use a photocopy of the page with the text.  Such paper can be "aged" with coffee, strong tea, or even make the edges "charred."  Such a processing of the manuscript will look fascinating, and a cleverly invented story about how you got such a relic will foster the interest of girlfriends. </p><p>  Some secret entries can be sealed with a wax candle and stamps, the main thing is to follow safety precautions so as not to get burned. </p><h2>  Little secrets for great creativity </h2><div class="photo" data-original="citizenow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="personal diary decor" class="if uuid-2939713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82635/2939713.jpg"></div><p>  If we decorate the LD with our own hands, it will be natural if fingerprints and palm outlines appear on the pages, decorated as the hostess of the diary wants to. </p><p>  Diary surprises can be arranged using hidden pages, secret pockets and small windows.  The most curious friends will fall into such a trap, so the scope for practical jokes and jokes is huge. </p><p>  Nobody canceled drawing on cells, coloring-antistress, the use of materials for scrapbooking, buttons and fabrics - these are simple ideas on how to decorate LDs, but they are often forgotten.  Moneyboxes from the most memorable particles of past events look great.  You can put together concert tickets, a dried flower, a label with your favorite clothes, a wrapper from candy donated by someone very important ... </p><p>  A personal diary is the best thing that can preserve memories of childhood and school years.  Time will pass, and he will witness the most interesting moments and events, which the adult mistress will probably already forget. </p>
