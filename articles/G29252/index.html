Original and ergonomic solutions triumph here, every square meter of both internal and external space is optimized, the most advanced technologies and the highest quality materials are used here. </p><h2>  How to find in Moscow "CASCADE Real Estate" </h2><p>  Company address for postal items: 115093, Moscow, 1st Shchipkovsky Lane, Building 5. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.7225858" data-lng="37.63199810000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/6/8/1/12681.png"></div><p>  Using the attached map, you can calculate the route for your own car or make sure that the location of the office is very accessible: there is quite a lot of transport, and the Dobryninskaya metro station is not so far, within walking distance. </p><p>  Phone "CASCADE Real Estate" can be found on the official website, office hours on weekdays from 09.00 to 21.00, and on weekends from 10.00 to 19.00.

Here is the sale of suburban real estate.  Those wishing to live in an environmentally friendly natural environment and at the same time in urban comfort (only 25 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road) can buy either comfortable apartments or townhouses on two levels in pretty four-story buildings. </p><p>  The local builder has an impeccable reputation; he proved himself to be a reliable builder with impeccable quality of work.  Materials were used only from European manufacturers.  All central communications are present, innovative layouts, architectural solutions are modern and interesting.  On the territory, the infrastructure occupies more than 6,600 square meters, which includes a school, a kindergarten and many other commercial and social facilities. </p><p>  As already mentioned, the ecology is beautiful and the nature is picturesque: a forest on three sides of a residential complex.  Transport accessibility is also wonderful, and residents of the Park April residential complex, who are missing the city bustle, can quickly find themselves in the center of the capital by using a freeway or railway.  There are 25 townhouses in total, and 17 buildings with apartments. The entire project is being implemented in four phases, the first will be introduced at the end of 2019. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The company "CASCADE Real Estate" is engaged in sales.  New buildings in the form of townhouses and cottages fly like hot cakes, since many people today have a great desire to move closer to nature.  This company works cleanly, always according to DDU and according to FZ-214, mortgage programs are supported by the ten most reliable banks, including Otkritie, VTB and Sberbank, and maternal capital is also widely used. </p><h2>  Cottage Village "Saburovo Park" </h2><p>  Seven kilometers from Moscow, the already commissioned cottage village "Saburovo Park" is located on a site of 18.5 hectares.  Townhouses made of high-quality brick, living space - from 146 square meters to 174's, layouts are free, so you can independently plan the space inside, depending on preferences.  According to reviews, the most attractive thing in this proposal is that each housing is accompanied by a land plot of up to five hundred square meters, where you can place a garden, garden or do landscape design.  There are also two parking spaces for cars. </p><p>  The nature here is truly amazing: a very beautiful dense forest for walking, exceptionally clean air.  Transport infrastructure is available: you can get to Moscow along Pyatnitsky highway, to the metro station, located seven kilometers away, minibuses constantly run.  Stop literally a hundred meters from the entrance to the cottage village.  Getting to work in any district of Moscow, as noted by locals, is quite convenient, even if there is no own car.  Roads in the village are asphalted. </p><p>  The developers have probably given part of their soul to this project, the living environment they created is so peaceful.  The most modern, foreign and domestic developments were used, and therefore the engineering communications correspond to the highest standards of today, and the recreation areas are designed for both children and adults.  The classical style of the architectural appearance of the village fits perfectly into the surrounding picturesque nature. </p><p>  It should be noted that CASCADE Real Estate does not raise prices to a sky-high level, they are quite consistent with the cost of a not too large three- or four-room apartment somewhere on the outskirts of Moscow.  Some Muscovites buy a townhouse here as a place to relax - to the cottage, but for the most part the owners of the conditions created here were appreciated, and therefore they will live here on an ongoing basis. </p><h2>  "Domodedovo Town" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="topnovostroek.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Domodedovo Town" class="if uuid-2998348" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13352/2998348.jpg"></div><p>  This is a very large project called "New Domodedovo", a separate stage of which is a cottage village seventeen kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road.  This is the Domodedovo Town.  Here is the most modern infrastructure with a high level of comfort.  The nearby forest adds a bit of appeal to shoppers.  Also close is the Kashirskoye highway, providing transport accessibility.  All houses in the village have the highest quality engineering communications, and the energy-intensive technologies used provide, along with comfort, a saving mode.  All engineering systems are under the control of a specially created management company, which means that there will be order and timely garbage collection. </p><p>  The whole village occupies 12 hectares, each two-story townhouse will have a site from one to six hundred parts.  Living areas vary in size - from 102 to 144 square meters.  Low-rise houses are equipped with elevators, apartments are sold ranging from 28.7 to 66.7 square meters.  Planning is free.  Two parking spaces are required, in addition, guests can use guest parking.  A territory with a quality fence, an entrance with a checkpoint, a private security agency operates, which will monitor the absence of incidents and the safety of property. </p><p>  Sales are handled by CASCADE Real Estate.  Promotions and discounts are almost constant, you can watch them on the company's website, they are numerous and constantly replace each other.  As a result, this living space in a beautiful, picturesque and environmentally friendly place will not cost more than a three-room apartment in a not too prestigious area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMoscow. </p><h2>  Duplexes of the village "Zelenogradsky" </h2><p>  22 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road, if you follow the Leningradskoye Shosse, there is a guarded village, which is almost closely fused with Zelenograd.  Duplexes are built here - cottage-type houses for two owners, with two separate entrances.  In total, two hundred of them are being built, but they are not the same, even the living area varies from 110 to 153 square meters.  Inside, the layout will not differ from a separate cottage: you can install a fireplace, as in the best English houses (where duplexes come from, by the way), there are attics. </p><p>  Centralized networks - gas, water, electricity, sewage, digital television, and high-speed Internet.  But for heating, each section is calculated individually - the choice of method.  The plans include the arrangement of an artificial lake and the improvement of recreation areas on it, and in winter there will be an excellent skating rink.  It is also planned to build a tennis court, playgrounds, as well as sports.  Well thought out landscape gardening.  The coniferous forest nearby will also be landscaped: special paths are provided for hiking and cycling. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hoff.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Village of duplexes &quot;Zelenogradsky&quot;" class="if uuid-2998353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13352/2998353.jpg"></div><p>  The village is built, fenced, guarded.  Turnkey duplex finishing, with all communications connected.  According to reviews, the bathrooms are equipped with high-quality equipment, and the kitchens have wonderful furniture.  Even the local area is being improved, and in the parking lots paving stones are laid.  Reviews of "CASCADE Real Estate" especially often note this attention to detail. </p><p>  On sale is a duplex of 153.7 square meters.  m in a ready-guarded village near the city of Zelenograd with a turnkey finish.  All communications are connected, included in the cost of home ownership.  The house has high-quality kitchen furniture, 2 bathrooms are fully equipped with the necessary equipment.  When buying a living space in the village "Zelenogradsky" will be offered a variety of discounts, "CASCADE Real Estate" constantly gives all such information on its own website and on the site of the village. </p><h2>  Serednikovo Park in Solnechnogorsk district </h2><p>  Another nearby duplex village is 19 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road and also one kilometer from Zelenograd.  Judging by the reviews, "CASCADE Real Estate" quickly sells these cottages, as many reasons contribute to this.  Firstly, these are highly comfortable brick houses of free planning, in which communications are connected.  Secondly, the construction is very high quality, European building materials were used.  According to reviews, the infrastructure is well thought out: sports fields, a kindergarten, walking areas, gaming complexes - everything is there. </p><p>  Before each household there is a parking lot for 2 cars, transport accessibility is wonderful.  It is difficult to say what is most convenient: public transport or a personal car.  Both that and another will help to quickly reach the center of the capital.  The construction of 254 duplexes in the village of Serednikovo Park is planned, some with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã150 square meters, others 180. The land plots are in all - from three to six hundred parts.  In December 2018, the second phase of construction will be completed, and therefore it makes sense to hurry. </p><p>  Promotions and discounts are announced in sales regularly, you need to follow this.  An example of the fact that duplexes, which are practically no different from cottages, can be acquired in a much more profitable way, is the fact that next to Moscow, 153 square meters are offered on a three-hundred-square-meter plot for just 5.85 million rubles.  The project is accredited by the four largest banks at once, therefore both a mortgage and an installment plan are possible.  If you immediately make 50% of the cost, half a year installment plan will be without interest.  At the moment, the action can be issued for the whole year interest-free installments. </p><h2>  Academy Park on the Desna </h2><p>  This cottage village is located in a very favorable place near Moscow, ecologically clean, picturesque and calm.  Pine forest favorably affects the human body as a whole and its attitude in particular.  The conditions are simply unique: only 22 kilometers of the Kiev highway separates this paradise from the inexhaustible energy of the capital, by bus you can reach the city in about twenty minutes, and with personal transport ten minutes are enough. </p><p>  Here, the townhouses are purely business class, all on two levels, and the area varies from 101 square meters to 185. Lovely private courtyards for each house, landscape design.  Engineering communications correspond to the class of buildings, and according to reviews, here the level of comfort is very high.  Individual heating, "smart home", Internet and digital television - optional.  A huge factor of attractiveness is registration in the capital! </p><p>  There is all the infrastructure, and it meets all the needs of our time.  These are kindergartens, and kindergartens and sports grounds, and shopping centers, and pharmacies, and laundries.  Of course, the wonderful recreation areas that always stand out at the facilities of the company "KASKAD Real Estate".

The order will be supported by a security company, entry through a special checkpoint. </p><h2>  Townhouses KASKAD Park </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kfamily.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Second stage &quot;Cascade Park&quot;" class="if uuid-2998368" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13352/2998368.jpg"></div><p>  In this <span>residential complex</span> all the advantages of the existing ones happily combined: the location is excellent, and the environment is favorable, and it is close to the capital, and the place is calm.
