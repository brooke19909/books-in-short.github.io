    <p>  The term "sovereignty" literally means "supreme power."  It characterizes the concept of independence, the unity of power of a particular subject.  In science, such definitions as <span>national, national</span> and state sovereignty are used.  The third concept is considered to be derived from the second. </p><p>  The state sovereignty of the Russian Federation is inextricably linked with the multinational people of the country.  The Russian Constitution defines the population as the sole source and holder of power.  In accordance with Art.  32 in the basic law, Russians have the right to take part in managing the affairs of the country both through their leaders and directly themselves.  Citizens of the Russian Federation are entitled to choose and be elected to state and local authorities, to participate in a referendum.  In addition, they have equal access to public service, as well as the right to administer justice. </p><p>  Thus, national and state sovereignty are so connected that the full realization of the supreme <span>power of the people is</span> impossible without the existence of the country.  Here we should mention the statement of Hegel.  The philosopher believed that nations that did not form states did not belong to history.  Moreover, the prosperity of a democratic country that does not recognize the supreme power of its people is impossible. </p><p>  According to I.A. Umnova, national and state sovereignty in the complex are the ability and property of a country to independently determine its foreign and <span>domestic policies</span> in compliance with human and civil rights.  In such circumstances, protection of the <span>national minority is</span> also ensured in compliance with international legal norms. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A close connection exists between state and national sovereignty.  The national supreme authority indicates that a nation has the right to self-determination.  This right in Russia is enshrined in Article 5 of the Constitution of the country. </p><p>  It should be noted at the same time that state sovereignty in a multinational country cannot be reduced to the supreme power of a nation alone.  In accordance with what method of exercising their right to self-determination was chosen by the nationalities united in one country, the supreme power in the country must guarantee the independence of everyone. </p><p>  To ensure the preservation of the integrity of Russia as a multinational country, to prevent <span>violations of human rights</span> and each nation, the realization of national self-determination can be carried out only within the Russian Federation or abroad, but with its permission.  At the same <span>time, the state,</span> being sovereign, guarantees the citizens of the Russian Federation, related to specific ethnic unions, equal rights, the opportunity to independently resolve issues of preserving their language, original culture, and education.  In addition, the inviolability of the borders of the country as a whole is ensured. </p><p>  Thus, state sovereignty is the supremacy inherent in a country on its territory, and independence in foreign policy relations. </p><p>  When revealing a concept, it is necessary to point out its fundamental principles: indivisibility and unity of the territory, non-interference in the internal politics of the country, and the inviolability of territorial elements.  If any external force or other country encroaches on the borders, forcing them to take certain decisions contrary to the interests of the nation, they speak of a violation of independence. </p><p>  Thus, sovereignty, unity of power is exclusive and complete, one of the inalienable characteristics of the state.  It is this criterion that makes it possible to distinguish a country from other public law formations.  Being a property of the <span>state, sovereignty</span> gives it the status of a special subject in political relations. </p>
