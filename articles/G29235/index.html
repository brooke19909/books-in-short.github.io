It is curious to observe its genesis from the window of a car, comparing the architecture of stations passing by.  There are many masterpieces in the Moscow metro, but there are also more modest underground interiors.  Such as the Profsoyuznaya metro station.  But she deserves attention.  A closer look at her example shows how conflicting trends fought for dominance in metro construction. </p><h2>  From the history of the Moscow metro </h2><p>  The first passengers stepped onto the platform of the Profsoyuznaya metro station in October 1962.  It was the penultimate one as part of the launch site of the Kaluga radius from the Oktyabrskaya station to the <span>Novye Cheryomushki station.</span>  <span>Moscow</span> in the early sixties was built at an unprecedented pace.  In all peripheral areas, new microdistricts grew.  For the first time in their lives, people got the opportunity to move from communal apartments to their own apartments.  The construction of <span>transport infrastructure</span> did not always keep pace with the construction of housing.  This was one of the main reasons forcing to reduce the time for laying new metro lines.  And the number of commissioned stations and metro lines in the sixties was very high.  At that time, they preferred not to think about the fact that this was largely achieved due to the quality of architecture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro union" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/447197.jpg" width="492"></div>

Strategic approaches to construction were radically changed in the country, preference was given to standard projects.  This really made it possible to save money, increase volumes and reduce the time required for putting objects into operation.  But I had to pay for it by neglecting the aesthetic expressiveness of these objects.  This is especially evident in the Moscow metro.  The fallacy of the concept of excesses was recognized only after two decades. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro trade union Moscow" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/447196.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  Architectural features of the Profsoyuznaya metro station </h2><p>  The station does not make a vivid impression.  There is nothing particularly outstanding in the architectural design, or even in the name of the Profsoyuznaya metro station.  "Profsoyuznaya St." - indicated on signs in the <span>underpass</span> and on signs on the walls of houses, when exiting the subway.  It was in honor of this, not particularly famous street, located in the south of Moscow, that the station was named.  The street itself in the early sixties of the last century was in the process of construction and only acquired the familiar look of everyone today.  Structurally, the Profsoyuznaya metro station is a columned three-span shallow station.  This is a typical project, various variations of which can be found in abundance both in the Moscow metro and in the subways of other cities of the former Soviet Union.  There is no ground lobby.  The exit to the city, to Profsoyuznaya street, is through the underground passage laid under it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro trade union street trade union" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/447198.jpg" width="492"></div>

The authors did everything possible to achieve individuality within the framework of a standard project.  This is achieved by decorative decoration of the interior of the main hall.  Stations of this type, which include, in particular, the Profsoyuznaya metro station, architects and metro builders jokingly denote the slang term ‚Äúcentipede‚Äù.  Because of the two rows of columns supporting the vault.  There are forty of them in each row.  With all the limited possibilities of a typical project of the authors, no one deprived of the opportunity to express themselves in the field of decorative solutions of the existing architectural volume.  It was believed that a true artist can achieve expressiveness by the most modest means.  And in many ways it was possible.  The gray marble on the columns of the station is organically combined with ceramics of the track walls and red granite flooring. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="trade union metro station" class="if" height="261" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/447195.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  In the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãProfsoyuznaya street </h2><p>  More than half a century has passed since the Profsoyuznaya metro station came into operation on the street of the same name.  Moscow over these decades has managed to expand its borders in a southwestern direction very far.  Currently, the area around the Trade Union has lost the features of the Moscow outskirts.  Today he is quite respectable and well-rated by the ratings of real estate agencies.  This means that many indigenous and new Muscovites are ready to choose this area as their permanent residence.  And this is not surprising - on Profsoyuznaya Street many new modern residential complexes, shops, cultural and entertainment facilities were built.  A significant amount of improvement work has been carried out.  And the transport problem of the region was solved in the early sixties.  Reliable communication with the center of the capital is ensured by the Kaluga radius of the ‚Äúorange‚Äù line of the Moscow Metro. </p>
