They allow each person or family to purchase their property without having their own necessary means.  Such loans are granted only if potential borrowers meet multiple requirements.  Additionally, you need to prepare a variety of documents for a mortgage.  They may differ slightly depending on various factors, which include the use of collateral, attracting guarantors or buying an apartment under construction. </p><h2>  What papers are needed? </h2><p>  The documentation can differ significantly when considering various factors, therefore the parameters are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  the bank in which it is planned to arrange a loan, since the documents for a mortgage in Sberbank may differ slightly from the requirements of VTB 24 or another similar organization; </li><li>  purchased property, which can be represented by a room, apartment or house, as well as an unfinished object, and some banks even offer the opportunity to obtain borrowed funds for the construction of a building; </li><li>  used state programs, according to which borrowers must meet certain requirements, and this should be confirmed by various documents; </li><li>  the need to attract a guarantor, as he must be a solvent citizen with an ideal credit history. </li></ul><p>  Regardless of the above conditions, certain papers must be prepared for the borrower himself.  They must confirm that he really has the opportunity to repay the debt with all interest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="list of documents for a mortgage" class="if uuid-2316522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2316522.jpg"></div><h2>  Personal papers </h2><p>  What documents for a mortgage will be required in any case?  These include the personal papers of the potential borrower.  This includes documentation: </p><ul><li>  the passport of a Russian citizen, since it is almost impossible for foreigners to obtain such a loan; </li><li>  a work book with which bank employees can easily calculate the length of service of a potential borrower; </li><li>  documents confirming the specific education of a citizen, and they can be presented not only with different diplomas, but also with certificates, certificates or certificates; </li><li>  papers confirming the status of the applicant, for example, a pension certificate, certificate of a large family or single mother; </li><li>  marriage certificate and documents for all children held by a potential borrower. </li></ul><p>  Since a mortgage loan is considered to be a specific offer of the bank, the employees of these institutions are responsible for studying the potential borrower.  You really need to provide a lot of documents for a mortgage.  Usually a list is issued by a bank employee.  If at least one paper is absent, this can become an objective and compelling reason for receiving a refusal to obtain a large loan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Documents confirming solvency </h2><p>  Each bank wants all issued funds with interest to be returned.  Therefore, potential borrowers are carefully checked, as they must be solvent.  Only in this case, you can be sure of the return of the debt.  Documents required for a mortgage and confirming the financial condition of the borrower are represented by the papers: </p><ul><li>  a certificate from the citizen‚Äôs place of work, which is compiled in a special form 2-NDFL, it indicates all paid funds to the person for the year of work; </li><li>  <span>a certificate in the form of a bank,</span> which may contain slightly different information, but it will certainly have to be certified at work, so the potential borrower will not be able to enter any data into it; </li><li>  copy of the employment contract with the company where the citizen works; </li><li>  securities confirming the existence of other income, and they may be presented by bank statements, lease contracts, rental agreements or other agreements; </li><li>  certificates indicating various valuable property held by the citizen, as this can confirm that the borrower is really a wealthy person, so even if he loses his income, he will be able to use his property to cover the debt; </li><li>  Bank statement, indicating that the applicant has funds that can be used as an initial payment. </li></ul><p>  If at the time of applying to the bank for a mortgage a citizen has unsecured loans, then you must additionally take a note from the bank indicating the balance of the debt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.canadianmortgagetrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage documents banks" class="if uuid-2316524" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2316524.jpg"></div><h2>  Other personal papers </h2><p>  In addition, other documents may be required to obtain a mortgage.  These include: </p><ul><li>  a certificate indicating that the applicant is not legally incompetent, and is also not registered with any medical institution; </li><li>  if a citizen works as a director, then he needs to prepare papers on the basis of which it is confirmed that he is not a founder, since completely different requirements are made to such persons; </li><li>  a certificate of family composition, as well as other documents indicating that the applicant has a spouse and children; </li><li>  certificate of the place of permanent registration of the potential borrower; </li><li>  if a man applies, then he must confirm that he has a military card; </li><li>  an application for a loan must be filled out, presented by a special questionnaire, and only reliable information must be entered, since they will be checked by the bank security service, and if inconsistencies with reality are revealed, this will cause a refusal of a mortgage. </li></ul><p>  Banks usually require both originals and copies of all papers.  The originals are checked by bank employees, as they must make sure that the data in the copies matches the actual information. </p><h2>  What if there are several borrowers? </h2><p>  Often, spouses act as mortgage borrowers.  In this situation, each of them prepares the necessary documents for the mortgage. </p><p>  It is advisable to come to the branch of the selected bank in advance to get a complete list of required securities.  This will reduce the amount of time that you have to spend on preparing documentation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expertise.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="documents for obtaining a mortgage" class="if uuid-2316527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2316527.jpg"></div><h2>  Documents for IP </h2><p>  Often, individual entrepreneurs wish to arrange a loan.  They usually work under simplified taxation regimes, which makes it difficult to confirm their income.  Therefore, entrepreneurs are preparing the following documents for obtaining a mortgage: </p><ul><li>  standard papers submitted by passport and application; </li><li>  certificate of registration of IP and registration in a specific branch of the Federal Tax Service; </li><li>  license to work in a specific area where this permission is required; </li><li>  a declaration for a year of work or two years, if IP is operating under the OSNO. </li></ul><p>  If an entrepreneur applies during the operation of UTII or PSN, then the documents do not contain information about the amount of income.  Under such conditions, you will need to prove your solvency in other ways.  For this, bank statements, documents for existing property or an account statement are prepared, indicating the regular movement of money.  Often, even with such documents, banks require the involvement of a guarantor or co-borrower. </p><h2>  What is required from the co-borrower? </h2><p>  If the official income of the borrower himself is considered too low, then he can take the help of the co-borrower, as this will allow to take into account his income.  If the borrower himself cannot pay the loan, this obligation will be transferred to the co-borrower. </p><p>  What documents are needed for a mortgage from the co-borrower?  They prepare the documentation: </p><ul><li>  passport and its copy; </li><li>  certificates and other documents confirming different types of income; </li><li>  employment history; </li><li>  SNILS. </li></ul><p>  It is these documents that serve as evidence of a citizen having sufficient solvency so that, if necessary, he could pay the loan funds for the direct borrower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="themocracy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="documents needed for a mortgage" class="if uuid-2316520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2316520.jpg"></div><h2>  What is needed from a senior citizen? </h2><p>  Often, a pensioner wants to become a borrower.  Older people often want to live separately from their adult children, but they may not have enough money to buy housing on their own.  Therefore, they are forced to contact the bank.  The list of documents for a mortgage for a pensioner consists of papers: </p><ul><li>  passport; </li><li>  pension certificate; </li><li>  documents for existing property that may be pledged to the bank; </li><li>  papers confirming that the pensioner continues to work, so he has an official salary that allows him to easily manage loan payments; </li><li>  documentation indicating that the pensioner has securities or additional income. </li></ul><p>  The more documents will be transferred by the potential borrower, the more likely it is that he will receive approval from the bank. </p><h2>  Bonded papers </h2><p>  If the borrower wishes to transfer his own property as a security to the bank, then a mortgage is drawn up.  In this case, the following papers are transferred to the bank: </p><ul><li>  passport of a citizen; </li><li>  title papers for real estate; </li><li>  certificate of ownership of the object; </li><li>  technical papers received at BTI; </li><li>  extract from the USRN. </li></ul><p>  If there are registered minor citizens in this facility, the bank may refuse to accept it on bail, because if the borrower cannot pay the funds under the agreement, it will be impossible to sell such an object. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.americanfinancing.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage documents" class="if uuid-2316526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2316526.jpg"></div><h2>  Documents for the purchased property </h2><p>  In addition to the personal papers of the borrower himself, documentation is required for the selected object, which is purchased at the expense of the bank.  The number of documents depends entirely on what kind of real estate is bought. </p><p>  The paper will differ depending on the purchase of a finished house or apartment in an unfinished object.  Also, often people even prefer to build houses at the expense of borrowed funds. </p><h2>  Papers on an apartment or house </h2><p>  Documents for a mortgage on an apartment or house are almost the same.  They must be taken from the seller, who must be the owner of the object.  Initially, you need to request a list of securities from bank employees, after which it is transferred to the seller.  Most often, documents for a mortgage for finished real estate should be as follows: </p><ul><li>  title papers for real estate represented by an agreement on the purchase of an object, a gift, certificate of inheritance or similar documents; </li><li>  cadastral passport, and this document is valid only for 30 days, so you should make sure that it was received recently; </li><li>  an extract from the USRN containing information about all registered persons and past owners, and it is important to check who is registered in the object, since at the time of sale all citizens should be discharged from it; </li><li>  copies of passports or certificates of birth of all owners, which must be indicated in the contract; </li><li>  extract from the house book; </li><li>  a certificate indicating that the seller is a competent person, therefore, he can make a decision regarding the sale of his property; </li><li>  written permission is required from the spouse to sell the apartment or house; </li><li>  if there are children among the owners, then the seller must have permission to sell the object from the guardianship authorities. </li></ul><p>  If you use the help of a realtor, he also checks the seller, which allows you to verify the appropriateness and legal purity of the transaction.  What documents for a mortgage are needed additionally from the seller, you can check with the bank. </p><p>  The buyer himself must pay an assessment of the apartment or house in order to determine their market value.  Based on this indicator, the bank decides what maximum amount will be provided on credit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bestrefinanceoffers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what documents for a mortgage" class="if uuid-2316519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2316519.jpg"></div><h2>  Paper on an object under construction </h2><p>  Often people want to buy apartments in a house under construction.  In this case, the DDU is drawn up with the developer.  The documents required for a mortgage with such an acquisition are represented by the papers: </p><ul><li>  direct DDU received from a builder accredited by the bank; </li><li>  copies of the constituent papers of the selected construction company, moreover, registration certificate must be included here; </li><li>  an order or an order, on the basis of which the apartment is sold by a legal entity, and the technical parameters of the object and its price must be indicated in it; </li><li>  documentation confirming that a particular construction organization really has the right to build and sell apartments. </li></ul><p>  Usually, additional papers are not required, since it is necessary to choose developers accredited to the selected bank.  In this case, the mortgage will be easy to arrange.  Documents banks require almost the same, so there is no problem with their preparation. </p><h2>  What do you need when building a house? </h2><p>  If people are independently engaged in building a house, then they must confirm their solvency and spending on this process.  What documents are needed for a mortgage at Sberbank or another bank under such conditions?  These include: </p><ul><li>  certificate of ownership of the land where it is planned to build a residential facility; </li><li>  permission to carry out construction work; </li><li>  an agreement drawn up with a construction organization that will be engaged in the construction of a house. </li></ul><p>  It is allowed for banks to require other certificates if there is any doubt that the funds will really be directed to these purposes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sellanyhome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="documents for a mortgage for an apartment" class="if uuid-2316521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2316521.jpg"></div><h2>  What do you need when participating in government programs? </h2><p>  Often, the state develops special programs on the basis of which citizens can use soft loans.  Documents when buying an apartment in a mortgage with state support may be different depending on the chosen program: </p><ul><li>  when using a mat.  capital needs a certificate directly; </li><li>  if you plan to apply for a mortgage without proof of income, then usually you need only a few documents, which include a passport, application, as well as confirmation of the availability of other property and funds for investment in the form of an initial contribution; </li><li>  young families prepare papers for children and passports confirming that citizens are not yet 35 years old, they need extracts from the USRN, with which they confirm that they do not own other real estate, and they must additionally prove that they live with children in cramped conditions. </li></ul><p>  Thus, to obtain a mortgage loan, different documents may be required.  They depend on various factors, which include the acquired property, the status of the borrower and the requirements of banks.  It is advisable to independently find out from the employees of the selected banking institution about the necessary securities.  This will allow you to immediately prepare the required number of documents, which are then submitted to the bank for consideration. </p>
