This often happens if paid additional services are connected.  It often happens that operators recommend activating an option that can be dispensed with.  Their list is quite large, for example: </p><p>  - Connect melodies instead of waiting beeps. </p><p>  - Subscriptions to various content. </p><p>  - Various notifications and others. </p><p>  In addition, some subscribers, due to their carelessness or forgetfulness, simply forget to periodically disable those options that are no longer needed. </p><p>  For various operators, there are various methods for determining activated services and ways to disable them.  For example, how do you know which services are connected on Tele2? </p>

    <p>  For all telecom operators, there are 3 ways to find out connected paid options: </p><p>  - Personal appeal to the company office. </p><p>  - Personal account on the website. </p><p>  - A <span>telephone conversation</span> with the operator. </p><h2>  Contact the operator‚Äôs office </h2><p>  All Tele2 subscribers can learn the connected services and options by visiting the operator‚Äôs office in person.  If a branch of the company operates in your city, then you can contact the office closest to you for information and recommendations.  To find a branch convenient for you, you need to go to the main page of the site, find the link "Our regions", select your region and city in the list that appears, after that you will see the line "Sales offices".  A map appears with the points of sale indicated on it.  It should be recalled: in order to get information at the office and find out what services are connected on Tele2, you need to bring an <span>identification card with you.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Operator consultation </h2>

    <p>  Another way to find out what services are connected on Tele2 is to consult a technical support operator.  In order to contact him, you need to dial the number "611" on the phone and press the call button.  After a short wait, a connection with a technical support specialist will occur.  It will be possible to find out how to find out what services are connected on Tele2 after answering a secret question, which will help the operator to make sure that you are the true owner of the SIM card.  After identifying the subscriber, you can ask the consultant all your questions regarding activated options.  Upon oral request, the operator can immediately turn them off.  You can also turn off the services yourself, simply by asking the service employee what sequential actions are necessary for this. </p><h2>  On "Tele2" you can find out what services are connected using your Personal Account </h2><p>  The third way is your personal account.  To access it, you need to go to the main page of the site and in the upper right corner click on the link "Log in to My Tele2." indicate the mobile phone number for which you want to know the connected Tele2 services, and click on the "Get Password" link. In the near future you will receive a code to access your personal account. By clicking on the "Enter" button, enter the phone number that is used again  ere as login and password received. Thus, go to a home page of the Personal Cabinet. It remains only to go to the "Service management" and turn off unnecessary options or connect necessary. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Request the number of connected paid services using USSD commands </h2>

    <p>  In addition to the consultant‚Äôs help and the capabilities of your Personal Account, USSD teams will help you figure out how to find out what services are connected on Tele2.  To get the list of activated additional options, you need to dial the combination * 153 # and press the call.  A message will appear on the phone screen stating that the request has been accepted, and after a few seconds an SMS message will come with a complete list of all paid functions.  You can also use specialized commands to deactivate them. </p><h2>  Service Management "Tele2" </h2>

    <p>  After you find out which additional options are connected, you can independently turn off all those unnecessary services that so successfully reduce the balance of your phone bill.  You can do this in almost the same ways: using your Personal Account or using USSD commands. </p><h2>  Deactivation of services in your account </h2><p>  After successful authorization in your account you will need to find the link "Service Management".  After that, a page with detailed information about available active or available options will open.  Usually, three main lists of services are indicated: <br>  - "The whole list", where absolutely everything is displayed - both already connected and available for inclusion services. <br>  - "Connected", which lists the currently active options. <br>  - "Available", where all the services that are not yet activated, but there is the possibility of their inclusion.  Opposite to each service in the list there is a "Connect / Disconnect" button.  Using this command, you can activate additional services, such as, for example, <span>voice mail,</span> AntiAON, Conferencing or packet services. </p><h2>  Disabling Services Using USSD Commands </h2><p>  You can also disable an unnecessary option by sending the necessary USSD command from the phone.  The main nuance is that for each service such a code is different.  You can find out which teams are intended for which services from the operator. <br>  How to find out what services are connected to Tele2 was discussed above.  Disabling options can be considered on the example of the option of deactivation using the service commands of the following services: "SMS-freedom" and "Beep". </p><h2>  Disabling the option "SMS-freedom" </h2>

    <p>  The SMS Freedom service allows you to send up to two hundred text messages per day almost for free.  A certain <span>monthly fee</span> is charged for this service <span>.</span>  The option will be beneficial to those who quite actively exchange messages throughout the day.  If the subscriber does not conduct active correspondence, then there is no point in the service.  In this case, it is more advantageous to disable the option.  In order to deactivate the ‚ÄúSMS-freedom‚Äù package service, you need to create a request code * 116 * 21 * 1 # on the device and press the ‚ÄúCall‚Äù button.  After these actions, the service will be disconnected, but not instantly.  As a rule, the termination of the service occurs the next day. </p><h2>  Deactivation of the service "Beep" </h2><p>  This service is suitable for those who want, instead of the usual beeps when dialing the device, the interlocutor heard a melody.  As a rule, for most users it is pretty useless.  Therefore, if the operator activated it by default, or the connection failed, then it makes sense to deactivate this option.  In order to regain the usual beeps instead of a musical theme, you need to dial * 115 * 0 # on your phone.  After that, a standard monotonous beep will be returned and installed, and funds for using the option will no longer be debited.  The ‚ÄúBeep‚Äù option will be deactivated, as well as the ‚ÄúSMS-freedom‚Äù option, the next day. </p>
