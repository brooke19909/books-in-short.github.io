  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sodium benzoate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The substance <span>sodium benzoate is</span> better known as a food supplement (E211), which is classified by a group of preservatives.  This is the sodium salt of <span>benzoic acid.</span>  Externally, this compound is a white powder that is odorless, or may be with a slight smell of benzaldehyde. </p><p>  The substance was first obtained in 1875 by the American researcher Hugo Fleck and was also proposed by him as a substitute for salicylic acid.  Already in 1908, sodium benzoate in the United States was approved for use as a preservative.  Its preservative effect is based on the fact that sodium benzoate is able to significantly reduce the activity of enzymes in the cell, which ensure the occurrence of redox reactions, and, thereby, significantly reduce the effectiveness of the action of yeast and <span>molds.</span>  This action is characteristic of preservatives <span>potassium sorbate</span> and sodium benzoate.  There is a small content of this compound in natural foods.  Among these, you can specify apples, raisins, mustard and others. </p><p>  The chemical formula of the substance is C6H5COONa, but it is an empirically derived equation. </p><p>  As a <span>dietary supplement</span> registered under the article (E211), sodium benzoate is approved for use in many countries of the world, including Russia.  Specialists are currently engaged in an active discussion on the health hazard of combination substances, which include sodium benzoate and some dyes at the same time.  The fact is that scientific data are presented on the harm that may be caused by the interaction of benzoate with <span>dyes E110,</span> E104 and others. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is widely used in industrial production, especially in the food industry.  Here it is used to preserve meat and fish products, margarine, various varieties of mayonnaise and ketchup.  If sodium benzoate is used in products that contain vitamin C in its composition, then interaction with it can lead to the formation of benzene, which is dangerous in high concentrations. </p><p>  As a preservative, sodium benzoate is used in the manufacture of cosmetic products and pharmacological preparations.  In the latter case, it is part of expectorants and other combination drugs of this purpose. </p><p>  The use of sodium benzoate is also common for technical needs.  So, for example, in aviation they find it used as the main component of coatings for protection from the harmful effects of various parts of airframes made of aluminum.  In addition, it is used as a <span>galvanic coating</span> in various industries associated with this process. </p><p>  The pyrotechnic purpose of a substance is its ability to simulate the sound of a rocket taking off. </p><p>  In 1999, the biologist P. Piper suggested in one of his works that benzoate, when exposed to yeast cells, can cause the so-called ‚Äúoxidative stress‚Äù.  It was also stated there that the substance has a mutagenic activity, which extends primarily to human DNA.  Here it is necessary to make a reservation that Piper investigated not only how sodium benzoate acts, but also other organic acids that are used as preservatives. </p><p>  Later, the scientist said that the harm that may be associated with the presence of benzoate is associated with the danger of Parkinson's disease. </p><p>  In accordance with WHO requirements set forth in CICAD26 of 2000, a variety of studies on the nature of the effect of sodium benzoate on humans have shown the relative safety of this compound.  However, this document indicates that there may be cases of skin allergies (dermatitis), as well as exacerbations caused by asthma. </p>
