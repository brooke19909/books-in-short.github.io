  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Uprising Square in Tula and a monument to V.I. Lenin</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Uprising Square in Tula, guests are often confused with Lenin Square.  There is such a city, and it is really easy to get confused.  Until recently, it was on Uprising Square that a monument stood to the leader of the world proletariat.  To this pedestal, on festive May Day and October days, folk columns flocked along the streets in streams, turning into squares into a jubilant sea of ‚Äã‚Äãdemonstrators.  Now everything is different. </p><h2>  Why Rebellion Square? </h2><p>  September 14, 1903 on this square the first demonstration of workers of the Tula plant took place.  People came to this place to defend their interests.  Requirements were put forward of an economic nature: improving working and living conditions, reducing working hours, increasing wages.  But this was only the first step in the struggle for a normal existence. </p><p>  In memory of this event, Tula Square appeared in Tula, and an obelisk was erected, which in 1926 replaced the monument to V.I. Lenin.  The author is the sculptor Kharlamov, he saw the living Lenin twice, and after the death of the leader in 1924 he traveled to the capital to continue working on sketches.  Experts assure that the similarity of the monument with the original was very strong. </p><h2>  The second monument to Lenin in the country </h2><p>  The pedestal to Lenin on Uprising Square in Tula was cast with the money collected by the city residents, made by the workers of the Krasny Vyborzhets factory, and was the second monument in the USSR in honor of the leader of the peoples. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tulainpast.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tula uprising area" class="if uuid-3151141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3151141.jpg"></div><p>  The first, of course, were Leningraders who erected a monument to Lenin at Finland Station.  Memorials appeared in Moscow only a few years later, then there will be many of them, in each locality, in each passage of the plant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Changes in the movement of demonstrators </h2><p>  Tula is a city in which changes and improvements occur annually.  New neighborhoods are being built, squares and parks are being improved, and avenues are expanding. </p><div class="photo" data-original="trof-av.livejournal.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://trof-av.livejournal.com/91771.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tula Uprising Area" class="if uuid-3151142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3151142.jpg"></div><p>  In 1983, the construction of a new complex was completed, consisting of the Government House, popularly called the "White House", and a new monument to Lenin - the work of the sculptor M. Zakharov. </p><p>  The fate of the old monument was decided as follows: it was dismantled from its historical place and transferred to the courtyard of the Tula artillery school.  Now it has become easier for guests of the city to navigate in the names: there is Lenin Square with a monument to the leader in the center, there is Uprising Square in Tula at the address: Sovetskaya Street, without any monument. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="54.1942761" data-lng="37.61160050000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/5/7/9/0/15790.png"></div><p>  There is a military school, in the courtyard of which there is a wonderful work of a talented sculptor-monumentalist, which is of artistic and historical value.  It is gratifying that the Tula people were able to find an alternative, quite worthy place to the talented work of the sculptor Matvey Yakovlevich Kharlamov. </p>
