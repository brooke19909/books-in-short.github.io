The main boom around the "bluetooth" devices fell asleep three or four years ago, and some second-tier companies somehow completely disappeared from the market.  The venerable brands narrowed the segment to reasonable limits, completely shaking up their lines.  Experts say with confidence that such an abundance of wireless headsets, which was the same five years ago, will no longer be. </p>

The box is made of very good and high-quality cardboard, which is easy to throw out after unpacking.

The manufacturer‚Äôs approach to packaging can be called scrupulous. </p><p>  Going on a long journey, you can easily pack the entire contents of the box into a case, without worrying that a carbine, battery or charger will travel around the suitcase.  There are simply no any unnecessary or unnecessary things in the Plantronics Discovery 975 kit, and the explanatory instructions will clearly tell and tell you how and what to do, so it‚Äôs simply unrealistic to get lost with the headset. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Most of the owners liked the past models of the series: the devices worked properly, but many were confused by the ‚Äúbeak‚Äù, which immediately caught my eye when looking at the gadget from the side.  The headset was lightweight and original, but the manufacturer somehow ‚Äúon an amateur‚Äù complicated the appearance, instead of making a regular and familiar microphone foot. </p>

    <p>  The new Plantronics Discovery 975 gadget received a logical development of design ideas: a small base where the chip is hidden, a thin microphone leg and a battery that fully matches the dimensions of the gadget. </p><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  The design is made of fairly high-quality silver-colored plastic, and, unlike previous generations, it is not easily soiled, not shiny and does not collect dust and all kinds of dirt like a vacuum cleaner.  In addition, the new ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù headset Plantronics Discovery 975 received a leather insert on the front panel - made great, unusual and sensible. </p><p>  As for the build quality, there are no complaints: nothing backlash, creaks and crunches.  The weight of the gadget is only eight grams, so you simply will not notice its presence, which means that Plantronics Discovery 975 is also in order with ergonomics. Owner reviews have repeatedly noted the convenience of the model and the manufacturer‚Äôs truly competent approach to the whole design. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  The nozzles included in the kit remained as comfortable as in the case with the previous generation, and the diameter of the speaker is correctly adjusted, which means there are no problems with the ‚Äúweight‚Äù of the device.  Silicone pads are additionally equipped with fasteners, so even with active sports, the Plantronics Discovery 975 headset will remain on your head. </p>

    <p>  Judging by the reviews of the owners, for some users the accessory is not quite suitable, somewhere due to the specific structure of the ear, and somewhere because of a unique kind of activity, but such an overwhelming minority.  In any case, the instruction manual lists almost all professions that for some reason are incompatible with the use of this accessory. </p><h2>  Functional </h2><p>  The Plantronics Discovery 975 (Bluetooth) headset comes with just two function buttons.  A small and rectangular key is used to adjust the volume and mute the microphone if the call is moderately on hold. </p><p>  Another multifunctional button is not visually visible, but it is felt under a leather insert.  It is designed to answer incoming calls, end a conversation, switch between two lines, transfer a call to a phone, and also turn a Plantronics Discovery 975 headset on and off. </p>

    <p>  The firmware downloaded from the official source does not change the buttons in any way, while amateur drains allow, albeit slightly, to expand the capabilities of the device.  If you want, you can experiment with them, but then flashing in the company center, if something goes wrong, will cost a tidy sum.  In most cases, the ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù problem is solved by the Plantronics Discovery 975 hard reset (Hard Reset). To do this, just press both buttons simultaneously and hold them for ten seconds. </p><p>  Among other things, the headset is equipped with service voice messages that will notify you of most of the standard features and low battery.  A very useful addition, which, by the way, can be easily turned off if the female voice in your ear is slightly fed up. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The manufacturer said five hours of continuous talking.  After field trials, it turned out that for such a small accessory - a very good indicator.  You can charge the device using the micro-USB port at the end of the gadget.  The first charge lasts about two hours, and all subsequent ones are slightly less - about an hour or so. </p><h2>  Battery case </h2><p>  The previous 925th model possessed such an accessory, but in the new Plantronics Discovery 975 this point was perfected, as they say, ‚Äúdopilil‚Äù.  Now on the case itself you can see a small display, where the charging indicators of the headset itself and the battery built into the case are conveniently located. </p>

    <p>  A special button is provided for removing the gadget, which is very convenient.  Also on the case itself there is a small loop where, using the carabiner that comes with the kit, you can safely attach the entire structure to jeans or trousers (also great and practical).  Users in their reviews have repeatedly thanked the manufacturer for the thoughtful design - it was done conveniently and as it should. </p><h2>  Case Features </h2><p>  The operating principle of the battery case itself is quite simple.  If the charge of Plantronics Discovery 975 is approaching a critical indicator, then all you need to do is just put the headset in its case and leave the gadget alone for an hour.  Watching the charge indicator, you can decide for yourself when the device can be used again.  Of course, there are some disadvantages in the whole process: you cannot use the headset while recharging in a case, but it's still better than looking for a nearby outlet. </p><p>  The battery life of the gadget with the case, according to the manufacturer, is already 15 hours of continuous talking, and this is a very decent indicator.  The case itself charges in about two and a half hours through a micro-USB port similar to the headset. </p><h2>  Transmission quality </h2><p>  The protocol according to which Bluetooth works, though not the most up-to-date (2.1), but nevertheless it showed itself perfectly in work.  It is possible to connect up to two phones at a time when removing no more than five meters. </p><p>  In addition, a well-implemented scheme for working with two microphones, coupled with wind protection using WindSmart technology.  The latter copes with its task perfectly thanks to the holes of a peculiar shape in the microphone and its own acoustic coating, which kind of envelops the speaker.  There is a completely sensible automatic volume control, and that pleases - with the ability to mute. </p><p>  The 925th model was already distinguished by excellent speech transmission indicators, and our respondent was even more successful in this matter.  Specifically, the quality of the conversation on the headset paired with an iPhone is noticeably better than from the phone itself, not to mention the other Androids.  By and large, the interlocutor at that end does not even notice that communication is going on through the headset. </p><p>  Talking on the street even during the most ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù rush hour can be quite comfortable.  Here, even the fact is that, rather, you will not hear the person at that end, while he will easily understand your words.  As an assistant for the driver, the accessory showed its best side: juicy sound without any cacophony, preserving notes characteristic of your timbre, loud sound, convenience - in general, the gadget is ideal for a car. </p><h2>  Impression of work </h2><p>  The main impression of using the headset, judging by the reviews of the owners, is the lack of discomfort while wearing.  Many, by virtue of a profession or for other reasons, are forced to wear a gadget for almost 12 hours, and for all this time the ear does not get tired and does not rub.  This was facilitated by soft gel nozzles and a very tiny weight of the device. </p>

    <p>  If you use the device not as a dispatcher, but as an everyday accessory, then the battery charge (both in the case and in the headset itself) is enough for about a couple of weeks. </p><p>  The control of the gadget is so simple and intuitive that the instruction sometimes seems superfluous.  A pleasant female voice will tell you that you are away from the source of communication or about a critical indicator of the battery.  "Girl" does not bother at all, and the desire to turn it off does not arise.  In general, judging by the reviews of the owners, the impression of the work of all at least four and a half points, and most often five. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  As for some of the minuses of the device, they can‚Äôt be found even with the most scrupulous inspection and use of the gadget, but there are plenty of pluses. </p><p>  Advantages of the Plantronics headset: </p><ul><li>  excellent performance of voice data transmission; </li><li>  the presence of a case with its own battery for a significant increase in battery life; </li><li>  The headset is intuitive and ergonomic; </li><li>  unusual and interesting appearance, but at the same time classically simple; </li><li>  rich scope of supply. </li></ul><p>  The price of the device, although slightly overestimated, but experts consider it more or less adequate.  Despite the fact that the gadget is very beautiful, adding one or two thousand rubles, you can take the flagship from Jawbone, and this is a completely different elite level. </p><p>  In any case, if you need a really high-quality and sensible headset in many respects, then the 975th model from Plantronics is a great option.  We can safely say that the money that you pay for this gadget will not be wasted, and you will become the owner of the fashion item from a reputable brand. </p><p>  Verdict - recommended for purchase. </p>
