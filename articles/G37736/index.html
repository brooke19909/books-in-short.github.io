Of course, all this is true, and this is enough to choose this island for relaxation. </p><p>  In fact, it now has a different name - Kerkyra (with emphasis on the first syllable).  The old is preserved from the time when this territory belonged to Italy.  In addition to the Russian language, the same name appears as the main one in a number of European languages, although the official name is still indicated on the maps. </p><p>  The island is located in the <span>Ionian Sea,</span> off the western coast of mainland Greece, and stretches along it for 65 kilometers.  Its northern tip begins near the territory of Albania.  To the west is Italy. </p><p>  The average annual temperature on the island is 22 degrees above zero.  The rainy season lasts from October to March, the rest of the time Kerkyra is a real paradise for tourists.  So, what to look at Corfu to leave here with the best impressions? </p>

    <h2>  Island history </h2><p>  In order to understand what to look at Corfu, you need to look into its past.  After learning a little about its history, you can understand what will be the most interesting.  And there is something to learn. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At different times, Corfu was a colony of Corinth, came under the rule of Sparta, united with Athens, was part of the Roman, and later the Byzantine Empire.  In the Middle Ages, the island was repulsed several times by representatives of the cities of modern Italy, and Venice ruled it for about 400 years.  Not long Corfu also visited the territory of Turkey, and in the XIX century - even France.  Having been under British rule for some time, in the end (in 1864) he finally became part of Greece, although Italy had occupied it several times during several wars. </p><p>  Corfu is interesting because some ancient buildings and even part of the old city of Kerkyra, located north of the modern one, have been preserved here.  In addition, it is obvious that the Venetian culture had a great influence.  Architecture, art, even the features of the local language - all reflect the four-century dominance of Italians.  And it gives a special charm. </p>

    <h2>  In the myths of ancient Greece </h2><p>  Even the name of this island comes from the name of a nymph - the Greeks respect their legends so much.  Kerkyra was abducted by the god of the seas Poseidon.  And if before that, according to Homer, the island was called Scheria, then later it was named after the nymph for whom he became a new home. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Largest cities in Corfu </h2><p>  According to the 2001 census, just over 110 thousand people live in Kerkyra.  So there is no need to talk about truly large settlements. </p><p>  The most populous remains the island's capital - Kerkyra or Corfu, located on the east coast.  Almost 25 thousand people live here.  There are several more towns and villages, but the most popular, except the capital, are Paleokastritsa and Perama.  Hotels are mainly located on the coast, but there is always some kind of settlement nearby, so you should not worry about infrastructure. </p><h2>  Major tourist attractions </h2><p>  So what to look at Corfu?  Of course, every traveler will answer this question in his own way, but there are also traditionally popular tourist places here.  Among other things, the island is very picturesque, especially its northern part.  Fortresses Citadel and Angelokastro, numerous churches and monasteries, museums, Pontikonisi, Paleokastritsa - Corfu offers a choice for every taste.  So what is the first place to visit? </p><ul><li>  The old city of Kerkyra.  In 2007, it was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, so it‚Äôs worth a look at least with one eye.  Narrow streets, baroque architecture, balconies, elegant windows, arches - literally everything here reminds of Italy. </li><li>  Vlacherna Monastery.  The snow-white building is extremely popular among tourists, probably due to the fact that Pontikonisi is nearby. </li><li>  Church of St. Spyridon.  This place is literally a symbol of Corfu.  Almost every visitor brings home photos of this church.  The relics of St. Spyridon are stored in the temple, which once a year, on Easter, are carried throughout the city. </li><li>  Old and New Fortress.  In Greek, they are respectively called Paleo Frurio and Neo Frurio.  The old one was built by the Venetians, now it has been restored and used for cultural events, although not all buildings have been preserved.  They began to build a new one (even if it bears such a name) even earlier.  A stunning panoramic view opens from its walls, contrasting with the gloom of its interiors.  They say that under the fortress there is a whole maze of underground passages.  And now here is the base of the navy. </li><li>  Liston Street.  It was designed by a French architect and is very reminiscent of Rivoli.  Previously, only people belonging to the highest circles of society could walk on it.  Now there are boutiques, restaurants and cafes. </li><li>  Spianada Square.  It is considered the largest on the island and the main one in the city.  There are a large number of museums, several Christian churches and a beautiful park. </li><li>  Paleokastritsa.  Corfu, although it is the largest city, is not always the most interesting.  Therefore, it is worth visiting the neighboring coast, especially since a beautiful beach is located here, and the views are extremely picturesque. </li><li>  Canoni.  This area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKerkyra is charming at sunset.  Here you can see the approach of aircraft for landing, and many tourists consider this a wonderful sight. </li><li>  Pontikonisi, or Mouse Island.  Corfu is surrounded on all sides by small patches of land, and although not all of them are popular, this is often visited by tourists.  Despite the name, there are no mice, just in the form of Pontikonisi resembles a rodent.  According to legend, before it was the ship of Odyssey, which angry Poseidon turned into an island. </li><li>  Pantocrator.  The highest point of the island, from where a stunning panorama opens and you can even see the coast of Albania. </li></ul>

    <p>  In general, the easiest way is to rent a car or a scooter for a few days and go around the whole island in search of your own unique experiences, especially since it is unlikely to take much time.  So, to get from Kerkyra to Paleokastritsa, you need to drive only about 20-30 kilometers. </p><p>  <span>Attractions of the island of Corfu</span> (Greece), of course, are not limited to this.  Amazing nature, clean sea air, the atmosphere of Italy, museums full of antiquities - here literally every stone breathes history.  So why not enjoy it? </p>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Of course, many tourists do not think about what to look at Corfu, but just want to lie down in the sun and splash into the sea.  They will also be satisfied, because the island has many diverse beaches, lagoons and bays.  The most famous of them is Paleokastritsa.  Corfu, however, does not end up with a collection of its beaches: the rocky Perulades, located in the north of the island, the sandy Agios Gordis and Glyfada, perfect for children.  It should be noted that on the east side the sea is calmer, the most fashionable hotels are located here. </p><p>  Another interesting beach is the romantic French name "Channel of Love", because two rocks, forming a small bay in the shape of a heart, according to legend, used to be two lovers, but they were separated.  The couple who will swim together the bay, according to the sign, will be together forever, and those who are just looking for their love will swim through the natural tunnel in the hope that this will help them soon find happiness.  This beach is a kind of attraction and is very popular among tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Other entertainments </h2><p>  Young people will also be interested here, because the natural conditions make it possible to engage in such sports as diving, snorkeling, kayaking, yachting.  It is possible that under water there are not such picturesque views as in the Red Sea, but the abundance of caves perfectly compensates for this.  Of course, there are bars and nightclubs for those who prefer not to sleep until the morning.  Water parks, with hotels and not only, are suitable for families.  In the end, you can simply bring a fishing rod with you, as many Europeans do, and calmly meditate while looking at the float. </p><h2>  Neighboring Islands and Territories </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Corfu occupies a very small area, many tourists come back here again and again.  Naturally, they have no desire to look at the same attractions, so many go on short trips to Albania, Italy and mainland Greece, as well as to neighboring islands, for example, Paxos and Antipaxos, which, according to legend, were once part of Kerkyra, but Poseidon separated them with a trident blow, so that he had a quiet place to rest.  The ferry service is established, so that traveling and excursions on the island of Corfu and in its vicinity will not be a problem.  Of course, someone will say that in this case you should not go to Kerkyra, but the indescribable atmofer attracts tourists here again and again. </p>

    <h2>  Other recommendations </h2><p>  Since Kerkyra is a <span>Greek island,</span> the same visa rules apply as in the rest of the country.  It is best to get a long-term Schengen visa, providing for multiple entries, especially since consulate workers in recent years have begun to treat Russians more favorably. </p><p>  Do not get hung up on one restaurant located nearby.  Greek cuisine is beautiful and amazing, and if you go away from tourist places, you can enjoy its authenticity with a glass of local wine. </p>
