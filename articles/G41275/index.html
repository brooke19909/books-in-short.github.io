    <h2>  Work and work again </h2><p>  The first thing you can do when you urgently need money with open loans is to get a part-time job.  In other words, do not get into regular debts, but simply earn the necessary amount.  It is not so simple, but possible. </p><p>  Typically, this method is good for those who are not "on fire" loan.  That is, money is needed urgently, but not instantly.  If there is the slightest likelihood of self-raising funds, try to use it.  The only way you can not get yourself into the "debt hole". </p><p>  In practice, such an exit is rarely successful.  And people are trying to think more actively about where to borrow money urgently.  Indeed, repaying debts in the future is sometimes much easier than earning money on your own in the shortest possible time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Relatives </h2><p>  Who should I contact if I have any problems?  To the closest!  So, if you are thinking about where to borrow money urgently, even if there are outstanding loans and borrowings, you can try to contact your family.  They will definitely help you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to borrow money urgently even if there are outstanding loans" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1316496.jpg"></div>

    <p>  True, this method is also not suitable for everyone.  Of great importance is the relationship in which you and your relative borrower, as well as its nature.  If all is well, the person is responsive and kind, you are on friendly terms, you can borrow money even without interest.  And give either partially or completely at a certain point. </p><p>  But when a relative is not very kind or you are just in a bad relationship, you should not mess with him.  Often, such people are asked to give a loan with interest.  Or even in the future they begin to ‚Äúsaw‚Äù for the material support given to you, even if you have been fully calculated for a long time.  As practice shows, it is also preferable not to take money from parents.  Not a loan, not just like that. </p><h2>  Friends </h2><p>  Where to borrow money urgently without interest?  Another rather interesting method of solving the problem is to contact your friends and comrades.  This option is more acceptable for responsible people.  Even if they already have some kind of debt. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The advantages include the lack of interest on the loan.  Some, of course, require them, but these are not such frequent cases.  Also, you are always able with your friends to agree on the term of repayment of the "loan". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to borrow money urgently from a private person" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1316497.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Try not to have outstanding loans.  Some people tend to distrust citizens with debts.  And if you "delay" the payment of a friend, and this is not the first time, you risk losing the trust of the person.  A loan from relatives and comrades is more suitable for citizens in charge.  Or just those who are trusted. </p><h2>  "Private traders" </h2><p>  Where to borrow money urgently?  At the private person.  More precisely, any acquaintance or stranger.  True, on receipt.  As a rule, you can ask people for help.  And some of them will agree to help you. </p><p>  However, with open loans, certain problems may arise.  Not too willingly people borrow money to those who did not repay the loan on time.  That is why "private traders" give money only against receipt.  It will indicate how much you have taken.  And here the amount that must be paid in the future is prescribed.  Dates are also indicated. </p><p>  A receipt is a document that gives a "private trader" certain guarantees.  He has every right to go to court if you try to ‚Äúevade‚Äù the repayment of a loan or credit.  You can find such people through announcements (in newspapers or on the Internet).  As an option - just contact your friend with a similar request.  For receipts, money is often trusted in practice.  Therefore, your chances of success are not so small. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to borrow money urgently without interest" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1316495.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Redemption </h2><p>  Thinking about where to borrow money urgently?  Frankly, the best solution to the problem is to pay off existing debt.  After that, you will be able to simply contact the bank for a new loan. </p><p>  Perhaps this method only theoretically takes place.  Indeed, with open loans, few have a real chance of repaying thereof.  And that means that not everyone can do it.  Just take it as a possible alternative. </p><h2>  Appeal to the bank </h2><p>  Where to borrow money urgently, even if there are outstanding loans?  Contact a small bank in your city.  Maybe they will give you a loan.  Although such an action may be considered illegal.  With open loans, banking organizations usually refuse new ones. </p><p>  But you can hope for good luck.  In some cases, employees either intentionally make concessions (if there is good reason with evidence), or they can inadvertently give you a loan without paying attention to the existing loan.  Also not too common option, but it does. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to borrow money urgently to a card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1316500.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  MFI </h2><p>  And now more interesting and effective methods.  If you are thinking about where to borrow money urgently (by card or in cash), contact microfinance organizations.  They usually offer microloans and loans without additional paperwork.  A very good way to get cash. </p><p>  Where specifically go?  For example, in Micro Money, Quick Money, and so on.  Any microfinance organization that issues passport funds will do.  Accordingly, in order to get a loan, it is enough just to present an identity card.  Namely a passport.  Everything else is not important for MFIs.  If you want to receive funds on the card (some companies offer this service), provide its details in addition. </p><p>  The method is very good, but it has one significant drawback - this is the interest rate.  Taking, for example, 10,000 per month, you will have to give in the amount of about 12-13.  In general, overpayments in such organizations are very large.  Not everyone is ready to decide on such a step. </p><p>  Another disadvantage is that if you have arrears to MFIs, collectors will start talking to you almost instantly.  And the debt repayments will be disturbed for a long time after repayment of the loan in full.  Therefore, before contacting MFIs, think carefully about whether this is necessary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to get money urgently to a card without refusal" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1316501.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Internet Services </h2><p>  Where to get money urgently to a card and without failure?  The last good way is to access a variety of Internet services.  They, as a rule, allow literally a few minutes to receive money on a card or electronic wallet. </p><p>  All that is required of you is to find the right service.  There are a lot of them on the Internet.  Filing an application is as simple as possible - fill out the form where your passport details, bank card details, and also the loan amount are indicated.  Do not forget to leave a number to contact you.  After some time (from 10 minutes to several hours), the manager will call you back and inform you of the approval or rejection of the request.  Or you will receive an SMS message with the result of processing the operation. </p><p>  For the convenience of users, such services usually even offer special calculators.  They will show how much you will need to return if you take a specific amount of money for the period you set earlier.  No surprises - you can always find out how much the organization pays. </p><p>  But there are also a number of drawbacks.  If you are thinking about where to borrow money urgently, even if you have outstanding loans, and decided to turn to virtual services, get ready for huge overpayments.  Interest rates are usually high here.  Even more than in MFIs. </p><p>  Also, often Internet services are simply fraudulent sites.  A loan is issued for you, but you do not receive any money.  But you still have to pay.  Otherwise, you will deal with collection companies.  Therefore, try not to use this method.  And resort to it only in extreme cases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to get money urgently to a card and without refusal" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1316498.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear where to get the money urgently to the card without failure.  And what places to apply for a cash loan, too.  The following sources are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  relatives; </li><li>  friends </li><li>  money lenders and "private traders"; </li><li>  banks; </li><li>  microfinance companies; </li><li>  credit online services. </li></ul><p>  In addition, you can first pay off your existing debt or just earn the missing amount of money.  Among all the methods, the appeal to relatives and usurers most often enjoys success.  But different MFIs and Internet services are better off.  It‚Äôs painful a lot of fraud, they conceal in themselves.  Remember - not a single conscientious company will contact a person who already has an outstanding loan. </p>
