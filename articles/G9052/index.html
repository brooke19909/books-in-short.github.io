  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to rent an apartment</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern life makes people more mobile.  Very often, citizens change their place of work and place of residence, moving to another city, or even a country.  Moreover, sometimes a slave is provided under a contract for a certain period.  This means that the acquisition of permanent housing is impractical and such citizens will need rental housing. </p><p>  As you know, demand creates supply.  Therefore, in large cities, the rental housing market is very large.  For example, options offered on <noindex>  <span>http://www.sdam-dom.ru/</span> </noindex>  . </p><p>  However, if just recently it was possible to rent almost any housing for decent money, now during the crisis, prices have fallen significantly due to lower demand. </p><p>  What needs to be done in order to quickly and profitably rent an apartment? </p><ol><li>  Work is only necessary through agencies.  This will not only protect against fraud, but also will attract really respectable tenants.  In addition, specialists who have been working in the real estate market for more than a year will better be able to focus on the advantages of housing and smooth out some unpleasant aspects.  Each agency has experience working with advertising agencies and rental advertisements will be held to the maximum extent, as well as on their websites: <noindex>  <span>http://www.sdam-dom.ru/sdat.php</span> </noindex></li><li>  The cost of rental housing depends not only on the number of rooms and area, but also on the degree of comfort: the presence of a washing machine, microwave, TV, other household appliances, as well as Internet access.  When concluding a contract with an agency, you can be sure that tenants will not hit the price by bargaining with you.  Realtors study prices very well in the area where they work. </li><li>  When renting an apartment, it is very important who will live in it.  Often, the cost of repairs after tenants exceeds the benefits received.  Therefore, you need to check all the documents of the new residents, look at the place of registration.  Agencies provide security services free of charge, which will check the reliability and solvency of potential tenants. </li><li>  In cases when the apartment is rented for the first time after repair or for a certain period of time during the absence of the owners: a long business trip or travel, you can specify with the realtor who exactly you would like to see as a tenant.  For example: a married couple or students, animal lovers, so that they look after your pet at the same time or a lonely business woman.  This will avoid further misunderstandings with the tenants and get a decent and guaranteed payment for housing. </li></ol><p>  To help new residents, write a memo with useful phone numbers for emergency services, medical institutions, cafes with a delivery service, addresses of the nearest pharmacies, shops, and markets.  Perhaps, moving out of the apartment they will recommend you to their friends. </p></div></article>
