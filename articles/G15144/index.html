This allows you to make a more complete and close to the real state of affairs picture of the hotel you liked.  In this regard, to save your time, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized comments of our compatriots regarding their recent stay in Vassos Nissi Plage 4 * (Ayia Napa). </p>

    <p>  Just note that the vast majority of reviews are positive.  So, according to tourists, this hotel is consistent with both its category and the cost of living. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  As guests of the hotel note in their reviews, they were mostly satisfied with the apartments offered to them here.  So, tourists say that the hotel is new.  Therefore, the rooms here are freshly renovated, stylishly decorated, with new furniture and appliances.  Many liked the fact that the apartments have everything you need - from disposable slippers and a hairdryer to hangers in the closet and clothes dryers on the balcony.  Also, the bathroom has everything that is needed for hygiene procedures - shampoo, shower gel, cotton buds, soap, toilet paper, etc. Moreover, supplies of bath-toilet accessories are replenished as necessary. </p><p>  Many guests praise comfortable furniture in the rooms.  But some guests noted that instead of the apartments with one large bed they booked, they were accommodated in rooms with two beds.  Moreover, the berths were on wheels and parted.  However, this problem could very easily be solved by reporting about their inconvenience at the reception.  The administrator soon sent a master who fastened the beds together and replaced two single mattresses with one double.  The result was a very comfortable berth. </p><p>  Also in their reviews, tourists note the presence of a safe in the rooms.  You can use it for an additional fee of two euros per day.  Wireless internet is also available for a fee.  So, Wi-Fi will cost you 5 euros per day or 20 euros per week.  According to the guests, it does not always work stably. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel vassos nissi plage 4" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1025777.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Check-in, cleaning </h2><p>  Since the hotel Vassos Nissi Plage 4 * today is very popular among tourists from different countries, at the height of the holiday season, it is almost always completely filled with guests.  In this regard, if you arrive at the hotel early in the morning, then you should not hope for an early check-in.  However, our compatriots note that the reception administrators always do everything possible to accommodate newly arrived tourists as quickly as possible.  Therefore, in most cases, you do not have to wait until the scheduled two o'clock in the afternoon, and you will be able to check in the room as soon as the previous guests have released it and the maids have properly prepared it.  By the way, upon arrival at the hotel you do not have to sit at the reception.  So, you can go for breakfast, to the pool or immediately visit the beach. </p><p>  As for the cleaning of the rooms, then, as our compatriots note, its quality directly depends on the maid.  So, someone in their reviews claims that in their apartments they constantly performed high-quality not only dry, but also wet cleaning, and someone says that the maids forgot to even wipe the dust. </p><p>  Be that as it may, towels were changed regularly, and bed linen was renewed every two days. </p><h2>  Location, Territory </h2><p>  The location of the Vassos Nissi Plage 4 * (Cyprus) under consideration by us, many tourists found very successful.  So, it is located very close to the beach.  Also in its vicinity there are many restaurants, shops, travel agencies and other tourist infrastructure facilities.  But at the same time, the hotel is far from nightclubs and bars where music rumbles until night.  Therefore, hotel guests can count on a restful sleep. </p><p>  As for its own territory, ‚ÄúVassos Nissi Beach‚Äù, it is small, like most hotels in Cyprus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vassos nissi plage 4 ayia napa" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1025776.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  As travelers noted in their comments, most of them chose the half board option when booking a room.  That is, breakfast and dinner were included in their price.  In general, they were satisfied with their choice.  However, according to them, you will not lose if you prefer to pay only for breakfast.  So, in the morning the restaurant offers a wide selection of dishes - from a variety of side dishes, cereals, fruits, dairy products to sausage and cheese, omelettes, fried eggs, boiled eggs, delicious pastries and sweets.  A varied menu is also available for dinner and lunch.  So, there are always available dishes of meat, poultry, fish, seafood.  Please note that drinks are only free at breakfast.

    <p>  If you choose half board or only breakfast, then you can eat during the day in one of the taverns located in the vicinity of the hotel, or in Ayia Napa restaurants or places where you will go on an excursion.  Tourists note that the portions here are very large, so the waiter should check the size of the dish in advance.  Indeed, many travelers complained that they simply could not eat even half of the dishes brought by them. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of our compatriots, lovers to soak up the sun and swim in the warm sea, the Vassos Nissi Plage 4 * hotel (Ayia Napa) will be to your taste.  After all, it is located next to the popular Nissi Beach.  To get on it, you just need to go outside the hotel and go through the roadway.  This beach is in municipal ownership, so you need to pay for renting a sunbed and an umbrella (about 2.5 euros).  Experienced travelers are advised to go to the sea in the morning, as already in the afternoon there may not be free sunbeds.  The beach itself here, according to tourists, is very large, with a pleasant, fine snow-white sand.  The sea is warm, clean, with a gentle entry into the water.  There are bars and cafes along the beach where you can enjoy a drink or a snack.  By the way, <span>beach towels</span> can be taken at the hotel on a security deposit of 10 euros.  They can be exchanged for clean every day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cyprus hotel vassos nissi plage 4" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1025774.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Like most hotels in Cyprus, Vassos Nissi Beach does not offer its guests a special entertainment program.  So, you can‚Äôt count on daily animation here.  However, the hotel has a large swimming pool with a sun terrace, where you can have a good time.  There is also a children's pool.  Those who wish can play tennis and use the gym. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  The overwhelming majority of our compatriots, judging by the comments they left, were delighted with the staff of the Vassos Nissi Plage 4 * hotel.  According to them, the staff here are very welcoming, friendly, always happy to help.  In addition, many hotel workers speak Russian, which greatly facilitates the process of communication. </p>
