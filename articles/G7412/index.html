Before the appearance of the new ExpoForum center, it was the largest in the North-West region, and now it is in second place.  Lenexpo is much more convenient to get to, because it is located in the city center. </p><h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  The exhibition complex consists of 9 pavilions, not counting small buildings for employees and the administration of the center.  They have 8 conference rooms.  The scale can only be imagined: the total territory covers 15 hectares, and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe pavilions is 40,000 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  The complex of buildings is located on Nalichnaya street, next to the customs terminals of the seaport.  The area around the 8th and 7th pavilion is covered with asphalt, so it is very hot in summer sunny weather. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lenexpo how to get" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64128/2168977.jpg"></div>

    <p>  How to get to Lenexpo?  Address: Bolshoy Avenue V.O., building 103. From Nalichnaya street you need to turn in the opposite direction from Srednegavansky Avenue - here is the entrance for visitors. </p><p>  At Lenexpo, getting to Pavilion 3 is a bit difficult.  The fact is that the 3rd pavilion is similar to pavilions 1 and 2, but they go in order.  Facing the main entrance, the numbering of the pavilions begins on the left, which means that the 3rd can be easily found closer to the center of the complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get on the subway </h2><p>  Both from <span>the</span> Primorskaya <span>metro station</span> and from the Vasileostrovskaya station, and even more so from the Sportivnaya-2 station, it is problematic to get to the Lenexpo on foot.  The nearest station is approximately 2.2 km away, and the journey takes about 25 minutes on foot. </p><p>  Due to the long distance, visitors often use two types of public transport.  Upon reaching the Primorskaya metro station, change onto bus number 128, which leaves immediately from the stop near the metro lobby, 10 meters from the entrance.  True, this bus makes a detour across the Shipbuilders street, but it does not take much time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lenexpo 7 pavilion how to get" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64128/2168980.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Departing from the <span>Vasileostrovskaya metro station,</span> take buses No. 1 or No. 152.  They walk along the 8th line to Lieutenant Schmidt's Embankment, then turn off to Sredny Prospekt via line 22 and go to Bolshoy Prospect along Detskaya Street.  You need to get off at the Sredny Prospekt stop on Gavanskaya Street.  On the left hand you will see a small square with a cruciform path and a flowerbed in the middle.  From the stop, go straight along Sredny Prospect to the complex itself. </p><p>  Travelers leaving the violet metro line (from the Sportivnaya station on the 1st line of V.O.) can use the same bus No. 1.  Its route is duplicated by the k-30 minibus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tram to the exhibition center </h2><p>  The only tram passing by the exhibition complex is numbered 6. The route originates from Korablestroiteley Street, passes along Nalichnaya Street past the Primorskaya station.  The stop, as for bus No. 1, is located near Sredny Prospekt along Gavanskaya Street.  Then the tram goes through the entire Sredny Prospect to the Vasileostrovskaya station, and then to the exit from the Sportivnaya metro station on the 1st line of V.O. </p><p>  Due to frequent traffic jams on Sredniy in the evening, a tram is the best way to get to Lenexpo from one of the metro stations on Vasilyevsky Island. </p><h2>  Buses and minibuses </h2><p>  Minibus number 350 goes through the entire city from the south: from the ring in Kupchino to Korablestroiteley Street on Moskovsky Prospekt.  It runs along all metro stations of the blue line to the Spasskaya metro station, from which on Sadovaya it turns to Rimsky-Korsakov Avenue and Glinka Street to go to V.O.  over the Annunciation bridge.  Route No. 124 runs from the bus station on the <span>Obvodny Canal,</span> through the Zvenigorod and Technological Institute, also turning off to Blagoveshchensky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lenexpo pavilion 3 how to get" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64128/2168982.jpg"></div>

    <p>  You can also get to Lenexpo from the Baltiysky Station, just take minibus number 62, which, like the two previous ones, will allow you to get to the exhibition complex through the bridge from Promenade des Anglais. </p><h2>  Personal transport </h2><p>  You can easily reach the complex by car yourself.  There are several car parks on the territory of the center, access to the complexes is via Nalichnaya street.  It is necessary to turn off from it opposite Srednegavansky Avenue to exit to the parking lots. </p><p>  The 7 Pavilion is most popular at Lenexpo.  How to get to it?  Traditionally, major mass exhibitions and events are held there.  After turning from Srednegavansky Avenue, you need to go straight and to the right - after about 200 meters you will see how to get to Lenexpo.  Pavilion 7 is huge, its scale is estimated by visitors at a glance.  Signs are everywhere, and the building immediately attracts attention. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lenexpo address how to get" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64128/2168985.jpg"></div>

    <p>  By the way, parking at Lenexpo is paid, one hour will cost 60 rubles, a day will cost 350 rubles, and 1300 can be paid for the possibility of parking for the entire period of the exhibition or event.  Many visitors to the exhibition center simply enjoy free parking at the nearby Metrika construction store, leaving cars there for an unlimited amount of time. </p>
