    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sequence </h2><p>  The child‚Äôs desire to learn how to make nails out of paper will increase if before that he already saw them from someone or watched some favorite children's film with a monster that had huge claws, or with a princess with neat and well-groomed hands.  Depending on the desired form of crafts, a manufacturing method is also chosen.  If you want to have very <span>long nails,</span> they are simply connected together with glue.  The material will be a regular sheet of medium density (for example, notebook).  You can take white, but you can color.  Children who like to play vampires also make black nails.  However, this is a matter of taste and momentary preferences. </p><h2>  Working process </h2><p>  The following is a description of how to make paper nails: </p><ol><li>  A sheet is taken. </li><li>  On the left corner it folds diagonally. </li><li>  Then the same thing needs to be done on the right side. </li><li>  Once again, from the same angle, a sheet is folded diagonally. </li><li>  From the right side, the figure bends in half and begins to resemble a house. </li><li>  The angle from the bottom to the left is bent. </li><li>  The same thing is done on the right. </li><li>  The result is a rhombus that needs to be folded in half. </li><li>  Now the task is to give the nail a shape, for which a 30 ¬∞ angle is bent in a circle.  This is done 3 times in a row. </li><li>  The last corner is wrapped and inserted inward, fixed. </li><li>  The nail is given a voluminous appearance and the pocket for the desired finger is already made directly. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make paper nails with your own hands" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/416110.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ol><h2>  Another way </h2><p>  Consider another option on how to make paper nails.  For girls, this will be a very exciting activity.  To make false nails you may need: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - multi-colored paper; </p><p>  - pencils; </p><p>  - manicure set; </p><p>  - simple scissors; </p><p>  - nail polish, preferably transparent. </p><h2>  Stages </h2><p>  Using a manicure set, finger nails are prepared: they are trimmed, filed, the remains of the old varnish, if any, are removed.  Then, on a paper of good quality, each individual nail is drawn, even with a margin in size, so that later it would not be offensive if it turns out less than necessary.  Drawn layouts are very neatly cut.  Finger nails are coated with a clear varnish.  If necessary, it can then be easily removed.  The long-awaited moment has come: prepared paper nails, one by one, are superimposed on the prepared girl's hands.  They must be held for 15 seconds, pressing them to the surface of the fingers.  Here's how to make paper nails.  For girls, this is not only an exciting activity, but also a matter of pride.  You can show your work to a friend or mom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="origami paper nails" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/416111.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  "Glove" </h2><p>  This is a rather original way of making paper nails.  On colored sheets, hands are encircled 2 times each with a sufficient allowance: on the side and in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe fingers.  It must be remembered that after the parts are glued together, you will need to squeeze your hand in, and the form should not be torn.  The resulting blank must be cut carefully.  Using glue we connect the parts.  If desired, cuffs can be made that are prepared in advance by the size of the hand above the palm of the hand, so that the glove looks like a real one.  After complete manufacture, the craftsmanship is decorated at will: multi-colored details are glued, various applications, you can use a geometric composition, you can use vegetable.  Someone might want to paint their <span>paper article.</span>  Here everyone includes his own imagination and ingenuity.  You can add jewelry from beads or stick a finished picture.  Whatever option is chosen, the main thing is that it is selected independently, according to your taste.  So imperceptibly, actually playing, you can lead the child to the development of how to make nails from paper. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself paper nails" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/416109.jpg" width="550"></div>
