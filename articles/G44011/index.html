    <p>  Georgy Brasov is the son of <span>Mikhail Romanov,</span> who was the fourth offspring of <span>Alexander the Third.</span>  At one time (before the birth of Alexei Nikolaevich), he was considered the heir to the throne.  After the elder brother Nicholas II found out about his relationship with Natalia Sheremetyevskaya, who was the wife of Lieutenant Vladimir Wolfert, he stripped Mikhail of all posts and posts.  Also, Mikhail and his wife (by an organic marriage) and their son George were forbidden to be in the territory of the Russian Empire. </p><p>  By the beginning of the war of 1914 - 1918  Michael was able to return to his homeland, command a horse division, and later cavalry. </p><p>  During the 1917 revolution, the emperor, along with his young son, abdicated in favor of Michael.  However, he did not dare to become emperor without taking into account the popular will and refused, urging everyone to submit to the Provisional Government.  After the victory of the revolution, he was first exiled to Gatchina, and later to the <span>Perm province.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In June 1918, <span>Father George was</span> kidnapped from the hotel in which he lived and killed.

    <p>  Georgy Mikhailovich Brasov was the son of Natalya Sergeevna, who in girlhood bore the name Sheremetyevskaya.  The first time she married at the age of sixteen was pianist Sergei Mamontov.  They had a daughter, Natalya. </p><p>  After the divorce, she married Vladimir Wolfert, who served as a lieutenant under the command of Prince Michael. </p><p>  Natalya Sergeevna was a beautiful and experienced woman.  She subdued the younger brother of the emperor.  The second husband, in order to prevent a shameful scandal, agreed to a divorce.  However, Michael did not receive approval from the family because of the simple origin of the bride and the fact that she had already divorced twice. </p><p>  In 1910, a woman gave birth to a son, being officially not married to Mikhail.  The boy was named George in honor of the deceased son of Alexander the Third. </p><p>  In 1918, the wife tried to save her husband, went to meet Lenin, but to no avail.  By cunning, she managed to send the child to Denmark, where he, along with the governess, received asylum.  After the death of her husband, Natalya Sergeevna herself went to prison, from which she escaped by simulating a cold and thanks to the help of her daughter.  First she went to Kiev, then to Odessa, and from there to Europe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  She lived with her children in Paris, selling her jewelry.  A woman died of cancer in poverty and loneliness.  They buried her, like her son, in Passy Cemetery. </p><h2>  Morganatic marriage </h2><p>  Georgy Mikhailovich Brasov was born from the love of a beautiful woman and a decent man, who, moreover, was of noble birth.  Their marriage did not take place immediately because of the expectation of a divorce from the second husband of Natalia Sergeevna and the persistent protest of the emperor's family. </p>

    <p>  However, lovers after the birth of a son nevertheless entered into an organic marriage.  This type of legalization of relations existed in Europe.  He was concluded between persons in an unequal position.  The spouse, who was lower in the social ladder, did not have the right to apply for a higher position due to marriage.  So Natalya Sergeevna, marrying Mikhail Alexandrovich, did not receive the princely title.  Although later the emperor relented and awarded her the count's title.  She received the surname of Brasov thanks to the name of one of the estates of the Grand Duke. </p><h2>  Short biography of George </h2>

    <p>  The son of a couple in love was born on July 24, 1910.  Since he was born before the morganatic marriage, he could not claim the throne.  However, some time after birth, the emperor granted his brother's son the title, recognizing him as a nephew.  Thus, Count Georgi Mikhailovich Brasov appeared. </p>

    <p>  In 1918, at the age of seven, his mother sent him abroad.  Together, they lived first in the UK, and later in France.  In Britain, he studied at St. Leonards College and at Harrow School.  In France, his studies continued at the Roche school.  Upon completion, he entered the Sorbonne. </p><h2>  The death of George </h2><p>  Georgy Mikhailovich Brasov, whose photo was hardly preserved, passed the semester exams in July 1931.  With friends, he decided to go to Cannes for two weeks.  He was supposed to return to his birthday - he soon turned twenty-one. </p><p>  A few hours later, he crashed under the town of Sansa.  His friend died on the spot, and George, who was driving, died in the hospital.  According to eyewitnesses, the car crashed into a tree at great speed. </p>

    <p>  The son died in the morning the day after the accident in his mother‚Äôs arms, never regaining consciousness.  Natalia Brasova brought the body to Paris, bought two places in the cemetery - one for her son, the second for herself.  She spent the last funds on a magnificent funeral and remained in complete poverty. </p><h2>  Interesting information </h2><p>  The car on which Georgy Mikhailovich Brasov crashed was purchased with funds that he inherited from Maria Fedorovna.  She was a former Russian sovereign who died in Denmark.  The Chrysler sports car was a dream that George realized. </p><p>  Georgy Mikhailovich Brasov, whose biography is short but eventful, turned out to be the last surviving grandson of Alexander the Third on the male line.  He was even regarded as a contender for the throne. </p><p>  George's maternal sister, Natalia, lived until 1969.  She, like her mother, was married three times.  The girl first married at eighteen.  Her husband was a future writer, director of the BBC, actor Val Henry Gilguda.  They lived only two years.  <span>The second marriage</span> was with composer Cecil Gray.  He was terminated in 1929, but Pauline's daughter remained.  For the third time, Tata married a naval officer, from whom she gave birth to a daughter, Alexandra. </p>
