Thanks to the spirit of competition, the game does not lose its relevance for both adults and children.  Many parents offer such a pastime even to preschool children, which positively affects the mental development and logical thinking of the child.  The games of parents with children, for example, on a quiet family evening, are also relevant.  This type of relaxing holiday helps to bring generations closer and increases the curiosity of the child. </p><p>  That is how we know checkers today.  But what is the history of checkers?  What was this game before and how exactly was it played? </p><p>  The history of drafts is interesting.  Many adults know her.  The article tells about the tricks of the game and the history of the appearance of checkers.  For children and their parents, only understanding the rules, it can also become informative.  We will tell you in more detail the main points of the game. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chessentials.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to explain a game of chess to a child" class="if uuid-3020205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115182/3020205.jpg"></div><h2>  History of Checkers for Preschool Children </h2><p>  So, two popular games that everyone heard about, and some even played.  Checkers and <span>chess, whose history of origin</span> is very ambiguous, appeared a long time ago.  Let's take a closer look at them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Let's start with the checkers.  The history of the origin of this game originates in ancient Egypt.  It is he who is considered the true homeland of this entertainment.  It was believed that drafts were one of the most favorite activities of the pharaohs, since images of drafts were found in the pyramids of the deceased.  Apparently, the Egyptian rulers were so fond of this sport (that at that time was not related to competitive events) that they wanted to do this even after their own death. </p><p>  It is also impossible not to mention that in times of war, when there was nothing left to do but sit locked up, the prisoners tried to pass the time just by playing a game of checkers.  Convenience was that it was possible to build a playing field from improvised means on absolutely any surface. </p><p>  One of the stories of their origin, the most popular in the 20th century, says that the game itself originated in Russia.  It is believed that the history of Russian drafts originates in Russia.  In our country, the game is associated with Prince Monomakh.  However, one cannot fail to mention that even before the reign of the prince there were references to chess.  So the version is pretty dubious. </p><p>  Nevertheless, it cannot be said that almost every corner of the earth has always met this popular game, whether it be Europe, Asia or even Africa.  Everywhere people tried to have fun studying this type of concentration of thoughts and serious thoughts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chrome.google.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Secrets in checkers" class="if uuid-3020207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115182/3020207.jpg"></div><h2>  Checkers Options </h2><p>  In every culture, this game is played in its own way.  There are many options.  There are Russian, different European and Asian species.  And they all differ in the pattern and variations of the moves. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Let's consider some of them. </p><p>  For example, we all know Russian drafts.  They represent a field where the chips of two players are collected.  Alternately, the participants begin to walk.  The task of the game: "eat" all the chips of the opponent, ahead of him.  There are also additional functions, the transformation of checkers into a lady.  Having reached the end of the opponent's field, the chip becomes her.  Ladies get more benefits and can ‚Äúeat‚Äù twice as fast as their opponent‚Äôs chips. </p><p>  The Chinese type of checkers differs from the Russian in the first place in that there can be more players than in Russian.  The field itself is represented in the form of a star.  In this case, you do not need to beat the chips.  Objective: first to go into the shape of a star on the opponent's field.  If you think this is very simple, then you are mistaken.  Each game has its pitfalls that do not allow you to easily win the victory. </p><p>  The Brazilian look of the game is similar to Russian.  The differences are that players occupy the position of black cells.  White chips move first.  Next, the action takes place alternately.  Objective: Beat all the opponent's checkers first.  They play best in this form on the ladies, they try to save them and do it as much as possible and faster than their opponent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.smithsonianmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Where did the checkers come from?" class="if uuid-3020206" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115182/3020206.jpg"></div><h2>  Secret moves and game strategies </h2><p>  In order to win a game, you need to think through each step and the opponent‚Äôs responses in advance.  Then the win will definitely be secured.  So in checkers.  There are some tricks and combinations to win. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Several major life hacks </h2><p>  From ancient times, the rule came to build a series of chips surrounding the opponent.  Thus, even if he ‚Äúeats‚Äù you, you will have something to beat off from him. </p><p>  Another subtlety of the game is not to waste in vain.  There are players who prefer to beat blindly in order to quickly collect all the chips.  This is not worth it, as an opponent can pick up your chips immediately after you have done so.  It is pointless to sacrifice them, if they then do not remain. </p><p>  Always watch all your checkers.  You may not even notice how your opponent looks at them.  Do not play only ladies, because you can lose much more. </p><h2>  Tricks used in the game </h2><p>  Try to think at least one step faster than your opponent.  It may not be a long-term strategy, but you will think ahead, which will undoubtedly be your advantage. </p><p>  Before the game, set yourself a specific goal.  Maybe you want to make yourself more ladies or, on the contrary, act with ordinary chips on the way to victory.  It is important to understand this immediately in order to prevent a loss. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  As for history, we advise you to familiarize yourself with a number of interesting facts regarding the history of drafts. </p><p>  The first book about the game was written in the 16th century.  It was there that strategies and chances of winning in one case or another could be observed.  People could read a book and learn to win against rivals through competent game management.  This increased their mental abilities and improved their mood. </p><p>  In the Middle Ages, when the religious worldview was especially relevant and the life of a person was determined by the church, there was no fixed prohibition on this game, despite the fact that other games were considered forbidden. </p><p>  Also in the Middle Ages, it was believed that all warriors were required to master this game.  They should not just be able to play, but be able to win.  A warrior who was successful in checkers was almost always successful in military affairs as well as in relations.  This strange relationship contradicts the modern quote: </p><blockquote>  Not lucky in love, lucky in roulette. </blockquote><p>  Nowadays, there are international competitions in this sport.  They are held in Bulgaria and are considered one of the most interesting types of intellectual struggle. </p><p>  In history, there have been such competitions with rules for speed.  Participants had to think, walk as quickly as possible, ahead of the opponent‚Äôs actions. </p><p>  Now everywhere in our country there are numerous interest clubs, for example, there are institutions in which drafts are also popular.  Representatives of such communities gather in different places and train, then to participate and compete with other similar clubs. </p><p>  The most similar game to checkers can be called chess.  Some children confuse these names.  That is why you need to understand the difference between these games in order to distinguish between them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.timesofmalta.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What is the difference between chess and checkers?" class="if uuid-3020203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115182/3020203.jpg"></div><h2>  Chess Development History </h2><p>  Chess is also a rather ancient game.  The stories of the development of checkers and chess are absolutely opposite.  India is still considered the <span>birthplace of chess</span> , although many sources are prepared to challenge this version all the time.  It is believed that the Rajah, who defeated everyone, became bored, and no one could help him.  Then the ordinary peasant showed him this occupation. </p><p>  The difference in games is that in checkers the pieces on the board should move exclusively diagonally and no more.  In chess, pieces can only move forward and only one square.  Also, the rules of ‚Äúeating‚Äù the opponent‚Äôs figures themselves are slightly different. </p><h2>  Types of Chess </h2><p>  There are about thirty different types of this game.  Like checkers, they are divided into Russian, Japanese, etc. And everyone has their own rules, forms of boards, and much more. </p><p>  The classic Russian look suggests a square field.  Purpose of the game: defeat the king, putting him in jeopardy.  Players take turns moving forward one square (except for the horse, which moves with the letter "G").  During the game, much more time is spent thinking about the course than it is to action. </p><p>  The Chinese view involves a rectangular field in the middle of which there is a certain river, which not everyone can cross.  Of course, the names of the game figures and the initial arsenal are much different. </p><p>  In addition to the above, there are also chess, the forms of the fields of which will surprise the Russian person.  These are round, and cylindrical, and many others. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shutterstock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chess Tricks" class="if uuid-3020202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115182/3020202.jpg"></div><h2>  Game strategies </h2><p>  As previously stated, chess is much more complicated.  Due to the slow progress on the big board, the game can stretch in time for several hours, while in checkers the maximum time for one game is up to half an hour. </p><p>  Just as in checkers, there is the possibility of encircling the enemy with several of his soldiers, but only so that he does not have the opportunity to touch them.  This is very difficult, but as practice shows, it is not impossible. </p><p>  Next option: block the move.  The bottom line is to completely immobilize the opponent.  This technique is often used when attacking a boat.  This method allows you to completely surround the queen of the enemy, which can already speak of a win. </p><p>  Next: predicting the opponent‚Äôs step.  If you are a beginner, it will not be easy.  But if you have been playing for a long time, then this life hack is definitely for you.  This will allow you not only to surround the opponent, but also to save your soldiers.  With this move, you can show your opponent not only a competent game, but also your intellectual abilities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chessentials.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to play chess" class="if uuid-3020210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115182/3020210.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Nowadays, chess is played a lot and in different ways. </p><p>  One example is with eyes closed.  It's hard to understand, but it is.  People blindfold themselves and win anyway! </p><p>  Hours during the game are needed to relieve fatigue.  Since the game involves duration, there were people who simply fell asleep during the game.  For this, they came up with such an unusual tool. </p><p>  The possible variations are endless.  It has been scientifically proven that after several moves, countless different options appear to opponents that can hardly be counted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.udemy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to win chess" class="if uuid-3020204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/115182/3020204.jpg"></div><h2>  Games now </h2><p>  At present, chess and checkers are very popular.  They are loved by people of any age and nationality.  They are famous all over the world.  And everywhere, players created a special kind of field for themselves.  Whether it's a square variant with a rook or a star in the form of chips.  Even the rules and goals of the game themselves are very different from each other. </p><p>  Experiment, play and, of course, win. </p>
