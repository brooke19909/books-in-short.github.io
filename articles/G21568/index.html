But many of them choose Fujairah.  And such an amazing place like Ras Al Khaimah remains ‚Äútabula rasa‚Äù for the time being.  But in vain.  This emirate is in no way inferior to others.  There are also many attractions, shopping, entertainment and Arabic color.  Which hotel to choose for your stay?  It is desirable, on the front page, with a large territory, such as Bin Majid Beach Resort 4 * (Emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, UAE).  About this "four" tourists say that there is a very pleasant balance of price and quality of services.  Fans of chain hotels will be interested to know that the Beach Hotel in this city belongs to the Bin Majid Hotels line.  Previously, the hotel, built in nineteen ninety-seven, was called Bin Majid Beach Resort and had three stars on its sign.  The latest renovation allowed him to upgrade his status. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach hotel by bin majid hotel resorts" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1069772.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Why go here </h2><p>  Prohibition - this is why Russian tourists often avoid traveling to this country.  But this emirate is a happy exception.  There is no ban on alcohol there.  You can buy it in special institutions, and sometimes right at the hotel.  Another feature of this very northern emirate in the country is that the mountains come very close to the sea.  As a result, it is not necessary to pay extra for a sea view - in the opposite direction the landscape opens up no less marvelous.  But what do tourists need to know when arriving at the beaches of the resort town of Ras Al Khaimah?  Sand braids extend from the center by a crescent moon, the ‚Äúhorns‚Äù of which are connected by a bridge.  As a result, the water area, on the shore of which stands the Bin Majid Beach Resort Hotel 4 *, is not an open sea, but a bay.  But the water in it is still clean, and natural breakwaters protect the beach from storms.  To the west of the hotel is the old part of Ras Al Khaimah, and to the east is the Al Hamranya area, where the local airport accepts international flights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bin majid beach resort hotel 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1069773.jpg" width="600"></div>

Bus connections to this northern emirate are not very good.  And in the city of Ras Al Khaimah there is no public transport.  There are two ways to get to the hotel if you are not traveling with a tourist campaign and the transfer is not included in your package of services.  The first is to land at the Ras Al Khaimah Airport and overcome the remaining nineteen kilometers by taxi.  And the second option: in a rented car in an hour, get from Dubai along the Emirates Highway.  ‚ÄúBeach Hotel‚Äù, by the way, serves as a convenient starting point for traveling around the emirate.  A taxi rank is located just opposite the hotel.  Prices for trips within the emirate do not go beyond ten units of local currency.  To Dubai Airport, a taxi ride will cost twenty-five dirhams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bin majid beach resort 4 uae ras al khaimah" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1069774.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory and buildings </h2><p>  Exact address of Bin Majid Beach Hotel 4 *: United Arab Emirates, <span>Ras Al Khaimah, Al</span> Jazera Road.  It stands on its own eight-hundred-meter beach on the shores of Ras Al Khaimah Bay.  The hotel is a one- and two-story Moorish-style villas arranged in rows along the sea.  Many tourists called the advantage that on the east side the hotel has no neighbors.  One can contemplate the ‚ÄúGateway to Oman‚Äù (this border emirate is also called) in all its pristine beauty.  Privacy also affects the beach.  And to the west of the hotel at a short distance is the Rixos spa and the Double Three Bays Hilton Resort and Spa.  The hotel grounds seem like a spacious oasis.  It has several heated pools, which is important, because many tourists choose the Emirates for winter holidays.  The impression of the Garden of Eden is enhanced by the birds from the mini zoo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel beach resort by bin majid hotels resorts reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1069775.jpg" width="600"></div>

The houses are located near the sea, the room is bright and spacious.  Technical equipment and furniture are approximately the same.  Everywhere on the floor there is a cool tile, and the rooms have a terrace or a spacious balcony.  Filling the minibar is paid, but every day a bottle of drinking water is put as a gift.  Especially tourists liked the luxurious toiletries in the bathroom.  Here, daily and quality cleaning of the rooms.  Employees change towels and all bedding.  Re-lay sheets, pillowcases.

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Judging by the responses, most tourists only ordered <span>breakfast at the Beach Hotel By Bin Majid Hotels Resorts</span> .  They consisted of dishes familiar to Europeans.  This is an omelet, fried eggs, sausages, granola.  Pleased with real brewed coffee and natural juices.

    <h2>  Services and entertainment </h2><p>  The hotel staff is very helpful and executive.  They looked at the tips in bewilderment - here it is not customary to give them.  Since the main audience here is from Western Europe, they communicate in English.  For those who are not good in foreign languages, two Russian-speaking employees work at the reception from 9 to 18 hours.  A really cheap private duty-free is the trick of the Bin Majid Beach Resort 4 * hotel (UAE).  Ras Al Khaimah, due to the lack of Prohibition, freely sells alcohol.  Come here to buy from neighboring emirates!  Tourists say that the hotel does not have intrusive animations, although discos and all kinds of shows are regularly held.  As for the remote location of the hotel, the administration compensates for this with a free shuttle to the city center.  True, it is carried out once a day (all week, except Tuesday). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bin majid beach resort 4 emirate ras al khaimah uae" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1069780.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  For children </h2><p>  Beach Hotel By Bin Majid Hotels Resorts is positioning itself as a place for families.  The hotel has a mini zoo, or rather, a bird's yard.  Children like peacocks, roosters and other animals.  In the pools, the water is heated in the winter, and this is very convenient, given the fact that many people come to the UAE in the cold season.  As a plus, the parents of young children regarded the fact that the hotel had no animation at all, and there were few Russians and many Germans among the guests.  In the evenings, the rooms are quiet and calm.  Tourists recommend a trip to the water park near the hotel.  It is called ‚ÄúIce Land‚Äù and take a taxi to it for about ten minutes.  As for food, the hotel restaurant always has a children's menu. </p><h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  Eight hundred meters of fine golden sand near a calm bay - what else does an organism tired of work need?  Hotel Beach Resort By Bin Majid Hotels Resorts reviews are called a great place for an uncomplicated beach holiday.  Sunset at sea is very gentle, which can not but rejoice parents with young children.  The only peculiarity of the local coast is significant low tides.  At this time, you can literally walk to the buoys, the water will be waist-high.  But vacationers solved this problem simply: bathed at high tide, and then went to swim in the pools.  There are three of them in the hotel, and all of them are heated.  There are bars at the pools where you can order soft drinks and cocktails, ice cream, snacks.  Naturally, all beach ammunition - sunbeds, umbrellas, towels - is free of charge for hotel guests.  On the shore you can rent <span>water scooters</span> and other fun. </p><h2>  Reviews about Beach Resort By Bin Majid Hotels </h2><p>  Some tourists regretted not ordering the All Inclusive.  The hotel is a little out of the way, you need to take a taxi to the restaurants and cafes in the city, and buying lunches and dinners at the hotel is expensive.  But many mobile tourists had enough breakfast.  Of the excursions offered in the travel agency at the hotel, many recommend a jeep safari.  It‚Äôs better to go to the shopping malls in Ras Al Khaimah or Dubai yourself: it‚Äôs cheaper and you won‚Äôt depend on unorganized tourists.  Some were slightly disappointed with the sea, which turned out to be not an open water area, but a bay.  But many just liked this circumstance - there are no waves, clean sand without jellyfish.  Alkoshop is located near the hotel.  And for food, many tourists went to the Alhamra Mall, where you can eat. </p>
