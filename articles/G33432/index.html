  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Women's tricks or which epilator is better</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In modern times, every woman strives to have a slim figure and well-groomed body with smooth skin.  Fashion dictates its own, and a prerequisite for beauty today is the absence of excess hair in the armpits, bikini area and legs.  However, many people have the question of how to achieve good results when removing excess hair. </p><p>  In search of means and methods of hair removal, women take certain risks to their health.  Considering the ways in which you can make the skin smooth, or which hair removal is better, we can distinguish: </p><p>  1. Shaving.  This method is quite simple, and the result of its application appears instantly.  A shaving disadvantage is that, regularly using this method, the hair on the skin becomes stiff, and any kind of irritation on the skin can occur.  In addition, the shaving procedure must be repeated regularly. </p><p>  2. Epilation <span>with burnt sugar.</span>  This procedure is similar to waxing and is quite painful. </p><p>  3. Hair removal with an electric appliance such as an epilator.  This method is safe, effective and long-term.  The question immediately arises <strong>,</strong> which epilator is better? </p><p>  It should immediately be noted that an epilator is a device that removes hair by capturing it with two metal disks.  These discs, like tweezers, sharply pull out the hair, thereby removing it along with the root.  Epilation is a somewhat painful procedure, but the result is excellent, the skin remains smooth for a long time.  An important point when using the epilator is to reduce the <span>pain threshold</span> with regular use. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many will ask by what parameters it is necessary to choose this electric appliance, which epilator is better? </p><p>  By type of power supply, epilators are divided into battery powered ones, that is, those that are powered from a network, for example by Braun, and those that have autonomous power.  The latter are quite convenient to use, since they can be taken with you, for example, on a trip. </p><p>  According to the principle of action, epilators are divided into disk and tweezers.  In the first case, the hair is clamped with metal discs, in the second case - with metal tweezers.  Both types of such electrical appliances are quite effective.  Recently, a third type of epilator has been released, which combines these two principles of action, you just need to change the special nozzles.  It is impossible to say which <span>epilator is better</span> in this case, since the woman herself chooses the one that suits her best. </p><p>  Depending on the number of tweezers used on the head of the device, the hair removal process can last a different amount of time.  Also, some models can be equipped with two settings for the degree of hair capture, one of which regulates the removal of thin hair, and the other normal or rigid.  Such devices are manufactured by Rowenta.  It should be noted that all devices for hair removal, without exception, have two speeds. </p><p>  Today, there are several types of epilators that use additional functions when removing hair, and which <span>epilator is better</span> depends on what functions it has.  So, there are vibroepilators, for example, having a principle of operation based on the transmission of a pain impulse to nerve endings, RowentaEP 2610 can be attributed here. There are devices with cooling nozzles, due to which the hair removal process is painless, since the nerve endings are somewhat frozen.  A novelty in the cosmetic market is an epilator that works by stretching the skin while removing hair from its surface.  This method is virtually painless and was developed by Philips. </p><p>  Thus, knowing the principles of operation of various devices for hair removal, you can determine for yourself which epilator is good and whether it is worth buying it. </p>
