    <h2>  Flats </h2><p>  "South water area" is an excellent option for those who want to solve the housing problem or improve their living conditions.  The new microdistrict is designed for 5,000 apartments with different types of layout.  All of them are very convenient and comfortable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The company-developer will rent apartments with decoration.  This approach allows you to speed up the process of introducing people into the apartments they purchased. </p><p>  In the corner sections will accommodate apartments with a non-standard layout.  The rooms in them will turn out to be pentagonal.  According to the designers, this will help to visually increase the space and realize the most daring design ideas. </p><p>  Apartments located in the "Southern Water Area" have two distinctive features.  Firstly, the ceiling height in them reaches 2.65 m. Secondly, the layout includes a spacious entrance hall. </p><p>  It so happened that the one-room apartments are in the greatest demand.  The developers of the complex "Southern Water Area" took this into account.  They offer two variants of "odnushka" - with a separate and adjacent bathroom. </p><p>  Now a few words about the finish.  As soon as the houses are fully erected, specialists will begin their internal arrangement.  The walls will be glued with wallpaper that meets the indicators of strength and environmental safety.  The floors are covered with linoleum.  Subsequently, apartment owners can replace it with another coating. </p><p>  The bathroom is tiled.  The apartments are sold together with the bathroom and toilet installed in it, as well as domestic plumbing and household meters.  Sockets and switches, interior doors and metal double-glazed windows will also be in the apartments at the time of their delivery.  All you need to do is bring furniture and textiles.  And you can live in comfortable conditions. </p><p>  Designers also thought about the safety of people.  In every entrance and on each floor there will be CCTV cameras.  They will also create a throughput system.  Apartment owners will be offered to install video intercoms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK southern water area" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/806269.jpg" width="600"></div>
