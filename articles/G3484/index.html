This is becoming very important, given the fact that in our time, most buyers prefer "technically lightweight" smartphones, which can be saved.  One of the main criteria, in this case, is the <span>size of the screen.</span>  It should be noted the fact that the manufacturer also provided for the modification with one SIM card.  More details about the new product will be discussed later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy grand neo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/640899.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo model is equipped with a Broadcom BCM23550 processor, consisting of four cores.  Each of them operates at a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  A South Korean manufacturing company usually installs such units on <span>budget devices.</span>  To save information, the developers have provided 8 GB of internal memory.  At the same time, we must not forget that almost half of this capacity is required to provide for the system‚Äôs own needs, therefore it is not available to the user.  However, if necessary, the indicator can be improved by installing an additional microSD card, up to 64 GB in size.  The amount of RAM of the device is 1 GB.  The smartphone is equipped with a removable 2100 mAh battery.  It is enough to work in standby mode for about 439 hours, and in talk mode - 11 hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  In appearance, the novelty is not much different from its predecessor.  In the production of the case, "Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo" uses good quality plastic.  The device weighs 169 grams, while its dimensions are 143.7 x 77.1 x 9.9 millimeters.  In general, the model cannot be called light and ergonomic.  On the other hand, due to the pleasant texture of the back panel, it is quite pleasant to hold the device in hands.  Moreover, unlike options with a glossy case, it does not slip out of your hands during a long conversation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy grand neo 2" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/640896.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Stylish, catchy design - this is far from the strongest side of Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo.  A review of the smartphone market, as a whole, and the niche occupied by the model in particular, shows that for a similar amount the buyer is offered more attractive devices.  In fairness, it should be emphasized that for all devices from the budget segment from this manufacturer, a similar trend is characteristic.  The device is available in white, black, orange or green housing.  The front part is occupied by the display.  Below are three control keys, and above is a front camera with a speaker.  On the right side you can see the power key, and on the left - a rocker for adjusting sound parameters.  The bottom edge of the model is used for the microphone hole and microUSB port.  As for the headphone jack, here it is on top.  On the back cover, which is removed very problematically, the developers placed a peephole of the main camera, an LED flash, and also a speaker grill. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy grand neo reviews" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/640898.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The rather impressive dimensions and weight are associated, first of all, with the installation of a large, five-inch display on the Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo model.  Characteristics of the screen can not be called outstanding.  Its resolution is only 800x480 pixels, while the image density per inch is equal to 186 pixels.  The display is based on TFT-technology, which is not the best way affects the viewing angles.  The sensor itself responds to touch rather quickly.  With all this, you should remember the nuance that the model belongs to the line of budget devices, and its cost in domestic salons is about 300 US dollars. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The main camera of the smartphone has a 5 megapixel sensor.  It has auto focus with flash and is capable of recording HD movies.  It should be noted that in the predecessor its characteristics were more impressive.  In this regard, there is no doubt that the manufacturing company saved on this component.  Be that as it may, the quality of the pictures created with the main camera is at a decent level, as for this kind of matrix, which was left out by the numerous Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo owners reviews.  The most frequent complaints, according to users, are associated with the manifestation of too aggressive noise reduction under certain conditions, as well as with an incorrect exposure in macro mode.  It would be wrong to call such shortcomings significant, especially against the background of the cost of the phone.  Moreover, with good lighting, you can easily get a good photo for memory.  As for the front camera, it shoots at a resolution of 0.3 megapixels, which is no surprise to anyone.  The feasibility of its availability is connected only with the possibility of making video calls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy grand neo specifications" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/640900.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Interface </h2><p>  The model operates on the Android 4.2 system.  The low cost of the smartphone in many ways limits its ability.  At the same time, thanks to the use of a processor with four cores in it, most of the programs run and work very quickly.  In order to provide quick access to applications and mail, the user can independently configure the screen lock widgets.  For the desktop, which is standard for Samsung devices, there are seven plans.  Switching between them occurs with the touch of your fingers.  It is impossible not to note the presence of a built-in voice assistant, which allows you to completely control the smartphone - manage sound settings, type messages, call and much more. </p><h2>  Gallery </h2><p>  Compared to many other smartphones from this manufacturer, the ‚ÄúSamsung Galaxy Grand Neo‚Äù has a simple gallery.  Even high-quality images are clearly and colorfully displayed without delay.  Here you can also edit pictures (for example, change colors and add effects).  When viewing information in an album, the user can call up a panel that allows you to display two images. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy grand neo review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/640897.jpg" width="545"></div>

    <h2>  Telephony </h2><p>  Smartphone ‚ÄúSamsung Galaxy Grand Neo‚Äù has a fairly simple phone book.  You can make calls or send messages directly from it.  In the event that the device detects two similar contacts, it will itself offer to combine them.  The model boasts excellent sound quality during conversations, and there are no extraneous noises in the handset.  The real highlight was the developers adding an equalizer for calls.  Separate words deserve the direct dialing function, which consists in the fact that while viewing a specific contact, the device can simply be brought to your ear, after which it will ring.  The large display has greatly simplified the process of typing when creating SMS. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone samsung galaxy grand neo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/640901.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  To summarize, it should be emphasized that the main advantages of the Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo are the relatively low cost and large display, albeit with a low resolution.  The developers practically did not make changes in appearance, in connection with which the device does not stand out against the background of other representatives of the line.  The only exception is the back cover, which has a nice texture.  It would seem that the model‚Äôs camera, weak at first glance, creates photographs in good quality.  At the same time, a budget processor with four cores ensures the operational work of most demanding applications.  With all this, do not forget that the device supports two SIM cards, which is important in our time. </p>
