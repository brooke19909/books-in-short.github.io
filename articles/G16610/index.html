One of the key points of this revolution is the capture of the Bastille, a fortress that served as a political prison.  Why is the capture of the Bastille considered the beginning of a revolution in France?  To answer this question, it is worth considering the political situation of 1789 as a whole. </p><h2>  Background </h2><p>  The protracted <span>economic crisis</span> began during the reign of Louis XIV.  The root cause of this was the particular political system of France - absolutism.  Feudal orders made the development of trade, agriculture, and industry impossible.  The bourgeoisie paid exorbitant taxes to the state, which did not concern itself either with the creation of flexible economic laws or with the granting of political rights.  Exorbitant amounts were spent on maintaining the courtyard, the treasury was impoverished, and public debt reached unprecedented proportions.  Instead of streamlining the state of the economy, the authorities resorted to new exorbitant taxes, which placed an unbearable burden on the shoulders of the young bourgeoisie.  Meanwhile, industrialists and financiers did not have political rights that could affect the situation as a whole, therefore they became increasingly embittered with the nobles who were only interested in their own well-being.  One of the answers to the question ‚Äúwhy the capture of the Bastille is considered the beginning of a revolution‚Äù is considered to be that this prison was the place of imprisonment of aristocrats whom ordinary people hated so much. </p><h2>  General states </h2><p>  Economic chaos and tremendous <span>public debt</span> forced Louis XVI to return to power the former Minister of Finance, an active supporter of economic reforms, Necker.  It was also decided to assemble the <span>General States,</span> in which it was planned to double the number of seats for representatives of the third estate.  Representatives of the bourgeois were headed by Count Mirabeau and Abbot Sieyes.  After numerous disagreements, representatives of the third estate renamed themselves the National Assembly.  Attempts by the king to declare this decision invalid were unsuccessful.  <span>Louis XVI</span> was forced to proclaim the legitimacy of the National Assembly, which soon announced its new goal - the creation of a new <span>political system</span> and the development of the Constitution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why is the capture of the Bastille considered the beginning of a revolution" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/648938.jpg" width="538"></div>

Leaflets were distributed, numerous speakers spoke, various parties arose.  Meanwhile, in order to pacify the people, the king draws troops to Paris.  On July 12, by royal order, Necker was fired and exiled from France.  The news of this served as the beginning of an uprising.  On the morning of July 13, the alarm rang over the environs of Paris.  Small traders and artisans, journalists, workers, women and the elderly armed themselves and took to the streets of the city.  Later that day, the townspeople seized the arsenal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bastille Day in France" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/647823.jpg" width="380"></div>

    <h2>  The capture of the Bastille </h2><p>  1789 year.  The Bastille is not the same as before.  Instead of the eminent nobles, who have been spending decades of imprisonment here, the prison has become a place of detention for ordinary criminals.  The upkeep of such a huge fortress was very expensive, and Necker had already proposed abolishing the prison, and selling the land on which it stood in favor of the treasury.  The paradox is that the day of the capture of the Bastille in France might not be an official holiday if they had listened to Necker earlier. </p><p>  The cannons of the old fortress were deployed towards the outskirts of Saint-Antoine, where the urban poor lived.  This fact particularly revolted the townspeople on the day of the capture of the Bastille.  The date of June 14, 1789 was the last day of the existence of an aristocratic prison.  Upon learning that government troops were gathering for the fortress, Camille Demoulin urged to take the prison by storm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capture of the Bastille 1789" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/647827.jpg" width="359"></div>  The crowd swept away the detachment of defenders of the fortress and burst into the gate.  The commandant was killed, the Bastille fell.  The king was forced to return Necker and withdraw troops.

    <p>  Some time passed, and the walls of the old fortress were destroyed.  A wasteland formed on the site of the old fortress, on which a sign was placed with the inscription: "A place for dancing." </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Why is the capture of the Bastille considered the beginning of a revolution?  From the above, we can draw the following conclusions: </p><p>  - The Bastille was associated with aristocracy, royal power and at the same time was a symbol of oppression, imprisonment.  The fall of the fortress became a symbol of the destruction of the old regime. </p><p>  - After the fall of the Bastille, the king withdraws troops and for the first time in history hears the opinion of his own people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bastille Day" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/647824.jpg" width="409"></div>

    <p>  On July 14, 1789, the king retreated, aristocracy fell, the people proved their ability to resist royal power - this is why the capture of the Bastille is considered the beginning of the revolution.  The opportunity to influence the existing state of affairs and change life in their own country was presented to citizens, and they took this opportunity. </p><p>  Bastille Day in France is considered a national holiday.  This is a holiday of freedom, independence and national unity for all residents of this country. </p>
