How to knit, learn by reading this article</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Knitting as a kind of needlework appeared a very long time ago.  Who invented the first loop, could not be installed.  But during the excavations by historians, various things were found, connected from threads and on knitting needles.  In our country, for the first time, men took up knitting, and they knitted chain mail for themselves.  Today it is difficult to imagine a Russian young man returning from the battlefield with knitting needles in his hands.  Attitude to clothes has changed, the technology of its creation has changed, but knitting has remained the most popular type of making warm clothes.  Only women have taken up this matter now, and what they haven‚Äôt invented, what patterns they haven‚Äôt developed.  For example, English gum.  <span>How to knit</span> it?  Very simple.  As they say, the work of the master is afraid, and you just need to pick up the knitting needles and a ball of thread. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="english gum how to knit" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/403128.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  Knitting English gum begins simply.  On the knitting need to dial an even number of loops.  The first row fits with the alternation of the front and wrong.  But the second row will be somewhat trickier.  To keep the side of the product flat, the first loop should not be knitted, it just needs to be transferred to the working needle.  The next loop, that is, the first, should be front, but the second should seem to be wrong, but it does not need to be crocheted, but you need to make a yarn and remove the loop with it.  It is still unclear how to knit English gum?  The circuit will tell. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit english gum pattern" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/403572.jpg" width="320"></div>

Usually each row is clearly indicated on it.  Each loop has its own symbol.  For example, the front loop is indicated by a check mark, and the back loop is indicated by a dash.  So, for knitting English gum, the diagram shows a series of alternating purl and front loops.  If you look at the diagram, it is very easy to fit English gum.  How to knit according to the pattern?  The first row - one front loop, and the other - wrong.  The second row - the front is knitted, and the wrong one is removed with a crochet.  And so it is repeated until the end of the series.  The last loop should always be knitted from the wrong side.  This will allow you to make the side of the product smooth, without bulges. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to knit english gum with knitting needles" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/402677.jpg" width="600"></div>
