    <p>  By the age of nine, young Mark Thatcher was assigned to a prestigious private school - Harrow.  Over the years of training, he was remembered for being one of the stupidest students.  Classmates made fun of him in every possible way, inventing various offensive nicknames for him. </p><p>  In 1971, at the age of eighteen, the young man graduated from school.  He could hardly get a certificate of education.  His knowledge was not enough to go to university.  This fact was extremely unpleasant for his mother, who already held the post of minister in the field of education and science. </p><p>  He tried various possibilities in order to determine his life: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  three times entered accounting courses (unsuccessfully); </li><li>  opened jewelry business (the market was in recession); </li><li>  production of carts for supermarkets (did not arouse interest among entrepreneurs); </li><li>  opening an international consulting company. </li></ul><h2>  Racing career </h2>

    <p>  The young man tried his hand not only in business.  Once he came up with the idea to participate in races, namely in <span>the Paris-Dakar rally.</span>  The idea ended rather deplorably. </p><p>  Mark Thatcher (race car driver) could not finish the race, lost in the Sahara.  Mother and father organized a large-scale campaign to find a son.  Due to the incident, Margaret Thatcher was only once seen crying. </p><p>  The press closely followed the search and was extremely disappointed with Mark's behavior.  The fact is that at the time of his salvation, he did not shake hands with his own father and did not thank the rescue team from Algeria.  The saved one only muttered to everyone that he was glad to see everyone in health. </p><p>  This act led to the fact that the media began to look for an excuse to tell the public about the inappropriate behavior of the Prime Minister‚Äôs son.  For example, once he brought a stewardess to tears only because she asked for his name.  He very often rudely answered not only ordinary people, but also journalists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Entrepreneurship </h2><p>  Mark Thatcher, whose biography is presented, knew only one thing.  He learned to use the fact that he had a direct relationship with the country's prime minister.  This was his main source of income. </p>

    <p>  The son of an ‚Äúiron lady‚Äù decided to become a lobbyist and organized an international consulting firm.  She made several successful transactions on which Mark earned a millionaire fortune.  However, ill-wishers confidently stated that the deal would not have been possible without the direct intervention of the British Prime Minister. </p><p>  An example is the deal to build a hospital and university in Oman.  For them, the lobbyist received huge commissions.  Negotiations on the signing of the contract took place in Oman at the same time as Margaret Thatcher was there on a visit. </p><p>  Another scandalous deal occurred in 1986, when a British company signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia to supply aircraft.  The prime minister‚Äôs son again received large commissions. </p><p>  In these cases, political fraud was seen by the prime minister, who acted not in the interests of the country, but with the goal of improving the well-being of her son.  Parliamentary commissions were created that did not reveal anything illegal. </p><p>  Mark's career has changed since the defeat of Margaret Thatcher in the election. </p><h2>  Family status </h2>

    <p>  Mark Thatcher was married twice in 1987 and in 2005.  From his first marriage, he has children Michael and Amanda. </p><p>  Spouses: </p><ul><li>  Diana Bergdorf (American). </li><li>  Sarah Jane Russell </li></ul><p>  He met his first wife when he left Britain after the scandal over a deal in Oman.  An entrepreneurial man began to promote a car brand in Texas and met Diana, who was the daughter of a local businessman.  The young family lived in the USA, Switzerland, South Africa. </p><h2>  Conspirator </h2><p>  In South Africa, Thatcher Mark was originally a pretty famous person.  Due to scandals in lobbying, he and his family moved to Africa before the parliamentary elections.  The issue of the premier venue in which Margaret Thatcher took part was being decided.  Despite the fact that the scandalous son was not in the UK, his statements were constantly published in the <span>British media.</span>  This was not in favor of the mother, who lost the election. </p>

    <p>  During his first time in a new country, Mark was quiet.  He did not deal with <span>major transactions,</span> spending more time at social events.  The last time he was in England was at his father's funeral in 2003. </p><p>  Living in the prestigious part of Cape Town, the Thatcher family talked with fairly eminent neighbors, among whom were: </p><ul><li>  Nelson Mandella - a fighter with apartheid; </li><li>  Desmond Tutu - Archbishop; </li><li>  Mark Rich is a scandalous billionaire; </li><li>  Vito Palazzolo - a mafioso wanted by Italy and the United States; </li><li>  Count Spencer is the brother of the deceased Princess Diana. </li></ul><p>  This did not save his person from scandals.  The newly-minted sir was detained by South African special forces, accusing him of conspiracy to overthrow the government of Equatorial Guinea, a friendly state for South Africa.  It all started with the detention in 2004 at a Zimbabwean airport of a plane carrying weapons and mercenaries led by British military Simon Mann.  The investigation saw in the attempted coup d'etat the possibility of Communion Thatcher. </p><p>  He was facing fifteen years in prison.  Mark's mother could not stand aside and, returning from a trip to the USA to London, began to save her son.  She managed to secure his release from custody by making a bail. </p><p>  The accused did not admit his guilt, but in 2005 a South African court sentenced him to probation and a fine. </p><h2>  Barony </h2><p>  Mark Thatcher was not born into a simple family.  It's not just about the mother, who was the seventy-first prime minister of Great Britain.  Mark's father was a fairly successful businessman.  In addition, in 1990 he was granted the title of chivalry of the baronet, which was inherited. </p><p>  In 2003, Sir Denis Thatcher died and his title passed to his only son Mark.  Thus, he became the second baronet. </p><h2>  The Thatcher Movie </h2>

    <p>  At one time, the television film "Margaret" was created, telling about the "Iron Lady" and her entourage.  Thatcher Mark, whose photo is presented in the article, is embodied by the play of Oliver Le Sure. </p><p>  The film was directed by James Kent and was released in 2009.  He reveals the events of 1990, when the issue of the prime minister‚Äôs place for the Iron Lady was being decided. </p><p>  The last film adaptation about Margaret is the 2011 picture ‚ÄúIron Lady‚Äù. </p>
