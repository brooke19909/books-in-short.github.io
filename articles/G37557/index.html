Someone invests in real estate, someone is interested in their own business, the purchase of securities, etc. But if you have an initial capital or a desire to accumulate this capital, you can put money in a bank at interest.  This method does not take much time, ensures the safety of savings, brings a stable income. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.creditquebec.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Revenue growth" class="if uuid-2707085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2707085.jpg"></div><h2>  Should banks be trusted? </h2><p>  After the frequent revocation of banking licenses and the periodic bankruptcy of financial institutions, the idea of ​​putting money in a bank at interest causes distrust among the population.  Therefore, first, we will understand some of the nuances of financial security. </p><p>  Today, there is such a thing as a guarantee of deposits.  What does it mean?  In the event that the license was revoked from the bank, its bankruptcy and other troubles, the state guarantees the depositor a refund.  The insured amount of the deposit in 2018 is 1.4 million rubles.  That is, payments on deposits not exceeding this amount will be made immediately.  If the amount that is on the account is greater, first the depositor will be returned an amount of 1.4 million rubles.  And the rest of the deposit can be received only after the banking property is sold.  Please note that <span>deposits opened</span> in dollars or euros are paid in Russian rubles at the exchange rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation on the date the license was revoked or the bank was declared bankrupt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What types of accounts are subject to state insurance? </h2><p>  These guarantees apply to the following types of deposits: </p><ol><li>  Deposits </li><li>  Accounts opened on demand. </li><li>  Accounts linked to bank payment cards (including pension and salary projects) </li></ol><h2>  Not subject to state insurance </h2><ol><li>  Accounts drawn up in foreign branches of the bank. </li><li>  Metal deposits. </li><li>  Savings books and certificates. </li><li>  Accounts that were opened on trust </li><li>  Bearer. </li></ol><h2>  Do all banks participate in the insurance project? </h2><p>  Most banks of the Russian Federation work with a state insurance agent to protect the financial interests of their depositors.  But, unfortunately, not all.  The fact is that such cooperation is not a prerequisite for banking.  The bank board itself decides whether or not to insure the deposits of its customers.  As a rule, this is neglected by small financial institutions and banks that have recently appeared on the market. </p><h2>  How to find out if a bank participates in a deposit insurance system? </h2><p>  Getting this information is pretty simple.  There are several ways to do this: </p><ol><li>  By phone hotline. </li><li>  Clarify the information directly in the branch of the bank itself. </li><li>  View on the official website of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation in the section "Directory of credit organizations" (this is the most reliable source of information to date). </li></ol><p>  As you can see, if a bank participates in the insurance system, then there is no need to fear for the safety of funds. </p><h2>  What to look for when choosing a bank deposit </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sputniknews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian rubles" class="if uuid-2707104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2707104.jpg"></div><p>  A deposit is a <span>type of deposit that</span> is opened for saving money and receiving passive income in the form of accrued interest.  What should I look for before concluding a contract? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Contract time.  The longer the money is stored in the bank, the higher the income. </li><li>  Minimum deposit amount (the amount needed to open an account). </li><li>  Interest rate.  It is she who is an indicator of the profitability of the deposit.  The higher it is, the better. </li><li>  Interest calculation conditions.  They can be attached directly to the main deposit amount, transferred to a separate account or credited on the day the deposit agreement expires. </li><li>  Type of interest income.  The deposit rate can be fixed or floating.  The fixed interest rate does not change throughout the term of the contract.  Unlike floating.  Such a rate can both increase and decrease.  Depending on the situation in the financial market. </li><li>  Terms of early termination of the deposit.  Unfortunately, situations in life are different.  Therefore, it is very important to provide for the possibility of early termination of the deposit agreement: when and how to do this, what are the conditions, are there any penalties, etc. </li></ol><h2>  Account Opening Procedure </h2><p>  Now that the decision to open a deposit has been made, the bank is selected, let’s talk about how to put money into the bank at a percentage and what is the procedure for opening an account.  It is more convenient to open a deposit account in the bank office, which is closer to home.  So that to solve these or other issues did not have to spend a lot of time on the road. </p><p>  Today, there are two ways to deposit money at a bank at interest: by contacting the bank’s office and via the Internet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To open an account in the department, you need to have a passport (necessarily the original) and the money that you are going to put on the account.  The specialist will additionally consult on the conditions of the deposit of interest, draw up a contract and deposit money into the account. </p><p>  In order to open an account via the Internet, most often you need to be a client of this bank and use the Internet Bank system or a mobile application.  In the system, you need to select the type of deposit you are interested in, fill out personal data and use the bank card to deposit the amount into the account. </p><p>  Unfortunately, not all banks can offer the option of issuing an account remotely yet.  But every day this method is becoming increasingly popular. </p><h2>  Overview of banks.  Where to put the money at interest? </h2><p>  Many future investors are asking this question.  Someone would like to be able to put money in a Swiss bank at interest.  But, unfortunately, not everyone has such an opportunity.  Firstly, Switzerland is far, and secondly, it is difficult to do without knowing the laws of a foreign country.  Therefore, we will not complicate our lives.  Let's talk about which bank to put money at a high interest rate at home. </p><p>  For example, VTB, Sberbank, Post Bank offer their depositors attractive deposit conditions.  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><h2>  VTB Bank </h2><div class="photo" data-original="inkazan.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="VTB Bank" class="if uuid-2707110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2707110.jpg"></div><p>  To begin with, deposits at VTB Bank are insured.  Therefore, investors can not worry about the safety of their savings.  Talk about the products that customers offer. </p><p>  Today there are 4 types of deposits: “Maximum”, “Profitable”, “Replenished” and “Comfortable”.  All these products differ in terms: shelf life, interest rate, terms of replenishment, etc. The down payment for opening a deposit varies from 30 to 100 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  A brief overview of VTB Bank's deposit products </h2><ul><li>  We start the review with the "Comfortable" contribution. </li></ul><p>  Duration of the contract: 181 - 1830 calendar days. </p><p>  Interest rate: up to 3.61%. </p><p>  Minimum deposit amount: 30,000 rubles / 3,000 dollars / 3,000 euros. </p><p>  This product has the smallest interest rate of the entire deposit line.  But, at the same time, the most loyal conditions.  You can replenish this deposit, withdraw funds (up to the amount of the minimum balance) at any convenient time.  In addition, it is more convenient to open this type of deposit via the Internet, since the minimum amount for issuing an account is 30,000 rubles.  When contacting a bank office, the minimum amount increases to 100,000 rubles.  This product is suitable for those who do not want to store large sums of money at home.  Loyal deposit conditions allow you to use money if necessary.  Early termination of the contract is also possible.  But the interest will be paid at the rate of “Demand”. </p><p>  The disadvantages of the product include low interest rates for foreign currency accounts (0.8% in dollars and 0.01% in euros).  This type of deposit is more suitable for the national currency. </p><ul><li>  Deposit "Refillable" </li></ul><p>  Duration of the contract: 91 - 1830 calendar days. </p><p>  Interest rate: up to 5.61%. </p><p>  Minimum deposit amount: 30,000 rubles / 500 dollars / 500 euros. </p><p>  Replenishment is provided for this deposit, but under the agreement there is no possibility to make expenditure operations.  The minimum replenishment amount is 15,000 rubles.  In case of early termination of the contract, interest is recalculated at the minimum rate of demand deposits. </p><p>  A few words must be said about the payment of interest: they can both join the main deposit and be credited to a separate account.  At the request of the owner of the deposit. </p><p>  This product is suitable for those who need to save money.  For example, this is a good tool in order to raise funds for an apartment or other major purchase. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thehimalayantimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fundraising" class="if uuid-2707089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2707089.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Profitable deposit </li></ul><p>  Duration of the contract: 91 - 1830 calendar days. </p><p>  Interest rate: up to 6.48%. </p><p>  Minimum deposit amount: 30,000 rubles / 500 dollars / 500 euros. </p><p>  This contribution does not provide for replenishment or expenditure operations throughout the term of the contract.  The product is suitable for storing cash.  In case of early termination of the contract, preferential terms apply. </p><ul><li>  Maximum Contribution </li></ul><p>  Duration of the contract: 120 days. </p><p>  Interest rate: 6.45%. </p><p>  Minimum deposit amount: 50,000 rubles. </p><p>  This is a short-term deposit, which does not provide for any additional operations on the account.  It can be opened only in Russian rubles.  Interest is automatically added to the deposit amount. </p><p>  If you decide to put money at interest at VTB Bank, carefully read all the conditions of deposits.  In addition, it is more profitable to open some deposits via the Internet. </p><h2>  Sberbank </h2><div class="photo" data-original="yakapitalist.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank of Russia" class="if uuid-2707107" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2707107.jpg"></div><p>  Putting money at interest in Sberbank is also not difficult.  Unlike VTB Bank, it offers a wider social line of deposits: for pensioners, charitable deposits, etc. Therefore, before you open something, carefully read the terms of the agreement. </p><p>  The most popular deposit instruments of Sberbank are deposits “Replenish” and “Manage”.  These are very convenient tools for accumulating cash.  While the “Save” deposit is only suitable for storing large sums of money. </p><ul><li>  Deposit "Replenish" </li></ul><p>  Duration of the contract: up to three years. </p><p>  Interest rate: up to 3.80%. </p><p>  Minimum deposit amount: from 1,000 rubles / 100 dollars. </p><p>  This contribution provides for the possibility of additional contributions.  Consumables are prohibited.  The interest rate will depend on the amount on the account and the term of the deposit.  The exception is pensioners.  Their accounts set the maximum interest rate, regardless of the amount. </p><ul><li>  Contribution "Manage" </li></ul><p>  Duration of the contract: up to three years. </p><p>  Interest rate: up to 3.8%. </p><p>  Minimum deposit amount: 30,000 rubles. </p><p>  <span>This deposit,</span> like the “Comfortable” deposit of VTB Bank, provides for both incoming and outgoing transactions.  It is a convenient contribution to life.  In addition, it can be opened via the Internet using the application, or on the official website of Sberbank). </p><p>  Putting money at interest in the bank in this case is not difficult.  But in order not to get confused in numerous products, it is better to do this directly in the office. </p><h2>  How to put money at interest in the Post Bank </h2><div class="photo" data-original="shopandmall.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Post Bank" class="if uuid-2707121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2707121.jpg"></div><p>  Post Bank offers its customers a small line of short-term deposits up to 18 months with a high interest rate and loyal storage conditions.  In addition, by opening an account remotely, the client can count on an increased percentage of his deposit. </p><ul><li>  Savings deposit </li></ul><p>  Duration of the contract: 1 year. </p><p>  Interest rate: up to 6.15%. </p><p>  Minimum deposit amount: 5000 rubles. </p><p>  A deposit, like similar products of other banks, is suitable for accumulating funds.  It has optimal storage periods.  In case of early termination of the contract, interest income is retained.  If necessary, money can be withdrawn at any time.  The interest income on the deposit is accrued quarterly. </p><ul><li>  Profitable Deposit </li></ul><p>  Duration of the contract: 1 year. </p><p>  Interest rate: 6.35%. </p><p>  Minimum deposit amount: 500,000 rubles. </p><p>  This contribution is suitable for storing large sums of money.  <span>Replenishment of the account is</span> possible in the first 7 days after opening.  Expenditure operations on it are not provided.  Early termination of the contract is possible, but the interest rate will be reduced to 0.1% per annum. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="unsplash.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="passive income" class="if uuid-2707130" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96080/2707130.jpg"></div><p>  In which bank it is better to put money at a percentage, everyone should decide for himself.  In the light of historical events, this issue has become topical for millions of Russians.  Therefore, the choice should be based not only on advertising that is shown on television, but also on obvious facts.  The bank must have a clean reputation.  All conditions for banking products should be accessible to the client, transparent.  In addition, before concluding an agreement, a bank employee once again explains the conditions. </p><p>  Remember, if you approach the issue of passive income and preserving finances with all severity and responsibility, then the decision to put money in the bank at interest rates can help not only save money for a dream, but also bring tangible monthly income. </p>
