With their help, goods are paid and transfers are made.  But many people know firsthand that each bank has commission fees for all services provided, up to cash withdrawals.  Consider what the commission of Sberbank for all services provided. </p><h2>  Why charge a fee </h2><p>  Why they charge a fee for transferring money from Sberbank cards to cards of other banks is understandable.  At least everyone is used to it and understands that banks should receive their interest. </p>

    <p>  But many are perplexed by the fact of withdrawing interest for receiving cash through ATMs.  Let us look at this situation from the other side.  In order for a financial institution to be provided with cash, it is necessary to make not only the physical costs of those who work in the bank, but also material ones.  The percentage for cash withdrawals usually includes: </p><ul><li>  Acquisition of cash in the interbank market. </li><li>  Payment of collection services. </li><li>  The rent for the place where the ATMs are located. </li><li>  Payment for light. </li><li>  Purchase of consumables. </li><li>  Paying salaries to staff. </li></ul><h2>  What does it depend on </h2><p>  Usually, Sberbank's commission for using money (withdrawal or transfer) depends on the class of cards issued.  They can be debit or credit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When servicing <span>debit cards, the bank</span> does not take interest, that is, if a person withdraws money from the Sberbank card at the ATM of this bank, then the commission is not debited.  But this rule does not apply to debit cards that are used outside the region of their opening: "Maestro", <span>"Visa Electron"</span> with the package of services "Momentum Visa Electron", "Maestro" with the "Transport" package.  For them, the cash withdrawal fee will be about 1% of the amount. </p>

    <p>  Do not forget about such a concept as the daily limit for the transfer or withdrawal of funds.  If a client of Sberbank exceeds the limit (usually it is no more than 500 thousand rubles per day), then for further operations with money he will be forced to pay 0.5% of the amount. </p><p>  As for credit cards, the percentage for withdrawal is purely individual.  But in general, the size of the commission can reach up to 3% of the amount, but not less than 199 rubles.  Therefore, it is not profitable to withdraw small amounts from credit cards, however, as well as large ones. </p><h2>  Money transfers </h2><p>  You can transfer money in different ways: </p><ul><li>  From card to card of Sberbank. </li><li>  From a Sberbank card to cards of other banks. </li><li>  From the card to the current account. </li></ul>

In order to carry out this operation, it is enough to know the opponent‚Äôs card number or his phone number, which will be tied to this card.  Fee for money transfer between cardholders of one bank is not charged. </p><p>  If money needs to be transferred <span>from a Sberbank card to a card of</span> another bank, the first one takes a commission in the amount of 1.5% of the amount, but not less than 30 rubles.  This translation can also be carried out by the methods indicated above. </p><p>  For bank card holders, the option of transferring money from the card to the bank account of both their bank and a third-party is available. </p><p>  When transferring from a Sberbank card to an account opened with the same bank, no commission is charged.  This is provided that both the card and the account are open in one region and the transfer actions are carried out within the region.  If the current account is opened in another region, then the transfer fee will be from 1% to 1.5%, but not less than 30 rubles.  and not more than 1 thousand rubles.  You can carry out cash transactions in foreign currency.  In this case, the commission of Sberbank is from 0.5% to 0.7%, but not more than $ 100. </p><p>  It is also possible to transfer from a card to a bank account of another bank.  Here, the commission fee is 1-2% of the amount, but not more than 1500 rubles.  If the transfer is made in currency, the bank will take up to 1% for the transfer.  The maximum commission in this case is $ 200. </p><p>  Transaction cancellation is not possible.  Therefore, when transferring large amounts you need to be as careful as possible.  In the case of incorrectly specified details, the issue will have to be resolved with the recipient of the money and rely only on his honesty. </p><h2>  Cash withdrawal </h2><p>  It is not forbidden to withdraw cash from debit cards or credit.  Another question, how much can Sberbank take for such operations?  Bank commissions will vary from class of cards, and in which ATM there is a cash withdrawal. </p>

    <p>  Naturally, the organization does not charge anything for servicing its debit cards.  You can get cash without interest, but not more than 50 thousand rubles at a time.  If you need to withdraw money from a credit card, then you need to get ready to give the bank a commission in the amount of up to 3% of the amount, but not less than 390 rubles.  Moreover, if you try to withdraw cash from Sberbank's credit card in the terminal of another bank, the fee will be up to 4% of the desired amount.  Moreover, two banks can take the commission at once, respectively, and the costs will increase. </p><h2>  Money Transfer Services </h2><p>  Sberbank itself restricts transfers between its own accounts.  For example, you cannot transfer money from your credit card to your own debit.  And even more so on someone else's. </p><p>  Here various payment systems come to the rescue, which allow you to transfer money anywhere and to any resources. </p><p>  The most famous include: </p><ul><li>  "Qiwi wallet.  A money transfer will cost Russia 2% of the amount, and the plus service will take its 50 rubles, you will have to pay 2% + 100 rubles for transfers to other countries. </li><li>  "Yandex money".  For any transfer, you will need to pay 3% of the amount and 45 rubles to the service. </li><li>  "WebMoney".  This system will take its 40 rubles for maintenance and 2.5% of the amount will have to be paid. </li></ul><h2>  Transfer through Sberbank Online </h2><p>  This option is available to all holders of debit and credit cards of Sberbank.  To complete the transfer, you need: </p><ol><li>  Go to your personal account. </li><li>  Select the ‚ÄúPayments and Transfers‚Äù section. </li><li>  Choose the necessary operation, that is, to whom the funds will be transferred: to a client of Sberbank or a client of another bank. </li><li>  Indicate the recipient's card number or his phone number (if the card is tied to a number). </li></ol>

    <p>  Sberbank commission is not charged from card to card of the same bank or for transfer between your accounts.  For transfer to a client of another bank, interest is charged according to the tariff. </p><h2>  Phone Transfer </h2><p>  This method is available only to Sberbank cardholders.  In other words, money cannot be transferred to a client of another bank. </p><p>  The algorithm is as follows: </p><ol><li>  To number 900 you need to send an SMS with the text "Transfer 9 ******* 47 650", where 9 ******* 47 is the phone number of the addressee, and 650 is the amount to be received. </li><li>  In the response SMS, the code and data of the recipient come.  They need to be verified and only then send a message with a code.  After sending, the money will be debited from the card in favor of the recipient. </li></ol><p>  Sberbank commission for these actions is not charged. </p>
