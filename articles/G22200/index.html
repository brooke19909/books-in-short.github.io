    <h2>  VTB collateral </h2><p>  Pledged property is such property, which, according to the agreement of the parties, is a necessary guarantee of fulfillment of obligations in civil law relations.  To ensure maximum security of bank financial assets in Russia, a special mechanism is used - bank pledge. </p><p>  Thus, the principle of the sale of collateral in VTB 24 is that the bank offers its customers to purchase movable and immovable property on favorable terms with the security of the transaction, conducting a legal audit of all property objects even before the paperwork begins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Collateral from VTB is a program called the ‚ÄúShowcase of Collateral‚Äù.  At auctions at VTB, the sale of collateral under the hammer gives people the opportunity to get their chosen property from a special catalog, but it is the real estate that is the mortgage property of VTB Bank. </p><p>  If it comes to cars, then their sale is possible only after a special legal audit, after which it is carried out in accordance with market prices.  There are times when the value of property can be reduced. </p><h2>  Sale of collateral through the official website </h2><p>  The sale of real estate at VTB Bank is carried out on the official website, in the "Showcase" section.  VZI VTB 24 is a search system that from the list of real estate provided helps to choose exactly the object of purchase, which is in the pledge, which interests each specific buyer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="take vtb 24" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55324/2151901.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Purchasing Confiscated Collateral </h2><p>  A confiscated property is property that for some reason has been seized and then forcibly taken from a person or organization.  Most often this happens due to insolvency of an individual or legal entity.  VTB's mortgage property showcase offers a wide selection of confiscated goods, and trading is ongoing.  Here, both legally verified property can be offered, and not verified, but each sold object has documents that can be presented to the buyer at any time upon request, so that he does not have unresolved issues regarding a particular object. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Confiscated liens can be purchased in several ways: </p><p>  1. In the remote access mode through the Unified trading platform. </p><p>  2. With a personal presence in Moscow (the address can be additionally found in the nearest branch of VTB Bank).  The showcase of collateral in VTB Moscow may not differ from other cities, if we are talking about an electronic trading platform </p><p>  3. CES is one of the largest federal electronic bidding operators.  In order to take part in the auction, you need to leave your application on the VTB official website, where it is also possible to choose the most suitable option from all property objects, however, this requires special accreditation.  Using the electronic system of VTB Bank, such a procedure can be carried out literally in two to three hours, which is very convenient and fast.  Mandatory conditions for obtaining accreditation - the presence of an electronic signature and the presence in the bank account of at least 10% of the total cost of the preferred lot as a guarantee of subsequent redemption.  If the buyer chooses not one but several lots, then for each of them it is necessary to provide 10% of the cost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vtb collateral property sale" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55324/2151902.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Acquisition of banking property from a shop window </h2><p>  Auction takes place in the usual, generally accepted way.  Bids on objects are gradually increasing, however, if there are not too many bidders, the price will not increase much, and the initial cost, as a rule, is much lower than the market price.  Thus, the purchase of collateral is more than a bargain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Having become the owner of one or another lot, it is absolutely necessary to fully pay its cost by personal means or, on special conditions, take a loan from the bank.  At the initial stage of the application, you must specify the payment method.  If the purchase is made at the expense of credit funds, then in this case the bank must carry out a solvency check of its client.  In this case, all lending conditions will be slightly different from the usual ones. </p><p>  After making payment for the selected lot, an individual or legal entity signs a special purchase and sale agreement with the bank, and then registers this property in its name in the window of VTB collateral property.  If the property was taken on credit, then it will be documented with the bank until the absolute repayment of loan obligations. </p><h2>  What property does the bank offer for repurchase? </h2><p>  The banking program "Showcase of collateral property" includes a rather large number of the most interesting offers, which include the purchase of commercial real estate.  Collateral in the window of VTB 24 collateral is very diverse.  It can be various warehouses, land, offices, entertainment centers, shops and much more.  Also, customers are given a convenient opportunity to rent a property. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="purchase of lots from a shop window" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55324/2151903.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Buying a home </h2><p>  The buyer has the right to choose housing on their own, taking into account all the offers of the primary and secondary market.  Offers that are usually in high demand are private houses and apartments.  A house or apartment can be purchased both within the city and beyond. </p><h2>  Acquisition of commercial vehicles </h2><p>  This proposal involves the acquisition of all kinds of transport equipment, both Russian and foreign production.  The cost of such facilities will depend on their technical condition, which can be completely different. </p><h2>  Passenger transport </h2><p>  VTB's mortgage property showcase offers the customer a wide selection of a wide variety of foreign and domestic cars.  Condition - excellent, satisfactory or unsatisfactory, the customer chooses in accordance with their own preferences and purchase goals. </p><h2>  Sea and other vessels </h2><p>  This is one of the most non-standard offers at VTB Bank in the window of collateral.  There are special parameters for selecting an object. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="VTB Bank showcase of collateral" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55324/2151904.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment purchase </h2><p>  In this section you can find a variety of equipment for the production of any goods.  A special catalog and a photo gallery in the window of VTB collateral property allow you to consider all possible offers in accordance with the location of the buyer.  You can also see all the offers in other areas of the country. </p><h2>  Sale of confiscated cars on lease </h2><p>  The sale of collateral objects through the window of collateral in VTB 24 includes the sale of seized trucks and cars, as well as special equipment.  Here, as in other sections, there is a special search system that will allow a private entrepreneur or an ordinary person to choose a product that matches his personal preferences.  It is even more convenient to buy a vehicle without an auction, the only condition for such a transaction will be the availability of funds to pay for the purchase in full.  There are times when the buyer does not have enough cash on hand, but in this case, VTB Bank helps to solve the problem.  Here there is a convenient offer to rent a car, and then buy it back, which will help to wait for the time when the client will have enough money and even save his money.  This system is called leasing.  Nevertheless, despite all the convenience of providing services, here the choice of cars is significantly reduced. </p><h2>  Mortgage on preferential terms </h2><p>  Individuals are more likely to purchase apartments than houses.  VTB Bank provides them with the opportunity to buy property that it owns through preferential mortgages on very favorable terms.  The cost of such objects is usually much lower than the market price, plus the client is given a privilege, which for him becomes the most profitable option to purchase housing.  The maximum cost of such facilities is 60,000,000 rubles.  The rate in Russian currency is 10% when applying for a policy, and the loan term is 30 years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage property vtb 24 showcase of mortgage property" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55324/2151906.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Down payment is approximately 20% of the total loan amount.  No commissions.  The plus is that in terms of fraud, the buyer does not risk anything, because all the real estate offered by the bank is legally clean, which greatly facilitates the preparation of all necessary documents and shortens the time for all transactions.  But there are some requirements that in this case are put forward by the bank in relation to the borrower.  Registration in the region of real estate purchase is not required.  It is necessary to confirm all available income with a 2-NDFL certificate and a bank form.  The bank also takes into account additional income of an individual.  The age that allows you to purchase real estate on mortgage terms is 21-75 years.  Also a prerequisite is official employment over the past 6 months.  The buyer should not have other loans, and the salary should be 2 times the loan payment. </p><p>  Stages of design: </p><p>  1. On-line filling in the application, which should contain an application with a list of scanned documents.  This list can be clarified in the service that provides information to customers of the bank </p><p>  2. Waiting for a bank decision.  If it turned out to be positive, you must select a property from the catalog. </p><p>  3. Register an agreement with the bank.  VTB Bank can offer bonuses to participants of this program. </p><h2>  Credit on preferential terms for individual entrepreneurs </h2><p>  Individual entrepreneurs who want to purchase real estate as collateral are also given the opportunity to obtain a loan on favorable concessionary terms.  This option has become available for representatives of various types of businesses - both small and large.  With the help of this loan you can buy any residential and non-residential property, any object of transport and special equipment.  The main condition here is to make a down payment, which is at least 20% of the total value of the collateral property.  It can be purchased at auction through the sale of collateral in VTB or directly purchased from the bank.  The maximum amount here is not more than 150,000,000 rubles, and the time frame is up to 10 years.  Commissions are not provided, and the policy is not required. </p>

Upon approval of the questionnaire by the bank, sign an agreement with him on the sale of the selected object. </p><p>  The documents that need to be submitted to the bank are constituent documents, passports of people participating in the transaction, a tax return, a certificate from the USRIP or the USRLE, a report on financial activities. </p><p>  If an excessively large amount of money is not required, then the buyer will not require a business plan, as well as a statement of the current account or any debt. </p><p>  The client has the right to submit an application to the bank with a request not to sell the collateral property he has chosen, while he collects all the necessary documents. </p><p>  So, individuals and legal entities have the opportunity to purchase collateral property of the bank on favorable terms for themselves with a large discount on the VTB program.  This can be done on the bank's website or at auction.  If the financial opportunity of the client does not allow to pay the purchase price, he is given the opportunity to lend. </p>
