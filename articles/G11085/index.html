    <h2>  Hotel "Leo" </h2><p>  If the choice is made exclusively at a price, then, of course, the first two options are beyond competition.  However, tourists often note that inexpensive hostels and hotels do not provide the level of comfort they would like.  If you have the same opinion, we recommend that you consider other hotels in Lyubertsy.  Not far from the two largest metro stations ("Zhulebino" and "Lermontovsky Prospekt"), at the address: 142 Oktyabrsky Prospekt, there is a mini-hotel "Lev".  It consists of only nine rooms, but you will certainly be pleased with comfortable suites and junior suites.  Refined interiors, high-quality furniture and all necessary household appliances will allow you to spend time just fine.  The price starts from 3300 rubles per room per day, this price includes a delicious breakfast, an excursion program.  The advantages of this hotel are obvious, it is very cozy, elegant, and also quiet.  Judging by the reviews, this is exactly the hotel where you want to return again and again. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Iskra </h2><p>  This particularly cozy hotel is located three kilometers from Lermontovsky Prospekt Metro Station, at 8a Marta Street, 4a.  Hotel "Iskra" offers you many beautiful rooms, but they do not include children, there are no special cots.  Each room has a fridge and a TV, while some have a private bathroom.  Sheremetyevo International Airport is 48 km away.  The hotel offers guests a sauna and minimarket.  A concierge is on duty 24 hours a day to answer all your questions.  The cost of rest starts at 3,500 rubles per day, which is the average cost for the city of Lyubertsy.  Pets are allowed upon prior request.  Tourists say that this is a fairly simple hotel, which is nothing special, but where you can spend the night with comfort. </p><h2>  Hotel Through the Looking Glass </h2><p>  This is an original hotel for organizing wonderful leisure activities, located at: st.  Kirova, 3. A pleasant stay will be provided by caring staff and an unusual interior, wonderful atmosphere for happy friends.  At your service are mirrored rooms and a cozy bar, a luxurious sauna with a swimming pool.  Even if you need a room for just a few hours, the hotel administration will meet you.  There are only five rooms, but the hotel is not designed for a massive flow of customers.  Rather, on the contrary, each guest is valued here and his individual wishes are taken into account.  A day's stay will cost you 3,500 rubles.  Judging by the reviews, this is a hotel for a special evening that you want to spend in unusual conditions.  But for a regular business trip, it is not suitable. </p>
