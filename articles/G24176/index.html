Never before having faced a similar problem, a person can come to a standstill.  Therefore, the purpose of our article is to tell you about how to block a Sberbank card correctly, while losing a minimum of your time. </p><p>  If a person has lost a Sberbank card, he should use one of the options below for blocking it. </p><p>  <strong>How to block <span>a Sberbank card</span> - help desk will tell</strong> </p><p>  One of the options for blocking a <span>plastic card</span> is to call the help service of Sberbank.  This is one of the easiest ways.  8 800 555 5550 <strong>is</strong> a number that everyone should remember.  Of course, not everyone is able to remember, therefore it is better to write it in your notebook.  This reference service allows not only to lock the card, but also to unlock it.  Among other things, it allows you to get the necessary information on the map.  There you can get additional information on how to block a Sberbank card. </p><p>  If your card has the Mobile Bank service activated, then you have the opportunity to send an SMS message to a simple number 900, in which you indicate the following: </p><p>  1. Write the word BLOKIROVKA. </p><p>  2. Indicate the last digits of the card (five should be written). </p><p>  3. Write one of the proposed numbers: </p><ul><li>  if the card is lost - 0; </li><li>  if the card is stolen - 1; </li><li>  left a card at an ATM - 2; </li><li>  another situation is 3. </li></ul><p>  The code that you will receive in the reply SMS message must be sent within five minutes to the number 900. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The card may stop working due to incorrect three-time input of the PIN code.  But in this case, the card unlocks itself after 24 hours. </p><p>  In the event that you have lost a credit card of Sberbank, it is urgently necessary to block it.  In this case, access to the card will be blocked both by the bank and by you and by unauthorized persons. </p><p>  When should you block a credit card? </p><p>  Firstly, in case of loss or theft of a card.  It may happen that one of the passersby picks up the card you lost and uses it for your own purposes.  However, all purchases made from your card will have to be paid to you, and not to a third party. </p><p>  Secondly, they decided to block the forgotten credit card without your participation.  You can simply forget the <span>credit card</span> in the store where you made the purchase of products.  Such cards are immediately blocked by the administration of the store. </p><p>  As in the first case, you can simply call 8 800 555 5550. This is the Sberbank hotline that will help you block the card.  You can <span>lock out a Sberbank card by</span> sending a message to 900. The instruction was given above. </p><p>  The simplest, but more time-consuming and time-consuming option is the option of going to the Sberbank branch.  You will have to visit Sberbank even if you call the hotline or send SMS to 900. This is done in order to provide written confirmation of the card‚Äôs blocking.  And you need to do this no later than three days, calculated from the moment you call or send a message.  If you contact Sberbank, the card will be locked quickly. </p><p>  There are other ways to block a Sberbank card, but the most effective ones have already been presented in our article. </p><p>  Locking a Sberbank card is easier than unlocking.  Therefore, when blocking a card, foresee the moment of its unlocking. </p><p>  So, from what has been said it is clear that there are three main ways to block the operation of a Sberbank card.  The first method is to send a message to the number 900. The second method involves contacting Sberbank's support team - hotline number 8 800 555 5550. And, finally, the third method is to contact the Sberbank branch for help in blocking the card. </p><p>  Do not forget that the first two methods should always end with the third.  Any of these methods requires contacting a Sberbank branch to write a written confirmation of the card blocking.  Only after all the operations done, you can count on the fact that no one will use your lost card (if you lost it).  That you don‚Äôt have to put money out of your pocket to pay for someone else‚Äôs purchases. </p>
