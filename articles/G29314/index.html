The manufacturer plans to replace the 6300 model with this device. It should be noted that the functionality of our ‚Äúhero‚Äù is much richer. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2><p>  For Nokia, the most successful form factor with the highest level of sales was the classic - monoblocks.  Model 6700 runs on the familiar S40 platform.  It should be noted that this is not just about the previous device with improved characteristics.  The updated Nokia 6700 Classic firmware implemented a number of features that had not previously been seen in competitors' devices.  Among them, CABC and UNC technologies stand out.  The device has received widespread demand among users.  We can also say that we have a direct continuation of the 6500 Classic. </p>

    <h2>  Design, size, controls </h2><p>  The manufacturer officially introduced four color options.  Among them, Nokia 6700 Classic of gold color should be highlighted, since this shade pleases with its elegance.  The size of the device is 109.8 x 45 x 11.2 mm and weighs 116.5 grams.  If you look at the reviews, ‚ÄúNokia 6700 Classic‚Äù users consider a phone with a pleasant and comfortable external settings.  If you pay attention to the back of the case, we can say that it is entirely made of special <span>stainless steel.</span>  Such metal slightly cools the hand, causing a pleasant sensation.  Based on the color, the coating also changes.  For example, in the chrome design there is a glossy surface, over time, traces of scratches may remain on it.  If we talk about abrasion resistance, it perfectly manifests itself in a matte version.  However, the most practical was <span>black.</span>  The rear surface has a 5-megapixel camera, LED flash and speaker.  The right <span>side panel</span> received a paired volume key and a camera button.  At the same time, the microUSB connector hit the bottom, as did the input for connecting the charger (2 mm).  The assembly of the apparatus and the quality of materials are at the highest level and do not cause complaints.  There is no backlash.  The execution is very reliable.  It is convenient to compare the phone with the 8800 Arte model, similar case materials are used here, and it can be called similar in aesthetics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  The screen of Nokia 6700 Classic is QVGA with a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels.  The display displays 16 million colors, the colors are juicy and bright.  The light indicator is able to change the backlight, based on external conditions.  CABC technology debuted in this unit.  Thanks to it, the brightness of the backlight changes based on the ambient lighting and what the phone‚Äôs screen is currently displaying.  For example, when viewing Internet resources with a lot of text, the screen becomes muted, the text becomes more contrast.  As for games, here, on the contrary, the brightness increases, if only the user is not in absolute darkness.  Thus, you can significantly save battery power.  Ideally, 50% of energy can be saved in this way.  At the same time, working with the screen remains just as comfortable.  Forced brightness control in the phone is missing.  The screen displays 9 text lines and 3 service lines.  The font is readable, quality.  With special operating modes, the phone can show up to 16 text lines. </p>

    <h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  The keypad of Nokia 6700 Classic is slightly buried behind the edge of the case.  For the keyboard used one piece of a metal plate.  The buttons have a good stroke and are easily pressed.  The keyboard feels like you can compare with that of the <span>Nokia 6300.</span> You can quickly get used to it.  The backlighting is white, bright and uniform.  The navigation key is convenient, it has a built-in indicator light.  In case of missed events, it blinks.  It is curious that with active backlighting, characters on the screen are created from points with different brightness.  This design looks nice. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
