    <p>  Patterns and principles of learning are important components that are inherent not only to learning, but to all, without exception, the sciences and <span>subsystems of society.</span>  The determination of the laws of instruction largely depends on the level of development of the humanities and anthropological sciences.  Today, in view of the current level of development of <span>pedagogical theory,</span> it is possible to formulate some patterns and principles of instruction. </p><p>  The pattern of learning is a system of general, essential, objective, necessary and steadily repeating relationships between pedagogical phenomena, as well as components of the learning process that characterize their functioning and development.  Allocate internal and external patterns. </p><p>  Internal patterns are: subordination of the result to learning the student‚Äôs activity and the <span>way the</span> learning is <span>managed</span> , the dependence of learning on how to find a contradiction between cognitive (practical) tasks and the level of students ‚Äôskills, knowledge and skills necessary for their solution, their mental development. </p><p>  External patterns are: the developing and educating nature of instruction, the social conditioning of the methods, goals and content of instruction, the dependence of the learning outcomes on the characteristics of the student‚Äôs contact with the elements of the world, the implementation of instruction in communication and based on a web-based approach. </p><p>  Speaking in a more understandable language, the external laws include the dependence of the learning process on social conditions and processes (level of culture, political and economic situation, etc.).  By internal laws are meant the connections between the components of the learning process, for example, between the student, teacher and educational material, between the <span>content of education,</span> goals, means, methods and forms of learning. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All these laws can be considered precisely established, since they have been checked, confirmed and explained many times.  Since the learning process is always influenced by economic, social, cultural and other phenomena, in the course of further development of the <span>humanities</span> , new laws of the learning process will be established. </p><p>  Patterns and principles of learning are closely interconnected.  And all for the reason that, on the basis of laws, the <span>formation of principles is</span> taking place exactly the same <span>.</span>  Principles are understood as general provisions that define the requirements for the organization, content, management and implementation of the learning process.  In pedagogical science, the principles of culture and nature conformity, problematicity, optimality, consistency, consistency, accessibility in education and training, and many others are currently formulated.  Understanding the principles of training makes it possible to organize training, depending on its laws, as well as justified to determine the goal, choose appropriate <span>forms and methods of training.</span> </p><p>  The principles of training can be divided into general didactic and methodological.  General didactic principles of teaching include the principles of consciousness, accessibility, feasibility, strength, visibility, activity, educative training, individualization.  Methodological principles of teaching are the principle of accounting for the native language, the principle of communicative orientation and the principle of integration and differentiation. </p><p>  Thus, the laws and principles of training are in direct connection with each other.  First, patterns arise, and only then, in view of their development, principles arise, the development of which is also largely associated with the development of new teaching concepts and theories. </p>
