    <p>  Chaim Weizman was born on 11/27/1874 in the village of Motyl near Pinsk (modern Belarus).  His father worked as an officer in an office that was engaged in timber rafting.  The family had six more daughters and two sons. </p><p>  Children were brought up in an atmosphere of Jewish traditions, but with elements of enlightenment.  At first, Chaim was brought up in a header, after which he continued his studies at a real school, which he graduated in 1892. </p><p>  The young man received further education in Germany and Switzerland.  With a doctorate, he becomes a professor, first at the University of Geneva, and later at Manchester. </p><h2>  The beginning of a political career </h2>

Its representatives were inspired by the ideas of <span>T. Herzl.</span>  Weizmann began to come up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding a university for the Jews, which was to become the spiritual center of Zionism. </p><p>  At the same time, Chaim Weizman was an opponent of the so-called Uganda plan, according to which it was supposed to create a temporary Jewish national center away from historical lands. </p><p>  After settling in Manchester, he formed pro-British views.  Here he marries Vera Hatsman, who was a university student.  By 1910, the teacher received British citizenship and met Lord Balfour.  Chaim convinces his close acquaintance (the future British Foreign Minister) that it is necessary to create a Jewish national home in the land of Israel. </p><h2>  During the first world </h2><p>  With the outbreak of war, the Zionist circle took a neutral position.  Although some of its representatives, for example Vladimir Zhabotinsky, decided to form the Jewish Legion as part of <span>the British Army.</span>  He was supposed to free Palestine from the rule of the Turks. </p><p>  Jabotinsky's plans were supported by Chaim Weizmann.  It was he who organized the meeting with Lord Kitchener, who served as British War Secretary. </p><p>  During the war, Weizmann was able to provide substantial service to the British army.  The armed forces needed acetone, which was used to produce smokeless gunpowder.  Prior to this, acetone was imported from the United States, but everything changed with the presence of German submarines in the Atlantic Ocean in 1915.  The chemist was able to expand the production of acetone on the island.  For its creation, grain starch was first used, but this began to affect the supply of grain crops to the domestic market.  Therefore, it was decided to use horse chestnut fruits that did not have nutritional value.  Even schoolchildren took part in the chestnut collection. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Thanks to this, Weizmann acquired important ties among the ruling circles of Britain.  He was able to get the British authorities to show interest in Zionism.  As a result, the Balfour Declaration was signed in 1917.  The document marked the beginning of the restoration of the Jewish center in Palestine. </p>

    <p>  With the advent of the Balfour Declaration, the politician became extremely popular in Zionist circles.  In 1918, he became the head of the Zionist Commission, which was sent to Palestine from the British government.  The commission was supposed to assess the prospects for the possible settlement and further development of the Jews.  Weizmann's subsequent life was closely tied to the creation of a center of his people in Palestine. </p><h2>  During the second world </h2>

    <p>  Before the outbreak of World War II, Haim Weizmann, whose biography is associated with the creation of Israel, began to lose popularity in Zionist circles.  The reason for this was the creation by Britain of a white paper, which was contrary to the principles of the Balfour Declaration. </p><p>  In the early days of the war, a political scientist made an official statement to the British government.  It stated that the Jews would be on the side of Britain and want to fight for democracy. </p><p>  During the war, Weizmann worked on the production of high-octane fuel, artificial rubber.  He encouraged Jews to serve in the British forces.  During the war years, there were about twenty-seven thousand volunteers, including Weizmann's son, who died in 1942. </p><h2>  The creation of Israel </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the post-war Zionist organization did not re-elect Weizmann as chairman of the World Zionist Organization, he did not abandon the attempt to create a Jewish state. </p>

    <p>  Thanks to his efforts in 1947, the UN decided to divide Palestine.  A few days after the founding of the state, the future president of Israel was able to obtain from the head of the United States (Truman) consent to provide a loan on favorable terms to the Jewish state in the amount of one hundred million dollars. </p><p>  Politics was elected head of the Provisional Council of the new state in 1948, and in 1949 - the first president.  By that time he was seventy-four years old.  Due to age and illness, it was difficult for him to engage in public affairs.  The residence was his personal home in Rehovot.  Weizmann was re-elected for a second term in 1951. </p><p>  The President of Israel died on 11/11/1952 as a result of a long illness. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2>

    <p>  According to the will, Weizmann is buried in the garden of his own house, which is located on the territory of the Research Institute in Rehovot.  Since 1949, the institute began to bear his name. </p><p>  The first president in 1949 published his own autobiography.  She was published in England under the name "In Search of a Way." </p><p>  Chaim Weizmann (quotes confirm that) was a smart and judicious politician.  He knew how to convey his idea to the interlocutor.  The most vivid statements: ‚ÄúWe had Jerusalem when there were still swamps in place of London‚Äù, ‚ÄúPerhaps we are the sons of merchants, but we are the grandchildren of the prophets.‚Äù </p><p>  Weizmann's nephew by brother (Ezer) became the seventh president of Israel.  He ruled the country in 1993-2000. </p>
