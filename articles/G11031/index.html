    <h2>  Excursion into the past </h2><p>  Long before the purchase of a large piece of land, the family of English kings in this part of Scotland was a fortress and estate, from which Balmoral castle got its name.  There are several versions of descriptions of this historical event: </p><ul><li>  Some say that the purchase of land in Scotland was the decision of Prince Albert, whose locality caused associations with his homeland, Thuringia.  Then, by order of the monarch, a <span>Gothic castle</span> in the old Scottish style was erected, which was later presented as a gift to his wife. </li><li>  Others believe that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuying an estate belonged to Queen Victoria herself.  The deal took place for 30,000 guineas after the death of the previous owner of the site, choked on fish bone.  And then, on the orders of the Queen, a beautiful castle was erected, which became a summer residence. </li><li>  According to the third version, at first Albert and Victoria rented a medieval castle in Highland in 1848.  And since they really liked the area, they decided to buy here their plot of land for a summer residence. </li></ul><p>  Despite the large number of versions, the facts are as follows.  The acquisition of the Balmoral estate took place in 1852.  Since the old Gothic castle was too cramped and inconvenient for the owners, the construction of a new one began.  For this, the famous architect William Smith was invited.  His project was completed by 1856. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So that the royal couple did not experience great inconvenience, they began to erect a new structure at a certain distance from the previous one.  And when all the work was completely completed, the old building was destroyed.  It is known that the castle of Balmoral was visited by the last Russian emperor Nicholas II and his wife in 1896.  What happened to the fortress now? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gothic castle" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/2036822.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  Balmoral Castle today </h2><p>  From the very beginning, the castle had a special, reverent attitude.  It is considered a hallmark of all the English kings, starting from the middle of the XIX century.  Therefore, Balmoral Castle is still used as a summer cottage.  According to the inhabitants of the castle, everyone who has ever visited this fabulous, paradise-like place will be irresistibly drawn to come back here again and again. </p><p>  Every year, a family of English monarchs lives in this area for up to 10 weeks.  This period falls on the last month of summer and the beginning of autumn.  At this time, visiting this Scottish attraction stops. </p><p>  Traditions are carefully preserved inside the castle.  For example, from ancient times it was customary to start the morning with music performed on the bagpipe, an old Scottish instrument.  Such a peculiar ‚Äúalarm clock‚Äù is used today.  The interior decoration is also made in the old Scottish style.  And everyone inside must be dressed in the national clothes of this country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="balmoral castle scotland" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/2036817.jpg" width="448"></div>

Since Prince Albert was keenly interested in innovations in this area, he strove to fit the structure into the terrain as naturally as possible. </p><p>  Those who compiled the description of the Balmoral castle note the relatively small height of the structure.  Most of it is a building on 3 floors with a basement.  An element resembling a watchtower is the tallest part of the building.  In the center of the main part of the building is a tower that connects two courtyards located diagonally.  To enhance the romantic appearance in the corners of the house made small turrets. </p><p>  Cream granite was chosen for the construction of the castle.  Because of him, Balmoral Castle acquired such a majestic and noble appearance.  And thanks to the figures depicting saints and heraldic animals, the walls are turned into a real work of art. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="balmoral castle" class="if" height="248" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/2036820.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  About the area near the castle </h2><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe plot acquired by the royal family in the 19th century is about 20,000 hectares of land.  In addition to the castle, there are virgin forests, in which the best hunting grounds in the country are located. </p><p>  The waters of the Di River, flowing around the castle, is home to a lot of fish.  Therefore, one of the entertainment for guests is fishing.  At the same time, an ancient tradition is observed: all fish caught in these places must be released back into the river before sunset. </p><p>  Since Balmoral Castle is located in a mountainous area, its lands are poorly adapted for agriculture.  Nevertheless, vegetables and fruits are actively grown on the estate, which are then served at the royal table. </p><p>  Describing the beauty surrounding the castle, it is impossible not to mention the amazing flower gardens, the greenhouse.  Of the natural beauties in the memory of many tourists, the gentle sea, narrow mountain trails and magnificent waterfalls remain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Balmoral Castle Description" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/2036821.jpg" width="448"></div>
