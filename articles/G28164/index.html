    <p>  Even the smallest child can make an application on a winter theme, however, he will need the help of an adult.  But such a lesson from the student will not require too much effort, and the time will be spent interestingly.  It is worth noting that making an application of this topic can be interesting for an adult as well - the main thing is to correctly determine goals and select materials. </p><p>  So, with the help of a fabric applique, you can decorate a pillowcase, children's pajamas or any other thing.  And from paper of various textures and colors you can create a whole picture called ‚ÄúBullfinches in the winter on the mountain ash‚Äù, which will be an excellent addition to the interior of a children's room, living room or kitchen.  However, whatever you decide to make the application, the ideal option is the joint work of a child and an adult. </p><h2>  Preparation of materials and tools </h2>

This case is no exception.  The application ‚ÄúBullfinch‚Äù made of paper requires the following materials and tools: cardboard, colored paper, standard white sheets, napkins, <span>PVA glue</span> or a glue stick, scissors, a pencil favorite by small craftsmen, a ruler.  Felt-tip pens will also be needed if some elements of the application (for example, the eyes of a bird, paws) are planned to be finished. </p><p>  If you are going to make a fabric applique, then you need to stock up on the fabric with the necessary colors, a needle, threads and scissors.  As for the colors of the main material, you can step back a little from the usual image of a bullfinch and to make its abdomen, use not red fabric, but for example, in white polka dots, orange or pink.  As for the wings and the head, it is better to leave them black with small inserts of gray, so the bird will be more similar to its prototype. </p><h2>  Creation of patterns for the application ‚ÄúBullfinch on a mountain ash‚Äù </h2>

    <p>  So, you have decided that your craft will be a bullfinch - an application made of paper.  The templates for creating this birdie need to be done immediately after all the materials and tools for the work have been collected.  Indeed, thanks to them, all further work on the application, whether it is fabric or paper, will be greatly simplified.  As for the manufacture of templates, it is easiest to use the ones below.  However, if you draw well, you can create unique templates yourself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If it is decided to use the filed option, then the sheet will need to be printed, transferred to a thick cardboard, circled with a simple pencil and cut.  It is worth noting that the denser the templates, the more convenient it will work.  Further, the obtained blanks must be installed on paper or fabric of suitable colors, circled, cut, placed in the right places, and soon you will get the application ‚ÄúBullfinch on a rowan branch‚Äù.  You can also use <span>geometric shapes</span> to create bullfinch patterns <span>,</span> but more on that below.  As for the details for the rowan branch, they will serve as small circles that will replace the berries, and long narrow rectangles to create the branch itself.  By the way, rectangles can be cut out of brown paper without any patterns - it‚Äôs more convenient and faster, but you have to tinker with the berries a bit. </p><h2>  Children's application "Bullfinch on a rowan branch" </h2><p>  It is advisable for an adult to make the above templates in advance.  The application ‚ÄúBullfinch on a rowan branch‚Äù may seem a little complicated for a preschool child.  Next, you need to cut out the body of the bird and rowan berries from red paper, from the wing - the eye and from black, from the gray - paws and beak, and from brown - bush branches.  The most suitable background for the application is blue or white paper, but you can use any other. </p><p>  When all the parts are ready, you only need to stick them in their places.  First, the body of the bird should be placed in the middle of the leaf, then the wing, beak and eyes.  Then, glue the main branch a little lower, and only after that attach the bird's legs a little overlap.  This procedure is needed in order to give the impression that a bullfinch is sitting on a bush.  Lastly, you will need to ‚Äúassemble‚Äù a rowan branch from previously prepared parts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Fabric applique </h2><p>  The application ‚ÄúBullfinch on a mountain ash‚Äù, made of fabric or felt, can be an excellent decoration for children‚Äôs clothing or <span>decorative pillowcases.</span>  For its manufacture, you can use the templates presented above, however, you will need to cut out the details this time from the fabric.  This application is made much easier than it might seem at first glance. </p><p>  First you need to cut out all the necessary parts from a suitable fabric and sew them with a needle in the same manner as a paper application to the product.  And if you are also the owner of a sewing machine, then such a <span>clothing decor</span> will take you very little time.  It is worth noting that from the fabric you can make whole pictures to decorate the interior or present to someone as a gift, just put them in a frame. </p><h2>  Winter applique - paper mosaic </h2>

    <p>  Very easy to manufacture, but no less interesting in appearance, and possibly more, is a winter application in the form of a mosaic.  For its manufacture, you can apply the same template, or you can draw a bullfinch on a sheet of white paper using the diagram below. </p><p>  Regardless of whether you will use a ready-made template or draw a bird yourself, it is important that it is in the center of the sheet.  Next, you need to create a winter background.  To do this, you need to tear or cut many small pieces of paper of different textures in white, blue and <span>blue colors.</span>  It can be standard sheets, corrugated, color or wallpaper paper. </p><p>  It is worth noting that this work does not require great accuracy, which, of course, is to the liking of little masters.  The fact is that the prepared pieces do not need any ordered and even gluing.  They can be attached in any position, side by side or with an overlap, glued completely or leaving the protruding ends - this will make the finished application ‚ÄúBullfinch on a mountain ash branch‚Äù more interesting. </p><p>  When the background is completely ready, you can proceed to the manufacture of the bird itself.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe wings, tail and legs should be sealed with black and gray pieces of paper, the abdomen with red and pink, the branches with brown.  Completely finished application must be left for several hours to dry. </p><h2>  Bullfinch of geometric shapes: an interesting application </h2>

    <p>  Another interesting <span>applique for children</span> can be a bullfinch made of geometric shapes.  By the way, it is a great way to introduce a child to geometry.  Of course, such a bird will more resemble a cartoon character, however, children will definitely like this bullfinch (paper application).  Templates do not have to be prepared in advance, you can draw the necessary shapes immediately on the sheets you need colors. </p><p>  So, you need a big black circle for the trunk, a red oval for the breast, 2 small red circles for the cheeks, 2 white ovals for the eyes, 2 small black circles for the pupils, a small orange triangle for the beak, 3-5 narrow black ellipses - for a shaggy hairstyle, 3 black ovals - for the tail, 2 gray ovals - for the wings.  When all the details are cut out, you only need to assemble them.  It is more convenient to draw a rowan branch and bird legs with a brown felt-tip pen, but you can also cut it out of paper. </p><h2>  Winter picture from plain paper and napkins </h2>

    <p>  If you need to take a few children at home or in kindergarten, you can offer them to create a whole picture-application on a winter theme.  By the way, there is also a lesson for an adult in this matter, because it is necessary for someone to coordinate the actions of children, as well as to make parts that are too complicated for them. </p><p>  A bullfinch stencil for an application can be made independently using the template provided above, or try to buy a finished one.  Since it is planned to create the whole picture, there should be several birds.  They can either sit on a bush with mountain ash, or jump on snowdrifts, or peck grain in a feeder - it all depends on the wishes and fantasies of the guys. </p><p>  The bodies of bullfinches must be cut out of black paper, and the breast should be made of small lumps of red napkins, for the manufacture of which children will need a lot of time.  When the lumps are ready, they need to be glued to a black template in the abdomen, in a similar way you can create snow, though from white or blue napkins, rowan from orange, twigs from brown.  This winter applique will contribute to an interesting leisure of children and will be a great decoration for any room! </p>
