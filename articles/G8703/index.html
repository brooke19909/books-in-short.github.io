In countries such as Thailand, the Philippines, Cuba and the Dominican Republic, the rainy season is already ending. </p><p>  Hoteliers carried out repairs in the summer and are looking forward to the first guests.  In this article we will talk about the Duangjitt Resort &amp; Spa 4 * hotel. </p><p>  It is located on the largest island of Thailand Phuket, in the famous city of Patong.  What is the hotel so famous for? </p><p>  We will also talk about this below.  We compiled a description of the hotel not only on the basis of information provided by the administration. </p><p>  We studied and analyzed a lot of reviews, including recent ones, to create an objective and complete picture of the room fund, service and services at this hotel.  The total hotel rating is 4.53 out of five. </p><div class="photo" data-original="duangjitt-resort-spa-patong.booked.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Duangjitt Resort &amp; Spa 4 *" class="if uuid-2921014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2921014.jpg"></div><h2>  Location of the hotel Duangjitt Resort 4 * </h2><p>  Thailand, Patong, Phuket, Prachnukro Road, 18 - this is the address of the institution.  On the map of the resort you can see that this is the very center of the city. </p><p>  The hotel is not on the first line, but only 200 meters to the main beach of Patong Beach.  The famous Bangla Road, which we will talk about in more detail, lies a kilometer away. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Patting Pier, from which boats and boats depart to the cleaner beaches of Kata and Karon, is 300 meters away.  The hotel is in the whirlpool of resort life. </p><p>  Here you can find Starbucks Coffee, OTOR supermarket, Jung Ceylon shopping and entertainment center, and Banzaan Fresh evening market.  Some establishments that are not located in Bangla Road are also nearby. </p><p>  These are the Banana Walk and Phuket Simon cabarets.  Near the hotel, a little to the left, there is a 7/11 grocery store.  But to another famous shopping and entertainment center "Patong Fantazia" is quite far away - eight kilometers. </p><p>  Phuket International Airport is 25 km from the hotel.  You can get to the resting place in half an hour. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="7.885639299999999" data-lng="98.29192239999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/6/4/4/10644.png"></div><h2>  The nuances of rest in Patong </h2><p>  This resort, like Pattaya, is known as one of the centers of the Thai sex industry.  The main street of Patong is called Bangla Road. </p><p>  It consists entirely of ‚Äúgo-go bars‚Äù and similar institutions.  Go to Patong to watch transvestite shows and have fun. </p><p>  This is a favorite vacation spot for young people.  But the hotel Duangjitt Resort &amp; Spa 4 * in Patong is located south of the evil places. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Thais themselves live in this area.  In addition, the vast territory of the hotel serves as a 100% guarantee of peace and quiet. </p><p>  In this oasis with numerous shady avenues, decorative ponds with lotuses and goldfish, among birdsong and the flutter of tropical butterflies, you will even forget that you are in Patong.  And you will want dubious joys, forward: a quarter of an hour on foot - and you are on Bangla Road. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Duangjitt Resort &amp; Spa 4 *, Phuket" class="if uuid-2921008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2921008.jpg"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Duangjitt Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (Phuket) was built a long time ago, in 1986, when the tourism business in Thailand was just gaining momentum.  This allowed the hotel owner to acquire a truly vast territory. </p><p>  Duanghit Resort is the largest hotel not only in Patong, but throughout Phuket.  This vast territory is landscaped in the best way. </p><p>  It is all turned into a garden of paradise.  Landscape designers did a great job - at the hotel you just forget that you are in the very center of a bustling city. </p><p>  It seems that this is a marvelous Eden - with fragrant exotic flowers, waterfalls, pools.  The Garden wing houses bungalows - small Chinese-style houses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  They place those who want to relax not only from work, but also from their own kind.  There are three-story buildings in the hotel. </p><p>  Tourists vacationing at the hotel in the low season (summer) mention in the reviews that repair work was constantly taking place there.  Renovation affected a large swimming pool; suites were completely rebuilt. </p><h2>  Where do guests stay </h2><p>  In the hotel Duangjitt Resort 4 * can find accommodation for both discerning and budget tourists.  The fund consists of 482 rooms. </p><p>  Almost every category of rooms has its own analogue both in the building and in the bungalow.  The rooms are called superior building rooms and superior bungalow. </p><p>  They are the same in area, in terms of service and technical content too.  The whole difference is that the bungalow is more quiet and calm. </p><p>  These houses are located deep in the entrance, at the far end of the garden.  In addition to the superior category, there are also deluxe, grand deluxe, suite, duplex (duplex) and villa rooms. </p><p>  The last three consist of a bedroom and a living room.  All rooms have balconies and private bathrooms with showers. </p><p>  Superior rooms include slippers and bathrobes.  In the "villas and suites", in addition to the shower, there are also bathtubs. </p><p>  Regarding the choice of room, tourists in the reviews do not give unambiguous recommendations.  The bungalow is quiet and green, but if you are afraid of crawling insects and lizards climbing from the garden, book a room in the buildings on the second or third floor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wotif.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Duangjitt Resort 4 *, rooms" class="if uuid-2921025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2921025.jpg"></div><h2>  Room features </h2><p>  Each living room of Duangjitt Resort &amp; Spa 4 * hotel has air conditioning (there is also a ceiling fan in the duplex), an electric kettle, a TV with satellite channels, a minibar, a safe, and a hairdryer.  Every day, maids put new cosmetics, towels, put a bottle of drinking water on a person, replenish tea and coffee bags. </p><p>  The villas and duplexes also have a DVD player.  Tourists in the reviews say that you should not be indignant at the unassuming view of the bungalow "superior".  These houses are built in the style of Chinese huts, that is, outside they are lined with palm straws. </p><p>  But inside the room is completely European, and the bathroom is striking in its cleanliness, shine of tiles and new plumbing.  After all, according to tourists vacationing at this hotel in the summer, the last renovation touched this particular category of bungalow. </p><p>  But in other rooms - guests assure - no worse.  They clean the rooms every day.  Maids give plenty of towels. </p><p>  Tourists like that you can make drinks at any time: there is clean water, tea bags and coffee.  A minibar is often used as a refrigerator for storing food. </p><h2>  Breakfast </h2><p>  The cost of rooms at the Duangjitt Resort 4 * hotel includes a morning meal.  Breakfast is buffet style. </p><p>  The restaurant where the meal takes place is air-conditioned.  You can eat inside, you can - on the open and shaded porch at the largest of the three pools. </p><p>  Breakfast is very varied and designed for every taste.  There is a set for a vegetarian meal. </p><p>  Those who are used to European traditional breakfasts (scrambled eggs or omelettes, sausages, etc.) will also be satisfied, as are those who adhere to a healthy diet.  For the latter there are granola, milk, a large selection of fresh vegetables and fruits. </p><p>  For those who like to start the morning with soup, there are also two dishes to choose from - Thai with noodles and broth with herbs.  Sweet tooth assures that they were satisfied.  For breakfast, croissants, rolls, Viennese waffles, pancakes and pancakes are baked. </p><p>  Of course, the assortment of dishes is the same every day.  Sometimes buns are replaced with muffins, and pineapples are replaced with watermelons. </p><p>  If you live in a hotel for more than a week, you will have time to try everything.  But in principle, tourists are satisfied with breakfasts, and they give a rating of 4.9 points out of five possible. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel and nearby </h2><p>  The hotel Duangjitt Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (Thailand) has two restaurants.  Bamburi specializes in Thai cuisine, while Tomtong specializes in Asian and European cuisine. </p><p>  Lunch can also be enjoyed at the poolside bar.  They cook very tasty there. </p><p>  But of course, the prices in hotel restaurants and bars are much higher than in the city.  Therefore, many guests were dining just outside the resort. </p><p>  To attract the public, the administration goes on a trick: distributes coupons for a free drink in the bar.  What if the guest wants to repeat or take some snack? </p><p>  As for the catering establishments nearby, the tourist relations are like that.  A grocery store "7/11" is nearby.  There is a microwave where you can warm up bought fast food for free, and an ice tank for drinks. </p><p>  Burger King and McDonald's must be walked to the left of the hotel for about five minutes.  Also nearby is Starbucks Coffee.  And right in front of the hotel from five in the evening, a small food market unfolds. </p><p>  That's where you can arrange a feast for the stomach!  Dishes here are prepared right at your place with the freshest ingredients.  And the prices are more than affordable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zuji.com.hk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Duangjitt Resort &amp; Spa 4 (Phuket, Thailand)" class="if uuid-2921030" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2921030.jpg"></div><h2>  Infrastructure and service </h2><p>  It is not known how the administration succeeds, but throughout the vast territory of the Duangjitt Resort 4 * hotel there is Wi-Fi.  When you check in, they will give you a PIN code, and you can connect to the network anywhere - in the room (even in the farthest from the reception of the bungalow), by the pool, on the veranda of the restaurant, on a bench in the park, in the Spa center. </p><p>  Your luggage will be delivered and taken back by a small electric car.  If you get tired of stomping to the pool or restaurant from the far corners of your tropical paradise, you can call a car - this service is free. </p><p>  Around noon, an ironing room is open.  This is another of the nice free bonuses.  From seven in the morning until eight in the evening room service is available. </p><p>  Beach towels are provided at the hotel.  And if you stopped at the resort during the rainy season, then in each room you will find an umbrella. </p><h2>  SPA-center </h2><p>  Not for nothing that the hotel is called Duangjitt Resort &amp; Spa 4 *.  There are many spa centers in Phuket, but this one is the largest and most impressive. </p><p>  It is more like an island of complete relaxation.  Indeed, in addition to numerous procedures - a jacuzzi, a bath, all kinds of massages - there is a special entourage there. </p><p>  Tourists write in reviews that the hotel's spa has its own ponds, gardens and pools.  The aroma of flowers is mixed there with oriental incense. </p><p>  Prices, of course, bite.  Massage in salons on the streets of Patong will cost you much cheaper. </p><p>  But the masters at the hotel spa are certified.  They can carry out not only a general, relaxing, but also therapeutic back massage. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Hotel Duangjitt Resort 4 * (Phuket, Thailand), although it does not stand on the first line, is a stone's throw from the shore.  Just two minutes of a leisurely walk - and you are on the main beach of Patong Beach resort. </p><p>  This long strip of sand stretched along the entire center.  Duangitt Resort is located closer to the southern part of the beach. </p><p>  And in the center of the sea the notorious Bangla Road abuts.  Therefore, the cleanliness of the main municipal beach leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  Let's face it: it is frankly dirty, especially in the morning.  Therefore, the contingent of vacationers in the hotel is divided into two groups: those that do not leave the hotel walls at all and are satisfied with pools, and those that ride bikes, motor rickshaws or tuk-tuks to the wonderful beaches of Phuket - Karon, Kathu, Surin. </p><p>  All of them are free.  White sand, high-class service, tropical paradise - what else is needed for a vacation in Thailand? </p><p>  Patong Pier is located near the hotel.  Why not wave to the coveted pristine beaches on a longtail boat? </p><h2>  Pools </h2><p>  The administration of the Duangjitt Resort 4 * hotel (Thailand) is well aware that the nearest beach (or rather, the cleanliness of its sand and water area) is the fattest minus of the hotel. </p><p>  Therefore, she took care that customers had plenty to swim and sunbathe.  There is absolutely no need to go beyond the paradise oasis, because there are three luxurious pools on the territory. </p><p>  The first is located at the reception (the passage to it is to the left of the reception).  It is small, but adjacent to the spa area, with its bamboo alleys and blooming orchids. </p><p>  The second pool is to the right of the reception.  It is adjacent to the open veranda of the main restaurant (where breakfast is served). </p><p>  The third pool is not just big, but huge.  It looks like a lake with an island in the middle. </p><p>  On the one hand there is an artificial waterfall.  There is also a hydromassage bowl. </p><p>  This pool, unlike the two small ones, designed for a quiet rest in the relax style, is in demand among young people and parents with children.  There is a water bar and a cafe.  A shallow area for bathing children adjoins the pool. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wotif.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Duangjitt Resort &amp; Spa 4 * pools" class="if uuid-2921020" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2921020.jpg"></div><h2>  Sun baths </h2><p>  In the hotel Duangjitt Resort 4 * free beach towels are provided.  They can be changed at least several times a day. </p><p>  Issue and pick up signature towels in a special pavilion by the large pool.  All swimming tanks surround tanning beds. </p><p>  There are a lot of sun loungers and umbrellas; there is no need to occupy them early.  The only minus of the main pool is the ability to smoke (ashtrays are on the tables). </p><p>  Many vacationers do not like it.  But on the sunbeds there are soft mattresses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Duangjitt Resort 4, Thailand" class="if uuid-2921029" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2921029.jpg"></div><h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  We have already written about the small ‚Äúpaddling pool‚Äù adjacent to the main pool.  Hotel Duangjitt Resort 4 * (Phuket) positions itself as a place of family relaxation. </p><p>  Despite the dubious glory of Patong, tourists come here with children.  An animation program is provided for the youngest guests of the hotel. </p><p>  The mini club is located in the shady corner of the garden.  His houses resemble giant multi-colored mushrooms. </p><p>  But the staff at the hotel, including the mini-club, do not speak Russian.  Although, according to the parents, this does not bother the kids at all.  They enjoy playing with their peers from other countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Duangjitt Resort 4 *, reviews" class="if uuid-2921027" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2921027.jpg"></div><h2>  Duangjitt Resort 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists were extremely pleased with their stay at the hotel.  Especially high points deserved: </p><ul><li>  location relative to urban infrastructure, </li><li>  territory, </li><li>  breakfast </li><li>  SPA-center, </li><li>  level of service. </li></ul><p>  Tourists found only one minus of the hotel - this is the nearest beach.  But this is not the fault of the hotel administration. </p><p>  The hotel staff is very polite and friendly.  Cleaned up here perfectly.  Internet is fast and free. </p><p>  Many tourists were struck by branded toiletries, including hair conditioner and body cream.  Travelers warn: upon check-in, they take a deposit of one hundred dollars, which they return after checking the number upon check-out. </p>
