  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Master crocheting squares and make a plaid, poncho, shawl or sleeveless</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  So, you most recently learned the simplest crochet - the usual single crochet.  Well, you can consider yourself almost an expert!  Of course, you still can‚Äôt afford lace blouses, but you can already knit slippers, berets, rugs, soft toys.  And if you learn how to crochet squares, then such a chic plaid can get out of your hands that the best designers of the world will be envious! </p><p>  A plaid can consist of knitted parts alone.  And you can staggered knitted squares and cut out of the coat and <span>crocheted.</span>  By the way, the problem of getting an already unfashionable coat, but which is still very unfortunate to put in the trash, will also disappear by itself.  And also, if you are crocheting squares for a blanket, then it‚Äôs worth collecting all the residues of glomeruli of a variety of colors around the house - when creating this model, they can all be put into action! </p><p>  Now we go directly to the process called ‚Äúcrocheting squares‚Äù.  This is not difficult, so let's try to complicate the knitting of squares with ornaments from yarn of a different color.  Therefore, it is worth developing a pattern of ornament.  Work as a creator - an artist! </p><p>  Take a sheet in a cage, draw a square on it with a side of 20 cells and paint over some cells in such a way that you get a picture.  If you are planning a plaid for an adult, then you should create an ornament from rhombs coming from the center of the composition, or from 4 curlicues, which also connect in the center of the square.  For a children's plaid, you can do with sketchy images of animals.  Then, when assembling the model, it should be ensured that the drawings are placed ‚Äúhead‚Äù in the same direction. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Crocheting squares begins with a chain of 20 stitches in length.  Then the knitting is rotated and the columns of the next row are knitted from each air loop.  When turning the knitting and moving to the next row, you need to knit 1 air loop - it will lift the work up without reducing the width of the knitting.  But you need to make sure that from this loop then you do not inadvertently tie a new column, because then the width of the product will increase. </p><p>  Now you should learn the secrets of crocheting ornaments.  In the place where the first column of a different color begins according to the scheme, you need to bind another to the main thread.  We carefully lay the main thread on the edge along the knitting and knit the string with a thread of a different color so that the thread that is no longer needed is inside the knitting.  As soon as the required number of columns of a different color ends, we also lay along the edge (extending it to the left) a free thread, and the main color thread comes into play again.  Indeed, while working in a different color, although she was not included in the case, she walked along the course of knitting, simply hiding between the sides of the column. </p><p>  Similarly, you can perform crocheting of squares with a smaller hook, for example, 10X10.  Having made them of two types - with a pattern and plain - in a checkerboard pattern we place them on a pattern of a T-shirt - sleeveless.  The straps of such a T-shirt will be exactly equal to 1 square.  For a T-shirt, however, it will be necessary to make additional tying in the side seams, since the <span>T-shirt pattern</span> cannot be a multiple of a certain number of squares, like a plaid or rug. </p><p>  Also, their squares can be made in the same way as an excellent chic poncho, decorating its edges with tassels or small pompons that will hang on twine made with air loops.  And you can make a shawl out of squares made in the described technique and arranged in a checkerboard pattern.  Openwork flowers crocheted from the middle will beautifully fit into the holes between them.  Sewing them will be possible for the places of touching the circumference of the flower with the sides of the main paintings. <strong><br></strong> </p>
