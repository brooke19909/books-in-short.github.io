  <section class="page js-page"><h1>'Japanese economic miracle'</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  After the war in 1945, devastation reigned in Japan.  However, already in 1950, the country began to develop rapidly.  What are the reasons for the "Japanese economic miracle"? </p><p>  Mostly, the government state has focused on education and high technology.  The Japanese began to buy advanced developments around the world and introduce them into their own production.  At the same time, qualified personnel were being trained.  A ‚ÄúJapanese economic miracle‚Äù would not have been possible without highly educated professionals capable of working with new developments using advanced technologies. </p><p>  In 1950, the country's industry in the entire capitalist world accounted for only two percent.  Twenty years later - sixteen percent.  By 1968, Japan was already in third place (after the United States and the USSR) in <span>terms of production.</span>  By 1980, the country pushed the Soviet Union. </p><p>  Firms in the state were formed on the principle of "community".  Workers were sacked extremely rarely, seeking, on the contrary, to secure people with various benefits.  Thus, each employee felt part of the organization. </p><p>  The "Japanese economic miracle" was made possible by automation of production.  The widespread introduction of robots and computers.  This made it possible to free qualified employees from hard work and transfer them to mental work. </p><p>  By the 90s, Japan had firmly taken the second place in the world in production volumes.  The country along with this was in first place in terms of per capita gross product. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The "Japanese economic miracle" is mainly the world's lowest <span>unemployment</span> and inflation rate. </p><p>  It should be noted that the rapid development of the state for the first time slowed down in the mid-seventies.  This was due to the global crisis (energy and economic).  Due to the fact that the country does not have its own energy reserves, it has suffered more than other states.  During the crisis, several other problems came to the surface.  Thus, the shortcomings of the social sphere appeared: corruption of officials and insufficient attention to issues of labor protection and health. </p><p>  However, the technological power of Japan made it possible to overcome the crisis with minimal losses.  The government has invested heavily in energy supply and environmental protection. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúJapanese economic miracle‚Äù led to an increase in the welfare of the state‚Äôs population and an increase in wages.  This allowed us to improve the quality and cost of production. </p><p>  During the period of the new global crisis, Japan also suffered quite severely.  However, despite a sharp decline in global demand for machinery and automobiles, <span>industrial production</span> continued to grow. </p><p>  It should be noted that over the past half century, a certain conglomerate of middle-class officials and large capitalists has been in power in the country, which formed a semi-state system.  According to researchers, the irresponsibility of the government‚Äôs social policy has led to a crisis of government.  The liberal party has not fulfilled its obligations to the population.  Unemployment among young people began to grow in the country.  As a result, in 2009, in November, elections were held in Japan.  It should be said that Japanese voters are conservative.  However, the population refused to trust the Liberal Party by voting for the Democratic Party. </p><p>  The "economic miracle of Japan" allowed the country to strengthen its position in world production volumes.  In <span>addition, the country</span> was able to avoid the destruction of accumulated potential. </p><p>  Today, Japan is one of the most <span>developed countries,</span> and its population continues to maintain a high standard of living. </p>
