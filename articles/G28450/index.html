    <h3>  <span>Crimean war:</span> briefly about the reasons </h3><p>  As a rule, all wars with the Ottoman Empire began because of disputes over the regimes of common straits.  The Crimean War was no exception.  It was this fact that became the first cause of the erupted disagreement.  The second reason was Russia's support for certain liberation movements that took place in Turkey.  This is due to the fact that the Turks severely suppressed in all senses the words of the Orthodox Serbs and other peoples.  The third reason is the policy of the leading European powers, which was aimed at weakening the role of our country.  Thus, the causes of the Crimean War, which were briefly described above, in the aggregate led to a large-scale bloody event.  War was already inevitable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimean War 1853 1856 briefly" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10508/218597.jpg" width="600"></div>

It all began in the best way possible for our army and navy: a grand victory in Sinop Bay made Nakhimov one of our best naval commanders.  After this great success, France and England entered the war on the side of the <span>Ottoman Empire</span> .  From that moment on, things went wrong for our army: a year after a naval victory, a long <span>defense of Sevastopol</span> begins <span>.</span>  This year-long event will be seen and recognized within its walls by many great people: here is the famous surgeon Pirogov (who first used anesthesia), and the geniuses of our literature (Leo Tolstoy), and great heroes (such as the <span>sailor Cat),</span> and real commanders who are worth their lives fought for the city (Nakhimov).  It would seem that the outcome of the war has been decided, and it will obviously not be in our favor.  However, the Russians did not intend to give up.  But luck will smile upon them only in 1855, when Kars will be taken by storm.  This was done in order to make life easier for those who defended Sevastopol at that time. </p><h3><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="causes of the Crimean war briefly" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10508/218596.jpg" width="600"></div></h3><h3>  Crimean war: briefly about the reasons for the defeat </h3><p>  So, the war ended in defeat for our country.  But the main thing is what conclusions were drawn from this.  Firstly, the country and the authorities realized that the state needed fundamental transformations;  secondly, it became clear that in terms of industry, Russia is lagging too far, and so long as it does not have a powerful defense complex, victories should not be expected;  thirdly, everyone understood well that now it is necessary to raise the country's authority on the world stage. </p><p>  Thus, the Crimean War of 1853-1856, briefly about the causes and consequences of which was described above, helped Alexander the Second to see that this society needed changes, radical changes were needed.  Nevertheless, our country received new heroes, some of whom remained at the walls protecting the city, while others more than once declared themselves. </p>
