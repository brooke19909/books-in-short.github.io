    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  <span>The ecology of the LCD "City of Embankments" is generally favorable.</span>  <span>Residents of the area have long been fond of parks and squares.</span>  <span>Moreover, the <span>residential complex is</span> literally surrounded by forest.</span>  <span>It compensates for the proximity to the airport.</span>  <span>There are no harmful industrial plants nearby, so the air here is quite clean and fresh.</span>  <span>The new building is located in a picturesque location on the banks of the Klyazma River, so the windows offer stunning views.</span> </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  <span>The complex cannot boast of its own infrastructure.</span>  <span>On its territory there are only small shops, cafes, bakeries - they are enough for a comfortable life.</span>  <span>But there is no need for their own infrastructure: within walking distance from the LCD "City of Embankments" there are a kindergarten, a school, a clinic, a sports and equestrian club, and even a city beach.</span>  <span>Moreover, the largest shopping and entertainment centers are located nearby.</span> </p>
