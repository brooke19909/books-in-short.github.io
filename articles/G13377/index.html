The list of countries to which it is impossible to obtain a visa without health insurance includes countries such as the USA, Canada, <span>Schengen countries.</span> </p><p>  As a rule, the cost of the tour already includes insurance.  But tourist insurance offered by tour operators usually covers only the minimum range of services that may be needed in case of injury or in case of illness, for example, the cost of treatment or payment for medical transportation. </p><p>  And since the possibilities of insurance are actually much wider, you can purchase the policy yourself at the <span>insurance company</span> if you wish <span>.</span>  To do this, it will be enough to present an already completed package of documents necessary for leaving the country. </p><p>  I must admit that this will require some additional time to visit the office, but it will not be wasted, because tourism insurance has some subtleties that will be explained to you only by the insurance company - you can, for example, find out in details in which cases expenses are reimbursed , and in which - no.  Travel insurance has several types: </p><p>  - civil liability - an insured event is the occurrence of <span>civil liability</span> by a court decision in case of damage to a third party in the territory of another country, whether it be property or life and health; </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - baggage - it concerns theft, loss or damage, however, it should be noted that insurance does not cover all things that are in the baggage, in particular, money, antiques, jewelry; </p><p>  - cancellation of the tour - it provides for the probability of cancellation of the tour, and concludes an agreement at least 15 days before the date of the planned departure, but keep in mind that refusing to issue a visa is not an insurance event at all; </p><p>  - from recognizance - provides for the payment of the <span>sum insured</span> if it is impossible to leave due to unforeseen circumstances. </p><p>  You can go abroad once, say, during a short vacation, or you can go abroad and several times in a couple of months, respectively, and insurance in tourism exists in two forms: short-term and long-term (the total departure should not exceed 60 days). </p><p>  Making out insurance it is necessary to pay attention to: </p><p>  - its validity; </p><p>  - The policy must be issued in two languages: Russian and the language of the country to which you are sent; </p><p>  - memo of the insured. </p><p>  <span>The insurance premium</span> of the same insurer may vary depending on: </p><p>  - tariffs with different guarantees and amounts of coverage; </p><p>  - the duration of the trip - the longer it is, the higher the fare; </p><p>  - the quantitative and age composition of the tourist group, for example, the tariff for tourists of advanced age, older than 70, as a rule, is twice as high.  Insurance in tourism involves the presence of an insurance policy, which should be kept with you so that in the event of an unforeseen situation, you could immediately contact the dispatcher and ask for help. </p><p>  But it is possible that even with a policy, for one reason or another, you have to pay in cash for medical services.  In this case, it is necessary to collect all the checks: for paying for the services of a doctor, for medicines, transportation, etc., in order to try to return the amount spent upon arrival. </p><p>  For this, a statement is written to the insurance company about the insured event.  The originals of the following documents are attached to it: </p><p>  - accounts in which the full name and date of birth of the person undergoing treatment, the number of the policy, diagnosis, medical services rendered, their cost, dates of conduct should be indicated; </p><p>  - recipes on which the date and surname of the patient are indicated and there are stamps of pharmacies; </p><p>  - bills for <span>daily expenses</span> for hospital stays, on which the days of admission and discharge from the hospital must be indicated; </p><p>  - tickets, etc. </p><p>  Documents are submitted to the insurance company in person.  A response to the application by law must be received within 14 days. </p>
