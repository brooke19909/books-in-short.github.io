Specialists consider her work original and talented. </p><p>  Photographs taken many years ago are exhibited today in many famous galleries.  But, unfortunately, during her life, Francesca could only dream of fame and recognition.  She dreamed!  But not all desires are destined to come true in a timely manner. </p>

    <h2>  Way to dream </h2><p>  Francesca Woodman (1958 - 1981) was born in American <span>Denver (Colorado)</span> in a family of talented artists.  From childhood, she wanted to create, simply not imagining a different fate for herself. </p><p>  She became interested in filming at age 14.  In 1975, she entered the Department of Design in Rhode Island, and a couple of years later she left to continue her studies in Italy.  In Rome, Francesca quickly made acquaintances among artists and intellectuals, her knowledge of the language was very useful.  Already in those years, she was working on creating a portfolio that in the future should help her find a good place. </p><h2>  Strip of failure </h2><p>  Francesca Woodman returned to the States in 1978 and settled in New York.  However, youthful dreams were not destined to come true.  Her work did not bring her success, not a single publication invited her to collaborate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  For a long time, a young talented photo artist continued to search, but personal ones also added to professional failures.  The result was a deep depression. </p><h2>  The only exhibition of photographs </h2><p>  The opportunity to present their creations to the audience of Francesca fell only once.  It cannot be said that this was a real exhibition, rather a publication.  The artist herself created a selection, which was published under the title "Some samples of disordered internal geometry."  This happened in 1981, which turned out to be fatal for a young girl. </p><h2>  Sad fame </h2><p>  Many creative people are influenced by passions.  A series of disappointments in both professional and personal life played a decisive role in the fate of a young talented photo artist.  Francesca Woodman at some point realized that she could not cope with the difficulties he had encountered. </p>

    <p>  She wanted recognition and fame, she wanted her beloved business to bring income that would allow her not to engage in boring uninteresting work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, her work did not find an echo in the hearts of harsh critics.  On January 19, 1981, she stepped into the void from the attic of a skyscraper in Manhattan, in which she had previously rented housing, and crashed to death. </p><p>  Only then did the art world truly hear the name Francesca Woodman.  After the tragic death of the 22-year-old artist, her photographs finally drew the attention they deserved. </p><p>  The dream of a lifetime has finally come true.  But Francesca herself did not know how much attention was attracted to her printed photographs and negatives. </p><h2>  Francesca's legacy </h2><p>  When examining the apartment in which Woodman lived before her death, a huge amount of footage was discovered.  Field investigators found about 10 thousand negatives and a huge number of photos. </p><p>  According to experts, the work was really worthy of praise.  Francesca filmed in high and low key, playing with shadows and highlights.  Among the pictures was a considerable number of self-portraits.  Francesca built the light and props, and then posed herself. </p><p>  Her work is very sincere.  But to solve them is completely impossible.  The faces of models are often intentionally blurred or darkened, hidden under a veil of mystery.  This incredible mixture of frankness and understatement is even more incredible if we recall the age of the girl.  Looking at the pictures, one can more likely imagine that they were made by a person who has lived for many years and has experience. </p>

    <p>  The photographs show that Francesca Woodman did not recognize the patterns.  She was looking for her own ways, using props in the most bizarre way.  Her work traces the unusual use of mirrors, windows and a wide variety of surfaces, with which the main subject is highlighted and emphasized. </p><h2>  Long awaited recognition </h2><p>  The first full-fledged exhibition of photographs of Francesca took place shortly after her death.  Today, black and white surrealistic works by the artist can be seen in the most prestigious museums and galleries. </p><p>  Her works can be seen in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, in the city's Helsinki Museum of Art, <span>the Guggenheim Museum</span> and many others. </p>
