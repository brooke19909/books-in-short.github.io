Quilling diagrams</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Products made from curled paper stripes are called quilling or paper filigree.  This art can be mastered even by a senior preschooler.  Now on the Internet you can find a lot of schemes for creating flowers, landscapes, cards, ornaments, paintings, topiary, crafts, panels and other products in this technique.  How to make quilling for beginning masters - we will consider in the article. </p><h2>  What is needed for paper rolling? </h2><p>  In a special store you can buy paper, scissors, a tool for paper filigree, tweezers, roll forms, PVA glue, an awl.  Quilling paper in comparison with color has 3 positive points: </p><ul><li>  the necessary density, keeping the shape of the parts; </li><li>  ready-made strips from 1 mm to 3 cm; </li><li>  high-quality painting even on side cuts. </li></ul><p>  Special paper saves time, but strips for crafts can be made of two-color office paper using a metal ruler and cutter. </p><p>  The tool is a kind of awl with a tip in the form of a fork.  It can be made from improvised material: </p><ul><li>  cut off the sharp end from a toothpick and cut it in the middle, making a kind of fork; </li><li>  by the above analogy, make an incision in the shaft of a conventional pen; </li><li>  stick the needle with a point into a tree or cork, and file the eye. </li></ul><p>  Take sharp scissors with straight ends.  A ruler with circles of different diameters can be used as a form for rolls.  If you choose volume quilling, then you will need improvised material (beads, beads, wire, skewers, cardboard, frames, scallop, pin, etc.).  We‚Äôve sorted out the tools, now we will study the basics of paper rolling. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Quilling: a master class of basic elements </h2><p>  Insert a strip into the slot of the tool and start twisting it into a spiral called a roll.  It is from this element that we form certain forms under a certain pressure: </p><ul><li>  A tight roll is a tightly twisted spiral, and the end of the strip is glued to the base. </li><li>  A free roll is a spiral with a non-glued end.  Such a roll is placed in the shape of a certain circle so that the paper ‚Äúblooms‚Äù.  Then it is taken with tweezers and the tip is glued to the base of the spiral. </li><li>  A drop is a free roll that is pressed from one edge, while the middle of the circle is not affected. </li><li>  A curved drop is a drop whose base is slightly curved. </li><li>  A triangle is a drop in which the oval part is flattened and straightened. </li><li>  An arrow is a triangle in which the base is bent to the top. </li><li>  The bird's foot is a triangle in which two angles are strongly pressed to the top. </li><li>  The eye is a free roll in which both ends contract without affecting the middle. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to do quilling" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/373425.jpg" width="291"></div></li></ul><h2>  Quilling: basic element diagrams </h2><p>  Elements of quilling: </p><ul><li>  A rectangle is an eye that contracts in opposite directions, and then right angles align.  A square is made in the same way. </li><li>  A rhombus is an eye in which angles are compressed in opposite directions. </li><li>  A star is a rhombus in which the sides bend inward. </li><li>  A semicircle is a free roll, at which opposite ends are nipped, and then space is straightened into a semicircle. </li><li>  A crescent is a semicircle in which the base bends inward. </li><li>  A leaf is an eye that is pressed in the corners, but a volume is created in the middle. </li><li>  A wave is a sheet in which the sides are curved in different directions. </li><li>  A turret is a triangle with a short base and long sides. </li><li>  A cone is a tight roll with a glued end, which is then pressed through like a fist. </li><li>  A spiral curl is a twisted strip. </li><li>  Horns are a strip folded in half and twisted individually into a spiral. </li><li>  A curl is a smooth strip, the ends of which are twisted into a spiral in different directions. </li></ul><h2>  Fancy items for flowers. </h2><p>  In this case, too, there are secrets: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  A twig is a strip folded 1 to 2, in which both ends are twisted into a spiral in one direction at different levels. </li><li>  A heart is a strip folded in half, the ends of which are twisted into a spiral inside the figure. </li><li>  A tulip is a triangle, in which the base is compressed and a kind of ‚Äúnose‚Äù is formed. </li><li>  A looped petal is a strip that folds with your hands in the image of an accordion and with a small remaining edge is wrapped around all the loops and glued to the base with glue. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quilling master class" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/373424.jpg?1397480391978" width="600"></div></li><li>  The looped petal on the scallop is a strip that wraps around the teeth of the crest with an increasing turnover.  Then this element is removed and bent in half, wrapped with the end of the strip and glued. </li><li>  A two-color element is two strips glued together, twisted into a spiral from which the elements are made.  Or are these ready-made elements glued together, which are wrapped in a strip of a different color. </li><li>  The shaggy core is a long, wide strip that is cut into a shallow fringe and then twisted in a spiral.  The end is glued to the base, and the cut strips are straightened by hands in different directions. </li></ul><h2>  Create a filigree style card </h2><p>  Now it becomes clear how to do quilling, that is, from the basic elements you create different compositions for postcards and even paintings.  As a basis, you can take a finished work pattern or a diagram from a magazine.  But you can do the blank yourself.  Just on the front side of the postcard, draw a schematic <span>floral pattern, a</span> butterfly and stick elements on them already. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For example, in the lower left corner of the postcard we will draw a bouquet of daisies with curls and leaves.  We make the petals from a drop of white color, we make the core either shaggy yellow, or from a tight roll.  Chamomile can be made whole (it is a variety of ways that quilling is unique).  A master class in making a flower with petals and a middle is presented as follows: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself quilling" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/373422.jpg?1397480472243" width="500"></div>

    <ul><li>  take a white strip 1.5 cm wide and 30 cm long; </li><li>  make 1-2 mm wide cuts along the entire length, leaving 3-5 mm on top; </li><li>  stick on the back side a yellow strip 3-5 mm wide and 15 cm long; </li><li>  insert the yellow strip into the tool and twist a tight roll; </li><li>  glue the edge to the flower; </li><li>  gently spread the petals in different directions with your fingers. </li></ul><h2>  Card design </h2><p>  We continue to talk about how to make quilling and postcards in this style.  Glue different daisies on the base.  To resize, just grab strips of different widths.  Now glue the stem to the flowers - a strip in an upright position.  And to it you attach leaves made using the technique of a leaf, waves and arrows.  On the edge you can decorate with curls, twigs and horns. </p><p>  To make the postcard proportional, in the opposite corner stick a butterfly, whose wings are made of arrows and drops, the body of the eye, and the antennae of the horns.  Volumetric postcards are especially attractive.  This is also quilling.  How to make flowers voluminous: </p><ul><li>  spread the first layer of 12 flower petals made in the shape of an eye; </li><li>  glue 4 drops on top of the previous row; </li><li>  make the middle of a star. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quilling schemes" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/374316.jpg?1397480553397" width="216"></div></li></ul><p>  Another way to make volumetric colors: </p><ul><li>  cut out a circle from paper that will determine the size of the flower; </li><li>  bend the circle into 4 parts (you get a funnel); </li><li>  stick the petals on the concave side, leaving the middle; </li><li>  also process the inside of the funnel; </li><li>  now make a tight roll, to the edge of which you glue a strip with notches; </li><li>  straighten the core and stick to the middle of the funnel from the concave side. </li></ul><h2>  Paperwork Style Tree </h2><p>  In this technique, it is interesting to make a tree.  Quilling allows you to make it in a flat and three-dimensional form.  In the first version, we glue a tree or trees on a piece of paper: </p><ul><li>  Color the paper on paper. </li><li>  Use a pencil to apply forms of wood and grass. </li><li>  Glue the strips in an upright position along the lines of the trunk and branches. </li><li>  The trunk cavity can be filled with brown eyes. </li><li>  Next, from different shades of green make foliage from tight rolls. </li><li>  To create a multilayer, you can paste elements on top of the second layer. </li><li>  At the trunk, stick grass from the leaf and eyes. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tree quilling" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/373434.jpg?1397480607769" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  It remains only to frame the tree.  Quilling offers another version of the craft: </p><ul><li>  Make shaggy camomiles. </li><li>  Also make leaves, only take the tape longer to form fluffy balls. </li><li>  Take a small pot or cup of yogurt and decorate it. </li><li>  Insert the barrel into the <span>foam ball</span> , which decorate with green paper.  For these purposes, a wooden skewer or thick wire is suitable. </li><li>  Glue paper blanks to the ball. </li><li>  Pour gypsum mortar into the cup, set the barrel and allow to solidify. </li><li>  Decorate the top of the pot with grass made of paper or satin ribbons. </li></ul><p>  If necessary, you can decorate the tree.  Quilling allows you to make butterflies, spiders, birds, which can be placed on the crown. </p><h2>  How to make voluminous flowers </h2><p>  In this technique, you can make ordinary flowers that can be put in a vase.  Consider how to make gerberas: </p><ul><li>  Cut 24 strips of pink color 27 cm long and white 12 cm long. </li><li>  Glue them together. </li><li>  Twist loose rolls starting from the pink end and place in a <span>circle with a diameter of</span> 1.5 cm. </li><li>  Make a piece of rolls. </li><li>  Form a flower of 12 petals and glue them together. </li><li>  Make a funnel of 4 cm in diameter from paper. </li><li>  On the inside, glue the first layer of flowers. </li><li>  Turn the funnel over and glue the next row of petals. </li><li>  Next, from the pink stripes 27 cm long, make 13 free rolls with a diameter of 9 mm. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quilling how to make flowers" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/373426.jpg?1397480709343" width="589"></div></li><li>  Make leaves of them and glue them together in the shape of a flower. </li><li>  Cut a fringe from a pink strip 1.5 cm wide. </li><li>  From a yellow or black strip 40 cm long, make a tight roll. </li><li>  Glue a fringe strip to the edge of the roll and twist it into a spiral, then fluffing the fringe. </li><li>  Glue 9 mm petals and a core onto the funnel. </li></ul><h2>  Collect a bouquet </h2><p>  We continue the conversation on how to make quilling and volumetric flowers in this technique. </p><ul><li>  The funnel on the back side is slightly bent. </li><li>  From a green strip, make a tight roll with a diameter of 3 cm and form a cone out of it. </li><li>  You make a stem from a skewer, wrapping it in green paper. </li><li>  Insert the stem into the cone and glue it to the wrong side of the funnel. </li><li>  Now from the free rolls with a diameter of 2 cm make a crescent. </li><li>  From 7 crescents you make a Christmas tree leaf and glue them together. </li><li>  Attach the petiole to the lower leaves in two additions and adhere to the stem. </li><li>  Make a spiral curl and decorate the junction. </li></ul><p>  Also, by analogy, you make a whole bouquet.  This is unique and quilling.  With your own hands, according to this scheme, you can make different <span>flowers: daisies,</span> cornflowers, asters, in which the petals can be bent with scissors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quilling style" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/373427.jpg?1397480753075" width="595"></div>

    <p>  Paper rolling is an amazing creation.  Try to make simple elements and then proceed to complex masterpieces - landscapes, paintings, portraits, voluminous crafts.  This is an unusual style!  Quilling can be taken as a basis in the manufacture of panels for photo frames, where curls, horns, branches are made of cardboard, which is then decorated like wood or metal.  Try to do the work in this technique, and you will not remain indifferent. </p>
