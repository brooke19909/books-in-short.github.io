    <h2>  What is it for? </h2><p>  The main parameter in any such system is the sound range, which is formed by a subwoofer, speaker and amplifier.  It should be noted that the expensive radio from a leading manufacturer is usually not enough.  Only good <span>acoustics</span> installed <span>in the car</span> will ensure high quality sound in the cabin.  There are two main varieties of it: coaxial and component. </p><h2>  Coaxial system </h2><p>  By itself, it is a body, inside of which are located acoustic heads.  Its main disadvantage is not the highest sound quality, as well as the lack of ability to configure speakers.  On the other hand, this is crossed out by the low cost and ease of installation, because many motorists often pay attention primarily to these indicators. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what acoustics to put in a car" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/401393.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is more complex and consists of twitter, a crossover and several speakers operating at different frequencies.  Its installation requires certain skills and knowledge, so it is advisable that it be carried out by specialists.  The main advantage of such a system is the high sound quality, which is achieved due to the efficient arrangement of the components.  Associated with this is a higher cost compared to the coaxial system. </p><p>  <span>Component acoustics</span> in the car, in turn, is divided into two subspecies.  The two-component variety incorporates two tweeters and <span>low-frequency speakers.</span>  The three-component subspecies consists of two tweeters, two speakers with an average frequency, and two more with a low frequency. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what good acoustics in the car" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/401394.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Little trick </h2><p>  In most cases, the acoustics jacks in cars are quite small in depth and diameter, which greatly complicates the process of installing speakers.  There are two ways out of this situation.  The first of them is to increase them by expanding the diameter.  The second solution is mounting in another place.  Be that as it may, in any case, the use of a component system provides for additional work inside the cabin.  Along with this, it should be noted that most car manufacturers in their new models take into account that in the future they can be mounted dimensional sound system, therefore, provide for it a sufficient amount of space. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Choosing a place to install </h2><p>  To ensure high sound quality, it is important to choose the place where the auto-speakers will be installed in the car.  As practice shows, often to place the speakers selected door or shelf.  It should be noted that the optimal sound in this case will be achieved only when using the component system.  When using a coaxial look, high-frequency sound will be reflected from the interior of the car and only after that will it reach the listener. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what acoustics is better in a car" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/401395.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In this regard, regardless of the type of <span>speaker system, it is better</span> to choose a place located at the level of the driver's head.  So that the sound does not distort and does not become discontinuous, it is recommended to place speakers with high, medium and low frequencies near one another.  Speaking about the height at which the acoustics should be mounted in the car, it should be noted that at the bottom of the door it is better to arrange speakers with medium and low frequencies, and at the level of the driver and passengers - with high. </p><h2>  Using a subwoofer </h2><p>  In the case when the purchased sound system is equipped with a subwoofer, there is no point in using large speakers.  It doesn‚Äôt matter at all where this device will be installed in the car.  The main feature of the installation in this case is related to the type of car body.  The best place for a subwoofer in a sedan is the rear shelf.  Before starting the installation of the device, it is necessary to increase its rigidity and eliminate possible gaps between the trunk and the passenger compartment.  The installation of the system itself will be simple. </p><p>  In some car models, there are other suitable places.  For example, behind the armrest of the rear seat, special windows are sometimes provided for transporting long items.  At this point, you can also easily install a subwoofer speaker. </p><h2>  "Closed box" </h2><p>  Acoustics in a car called a ‚Äúclosed box‚Äù is a fairly common sight.  Its principle is that a box is mounted on the rear shelf of the car, inside of which there are speakers.  The main drawback in this case can be called the fact that the boot space must be used almost completely for this purpose.  On the other hand, the car enthusiast gets the perfect sound quality.  It should be noted that in this case, some financial costs are required associated with the manufacture of the hull and the preparation of the shelf. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="acoustics in the car" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/401396.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Some features of choice and use </h2><p>  Be that as it may, before you go to a specialized store to buy a <span>speaker system for a car,</span> you need to clearly determine what the desired result should be.  It is very important to consider not only the manufacturer, but also the available space and the conditions in which the operation will be carried out.  Do not neglect the protection of the elements of the car audio system.  The same applies to the subwoofer installed in the trunk, which is desirable to be protected (with a net, for example). </p><p>  When answering the question about which acoustics to put in a car, attention should be paid to the fact that it should be selected taking into account such nuances as resonant frequency, sensitivity and overall quality factor.  You can read more about these parameters in the instructions that came with each model.  Despite the fact that the installation of such systems is often not very difficult, it is still better to entrust it to a specialist. </p>
