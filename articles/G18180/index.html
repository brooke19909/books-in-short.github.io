Real earnings options for teens</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The needs and desires of modern children can hardly be measured.  And parents are far from always ready to satisfy the ‚ÄúWishlist‚Äù of their minor wards.  Then the child has a desire to save money or earn extra money for one or another dream. </p><p>  Today we‚Äôll talk about how to quickly save money in 12 years.  This is not an easy task.  Especially if the child has an entire week loaded with activities - sections, studies, tutors, circles.  But if you wish, you can earn and save money.  The main thing is to try and choose the right direction for the implementation of the task. </p><h2>  We save from pocket money </h2><p>  How to quickly save money in 12 years?  At this age, finding a job can be problematic.  In Russia, child labor is prohibited.  And they can officially take work only after receiving a passport - at 14 years old. </p><p>  Therefore, adolescents are often given pocket money.  A certain amount is given to minors by their parents.  For example, once a day or a week. </p><p>  To quickly accumulate in this way, just spend less.  For example, refuse optional and spontaneous expenses.  It is better to keep a record of desires and spending on paper.  This technique will certainly help to save and rationally spend the budget in adulthood. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chscomet.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baby and money" class="if uuid-2481465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2481465.jpg"></div><h2>  We walk dogs </h2><p>  How to quickly save money in 12 years?  For 1 week, savings will not produce a significant result.  Therefore, it is worth considering how to earn a little pocket money. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the USA, dog walking for money is popular among teenagers.  In Russia, such an occupation is rare.  A child can offer his services to friends, acquaintances and neighbors. </p><p>  Payment in this area is negotiable.  The advantage is that at the age of 12 a teenager can walk several dogs at once.  If you take from 100 rubles per day for an hour of walking from a person, you can earn good money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.edp24.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dog walking" class="if uuid-2482494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2482494.jpg"></div><h2>  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãcrafts </h2><p>  How to quickly save money in 12 years?  Each person will be able to get 500 rubles or more by selling the hand-made.  Handmade items are currently highly regarded.  They are willingly bought from hands or from store shelves. </p><p>  A similar technique involves the child having certain skills - knitting, sewing, cooking, turning and so on.  For one handmade accessory, you can earn from 200 rubles or more. </p><p>  Such a technique does not work effectively immediately.  First, the teenager will have to find customers.  But if this can be done, the sale of hand-made may become the main source of income in the future.  This is a good freelance for people of all ages. </p><h2>  Work as a promoter </h2><p>  How to quickly save money in 12 years in 1 week?  On a phone or tablet, for example? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It all depends on how much you want to earn.  Adolescents from 10-12 years old can be hired as promoters.  The child will have to stand on the street or in shopping centers, handing out leaflets.  An hour of work is estimated from 150 rubles.  At 12 years old, children are allowed to work 2-4 hours. </p><p>  Accordingly, if you work as a promoter every day, in a week you can save a little money on a simple smartphone.  Otherwise, you have to work much longer.  Especially if a teenager wants to buy a modern and powerful device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ki.ill.in.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="promoter work" class="if uuid-2485178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/2485178.jpg"></div><h2>  Domestic help </h2><p>  How to quickly save money in 12 years for a dog or any other desire?  In some families, parents use a system of encouraging domestic work and grades.  If the child is a good student, he is given a certain (pre-agreed) amount of funds. </p><p>  Housework is also paid.  For example, for a major cleaning in the room they pay 100-200 rubles.  This is a good option for part-time work and accustoming the child to domestic work. </p><p>  Similarly, a teenager can offer the help services of the household to friends, relatives and even neighbors.  Busy people are sure to take advantage of such services. </p><h2>  At school </h2><p>  How to quickly save money in 12 years?  For 1 month, a teenager can start making good money.  Especially if he is quick-witted and distinguished by his intelligence in various school subjects. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Some students do homework and tests for money.  The cost of one work depends on the complexity of the task. </p><p>  If a teenager has free time, then he can undertake the implementation of laboratory work, essays and even coursework for students.  There are a lot of such orders.  And they are paid with dignity. </p><p>  A talented student is able to earn in this way up to several thousand rubles a month.  Sometimes it‚Äôs enough to work hard for a month to buy yourself an expensive smartphone or a medium-sized laptop.  The main thing is to find customers, not be lazy and develop your mental abilities.  After all, the described method of earning is not suitable for everyone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onlineparentingcoach.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Earnings on homework" class="if uuid-2482493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2482493.jpg"></div><h2>  Presentations </h2><p>  How to quickly save money in 12 years?  The next option is to make presentations on a computer for a fee.  It can be combined with the solution of homework. </p><p>  The bulk of the ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù are classmates and other schoolchildren.  You can search for customers outside the educational institution where the teenager is studying. </p><p>  Beautiful presentations pay well.  On average, they require 300 rubles or more for a little work.  The cost of the order is agreed with the customer in advance. </p><h2>  Surfing the Web </h2><p>  How to quickly save money in 12 years?  For 1 week, every modern child who knows how to work with the Internet can get some pocket money. </p><p>  The thing is that on the Web there is such a method of earning as surfing sites.  You just need to browse paid sites by clicking on the links provided.  To do this, you will have to register on special exchanges.  For example, SeoSprint, VipIP or Wmmail. </p><p>  This method of part-time allows you to receive up to 2-3 thousand rubles per month from one virtual exchange.  A child of 12 years old may have problems withdrawing money from systems.  This often requires an online wallet or credit card.  Teenagers have trouble accessing such things. </p><div class="photo" data-original="teenkidsnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Working teenager" class="if uuid-2481470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2481470.jpg"></div><h2>  Social networks to help </h2><p>  How to quickly save money in 12 years?  Handy girl sale is suitable for the girl.  But teens can earn regardless of their gender.  This will help them social networks. </p><p>  On the Internet, you can earn income from simple tasks on social networks.  This variant of the development of events allows you to earn extra money in your free time, spinning other people's pages and publics.  Work does not require any skills. </p><p>  The child needs to register on the promotion exchange in social networks, link their work accounts to the profile, and then take and perform certain tasks.  You can get various tasks, for example, "Add to friends" or "Repost entries."  Even a preschooler will cope with similar tasks. </p><p>  In this way, you can‚Äôt earn too much.  Maximum - 2-2.5 thousand rubles per month.  Most often, users work with the exchanges VkTarget, Sociate, V-Like.  Registration here is completely free, there are many orders, but they are completed very quickly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="111sposobov.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="VK Target" class="if uuid-2482495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2482495.jpg"></div><h2>  Captcha and part-time job </h2><p>  How to quickly save money in 12 years?  There are many ways to make money on the Internet without investments.  For example, novice users can try themselves in the field of captcha input. </p><p>  The child only needs to register on the exchange, and then enter text from the images that appear.  Fast, easy and very convenient.  True, the payment of such work leaves much to be desired.  One captcha costs from 10 to 60 kopecks. </p><p>  At the moment, users most often work for "RuKapcha" and <span>"Pound loot."</span>  As in the case of social networks, a child can earn here no more than several thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="videohive.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Earnings for children" class="if uuid-2481466" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2481466.jpg"></div><h2>  Texts to order </h2><p>  The last interesting method of earning and saving money is to work as a freelancer.  Usually in this way adults earn extra money and earn their living.  Freelancers offer their skills on specialized exchanges. </p><p>  Students are encouraged to do copywriting.  This is the writing of texts on a specific topic under the order.  For example, about games or technology.  For the text, you can earn from 50 to 500 rubles.  Sometimes even more.
