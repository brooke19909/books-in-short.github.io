  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Mayakovsky": customer reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each of us dreams of living in a comfortable apartment in a good equipped area.  Today, the real estate market is constantly evolving, so there are no problems with buying a home.  The most important issue is the availability of financial resources.  LCD "Mayakovsky" in Moscow (reviews of the new building will be presented later) is a modern elite-class project, consisting of three high-rise towers, united by a stylobate.  At first glance, it may seem that the residential complex is not noticeable, but this is far from the case.  Designers provided for the presence of a well-developed infrastructure, which includes all socially significant objects, so that residents can not need anything.  Construction work is being carried out by a large Russian holding Tekta Group, which has successfully implemented more than one project. </p><h2>  general information </h2><div class="photo" data-original="-." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Features LCD Mayakovsky" class="if uuid-2974689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2974689.jpg"></div><p>  LCD "Mayakovsky", real customer reviews about which you can read at the end of the article, is a large-scale project of federal significance.  It was implemented not only in the capital, but also in many large cities of Russia.  Among the distinctive features of the <span>residential complex</span> are the following: </p><ul><li>  multi-storey buildings in the form of towers; </li><li>  apartments with panoramic windows offering incredibly beautiful views of the natural scenery; </li><li>  the presence of a park area with a pond and forest; </li><li>  recreational area with landscaping. </li></ul><p>  Houses in the LCD "Mayakovsky" (reviews of residents fully confirm this) are made in a modern style and have an attractive appearance.  They are multi-section residential areas with a height of about 120 meters.  The cost of square meters depends on many factors, and, according to experts, it is very overpriced.  Prices for one-room apartments start at 7.6 million rubles.  However, this amount is not scary for buyers, because they get incredibly comfortable housing of the elite segment for this money, designed for people with a high level of income. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location and transport accessibility </h2><p>  Let's dwell on this in more detail.  In <span>Moscow</span> , the Mayakovsky <span>residential complex</span> (reviews about the <span>residential complex are</span> mostly positive) is located in the Northern Administrative District, so it has excellent infrastructure.  The residential complex has a private kindergarten, a fitness club and a swimming pool, and schools, shops and shopping centers, banks and other social and commercial facilities are nearby.  The only drawback is that the Khovrinskoye cemetery is located right there, with a view from the windows.  If in summer it resembles a park because of the dense plantations of trees and shrubs, then in winter it is not entirely pleasant to look at it. </p><p>  As for the traffic intersection, then everything is just wonderful.  Just a short walk away are public transport stops and a metro station, so if you do not have your own car, then getting to other areas of the city will not be difficult.  For motorists, the developer has provided well-designed entrances that allow you to enter the territory of the residential complex from almost any direction. </p><h2>  Project Progress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="leasing-tiraspol.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="advantages lcd mayakovsky" class="if uuid-2974698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2974698.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of the Mayakovsky residential complex (customer reviews in most cases positive) has not yet been completed.  At the beginning of 2018, cascades of buildings were completely ready, after which the external decoration immediately began.  According to the planned plan, the commissioning of objects and the settlement of residents will be carried out approximately in February.  While the contractor is in time to fulfill his obligations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A land plot with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 8,500 square meters is allocated for the <span>residential complex</span> .  As mentioned earlier, in this territory there will be three business class buildings with a height of 36 floors.  The project is truly grandiose and will not only provide Muscovites with quality housing, but also transform the capital, making it more modern. </p><h2>  Sales office: where is it and how to get it </h2><p>  So what do you need to know about this?  If you want to get your own apartment in Mayakovsky residential complex (customer reviews confirm their high quality), then you can do this today.  To do this, you need to contact the sales office of the company, which is located directly at the facility.  The managers will advise you in detail on any issues and conduct an orientation tour, during which you can not only look at the houses, study the layout options and take a walk in the surrounding area.  Here you can consult about a mortgage, if you do not have enough money to purchase housing in cash.  The office works without a break and weekends, however, to get into it, you must first arrange a meeting. </p><p>  The easiest way to get to the facility is with your own car.  It is located about one kilometer from the Leningrad highway.  You can also take the metro to the Vodny Stadion station, and from there take a little walk.  Also, public transport goes here, so there will not be any special problems with getting there. </p><h2>  Parking </h2><p>  In the Mayakovsky <span>residential complex</span> (reviews of residents claim that the <span>residential complex is</span> very practical for living), things are not going well with the placement of cars.  Guarded and heated parking is provided under the buildings, but it can only accommodate 316 cars.  This is clearly not enough, since the total number of apartments reaches 1092. Thus, only 30 percent of residents will have their own vehicle.  How to be the rest in this case remains a mystery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Construction technology </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Infrastructure LCD Mayakovsky" class="if uuid-2974693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2974693.jpg"></div><p>  Let's dwell on this aspect in more detail.  All objects in the LCD "Mayakovsky" (reviews of real customers you can study at the end of the article) are built in accordance with modern standards and requirements.  The frame is a steel structure with aerated concrete walls, erected by monolithic technology.  Partitions are not provided, and pylons that are installed in certain places are responsible for increasing the rigidity and strength of the entire structure. </p><p>  The outside of the building is a ventilated facade that prevents moisture accumulation and extends the life of building materials.  The buildings are sheathed with ceramic tiles, which are highly resistant to negative environmental factors, as well as providing good thermal insulation.  The roof of the buildings is flat.  It provides a drainage system. </p><p>  The ventilation system in buildings is forced.  It consists of shafts running along the entire height of the building parallel to the elevators, and the air circulates thanks to electric pumps.  In order for residents to install domestic air conditioners in their apartments, an additional ventilation shaft is provided. </p><h2>  Architectural concept </h2><p>  What is its feature?  The well-known Russian architect Sergey Choban worked on the creation of the Mayakovsky LCD project, the customer reviews of which are more often positive than negative.  He practices a rather unconventional approach and uses unique solutions that other experts do not even dare to.  This time, his bureau did not begin to change his principles and developed a residential complex consisting of three high-rise towers, erected on a common stereo stereo.  At the same time, the buildings are located not in one line, but with a slight displacement, thus forming a kind of diagonal.  Thanks to this, not only overall insolation improves, but also more sunlight penetrates into the apartments. </p><p>  Facing of buildings does not differ in brightness.  It is made in strict and restrained colors, however, it does not look boring, but rather stylish and attractive.  Ceramic tiles with a matte and glossy texture were chosen as the facing material.  Its alternation adds sophisticated contrast to the overall style.  The space between the floors is lined with special tempered glass. </p><p>  Designers paid great attention to the improvement of the courtyard of the residential complex.  It is decorated in accordance with all modern standards: chic flower beds, benches, recreation areas, children's and sports playgrounds and much more.  However, despite the great abundance of decorative elements, everything is designed in strict style.  Along the entire perimeter of the Mayakovsky residential complex (reviews of residents confirm high security), a modern video surveillance system is installed.  In addition, in the event of an emergency, the police or rescue services can be called quickly. </p><h2>  Entrance groups and halls </h2><div class="photo" data-original="zhildoma.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="layout in a residential complex" class="if uuid-2974701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2974701.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs not without reason that the Mayakovsky residential complex belongs to the elite segment.  Design finishing is provided not only in residential premises, but also in porches.  The decoration of the hall is predominantly dominated by natural materials, such as stone and wood, so it looks very expensive and solid.  Bright saturated shades prevail in the color scheme, but, despite this, the rooms look very restrained and conservative. </p><p>  There is also a concierge room and storage space for prams in the lobby.  Each staircase has an elevator with a carrying capacity of 1000 kilograms, as well as a modern protection system. </p><h2>  Assortment of apartments </h2><p>  This aspect should be given special significance.  It is possible to purchase housing in Mayakovsky residential complex (feedback from real estate investors confirms the reliability of the construction company) not only in cash, but also in a mortgage.  In addition, the opportunity to participate in shared construction is available.  This option is also good because it saves a decent amount of money.  Moreover, any risks of losing your own money are completely excluded, since the developer has long been working in the Russian market and has earned a reputation as a reliable company that you can trust. </p><p>  If we talk about the choice of housing, then it is simply huge.  Buyers are available apartments with a free layout and the number of rooms from 1 to 5. Finishing is not provided, which can be attributed to the shortcomings of the residential complex, since the cost of square meters is quite high.  The usual odnushka with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã41 square meters will cost customers about 6.8 million rubles.  And the price tag for the cheapest five-room apartment with 136 squares is set at around 25.9 million.  Thus, prices are quite high even by Moscow standards.  However, this is not surprising, given the real estate segment, the proximity to public transport and metro stations, as well as well-developed internal infrastructure. </p><h2>  Residential complex in Samara </h2><div class="photo" data-original="taburent.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Mayakovsky in Samara" class="if uuid-2974679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2974679.jpg"></div><p>  There are modern microdistricts not only in Moscow, but also in many other cities of Russia.  Mayakovsky residential complex in Samara (reviews of new buildings involuntarily make you think about buying housing in them) is a modern residential complex, built according to the same concept as high-rise towers in the capital, but embodying other stylistic decisions.  It is located at the intersection of Sadovaya and Mayakovskaya streets.  The facades of buildings are made with modern materials of light colors, which are favorably complemented by panoramic windows that open up a magnificent view of the city.  For the construction, a monolithic-frame technology was used, which provides tasks with high strength and durability. </p><p>  A distinctive feature is its excellent infrastructure.  Customer reviews of the Mayakovsky residential complex in Samara claim that in the immediate vicinity there is everything necessary for a comfortable life.  House territory is framed in accordance with all the needs of a modern person.  It has recreation areas, playgrounds and parking.  Infrastructure includes the following: </p><ul><li>  kindergartens; </li><li>  educational institutions; </li><li>  post office; </li><li>  banks; </li><li>  cafeterias and restaurants; </li><li>  small shops and shopping centers; </li><li>  park area; </li><li>  hospital; </li><li>  public pool; </li><li>  city ‚Äã‚ÄãLibrary; </li><li>  playground; </li><li>  dry cleaning; </li><li>  Religious sites </li><li>  Fitness Centre. </li></ul><p>  Thus, close to the Mayakovsky residential complex in Samara (residents' comments state that the area is very quiet and calm) there are all significant social and commercial facilities that are needed to solve a variety of everyday problems and carefree living. </p><h2>  Residential complex in Yekaterinburg </h2><p>  This is another large-scale project of the elite segment.  LCD "Mayakovsky Park" in Yekaterinburg is a comfortable complex consisting of four 26-story buildings.  It is located in a green area and has good infrastructure.  The advantage of the facility lies in its good location.  It was erected near the main city attraction - Central Park.  There are attractions, a summer open-air theater, as well as a concert stage where local rock groups and pop stars perform. </p><p>  In the Mayakovsky Park residential complex in Yekaterinburg (reviews of homeowners confirm a high level of comfort) a large selection of different apartment options is available.  The number of rooms can be from 1 to 4. The minimum housing area starts from 47 square meters, and the maximum - 105 squares. </p><p>  The last two floors are designed for wealthy buyers, as they are located only three- and four-room apartments.  The first floor is fully reserved for commercial facilities.  It will have shops, offices of various companies, cafeterias and other public institutions for various purposes.  On the territory of the residential complex "Mayakovsky Park" in Yekaterinburg, there are also 2 general educational institutions, 3 kindergartens, a hospital, sports complexes, as well as shops and a hypermarket.  Everything is very thought out and rational, created in order to ensure the maximum level of comfort for living. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the layout of apartments in the Mayakovsky Park residential complex.  The base lane is considered a prestigious area, so the developer has provided consumers with appropriate housing.  There are several housing options with different layouts and finishes, ranging from classic to designer design.  If desired, buyers can purchase apartments without finishing and carry out repairs according to their own taste.  In this case, the cost of square meters will be much lower, but you will have to spend money, time and effort on the implementation of the project.  In addition, the construction company collaborates with design agencies where you can order individual interior decoration. </p><p>  If we compare other apartment buildings with the Mayakovsky Park residential complex, the reviews of which are extremely positive, then it is much better suited for living.  This is due to the excellent infrastructure, transport accessibility and the proximity of public transport.  As for the cost of housing, it is slightly higher than the average market, but for Yekaterinburg it is at a very acceptable level. </p><h2>  Residential complex in Volgograd </h2><p>  It is located in the Voroshilovsky district of the city and is made in the same concept as the residential complex in Moscow.  The main focus of the developer was on comfortable housing and a well-developed internal infrastructure.  There are public transport stops near the new buildings, which is a very big plus in favor of buying housing in them. </p><p>  LCD "Mayakovsky" in Volgograd (you can study customer reviews at the end of the article) has a very good location.  Nearby is the city market, various grocery stores, shopping centers, entertainment complexes, an ice rink, a swimming pool, preschool educational institutions, a school, a gymnasium, a hospital, a bank branch and other significant social and commercial facilities. </p><p>  As for the assortment of apartments, options for 1, 2, 3 and 4 rooms with different layouts are available.  Finishing work is not provided.  The cost of housing starts from 1.9 million rubles.  Given current market realities, this is relatively inexpensive. </p><h2>  Residential complex in Azov </h2><div class="photo" data-original="moigk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Mayakovsky Azov" class="if uuid-2974682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2974682.jpg"></div><p>  It is a complex of multi-sectional brick residential buildings with a height of 3 floors.  The houses offer the following apartment options: </p><ul><li>  Studio; </li><li>  odnushka; </li><li>  kopeck piece; </li><li>  treshka. </li></ul><p>  Regardless of the type of housing, finishing is not provided.  The area depending on the rooms can vary from 24 to 89 square meters.  The cost of apartments starts from 1.2 million rubles.  The infrastructure is relatively well developed.  The house territory is ennobled, not far from the houses there is a kindergarten, as well as children's play areas and sports grounds.    ""   ,            ,      . </p><h2>      ? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="-." data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="   " class="if uuid-2974688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2974688.jpg"></div><p> Mayakovsky residential complex is a large-scale project, the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is the construction of modern high-rise buildings and separate areas with a good internal infrastructure and providing comfortable living.  The quality of housing is at a high level, and the cost is not too high, so buying an apartment will be a fairly profitable investment. </p>
