Some brands are familiar to most, for example, the Krasnoyarsk ‚ÄúBiryusa‚Äù or Minsk ‚ÄúAtlant‚Äù.  Other, mainly newly made Chinese firms, are not even known to consultants.  But there are brands that have been around for quite some time, but not everyone knows what they are.  One such firm is Whirlpool.  Country of origin, model range, reliability and quality of equipment - all this interests buyers.  Therefore, consider Whirlpool in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Whirlpool country refrigerator manufacturer" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/1969595.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A brief history of the brand </h2><p>  The history of the development of this famous <span>American company</span> dates back to the founding of the company Upton Machine Co, which was engaged in the production of washing machines with an electric shaft, by Frederick Stanley Upton. </p><p>  In 1929, the company merged with Nineteen Hundred Washer Co.  Until 1950, the company manufactured only washing machines, then began to produce drying units.  From this moment begins the rapid growth and expansion of the company.  A year later, a plant in <span>Ohio</span> was acquired <span>,</span> and another four years later began production of refrigerators and air conditioners under the Whirlpool brand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the beginning of the XXI century, the company was one of the four largest manufacturers of household appliances in America.  On the path to success, it absorbed many competing firms, including well-known European companies such as Indesit.  Today, the company employs more than 100 thousand employees. Whirlpool products can be found in no less than 170 countries of the world.  The manufacturing country at the beginning of the 20th century was one - the USA. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Whirlpool manufacturer country" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/1968014.jpg" width="600"></div>  Now the company's factories are located around the world.

    <h2>  What does Virpul produce? </h2><p>  At the moment, the assortment of goods of the company is not limited to washing and drying machines, despite the fact that the production of large household appliances is the predominant direction of the corporation.  You can find air conditioners, <span>freezers,</span> and even Whirlpool microwaves at store stands.  The country of origin depends on the particular type of equipment. </p><h2>  Where are Virpul washing machines manufactured? </h2><p>  Let us consider in more detail the characteristic features of Whirlpool models.  The country of manufacture of washing machines is Slovakia.  There, in the small town of Poprad, there is a conveyor assembly of modern models.  The manufacture of many significant components (for example, welding drums) occurs on site.  Directly on the conveyor, each assembled machine is checked for electrical safety, tightness and the absence of leaks.  Selected specimens are sent to the laboratory.  There they are additionally examined for vibration and see how many cycles the machine is able to operate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Despite the European assembly, most models remain affordable for middle-class customers, for example, such as the Whirlpool AWS 51012. The country of origin in this case does not particularly affect the price. </p>

    <h2>  Features of Virpul washing machines </h2><p>  Like any other brand, the Virpul company strives to stand out with its innovative developments.  For example, models of modern washing machines come with the "6th sense" function.  This term refers to the combination of sensors, programs for recognizing the type and amount of fabric, automatic selection of the washing mode. </p><p>  Wave Motion is another well-known feature from Whirlpool.  The country of origin has high electricity tariffs, so the researchers have developed a special drum rotation algorithm that can effectively deal with dirty spots in cold water.  Among other things, with this approach, a thing lasts longer, pleasing the eye with the brightness of colors. </p><p>  Top-loading washing machines use Zen technology.  Its essence is that the belt drive is replaced by a direct drive (AlGi has a similar technology).  Thus, the unit is quieter and with less vibration. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Where do Virpul refrigerators produce? </h2><p>  Initially, only non-standard models with a width and depth of 70 cm with the top location of the Brazilian-style freezer could be found on store stands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Whirlpool country manufacturer reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/1968027.jpg" width="600"></div>  Now on sale are increasingly appearing refrigerators assembled in Poland.  As a rule, these are widely used budget models.

    <p>  With the acquisition of a controlling stake in Indesit, the geography has replenished with another manufacturing country.  Whirlpool refrigerators are already produced in Russia (Lipetsk), on the basis of pre-existing production. </p><h2>  Features of Virpul Refrigerators </h2><p>  The 6th Sense technology is applied here.  Several sensors record the temperature in the volume of the chamber and quickly respond to any changes by supplying cold air.  Many models use the Full Height Multi Flow system.  According to this technology, cold air is supplied through numerous openings on the rear wall.  Thus, the temperature is equalized over the entire volume of the chamber and the natural temperature difference is eliminated. </p><h2>  Where are Virpul freezers manufactured? </h2><p>  This is another popular line of household appliance manufacturing that the company deals with.  The place of manufacture depends on the specific type of mechanisms.  In Russia, they produce widely sought-after budget models, for example, a Whirlpool WVT 503 freezer. "Country of origin Italy" - this inscription can be found on premium vehicles, such as WVES 2399 NF IX. </p><h2>  Features of freezers </h2><p>  The range of freezers manufactured under this brand is quite wide.  It includes both stand-alone vertical units and horizontal chests.  Models differ in size, capacity, number of drawers and even management. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="freezer whirlpool wvt 503 country manufacturer" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/1969592.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The 6th Sense technology from Virpul is also used here.  When opening the chamber door and changing the temperature, cold air is supplied to the shelf where necessary.  Some models use the No Frost system.  This technology allows the freezer to function without defrosting, since ice does not freeze in it. </p><h2>  Reviews about the Virpul technique </h2><p>  The mere fact that the company occupies one of the leading places in the household appliance market indicates the high quality of the goods.  Despite the fact that the company's plants are scattered all over the world, including China and India, this does not affect the quality characteristics of the products.  Technology is the same throughout production.  In addition, the assembly process is as automated as possible, which minimizes the impact of the human factor. </p><p>  The decision on the location of production of a particular type of equipment on the territory of the country is made by the management, taking into account a combination of factors.  For example, it makes no sense in Russia to produce dryers, and in a country with a cold climate - air conditioners.  Such equipment will be more in demand elsewhere. </p><p>  Whatever the country of origin of the Whirlpool equipment, product reviews are always good.  The equipment is functional, affordable and made taking into account the interests of the consumer.  A large number of programs and options, regardless of the class of the model, allow you to choose the optimal mode of operation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Whirlpool country washing machine manufacturer" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3921/1968019.jpg" width="600"></div>  A variety of techniques allows you to choose the right option for every wallet and taste.

    <h2>  Where else do they assemble the Virpul technique? </h2><p>  Of course, the assortment of such a large company cannot be limited to stand alone refrigerators and washing machines.  The company also produces built-in appliances of all kinds: ovens, hobs, cooker hoods and more.  If desired, the buyer can fully assemble the kitchen kit of one company Virpul.  All built-in appliances, including washing machines, are assembled at a factory in Italy, which determines its high cost. </p>

In this country, microwave ovens and split systems are assembled.  Some <span>dishwashers are</span> also equipped in China.  Typically, these are budget models such as the ADP 450 WH.  But more expensive equipment, designed for a more affluent population, is produced in Poland.
