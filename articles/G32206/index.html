  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coins of the USSR. How much are rare specimens?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Numismatics was formed in ancient times, when merchants from around the world brought new coins to their hometowns.  Each of the states expanded its borders, thereby increasing <span>collectible coins.</span>  If we take the Soviet era, then this type of activity as numismatics was widespread, because not only the main coins were issued, but also jubilee copies. </p><h2>  USSR coins collection </h2><p>  How much are coins of the USSR and how can I put together a good collection?  If you are fired up by such a desire, then the first thing you need to study is a few materials on this topic.  Why is this so important?  Almost every third seller of a rare coin tries to get the maximum possible profit from his copy, so he does not intend to behave honestly.  Everyone overprices, hoping to catch a novice in this business. </p><p>  On the Internet you can find many different tables, which are distributed as rare coins and jubilee.  In Soviet times, approximately 70 coins from inexpensive material were issued, in addition, the price of each of them is quite affordable even for an ordinary collector.  And yet, how much are coins of the USSR? </p><div class="photo" data-original="coin-brothers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much are coins of the ussr" class="if uuid-2347984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2347984.jpg"></div><p>  Almost each of these coins will cost from 150 to 300 rubles, with the exception of a rare instance.  One of the most expensive costs about 2,500 Russian rubles; it is a 5-year jubilee coin, which was issued for 70 years of the Revolution.  It has an original name - the puck, since its size is almost equivalent to a hockey puck.  This is the only type of coin that was issued specifically for collectors.  But even this could not affect its value. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Regarding ordinary coins, many have already stopped collecting them.  All this is because the list of rare includes expensive items that not everyone can afford.  And not everyone is eager to leave an empty space in his collection or fill it with various fakes.  Therefore, before creating your first collection, you must not only know how much the coins of the USSR cost, but also be able to distinguish originals from copies. </p><h2>  1961 coin </h2><p>  We will discuss a very valuable coin of 1961 - 15 kopecks.  Its diagonal is 19.56 mm, the thickness of the rib is ~ 1.2 mm, and its weight is 2.5 grams.  The coin contains an alloy of copper and nickel. </p><p>  On one of its sides is the emblem of the USSR: a sickle and a hammer.  If you look closely, then under the coat of arms you can see the coined inscription - the USSR. </p><p>  On some coins you can find the stamp of the mint, but not in this case.  The copy cannot be fake, because on many old coins of the USSR times such a sign as the mint was no longer used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imperiya.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much are coins of the ussr 1991" class="if uuid-2347977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2347977.jpg"></div><p>  On the opposite side, its face value is indicated - the number 15. Under it - the inscription "cents" and the year of issue in the lower part. </p><p>  Now let's find out how much the 1961 USSR coin costs.  Its value is an average of 15 rubles, if it does not have a factory defect, in good condition and without any defects.  This is considered a classic case.  The cost can be increased to 200 rubles only if the coin is in perfect condition and has not been circulated (UNC). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Coins 1991 </h2><p>  In 1991, denominations of one and two kopeks ceased to produce.  The lowest coin was 10 cents.  Another change is an additional inscription on the bottom edge.  Now on each copy they began to indicate the place where it was minted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coins of 1961" class="if uuid-2347976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2347976.jpg"></div><p>  How much are 1991 USSR coins?  In fact, the list of valuable coins is quite impressive, starting from 40 rubles and ending with more than 40,000 per copy.  For example, ‚Äú1 kopeck‚Äù in 1991 in good condition will cost you no more than 120 rubles, but this is if it was minted in Moscow.  The same copy, only minted in Leningrad, will cost half as much.  But there are also very rare specimens where the inscription of the mint is missing.  Such coins can cost more than 1,500 rubles, although they were produced both in Moscow and in Leningrad. </p><p>  One of the rarest and significantly more expensive coins is the 1991 ‚Äú2 kopeks‚Äù coin.  Such a copy will cost more than 10 thousand rubles.  Coins got their value because of the human factor: someone mixed up the material, because of this, ‚Äú2 kopeks‚Äù were minted on 10 kopek material. </p><h2>  Coins of 1946 </h2><p>  In 1946, the Leningrad Mint issued a large number of coins of different denominations.  In appearance, they correspond to the old models that were produced in 1935.  Since 1947, the mint began to experiment on new coins, as a result of which 16 ribbons appeared on the coat of arms.  How much does a 1946 USSR coin cost? </p><p>  A coin with a face value of ‚Äú1 kopeck‚Äù will cost customers no more than <span>50 rubles.</span>  It was released in large quantities, its cost only with excellent condition can reach 50 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Year of issue of the coin 1946" class="if uuid-2347979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78450/2347979.jpg"></div><p>  The coin, issued in 1946 with the face value of ‚Äú3 kopecks,‚Äù has several varieties and one special series of coinage. </p><p>  Some of the most popular models have stamps ‚Äú1.1‚Äù and ‚Äú1.2‚Äù on one side.  The rarest instance has 16 ribbons on the coat of arms.  All of these coins produced about a dozen, so the price for one piece is up to 40,000 rubles. </p><p>  We have sorted out with you only a few popular coins of the Soviet period.  If you decide to collect a collection of expensive items, then you need to properly study almost every one of them.  It is extremely important to know exactly how much the USSR coins of different years of issue cost.  Acquired knowledge will help save money. </p>
