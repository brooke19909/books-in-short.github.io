The ability to fold bows from ribbons is also useful for decorating gifts.  A beautiful product can be attached to a blouse or dress instead of a brooch, to shoes, turning the model from everyday to holiday. </p><p>  In the article, we consider several options for making bows from ribbons with your own hands.  A detailed description of the work will help to cope with the task with ease.  To get started, take care of the materials you need to complete the assignment.  These are ribbons of selected colors (you can buy satin or from dense fabric), threads, a needle, a glue gun for complex bows and for making crafts using the kanzashi technique, additional elements for decorating the middle (beads, brooches, pebbles, etc.). </p><h2>  Flat hoop bow </h2><p>  A beautiful satin ribbon bow can be made on a hoop by adding several contrasting beads in the center.  In our case, the ribbons are selected in blue, and the beads in white. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flat bow on a hoop" class="if uuid-2529282" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2529282.jpg"></div><p>  The bow is made by folding the fabric in waves of different lengths.  If you use a glue gun, you can cut it into separate pieces, roll them around and attach hot glue to the joint.  When, in descending order, all the segments are laid out in the center, a bow in the middle is wrapped with a small piece of ribbon and fastened to the back.  If there is no glue gun, then this work can be done with a needle and thread. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  White bow </h2><p>  You can make such a bow from ribbons with your own hands by stitching several elements at the center point.  First, three identical pieces of the required size are cut out of a white ribbon and folded in half.  The edges need to be melted so that the fabric does not crumble during socks.  Then the edges are carefully stitched together to make three rings.  They are laid out on the table surface with seams in the center as follows: one loop in the center, and the other two - with a cross along the diagonals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="white elegant bow" class="if uuid-2529300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2529300.jpg"></div><p>  At the center point, the parts are stitched together.  The last element in the manufacture of this bow ribbon with your own hands will be a smaller loop.  It is made similar to the previous details of the bow and mounted on top of the workpiece.  Then with a piece of thin tape all the layers in the center are wrapped around the middle.  This part should be decorated with rhinestones and half beads.  It is best to use hot glue to fix small parts. </p><h2>  Combined Product </h2><p>  For the manufacture of the next beautiful bow from satin ribbon, material of different colors and widths is used.  You will need a wide blue and white ribbon and a thin red strip of satin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="three-color bow" class="if uuid-2529309" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2529309.jpg"></div><p>  2 identical pieces are cut, cut from each tape.  They add up loops on a diagonal, connecting in the center.  Bottom 2 blue loops, and two white on top with thin red stripes lying in the center of each.  They are also located crosswise.  At the center point, all elements are sewn together with stitches and wrapped at the end with a blue ribbon.  It is not difficult to do such a bow from ribbons with your own hands, the main thing is to carefully position the loops relative to the center, and then only sew them together. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Original craft </h2><p>  For the manufacture of such a product you will need a glue gun, scissors and diligence in work.  Tapes of the same thickness and two different colors are selected, harmonizing with one another.  It is advisable to choose a central element to match the design of the middle of the bow.  In our sample, this is a button that combines two primary colors of a bow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kanzashi bow" class="if uuid-2529254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2529254.jpg"></div><p>  Pieces of tapes of the same length are cut.  It is advisable to melt the edges with a candle or a lighter so that the threads do not crumble when wearing the finished product.  All kanzashi ribbon bows are usually fastened with hot glue, so prepare a glue gun for further work. </p><p>  All segments are connected at the central point with the face up.  They are arranged with alternating colors according to the type of sun's rays, that is, from the center in different directions.  Then each strip of fabric is bent by a loop, and attached in the center also to the front side.  Thus, all work is performed in turn with each element.  In order not to see the junction of the strips in the center, this place is decorated with a button.  Such a magnificent bow from a ribbon can be attached to a hairpin or elastic band for hair. </p><h2>  Triple bow </h2><p>  To create a magnificent bow, many details are usually used.  In our next sample, 3 wide ribbons with different patterns and colors and 2 thin two-tone ribbons were prepared.  Since there is a daisy print on one of the ribbons, the central point is decorated with the same artificial flower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="three-layer bow" class="if uuid-2529261" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2529261.jpg"></div><p>  The craft consists of three connected bows.  The first, lower layer is assembled from loops arranged horizontally.  The same bow is attached to it, only it uses two other types of ribbons.  The final top layer is made of thin loops that are fastened in the center by the front sides of the fabric.  When all the elements are firmly connected with hot glue, a large chamomile is glued at the central point.  Due to its multi-layering, such a bow looks very impressive, although it is not too complicated to manufacture. </p><h2>  Colorful bow </h2><p>  A bow made of ribbons of different saturated colors looks original, it can be attached to the hair of a child dressed in a neutral white or cream dress, the hair clip will look beautiful and with an outfit of one of the ribbon's colors. </p><p>  Each item of the craft is made up of 3 parts of different sizes.  The loops are arranged in order of increasing tape length, from the shortest in the middle to the longest on the last turn.  Those who like to work in the quilling technique can observe a certain similarity of products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="colorful bow" class="if uuid-2529258" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2529258.jpg"></div><p>  In order for the loops to fit well, you need to prepare the base in advance.  You can cut a small circle out of felt and stick all the details to it.  The ribbons alternate so that the same colors are not nearby.  When the whole bow in a circle is filled with triple loops, the middle is decorated with some kind of round medallion.  In our sample, the function of the brooch is performed by a plastic circle with multi-colored ovals in the center. </p><p>  Do-it-yourself ribbon bow masterclass will help you make products quickly and the first time.  Imagine and try different options.  Knowing the principle of the work, this is not difficult. </p>
