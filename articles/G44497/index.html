Not everyone needs such a large apartment, but nevertheless they are also in demand.  "Ecohouse" (Adler), reviews of which we will discuss further in the article, attracts completely different vacationers.  Apparently, for this reason, the number of rooms is represented by a variety of apartments for pricing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="eco-house hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1311942.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  I would like to note that all rooms are made in the same style.  The interior interiors of the apartments differ in the class of housing of the Ecodom complex.  Room prices vary depending on the seasons.  In general, they are quite acceptable for representatives of the middle class.  So, a double standard in the season will cost 4200 rubles.  day. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Buying vacation packages, you will immediately think about food.  "Ecohouse" in this regard is very loyal to its vacationers.  The administration offers various dietary options.  For an affordable fee, you can be offered a fairly varied three meals a day restaurant-type meals in the complex.  A separate children's cafe is provided for children.  If for some reason you do not want to eat at the hotel, then the nearest cafes and restaurants are at your service.  Those vacationers who have booked a room with a kitchenette may not need catering services at all.  Here it is up to you.  It all depends on your preference.  There are also additional food services in the form of a lobby bar and grill cafe. </p><h2>  Services provided by the complex </h2><p>  Guest reviews indicate a wide range of services in the hotel complex.  Here you can not only relax at sea, but also relax in the sauna or just soak up the sunshine by the pool if you do not want to go anywhere.  You will have time to just relax and be a bit lazy.  The organization of leisure for your children will be done by animators at the playground.

    <p>  I would like to note that Ecodom (Adler), the reviews of which we want to discuss, has proved itself from the best side.  An important role is played by the fact that the complex is located close enough to the sea, which in fact is of great interest to all vacationers in the warm season.  Two hundred meters to the beach, even children can master. </p><p>  Vacationers note the attentiveness and responsiveness of staff.  A characteristic feature of the hotel is cleanliness, rooms are cleaned daily. </p><p>  Reviews of tourists indicate a good level of food in the "Ecodome".  The hotel restaurant serves fine European dishes.  The infrastructure is also pleasing; a five-minute walk from the hotel if you wish, you will find several restaurants and cafes.  The location of the "Eco-house" is so convenient that in the immediate vicinity there is everything that a person may need during a vacation. </p><p>  Particularly warm reviews are left by visitors regarding the heated pool, which for many is an alternative to going to the sea, especially during those periods when it is cold.  Pleased with the purity of the water and the territory. </p><p>  The hotel provides ticketing services.  It is very convenient and makes it possible not to waste time traveling, but to completely immerse yourself in the atmosphere of a carefree vacation.  Very often people ask if non-smoking rooms are available.  For Ecodom, this topic is not relevant, since each room has its own balcony, therefore, in principle, there should be no problems with smoking.  In addition, the rooms are cleaned and ventilated daily; with respect to cleanliness, all visitors are satisfied.  As for balconies, this is a separate topic for the delight of vacationers.  All of them have a gorgeous view of the city or the sea.  Particularly satisfied are lovers of sea landscapes.  Not a single room has access to farm buildings or courtyards. </p><p>  In general, visitors are very pleased with the Ecodom Adler hotel complex.  Reviews are a confirmation of this.  Some tourists here spend their holidays not the first year, noting a good level of service, friendly staff and developed infrastructure. </p><p>  As for the cons, it is quite difficult to find them in the "Ecohouse".  Those who love an active night club life will have to go beyond the hotel complex, since there is no such institution on the territory.  But every evening vacationers are entertained by live music. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="room service" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1311961.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Those vacationers who have a pet and plan to come with him will have to discuss this issue with the hotel in advance, since animals are not accommodated in all rooms and only upon prior request.  But, in principle, we solve this issue, here the hotel adheres to a loyal policy. </p><p>  Reviews of vacationers talk about the comfort and carefree stay in a hotel complex.  And what else is needed for a good vacation, how not to plunge into the atmosphere of a joyful carefree vacation! </p><h2>  Leisure activities </h2><p>  For many vacationers, a trip to the sea is not only an idle stay on the beach, but also the opportunity to visit some sights, see something new.  In general, people need cultural events.  In this sense, Ecodom has a rather advantageous location, since there are objects in the immediate vicinity that may be of interest not only to adults, but also to children. </p><p>  Nearby attractions include: </p><ol><li>  Dolphinarium "Water Area", the distance to which is 1.1 kilometers. </li><li>  Sochi Aquarium - 0.8 kilometers.  It will affect not only children, but also adults. </li><li>  Water park "Amphibius". </li></ol><p>  In addition, vacationers love to visit the following local attractions: </p><ol><li>  The Caucasian State Biosphere Reserve (the distance to it is just over six kilometers).  To visit him regularly organizes excursions. </li><li>  Green Theater. </li><li>  Winter Theater. </li><li>  Summer Theater. </li><li>  Park "Riviera. </li></ol><p>  I would like to note that Adler is the place where you can safely take a course of treatment and relax.  At the same time, there are night clubs, restaurants for energetic and active pastime.  Adler is unique in its location.  On the one hand, it is located near Sochi, but the prices here are much more affordable and not so bite, on the other hand, it is near Abkhazia, on whose territory there is a ski resort called Krasnaya Polyana. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="organization of excursions" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1311963.jpg" width="600"></div>

Staying in the "Ecohouse", you can not only relax, but also heal in one of these institutions. </p><p>  Not so long ago, before the Olympics in Sochi, Adler was significantly rebuilt and modernized, so it makes sense to visit such a modern resort.
