What kind of operation is this?  Who is she put to?  And how can you bring it to life?  To understand all this and not only for us to come.  Only with proper preparation will a citizen be able to easily request a deduction.  But for this you will have to take into account many legal requirements and nuances.  Accordingly, sometimes the process causes a lot of trouble.  But if you follow the instructions below, all the chores can be minimized. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cherlock.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax Code and deduction" class="if uuid-2381454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2381454.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  What is a tax refund when buying an apartment?  It is from this issue that we begin to consider the topic. </p><p>  The tax refund is called a tax deduction.  It is a reimbursement of part of the costs for certain operations against listed taxes (PIT).  In fact, the FTS pays a certain share of the funds to the taxpayer.  In our case, for the purchase of real estate. </p><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that not every modern person can take advantage of the studied state bonus.  You will have to familiarize yourself with the conditions for receiving a refund. </p><p>  At the moment, it is necessary that: </p><ol><li>  The applicant was a citizen of the Russian Federation.  Foreigners do not provide deductions. </li><li>  The person submitting the application in the established form must have official employment.  Registration of IP or LLC will also be taken into account. </li><li>  A citizen paid income tax of 13%.  Other tax rates are not taken into account. </li><li>  At the time of the appeal, the applicant has not yet exhausted the limit on deductions of one type or another.  After that, the right to reimbursement of specific expenses is abolished. </li><li>  The purchase of goods and services for which you want to return the money is carried out at the expense of personal funds and in the name of the applicant. </li></ol><p>  Perhaps this is all.  In fact, the income tax refund for the apartment does not provide any special conditions.  In fact, if a person decides on a mortgage, he will also have to comply with such requests. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Important: when buying an apartment with the participation of capital, it is also possible to qualify for reimbursement of expenses.  But with some features.  We will talk about them later. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ligazakon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="About return personal income tax" class="if uuid-2381459" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2381459.jpg"></div><h2>  Return Types </h2><p>  Strange as it may seem, the income tax refund for buying an apartment may vary.  After all, real estate transactions also differ from each other. </p><p>  The thing is that the population can demand money from the Federal Tax Service when buying: </p><ul><li>  apartments on the secondary market (covering the entire amount under the contract immediately); </li><li>  in a mortgage; </li><li>  by installments. </li></ul><p>  In addition, if a loan is taken to purchase a home, it becomes possible to apply for a return on interest on a mortgage.  The main thing is to properly prepare for the operation. </p><h2>  How much to return </h2><p>  Want to request <span>a tax refund when buying an apartment?</span>  <span>Return dates are</span> quite flexible.  But the citizen has the right to implement the task only for a certain period of time.  After all, the operation has a limitation of calls. </p><p>  According to the current rules, personal income tax can be returned no later than 3 years after the conclusion of the transaction.  And demanding money is allowed immediately for 36 months.  This is very convenient, especially if initially the applicant transfers not so many taxes to the state treasury. </p><p>  After 3 years, if the return limit is not exhausted, a person will be able to apply to the Federal Tax Service minus, but for other transactions.  There is nothing incomprehensible or difficult in this. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Senior Citizens and Deductions </h2><p>  Special attention is paid to the tax refund for pensioners when buying an apartment.  Elderly people are divided into 2 categories: </p><ul><li>  unemployed; </li><li>  working. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, depending on this moment, further actions will take place.  Unemployed pensioners can apply for a deduction within 4 years from the date of dismissal.  This is a kind of tax transfer.  It is available only to older people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nsovetnik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deduction Application" class="if uuid-2381452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2381452.jpg"></div><p>  Working pensioners receive a deduction on the same basis as ordinary employed citizens.  As a rule, the application procedure does not cause any problems. </p><p>  Important: if there is any doubt about the right to transfer personal income tax upon tax refund, you can contact the Federal Tax Service to clarify the situation.  Workers will quickly figure out what years a person will be able to demand money. </p><h2>  Amount Limitations </h2><p>  Almost every potential applicant is interested in the amount of tax refund when buying an apartment.  How much money is allowed to refund? </p><p>  There are many nuances in this matter.  The thing is that the tax deduction allows you to reimburse 13% of the amount under the contract.  But with certain conditions and limitations.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  more money cannot be returned in a year than a person transferred taxes to the state treasury; </li><li>  property return allows you to return a total of not more than 260,000 rubles; </li><li>  the mortgage deduction reimburses a total of 390,000 rubles. </li></ul><p>  That's all.  Accordingly, it is far from always that citizens will be able to return money for certain transactions.  All potential recipients of funds will have to remember these restrictions. </p><h2>  Maternity capital and deduction </h2><p>  We found out what tax refund when buying an apartment can be obtained in Russia.  And how to behave if maternity capital was involved during the transaction? </p><p>  It has already been said that citizens can easily apply for a refund.  But it is worth paying attention to certain nuances of the process. </p><p>  The thing is that state support is not the applicant‚Äôs personal money.  And therefore, the amount of the subsidy will be deducted from the amount under the contract.  13% of the deduction is calculated from the figure received after reducing the fee. </p><p>  Accordingly, in fact, a citizen will not reimburse himself the money from the full amount under the contract of sale if he invests in the capital operation or enjoys other state support. </p><p>  Otherwise, there will be no problems with the task.  And each potential recipient will be able to quickly request a deduction for a transaction with property.  This practice is more and more common. </p><h2>  Where do they ask </h2><p>  Where exactly do you apply <span>for a tax refund</span> when buying an apartment?  There is no definite answer to this question. </p><p>  At the moment, a return can be requested through: </p><ul><li>  MFC; </li><li>  Federal Tax Service; </li><li>  single window services. </li></ul><p>  In fact, everyone decides for himself where to apply with the application of the established form.  The fastest way is progressing when contacting your local tax office.  Otherwise, a longer wait for funds may be required. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kreditorpro.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mortgage and deduction" class="if uuid-2381453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2381453.jpg"></div><p>  Important: it is proposed to demand a tax refund when buying an apartment through an employer.  In this case, the person will no longer withhold personal income tax on the size of the deduction.  This option is used infrequently. </p><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  Now consider the whole operation step by step.  How to proceed to receive income tax refund? </p><p>  We turn to the method of filing an application through the MFC or the Federal Tax Service.  In this case, the citizen will need: </p><ol><li>  Conclude a contract of sale and wait for the new calendar year.  The right to deduction does not appear immediately. </li><li>  Prepare a specific set of documents.  Their list depends on the situation.  Below are various packages of papers. </li><li>  Contact the registration authority with the appropriate application. </li><li>  Wait for an answer from the Federal Tax Service.  It comes in about 1-2 months. </li><li>  Get money to the account indicated in the application.  This operation will take another two months. </li></ol><p>  It is done.  Refund of income tax when buying an apartment does not cause any special trouble. </p><h2>  Main papers </h2><p>  It remains to consider the documentation, which can be useful when translating ideas into reality.  Let's start with the main papers.  They are needed in any circumstances. </p><p>  Among the certificates required for tax property deduction, there are: </p><ul><li>  applicant's passport; </li><li>  application for deduction with details of the beneficiary's account; </li><li>  declaration in the form of 3-personal income tax; </li><li>  USRN statements on property; </li><li>  income statements; </li><li>  receipts and receipts / receipts of expenses in the name of the applicant. </li></ul><p>  But that is not all.  Depending on the situation, a number of other papers will have to be prepared.  What is it about? </p><h2>  For family citizens </h2><p>  Let's start with more frequent cases.  For example, if a tax refund is required when buying an apartment by family people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kredit-blog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax refund for the purchase of an apartment" class="if uuid-2381458" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2381458.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, the applicant will be required to: </p><ul><li>  birth certificates of children; </li><li>  marriage / divorce certificates; </li><li>  adoption documents. </li></ul><p>  But this package of papers does not end there.  In some cases, the applicant is asked for an extract from the personal account and a certificate from the BTI.  But usually this kind of certificate is necessary to complete a transaction for the sale of property.  And the FTS does not provide documentation. </p><h2>  Buying an apartment for the whole amount </h2><p>  And what if you want to buy an apartment for the whole amount at once?  Without mortgages and installments? </p><p>  In this case, without fail, a citizen needs a contract of sale.  It is advisable to take with you the act of acceptance of the apartment. </p><p>  All listed documents are attached to the main package of papers.  It is advisable to bring the originals along with copies.  There is no need to certify them. </p><h2>  Mortgage and repayment </h2><p>  Are you planning an <span>income</span> tax <span>refund</span> when buying an apartment?  Mortgage also allows you to reimburse the costs of the transaction.  Just a package of papers under such circumstances will be different. </p><p>  It includes: </p><ul><li>  mortgage agreement; </li><li>  debt repayment schedule; </li><li>  certificates of making certain payments. </li></ul><p>  In reality, everything is simpler than it seems.  The listed certificates should be at each conscientious applicant.  You can‚Äôt do without them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog-nalog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tax return" class="if uuid-2381455" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2381455.jpg"></div><h2>  Mortgage interest </h2><p>  As already mentioned, a citizen can regain the interest overpaid for a home loan.  But how to do it? </p><p>  You‚Äôll have to act in the same way as with a normal deduction request.  You just need to prepare a certain package of documentation.  It includes additionally: </p><ul><li>  payment schedule; </li><li>  documents confirming transactions against interest on a mortgage. </li></ul><p>  You need to apply certificates to the main package of documentation and to the extracts necessary for returning money for a mortgage. </p><h2>  Response Timeout </h2><p>  How long do you have to wait for an answer from the Federal Tax Service for the implementation of the task?  In general, tax refund when buying an apartment in one way or another is far from the fastest operation.  It takes a lot of time. </p><p>  How much exactly?  There is no definite answer to this question.  It all depends on the load on the local tax authority and on where exactly the application of the established form is submitted. </p><p>  If a citizen addresses the Federal Tax Service directly, a response from the appropriate service will come in approximately 1.5-2 months from the date of the request.  And about 60 days, you need to wait for the transfer of funds. </p><p>  If you file a petition through the MFC, the waiting period is slightly increased.  Usually, the response from the registering authority comes in 2-2.5 months.  You will have to wait as much money as when applying to the Federal Tax Service. </p><p>  Important: in general, the demand for the return of personal income tax takes about 4-6 months.  Quickly or instantly receive funds does not work.  This is a normal occurrence. </p><h2>  Can refuse </h2><p>  What tax refund when buying an apartment on a mortgage is set in 2018?  The answer to this question will no longer cause any trouble. </p><p>  Can a deduction be refused?  Yes, but only in certain circumstances.  The reason for the refusal is recorded in the response of the Federal Tax Service. </p><p>  Typically, such situations occur if: </p><ul><li>  a citizen brought an incomplete package of documents; </li><li>  the applicant does not meet the requirements listed above; </li><li>  the apartment is not issued to the recipient of money, checks and receipts do not indicate the fact of payment of the transaction by the applicant; </li><li>  used papers are invalid or fake. </li></ul><p>  These are the most common scenarios.  In case of refusal of deduction within a month, a citizen can correct the situation without re-submitting the application of the established form. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ipya.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Contract of sale" class="if uuid-2381457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2381457.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We figured out how to get an income tax refund when buying an apartment.  A declaration of income, a certificate of a person‚Äôs profit, as well as other statements will have to be prepared in advance.  Otherwise, to cope with the task does not work. </p><p>  In fact, with the right approach, getting a tax refund will not cause much trouble.  Even a person who is poorly versed in paperwork will be able to demand the funds put to him. </p>
