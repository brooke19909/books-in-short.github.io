It is the oldest resort in Russia, attracting lovers of mountains and extremes since the 19th century, and as an all-Union and all-Russian resort popular since the second half of the 20th century.  Below is a description of the Baksan Gorge, its history and sights, tells about how it is most convenient to get to these beautiful mountainous places. </p><h2>  Path to the gorge </h2><p>  The Baksan Gorge originates near the village of Lashkuta in a sparse area near the Pasture and Rocky ridges.  Hence, the nature of nature completely changes: on the one hand, pale yellow sheer walls of limestone are piled up, on the other, a cliff descends down to the Baksan River.  At first, the gorge is quite wide, then (after passing the village of Byloe) the walls sharply narrow and extend upward. </p><p>  The mountains begin to change their shade and become angular and darker due to the presence of crystalline rocks inherent in the Lateral <span>Caucasus Range.</span> </p><p>  Through the entire gorge, a civilized <span>asphalt road is</span> laid <span>,</span> which reaches almost to Elbrus.  This road is considered the highest in the mountains of the Caucasus. </p><p>  On the sides are numerous lateral gorges (Adyl-Su, Irik, etc.), through which you can reach, for example, an incredibly beautiful lake.  If you turn into the Itkol gorge, then in clear weather you can look at the gray-haired Elbrus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  <span>The sights of the Elbrus region</span> (Baksan Gorge, Chegemskoye and others, mountains, waterfalls, museums) can be listed for a long time, we will focus on the most interesting and impressive: </p><ul><li>  Picturesque mountain landscapes do not leave anyone indifferent.  There really is something to see here, local beauties deserve to come here at least once. </li><li>  In the village  Tegenekli is the V. Vysotsky Climbing and Hunting Museum (various hunting trophies, photographs of Elbrus lovers, photos from the filming of the film "Vertical" are exhibited). </li><li>  In Terskol there is the Elbrus Museum of Defense. </li><li>  Chegemsky gorge and waterfalls - look especially impressive in winter and resemble the kingdom of the Snow Queen. </li><li>  Terskol gorge and glacier. </li><li>  The Baksan Gorge, where there are three main climbing meadows: Cheget, Azau and Polyana Narzanov, and 9 side gorges. </li></ul><h2>  Baksan River </h2><p>  The gorge got its name from the river of the same name, originating in the glaciers of Elbrus and then flowing into the tributary of the Terek - the Malka River (173 km long).  Baksan quickly flows through the entire gorge, carrying its boiling white waters and turning stones over with noise.  It is unsuitable for descents and rafting. </p><p>  The river has its own legend, which says that the name was given to it in honor of Prince Baksan, whose whole family and himself, after the insidious murder, were buried near the reservoir. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the banks of the river there are 5 settlements (quite modern) and one of the oldest hydroelectric power stations in Russia - the Baksan hydroelectric power station. </p>

    <p>  In 1986, the Elbrusier National Park was formed, the purpose of which is to preserve the unique nature of this region, to assist climbers and tourists in laying interesting routes. </p><p>  The river itself and its tributaries are places of permanent mountaineering camps. </p><h2>  Local legends </h2><p>  Like any mysterious and beautiful place on Earth, the Baksan Gorge has its own legend, according to which the gorge itself and others located nearby were formed from the blows of the tail of the Master of the Underworld.  This happened when he was in terrible agony after the touch of the hands of one of the Saints.  Satan tried to free himself from these touches, while at the same time he hit with his tail, which led to the emergence of many gorges in the mountains of Elbrus. </p>

    <p>  In one place over the road overhangs the rock of Kyzburun ("Maiden's Rock"), which has its own legend, according to which in ancient times, residents dumped naughty bitterness girls and unfaithful wives.  The mountain is clearly visible from the village of Kyzburun-2.  Although according to other sources, the rock is translated from Turkic as "Red Nose", most likely due to its shape and the red color of the rocks. </p><p>  There is another mysterious place here - the Kyzburunsky hills, which recently attracted pilgrims here who believed that Muslim preachers were buried in the hills and archaeologists (they are looking for Scythian burials).  According to local residents, the hills sometimes glow with an “unearthly” fire. </p><h2>  Historical facts </h2><p>  This region has a long history, the first mention of it dates back to the 15-16th centuries.  Since ancient times, the Balkars lived here, then the Karachais, immigrants from the Balkars and Chegem societies, Svaneti and Kabarda came. </p><p>  One of the historical places is the village of Upper Baskan (the old name Urusbievo), which was owned by the influential local family of the princes Urusbiev before the revolution.  The most famous of them was Izmail Urusbiev, a noble prince who lived in the 19th century and was highly educated and knew many languages ​​and who did much to familiarize other peoples with the traditions and spiritual values ​​of the Karachais and Balkars.  He met with musicians and cultural figures of Russia, told them the legends and traditions of these places. </p><p>  In 1922, the Baksan society became part of the Kabardino-Balkarian Autonomous Region, at that time 28 villages were located here, but by the beginning of the 21st century there were already 11 settlements. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the Red Army defended the line of defense of the Red Army on the right bank of the Baksan (it was later called the "Front-High Front"), and the Nazi division Edelweiss was located on the left.  All the years after the war, local residents periodically find details of weapons, the remains of Soviet soldiers.  They are buried with honor near the monument to the heroes of Elbrus in the village of Terskol.  Traces of military events can be seen now. </p><h2>  Baksan Gorge: Attractions </h2><p>  The main attraction is the natural beauty of the gorge.  But also here are other interesting places: </p><ul><li>  In Baksan, there is a monument to the classic of Kabardian literature - the poet Ali Shogentsukov, who died at the beginning of World War II. </li><li>  In 1913, this village served as the center of the Zolsky uprising.  In the center of the village, a mound was preserved, standing on which, the rebels took an oath of allegiance to each other and promised to win. </li><li>  In sec.  Kyzburun-1 the most noteworthy is the Baksan hydroelectric station. </li><li>  About  Terskol at an altitude of 3150 m is the International Astronomical Observatory, founded in 1980. </li><li>  In the city of Gundelen there is a monument to the Grieving Highlander, erected in honor of the inhabitants of this settlement, who gave their lives during the Revolution and World War II. </li><li>  Not far from the city of Bilyma is a monument of 4-8 centuries AD.  e.  - the burial ground, although looted, and along the riverbank there are traces of primitive people and medieval monuments. </li><li>  A useful attraction for tourists is a large number of mineral springs located along the entire route, which for many years have been used to treat various diseases. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Mysterious cave </h2><p>  Several years ago, in the area of ​​the Baksan Gorge (near the village of Zayukovo), local Kotlyarov enthusiasts discovered an unusual mine that leads to a huge cave at a depth of 70 m. The walls of the mine are lined with megaliths, clearly crafted by human hands.  At the entrance (at an altitude of 1 km) a swastika is depicted, which leads to reflection on the connection of this cave with the Hitler division Edelweiss present in these places during the war. </p><p>  The mysterious cave in the Baksan Gorge consists of several rooms and chambers, the walls and ceiling of the largest 36-meter underground hall are lined with huge slabs resembling blocks in the Egyptian pyramids.  According to the conclusion of geologists, the mine and cave are clearly of artificial origin, although no traces of human presence were found here. </p>

    <h2>  "Only mountains can be better than mountains ..." </h2><p>  To finish the story about these places, you can quote from the famous song of Vladimir Vysotsky, who sang the beauty of these mountains.  The Baksan Gorge and the Elbrus region were the poet's favorite places of rest, where he never ceased to admire the mountain views and write poetry.  Arriving here, not a single person can remain indifferent to the immense natural expanses and surrounding landscapes. </p>
