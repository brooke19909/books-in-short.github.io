In this case, we suggest you create your own jewelry.  One of the interesting options for making earrings is considered to be tassels from threads.  Crafts made of thin shiny fibers look interesting, although they often use simple cotton and even thick yarn designed for knitting. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider in detail how to make tassel earrings, options for making such jewelry, ways of their placement and strengthening on metal rings.  You will learn how to make the brush itself out of threads, what devices are used for such purposes.  These photos and videos will help you complete the task quickly and easily.  Additional fittings can always be found in specialized stores. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="dMGJFcW3s0k" data-url="https://youtu.be/dMGJFcW3s0k" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/7/3/4/8/17348.jpg"></div><h2>  Necessary materials for work </h2><p>  We begin the description of how to make tassel earrings with a choice of threads and the shape of future earrings.  Before buying material, you need to think in advance with what outfit you will wear them.  You can choose the threads in the tone of the fabric of clothing or combine them with the color of accessories or shoes.  If the decoration will be worn in the summer, it is recommended to use gentle flowing threads, for example, silk.  They are thin, so a large number of them will be required.  It is better to immediately buy a lot of skeins, so as not to look for material of the same shade later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can connect the details of the brush with each other both with the same threads and with contrasting ones.  Golden or silver look elegant.  For a pair of earrings, one skein is enough. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.campmakery.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to fasten brushes on fasteners" class="if uuid-3211538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3211538.jpg"></div><p>  For winter decoration, yarn threads are suitable, just choose the option without fluffy pile so that the fibers of the brush do not get tangled together.  The threads should be tight and keep their shape well.  Such earrings can be worn with a sweater, knitted dress or sweater. </p><p>  The easiest way to make earrings in the form of brushes is to strengthen the finished craft immediately on the ring of the clasp.  But intermediate reinforcement of a bead or a pebble in a frame will be more effective. </p><p>  To perform small work, pliers are useful.  You will also have to prepare a template for winding the threads so that the brush turns out even.  Most often, they use either a double-folded sheet of cardboard or an old bank plastic card. </p><h2>  Brush making </h2><p>  After cutting and preparing a template of the selected length, winding the threads around it begins.  They make rotational movements tightly, with tension, so that the turns do not hang on the edges, but lean tightly against the edges of the template.  <span>How to make DIY tassel earrings</span> from threads is clearly seen in the photo below. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.jillianundercover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="thread winder" class="if uuid-3211539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3211539.jpg"></div><p>  When the required thickness of the brush is reached, the end is pushed under the bundle from above and all the threads are tied to a strong knot.  Leave the long ends, so that later it is convenient to strengthen the crafts on the clasp. </p><p>  When the threads are securely connected, the pattern is removed.  The tip of the scissors is pushed into the middle of the beam, pulled it down all the way and cut all the threads.  If they are a bit of different lengths, it‚Äôs not scary; at the end of the work they can always be trimmed with scissors. </p><p>  The last action will be tying all the threads under the knot.  Here you can already use other shades to highlight the accent point.  All knots are tied tight and close to them the ends are cut off.  It is advisable to hide them inside the brush so that it looks neat.  How to make brushes for earrings, you already know.  Now let's see how they are attached to the rings of the clasp and how to diversify jewelry of this type. </p><h2>  How to strengthen a ring </h2><p>  To attach the earring itself to the brush, you need to use pliers.  The metal ring is slightly opened and one end is inserted into the second short part of the craft, between the two knots. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jillianundercover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get a little ring" class="if uuid-3211541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3211541.jpg"></div><p>  You need to act carefully to cover all the threads of the beam.  Then the ends are connected again using pliers by squeezing.  It remains to insert a ring into the arc of the earring and you can try on the craft in front of the mirror. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Lightweight version </h2><p>  You already understood how to make tassel earrings with your own hands.  Sometimes, instead of a metal ring, a contrasting dense thread is used to attach the bundle, with which it is pulled together at the base. </p><div class="photo" data-original="helloglow.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="contrast in earrings" class="if uuid-3211546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3211546.jpg"></div><p>  In the photo above, silver threads with lurex are used.  Beautifully emerald color is combined with gold. </p><h2>  Ombre brushes </h2><p>  If you can‚Äôt figure out how to make tassel earrings, then let's look at an interesting version of three different threads, the shades of which are similar.  Usually the darkest color is placed below, then the middle tone, and the lightest above.  You can use, of course, three completely different colors, but this option is more suitable for a young girl, to a bright summer outfit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.happinessboutique.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cascading tassel earrings" class="if uuid-3211575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3211575.jpg"></div><p>  For older women, brushes with close shades with a smooth transition of shades are more suitable.  How to make tassel earrings from three tiers, we will consider further in the article. </p><h2>  Putting Tiers Together </h2><p>  Three-tiered or cascading brushes are made simultaneously according to several patterns.  Cut them out of dense cardboard with a decrease in size at regular intervals.  Each template folds in half.  The bottom dark thread is wound first onto the largest piece of cardboard.  When the required thickness of the brush is achieved, tie a knot on top, as described earlier in the article, and cut off the excess thread. </p><p>  Then immediately put on a medium-sized template.  The lower one is removed, and a long section of the brush is temporarily tied with a bright thick twine, which will then be easily removed.  The bundle is laid aside so that it does not interfere.  And in the center of the middle template, winding is already done with another fiber. </p><p>  The same procedure is repeated with the third template, the shortest.  When all the bundles are tied together from above, the cardboard is removed, the temporary ties are removed and each tier is cut with scissors.  It remains to manually distribute the threads over the entire surface of the brush and tie the top with the selected fiber. </p><p>  If you can‚Äôt decide which thread to make tassel earrings from, then according to the opinions of experienced craftsmen, it is best to use viscose silk.  Such fibers hang evenly on the fasteners, moreover, in sunlight or electric light, they sparkle spectacularly. </p><h2>  Beaded Earrings </h2><p>  The ombre effect, that is, a smooth transition from one color to another, can be achieved by stringing beads on a thread.  Choose the smallest details for such painstaking work.  If a simple brush of thread is made quickly by winding fibers on a cardboard or plastic template, then this option is done by stringing beads in turn on each thread, and only then they are joined together and attached to the ring of the earring. </p><div class="photo" data-original="crafts.tutsplus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bead brushes" class="if uuid-3211549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3211549.jpg"></div><p>  So that nodules are not visible below, the first part is put on the middle of a single thread, and the second bead is already strung on a double.  When all the threads are filled with beads, the tops are tied into one knot in the center.  Further work on the upper part remains.  The cap can be wound from thread, fishing line or use a thin wire.  Now you know how to make tassel earrings yourself, so you don‚Äôt have to overpay for finished jewelry. </p><h2>  Tassels on large rings </h2><p>  Somewhat the same color and size of the brushes on a large ring look interesting.  If you buy such accessories, then making earrings on your own, as in the photo below, is as easy as shelling pears.  In advance with pliers, remove all the small rings on which the thread brushes will be attached. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fan brushes" class="if uuid-3211572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3211572.jpg"></div><p>  Then, using one pattern, make the same number of brushes.  It remains to knock the rings and secure them by squeezing them into the accessories of the earrings.  If the brushes are not quite even, they can always be trimmed at the very end of the work.  In order not to miss anything, smooth the fibers with a hand dipped in water. </p><h2>  Summer option </h2><p>  Let's look at another variety of earrings with small colored tassels.  In one decoration, not only crafts made of threads were used, but also glass faceted beads and small beads, selected in the same color scheme as the threads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.petitboutdechou.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="summer option" class="if uuid-3211547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3211547.jpg"></div><p>  Separately assembled elements are placed not tightly to each other, but at a distance, inserting small parts between them.  To assemble the beam, metal fittings were used together.  However, pre-tie the tops with threads anyway. </p><p>  Now you know <span>how to make DIY tassel earrings from threads</span> .  Making a simple monophonic craft will take a little time, but other options will have to work longer, but the result is worth it.  The earrings are original and spectacular, with each step they bounce or stagger, attracting the eyes of passers-by, not only to the jewelry, but also to the owner of such wonderful earrings. </p>
