  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung LED TV: device features, specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Samsung LED TVs are generally very different and can provide both good and very good picture quality.  The 2017/2018 models are similar to the previous ones and have undergone only minor changes.  The biggest difference is the ability of high-end televisions to reproduce an extended color palette. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Samsung LED TVs differ from models of other manufacturers in their balance.  As a rule, they are not the best for each specific indicator, but they are very versatile and demonstrate confident work in various fields.  They scale the image perfectly - low-resolution content such as broadcast television or DVD scales perfectly to ultra-high definition.  In addition, Samsung LED TVs have a low input delay.  Even in HDR mode, they provide only a slight input lag, which is great for computer games. </p><p>  The disadvantages of the LED screens of the South Korean manufacturer include the fact that even high-quality models do not cope well with image jitter.  The motion interpolation function is also not as good as that of some competitors.  In addition, users often blame the mediocre build quality of Samsung LED TVs.  A lot of plastic is used in their design, and some parts can simply come off after some period of operation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rtings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Q7F QLED TV" class="if uuid-2311702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2311702.jpg"></div><h2>  Comparison with other brands </h2><p>  The products of a South Korean company, as a rule, have a lower signal delay than Sony TVs, and a much more expressive and original design.  However, the Japanese assembly is usually a little better, since it differs mainly in the use of metal structural elements.  In addition, Sony TVs have much more motion settings and do not suffer from image jitter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you compare Samsung LED TV with similar products from LG, then, as a rule, the image quality is much better, if you do not take into account the expensive OLED TV.  Their screens are much brighter, although they do not have such wide viewing angles.  However, the smart features of LG TVs are made at a much higher level. </p><p>  Samsung LED TVs provide performance suitable for most buyers in every price range.  LED TVs are not bad and usually do not have any serious drawbacks other than common with LCD.  In 2018, competition intensified even more, so the products of the South Korean company seem to no longer provide the same price-performance ratio as before.  However, the <span>characteristics of</span> Samsung LED TVs remain comparable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rtings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Back Panel Samsung Q7F QLED TV" class="if uuid-2311706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2311706.jpg"></div><h2>  Model selection </h2><p>  Samsung lineup covers all price ranges from budget to luxury devices.  As a rule, the higher the cost, the better the TV, although sometimes the difference does not justify the additional costs.  Understanding the variety of offers from a South Korean manufacturer will help knowledge of the model numbering system.  The first letter of the number corresponds to the type of TV: Q - QLED, U - LED, P - plasma, L - liquid crystal, H - DLP, K - OLED. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second letter corresponds to the region of production: N - North America, E - Europe, A - Asia. </p><p>  After the screen size in inches diagonally follows the year of manufacture: </p><ul><li>  Q - high-quality models of 2017 QLED; </li><li>  MU - high-quality models of 2017 UHD; </li><li>  M - basic and mid-level models of 2017; </li><li>  K - 2016; </li><li>  J - 2015; </li><li>  H - 2014; </li><li>  F - 2013; </li><li>  E - 2012 </li></ul><p>  For example, UN55MU9000 is a Samsung Ultra HD 4K LED TV 9000 series with a diagonal of 55 ‚Äù, made in North America in 2017. </p><p>  The designation of the monitors is different.  After the first letter L, which indicates the LED backlight, the type of monitor follows: </p><p>  C, V - curved, S - standard, U - ultra high definition, T - with a television tuner. </p><p>  The letter following the diagonal screen size indicates the year of manufacture of the monitor: </p><p>  S - 2013, D - 2014, E - 2015, F - 2016, H - 2017. </p><p>  How is, for example, Samsung LT24H390six LED TV decoded?  This is a 24-inch monitor with LED backlight and TV tuner 2017 release. </p><p>  The following is an overview of Samsung LED TVs, recognized by independent testing as the best products from the manufacturer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rtings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Q7F QLED TV" class="if uuid-2311756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2311756.jpg"></div><h2>  Ultra High Definition Models </h2><p>  Samsung's Best TV - Smart LED TV Q7F.  It produces the most saturated colors that users have ever tested in devices of this category, capable of covering 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut commonly used in Hollywood.  This helps ensure that the very attractive vibrant colors of HDR movies are reproduced.  Like most other models of the South Korean company released in 2017, Samsung 3D LED TV does not support. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The design of the Q7F is an improvement over 2016 models such as the KS8000.  Samsung's LED TV with an 8mm wide white metal frame and polished stand looks great.  The OneConnect prefix, which eliminated the need for access to the rear panel to connect the antenna, acoustics, LAN, audio and video sources through component and HDMI connectors, USB devices, etc., became more cumbersome.  The need for two power cords (one for the TV and the other for the set-top box) is doubtful, but necessary, since the only thing that connects these devices is an optical cable 2 m long. </p><p>  The central pillar seems very reliable and well supports the entire structure.  The flat design looks better than the KS9000.  It is possible to route power wires through the rack.  The TV is very thin (3.9 cm) and looks great from the side.  Its maximum heating temperature is 46 ¬∞ C, and the average is 38 ¬∞ C.  QLED TV is illuminated from below, which makes the bottom edge warm to the touch, but this should not be a problem for normal use.  The One Connect box also heats up to 41 ¬∞ C, but again, this should not bother the user. </p><p>  The build quality of the Q7 QLED TV has improved.  The remote control is exceptional, with a premium metallic feel.  Unfortunately, according to user reports, the manufacturer switched to a complete set of the model with cheaper plastic remote control.  The center pillar looks sturdy, and although the back of the TV is made of plastic, it is firmly fixed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rtings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="OneConnect" class="if uuid-2311734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2311734.jpg"></div><p>  The Q7F has excellent contrast ratio and good black uniformity, making it a good choice for watching movies in a dark room.  If the TV is installed in a very bright environment, then this model may not be the best choice, since the brightness of the LED screen is average and may not cope with glare.  Although the uniformity is good, the image deteriorates when viewed at an angle. </p><p>  This means that the Q7F will not be the best option for a large group of spectators watching an important sporting event.  Insufficient local dimming and slightly higher than the average peak brightness of the extended dynamic range will not emit HDR movies in the same way as on other TVs, even though the screen has excellent color gamut coverage. </p><p>  Like other premium Samsung LED models, the Q7F handles glare with ease.  The TV screen is not the brightest, but it really decently refreshes HDR content.  Excellent motion control combined with low input lag makes it an excellent monitor for both conventional and HDR games, but also well suited for watching sports shows. </p><h2>  The best mid-range model </h2><p>  This is a Samsung Ultra HD LED TV MU9000 TV.  It has good image quality, and it supports some HDR functions, provides reproduction of a wide color gamut and 10 bits of color depth. </p><p>  The design of the MU9000 is gorgeous.  The TV looks and functions with dignity, and has some nice touches, such as thin frames (1 cm) and a textured back panel.  Most input and output connectors are located on the OneConnect and are easily accessible. </p><p>  The stand resembles the legs of other Samsung TVs, such as the 2016 KS9000.  It is narrow enough to fit on most television tables and supports the device well, although it will allow it to swing a little if it gets hurt.  From the side, the model seems thin - the thickest part is located at the bottom (4.8 cm), but it does not stand out during wall mounting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rtings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pixels Samsung Q7F QLED TV" class="if uuid-2311759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2311759.jpg"></div><p>  Samsung MU9000 4k LED TV shows perfectly.  When he works in the dark, he reproduces dark scenes very well, and the black shades look deep due to excellent contrast and remarkable uniformity.  In a lighted room, high peak brightness can easily deal with sun glare, and the surface of the screen copes wonderfully with reflection. </p><p>  The viewing angle is poor - the best viewing position is right in front of the TV.  Fortunately, sports fans will be happy, because the uniformity of gray is good, and the effect of a dirty screen is almost not observed.  Finally, HDR movies look great.  Thanks to its wide color gamut, colors are vibrant and small highlights really shine thanks to the high peak brightness of the HDR. </p><p>  One of the best features of this model is its fight against glare.  Usually this type of screen is used exclusively in high-quality models such as Samsung Q9F and LG C7.  This makes the TV the best choice for use in bright rooms, such as living rooms with lots of windows.  It is also great for gaming, as its input delay is about 24 ms even in HDR, which is one of the best indicators among modern TVs. </p><h2>  The best budget 4K model </h2><p>  This is a 40 ‚ÄùSamsung LED TV MU6300 with UHD resolution.  It has decent image quality and can serve as a good gaming monitor for users on a budget. </p><p>  Its screen is brighter than most televisions with which it competes, and has a low input delay, typical for many models of the South Korean manufacturer.  Its smart capabilities are also good and include many applications with almost all available streaming services that you might need.  The MU6300 does not have such advanced functionality as local dimming or wide color gamut, but in general it is a decent model. </p><h2>  Samsung Full HD LED TV </h2><p>  The M5300 is the only high-definition model in the 2017 lineup and it disappoints with image quality.  In a dark room, black shades appear gray and uneven.  In bright light, this is not so noticeable, but the display of movement is below the permissible and there is no other way to fix this, such as local dimming. </p><p>  The design of the 32 ‚ÄùSamsung LED TV is simple and unappealing because the housing is made of plastic.  The stand is wide and may not fit on a small table.  The M5300 is relatively thick (6.8 cm), like the screen frame (2.1 cm).  The Samsung Full HD LED TV does not support HDR, but the color accuracy is good and it does a great job displaying content such as movies and TV shows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Smart platform Samsung LED TV" class="if uuid-2312709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2312709.jpg"></div><h2>  Smart features </h2><p>  At the dawn of smart TVs, Samsung was a leader in providing functionality and smart features.  This does not mean that they were very good, since it took a lot of time for the Smart TV platforms to mature into something comparable to external set-top boxes.  However, leadership was quickly usurped by the LG WebOS platform, launched in 2014 and the best to date. </p><p>  In 2015, Samsung made an attempt to bridge the gap by updating the Smart Hub based on its <span>Tizen operating system.</span>  This was a significant innovation, but it still did not meet LG's constantly updated offer.  In 2017, the platform underwent cosmetic changes - the color scheme was changed and the voice control capabilities were improved. </p><h2>  Remote control </h2><p>  The control panel included with the high-end QLED series is excellent.  It is very convenient to hold in your hand, and it demonstrates design skills that stand out from anything that is currently on the market.  The controls are simple and intuitive, the remote easily establishes a wireless connection with a TV and other devices. </p><p>  In the models of the budget MU series, control panels are used that are almost identical to those that were released in 2016, but support all the functions of the above device, but in a plastic version and in a different form. </p><p>  You may notice that the current Samsung Smart TV LED TVs do away with advanced controls such as play buttons and number keys.  This is in line with the trend that began several years ago, which is supported by other remotes, such as the Roku TV set-top boxes.  Today, this is not so new, but people using a TV tuner may prefer a cheap universal remote control to have quick access to television channels. </p><h2>  Main interface </h2><p>  After pressing the button to go to the home page on the remote control, a toolbar is displayed at the bottom of the screen.  Here in one row are the icons of downloaded applications, as well as quick access to settings and data entry. </p><p>  The application screen is full of a variety of software.  It can be filtered by type, such as Video, Lifestyle, and Games, but this feature is hidden at the very bottom of the main page. </p><p>  The selection of applications is currently quite extensive.  All popular music and video services are available, as well as much more.  Fortunately, the search function is not bad, and the results appear very quickly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.samsung.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung LED TV Remote Control" class="if uuid-2312676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2312676.jpg"></div><h2>  Web browser </h2><p>  Over time, the web browser has improved slightly.  Now he is gaining 1,426 points in the performance test, which is about 2 times more than the 2015 models.  It still does not support Flash, but this is a negligible drawback compared to previous years, since most sites use HTML5 instead. </p><h2>  Voice commands </h2><p>  Voice control was modernized in 2017, and now it works pretty well.  Unlike most other smart platforms, you can search for content or applications, as well as change settings.  Even deeper things, such as calibration, require only a button press, which is pretty nice. </p><h2>  Advertising and privacy </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the main screen of the Smart Hub shows ads.  It is displayed in the same row as the installed Samsung Smart TV applications, and it cannot be turned off.  You can refuse to personalize it in the settings, but, unfortunately, this will only lead to the fact that instead of different advertisements a uniform one will be displayed. </p><h2>  Known Issues </h2><p>  Although this is now less common than in previous years, Samsung LED TVs often have problems connecting to Wi-Fi.  Wireless communication randomly ceases to function if you leave the device turned off for a while, and will require that the connection is configured again, which is very annoying. </p><p>  The 2017 update is noticeably slower than the previous software version.  Waiting for a few seconds to confirm your choice in the pop-up menu is not unusual, but the general experience of using the interface leaves a rather sluggish feeling. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In general, Samsung produces very good TVs.  Over time, their range has risen in price, but most users will still find a model that meets their needs.  Although smart features are not the best, they are still not bad.  Samsung LED TVs are quite versatile and suitable for most applications, until there is a need to look at them from an angle, which is their common flaw.  Otherwise, serious shortcomings are difficult to find. </p>
