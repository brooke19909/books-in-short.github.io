For many centuries, it was a thriving center of the textile industry and had strong trade ties with Europe, especially France.  The city is also known as Ciudad Blanca, or the ‚Äúwhite city‚Äù, thanks to the white robes worn by the townspeople.  This tradition continues to this day. </p><p>  The city of Merida, Mexico, is famous for its attractions that have preserved most of the old colonial charm.  For those planning a vacation, this place will provide an exciting adventure.  Merida in Mexico is great for art lovers.  On the expanses of the city there are a considerable number of museums and parks for hiking.  If you are confused by the variety of famous places, and you do not know what to see in Merida in Mexico, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the most popular of them. </p><h2>  Plaza Mayor </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.turimexico.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plaza Mayor, Merida." class="if uuid-3233559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131608/3233559.jpg"></div><p>  Plaza Mayor also bears such names as Plaza de la Independencia (Independence Square) or Plaza Grande and is the commercial and cultural center of Merida in Mexico.  Undoubtedly, this square will be a great start to a tour of the center of the old city.  Here are the memorable buildings of Merida and cover the whole city block.  Also on the square there were many markets and independent traders offering food, souvenir and craft products.  Guests can enjoy traditional Mexican food at the restaurants in the area.  Since 1965, lovers of Latin American dances have been able to attend the weekly dance event Yucatan Serenade in the nearby Sta Lucia Park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mayan World Museum of Culture </h2><div class="photo" data-original="es.socialdesignmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mayan World Museum of Culture." class="if uuid-3233560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131608/3233560.jpg"></div><p>  Gran Museo del Mundo Maya, one of the most valuable cultural houses in Mexico, is dedicated to the fascinating culture that can be seen in every corner of the Yucatan.  The museum consists of four large expositions that have preserved more than 500 relics.  The main monuments of this impressive collection show ancient engravings and sculptures, historical documents and textiles dating back to Spain.  Also, you can see the spectacular exhibits of the colonial period.  Of particular interest is the section on Mayan culture in the form in which it exists today.  At night, on the walls of the museum building, you can see a high-tech projection audio-visual show dedicated to the long history of the local population. </p><h2>  Merida Cathedral </h2><div class="photo" data-original="diariojuventus.hol.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Merida Cathedral." class="if uuid-3233570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131608/3233570.jpg"></div><p>  On the east side of Mayor Square, the Merid Cathedral was erected, which took the place of the former Mayan temple.  This impressive building was built between 1561 and 1598 and is listed as the most magnificent church on the peninsula.  The facade of the building is quite simple, but the interior boasts a rich decor, with numerous references to the history of Maya and the colonial history of the city itself.  At the entrance to the temple, one of the first attractions of Merida in Mexico, you can see a picture above the doorway - the Mayan ruler Titul-Chiu visiting the conquistador Francisco Montejo in Tycho.  Another notable feature of the temple is the chapel of Christ of the Blisters (Capilla del Cristo de las Ampollas), famous for its 16th-century wood carvings and known for its blisters left after a tree was burned during a fire. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cepeda Peraz Park and Jesus Church </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.artelista.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Third Order" class="if uuid-3233581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131608/3233581.jpg"></div><p>  In the picturesque Cepeda Peraza Park (or Hidalgo Park) stands the bizarre Church of Jesus, or the Church of the Third Order (Iglesia de la Tercera Orden), which is a favorite place for weddings.  It was built in the 17th century as part of a monastery that later served as a Jesuit seminary.  Every self-respecting tourist is simply obliged to look inside after admiring the park and the magnificent exterior of the church.  There you will see an exquisite high altar made of carved wood, gilded from above, made in the style of Plateresque, a tradition popular in the communities of talented silver craftsmen.  You can ride in the park on one of the funny horse-drawn carts, the route of which runs through the most interesting colonial architecture of the city. </p><h2>  Governor's Palace and Museum Fernando Garcia Ponce </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.7dayadventurer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Governor's Palace." class="if uuid-3233590" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131608/3233590.jpg"></div><p>  All visitors to Merida are simply obliged to see the government palace (Goberno Palace), erected in 1892 and decorated with 31 interesting murals, painted by the artist Fernando Castro Pacheco in 1971-1974.  The building itself and its magnificent central courtyard are regarded as a masterpiece of architecture, and in addition to the frescoes there is a museum with an abundant collection of paintings from the first Mexican artists covering the themes of the Spanish invasion.  It is also worth taking a little time to inspect the building itself, in particular the balcony, which offers panoramic views of the Plaza Mayor. </p><h2>  The ancient ruins of Uxmal </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ancient-origins.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The ruins of Uxmal." class="if uuid-3233600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131608/3233600.jpg"></div><p>  This attraction is located 80 kilometers south of the city and is considered one of the most beautiful pre-Columbian places in Mexico.  In 1996, the ruins of Uxmal were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  The building was built in the 6th century, in the style of Puuk, as evidenced by the thin limestone cladding with square or lattice patterns.  At the top of the smooth walls you can see many masks of the rain god - Chuck, depicted with a long curved nose and snakes.  Of particular value are: </p><ul><li>  The predictor's pyramid, having a height of 35 meters and an oval base.  It is considered the tallest building. </li><li>  Temple I, which has the exact age indicated on the door lintel, is 569 A.D.  It is considered the oldest building. </li><li>  Sculpture of Queen Uxmal. </li></ul><p>  In place of the ruins there is also a museum, which houses four stone heads of the rain god Chuck and hieroglyphic panels. </p><h2>  Museum of Natural History and the Canton of Palacio </h2><div class="photo" data-original="cronicadexalapa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Natural History." class="if uuid-3233606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131608/3233606.jpg"></div><p>  The Museo de Arqueolog√≠a e Histor√≠a is housed in a beautifully reconstructed former government building, called the Palacio Canton.  This 19th-century building houses a collection of materials related to the heyday of the Mayan civilization, as well as other advanced cultures of pre-Columbian Mexico.  The main values ‚Äã‚Äãof this collection are sacrificial gifts, reproductions of sketches of Mayan sites depicted by archaeologist Frederick Catherwood, as well as photographs taken by Theober Mahler. </p><h2>  Casa Montejo Museum </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.efetur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Colonial Museum." class="if uuid-3233608" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/131608/3233608.jpg"></div><p>  On the south side of Plaza Mayor is the Casa Montejo Museum, one of the first examples of Spanish colonial architecture in Mexico.  The building was built in 1549 as the residence of the wealthy Montejo family, which owned it until 1978.  Once the magnificent Plattersky facade of the palace stretched across the entire southern side of the square, now it is somewhat smaller, but equally impressive.  Inside is Casa Montejo, an interesting museum furnished with antiques imported from Europe.  Of particular interest are the coat of arms of the Montejo family, as well as stone sculptures of the conquistador, standing with one foot on the bent head of the defeated Mayans. </p><p>  Tourists who visit this city leave only positive reviews about Merida and Mexico.  This multifaceted country impresses to the depths of its soul with its beauties, traditions and customs.  Definitely, all the splendor of Merida in Mexico cannot be conveyed in the photo.  This is exactly the city that you need to see with your own eyes. </p>
