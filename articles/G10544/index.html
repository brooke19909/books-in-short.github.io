    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Handmade educational toys are very popular today.  They are quite expensive, and making them is not so difficult.  Take, for example, a developmental mat.  Its main goal is the development of fine motor skills and tactile sensations.  It is necessary to determine the most optimal sizes, choose the fabric for the base.  If the child is small, do not interfere with taking care of the waterproof lining.  That's all.  Now complete freedom of action.  Laces, zippers, Velcro, large and embossed buttons, various types of fabric, artificial or natural fur - all this will find application in creating a developing rug for the baby.  As a result, the result is no worse than the one offered in the store, but you are absolutely sure of its quality and do not worry about the child having an allergy due to poor-quality filler.  Whatever was created by the mother‚Äôs hands - a rug, cubes or soft toys, even matured children will keep this all their lives, every day more and more aware of the value and feeling unique warmth.  Undoubtedly, a toy created by a mother can never even be compared with what she bought in a store. </p><h2>  Mandatory element of children's wardrobe </h2><p>  In second place after the socks, with respect to the frequency of acquisition for young children, are hats.  Regardless of the time of year, this headpiece is required in the baby‚Äôs wardrobe.  And a lot of them, as practice shows, do not happen.  Panama hats, scarves, bandanas, knitted and woolen - all of them can be made independently, but old things can be used for this.  Sewing from old things and reworking from old things can reveal talent and become one of the most important hobbies in the life of a young mother. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Try to sew a bag </h2>

    <p>  Some of the ideas offered in fashion magazines are simply striking in their simplicity.  To implement most of them, you need to know at least a little about what sewing is.  Alterations from old things very often look much better than the original taken as a basis. </p><p>  For example, a bag.  Most often, its pattern looks like a rectangle, the sides of which are equal to the expected result, to which we must not forget to add allowances for the seams.  In just half an hour, a skirt, sweater or trousers turn into a knitted, denim or cotton bag, and if you also use decor elements, such as beads or ribbons, to decorate this work, you can proudly carry it yourself, but also exhibit it for sale somewhere at a hand-made auction. </p><h2>  Slippers always come in handy </h2>

If these are slippers for an adult, the foot is simply encircled and the top is cut out with the necessary allowances for the seams, and the <span>pattern of booties is</span> very easy to do yourself too.  Decorated to the taste and desire of the creator, they will warm on cold evenings much better than those bought in the store, and you can use suede clothes, old sheepskin coats, faux fur coats, hats, knitted sweaters to make them. </p><h2>  Everything is much simpler than it seemed. </h2>

All!  Done!  You can put on and rush to friends in the sandbox.

    <p>  Sewing and remaking from old things for girls is a whole epic.  The little fashionista surely wants to look like her mother, so any skirt or blouse remade from her things will become a favorite new thing in the wardrobe, and you should not even talk about bracelets, hairpins, brooches and handbags.  Very comfortable <span>for girls sundress.</span>  To create it you will need old flared jeans.  Given the length of the future product, you need to cut them off at the knees and flutter the internal seams.  You will get two identical parts in the form of a trapezoid.  They need to be steamed and swept away among themselves - the bottom is almost ready.  Now look at the rest of the jeans and depending on the model of the dress, cut the top.  Most often, it also looks like a trapezoid.  Measure the width of the straps.  They can be cut out of trousers, or you can buy ready-made ones at the store.  All parts must be well steamed and stitched together.  Come up with jewelry for a sundress with your daughter. </p><h2>  Give new life to old things </h2><p>  Sewing from old things for children allows you to use not only adult things.  Most often, your favorite skirt, sweater or pants become short, and in volumes they sit absolutely normally on the child.  Pants can be lengthened by adding cuffs made of contrasting fabric, a skirt with flounces, and a sweater can be made very fashionable by adding a trim to increase the length of the product and sleeves.  And what a wardrobe you can create for your favorite doll! </p>

    <h2>  We go to the country </h2><p>  The issue of creating the so-called ‚Äúsummer cottage wardrobe‚Äù is very relevant for every mother.  For residents of a metropolis who came to visit their grandmother or rented a house somewhere in a cozy place for the summer, it can be a very unpleasant discovery to find the number of non-excreted spots that a child will bring on his fashionable clothes after the first walk.  There are two options - either to lock it for the entire period of rest in the house, or to stock up with several changes of clothes, in which you will not be ashamed to go out into the street, but at the same time it is not so pathetic.  In this case, children from old things need to start sewing in the winter, and in the summer this will not be a problem at all.  Again, for boys, a few knitted shorts or overalls from daddy pants are enough, and the parents of the girls will be helped out by skirts or <span>denim sundresses.</span> </p><h2>  Experiment </h2><p>  In clothes for children, the most unexpected styles and models, finishes and color combinations are allowed.  You can sew a contrasting patch or appliqu√© in the most visible place of the sweater that has been stained, or you can <span>wear a jeans sundress,</span> which has become slightly short, trimmed with grandmother's lace and mother's beads. <br>  Review your wardrobe.  In it there is sure to be something of quite decent quality, but long out of fashion, with a torn sleeve or stain in a prominent place.  Feel free to take the thread with the needle - and go! </p><h2>  Mat?  Why not </h2>

    <p>  Sewing from old things is not only creating a children's wardrobe.  Our grandmothers also remade clothes into rugs.  Today there are two of the most popular methods for creating these products, which will find their place in any home, especially in the corridor and bathroom. </p><p>  In the first case, clothes of any quality are cut in a spiral into strips of approximately the same width.  Just sit down to watch your favorite movie in the evening, take an old skirt or T-shirt, scissors, and by the end of the series at least one ball will be ready for you.  Then take the hook thicker and single crochet, moving in a circle, begin to create.  A special plus is the ability to knit parts.  Day after day you will see what shape the mat takes and adjust the necessary sizes and colors.  The finished product does not open and holds its shape well.  Looking after him is also very simple.  After all, washing it in a typewriter or even with your hands in a basin is much easier than doing dry cleaning of a carpet purchased for a lot of money. </p><p>  If you do not know what a hook is, and even do not know the most basic knitting technique, there is a second option.  Similarly, the product is cut into ribbons.  After you get three balls of approximately equal size, start weaving a pigtail out of ribbons.  The ribbons of the same color or different will be decided by the needlewoman.  We wrap the resulting pigtail so that it turns out something similar to the shell of a snail, and we sew it with a regular needle at the joints.  Such a rug, if it is even slightly steamed at the end of work, will look simply amazing. </p><h2>  Great relaxation method </h2><p>  Sewing from old things, in addition to the possibility of creating original clothes and accessories, still perfectly calms the nerves.  Unleash your imagination, and you only need a thread with a needle and something that has been occupying a place in a <span>wardrobe</span> for a long time <span>.</span> </p>
