  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much do builders earn in Russia and abroad?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Everyone can find work in the construction industry, both qualified specialists with education in their specialty, and ordinary workers.  People who know their work well are in demand, if not in our country, so abroad.  Most of the population goes to work in Europe and Asia, and even to America, in order to earn more money for their work.  Why is this happening? </p><h2>  The specifics of construction work </h2><p>  The selection of workers for construction projects is carried out in two ways: </p><ol><li>  One worker individually performs work in his specialty, receiving a stable monthly salary for this. </li><li>  Or a team of workers is recruited, and the agreed amount of payment is divided by the delivery of the object at all. </li></ol><p>  How much do builders earn in Russia?  On average, a construction worker can earn from 24 to 35 thousand rubles.  Skilled workers, such as installers, electricians, industrial high-altitude high-altitude workers, receive an average of 70 to 100 thousand rubles a month.  Those involved in the interior decoration of apartments, concrete workers, painters earn about 1-2 thousand rubles a day, but to a greater extent they offer such wages to illegal immigrants who came from other CIS countries to earn money. </p><p>  There are many open vacancies for qualified specialists in the construction field for the position of company manager and even CEO.  To take such a high-paying place, you need to have experience in the same position for at least five years, be responsible, sociable, and able to negotiate.  Payment - about 3 thousand dollars and bonus bonuses for good work and an irregular schedule. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="thebusinessinbox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="work as an engineer" class="if uuid-2899185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4268/2899185.jpg"></div><h2>  Engineers </h2><p>  A popular profession in the field of construction is also an engineer.  <span>How much does a civil engineer</span> in Russia <span>earn</span> ?  Here a lot depends on the region of the country.  Most of all, engineers are required for construction projects in the Moscow region and St. Petersburg, and the average salary is 35-45 thousand rubles.  How much does a construction technician earn in Siberian regions?  Significantly more: from 50 to 200 thousand rubles.  Responsibilities of a civil engineer: </p><ul><li>  Analysis of future work and budgeting. </li><li>  Technical documentation. </li><li>  Collaboration with contractors. </li><li>  Supply of materials, quality control of work and their implementation on time. </li><li>  Registration of new facilities and redevelopment. </li><li>  Coordination of projects in appropriate bodies. </li><li>  Commissioning of the facility. </li></ul><p>  To get an engineer position, you need: </p><ul><li>  well versed in the legislative framework related to construction; </li><li>  own estimated programs in electronic form; </li><li>  know the laws, SNIP and GOST; </li><li>  modern technologies in the installation and construction field; </li><li>  principles used in the construction of new and reconstruction of old facilities. </li></ul><p>  As a rule, those who have good experience as an engineer can apply for a higher salary.  The construction technician earns about the same amount - within 40 thousand rubles.  To get a position in a foreign company operating in Russia, you must have at least three years of experience and have one or two foreign languages.  In particular, bonuses are also included in <span>wages</span> . </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.acppubs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="road builders" class="if uuid-2899194" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4268/2899194.jpg"></div><h2>  Road construction engineers </h2><p>  Track engineers are involved in the development and design of transport and railways, the construction of tunnels, bridges and their maintenance.  This is one of the most sought-after professions in Russia, as transport communication needs constant updating and reconstruction.  Highly skilled workers in demand and abroad. </p><p>  How much do road builders earn?  In Russia, namely in <span>Moscow, salary</span> ranges from 90-100 thousand rubles.  Workers who are specifically engaged in the laying of asphalt or the railway receive about fifty thousand rubles.  Much depends on the region, the abilities and skills of the person himself.  If the employee is employed by a government agency, he receives a fixed fee.  Foreign and private firms often offer their specialists bonuses and allowances.  The same method calculates how much railroad builders earn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crossrail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="railway builders" class="if uuid-2899191" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4268/2899191.jpg"></div><h2>  Work as a builder abroad </h2><p>  European employers appreciate workers from the countries of the former USSR for their performance and good qualifications.  At the same time, their work is much cheaper than their citizens with the same skills and experience in construction will require.  Even despite such a difference in wages, immigrants agree to this job, because how much builders earn in Europe is several times more than what they can earn in their country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Do not think that superficial knowledge is enough for employment in the construction industry abroad.  There, too, you need to have some kind of specialty and are well versed in construction.  Technology may be a little different, but overall there‚Äôs only one working principle.  In addition, if you intend to work in Europe, you will most likely have to learn the language of the country where you are traveling, or, in extreme cases, English.  Here's how much builders earn abroad: depending on experience and skill, from 700 to 4,000 euros. </p><p>  Those involved in engineering and design are in demand everywhere.  If you have good experience and qualifications, foreign employers are ready to provide high wages, living conditions and comfort.  For example, in the USA, engineers receive from 1 to 4 thousand dollars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tsjdevelopmentltd.co.uk" data-author=": Simon Staples, "><img itemprop="image" alt="builders abroad" class="if uuid-2899193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4268/2899193.jpg"></div><h2>  Over the ocean </h2><p>  If <span>in Russia wages are paid</span> with the calculation of one worked month, then abroad wages are measured per year, according to the contract, or hourly.  In the United States, wages depend on the specialty of work and geographic location.  Each region of America has its own calculation of average wages, from the highest cost of work in Alaska to the states of the mainland.  The minimum level of earnings is regulated by the authorities of each state separately.  Here are the minimum indicators of how much builders earn in the USA: from 15 thousand dollars a year for a handyman;  up to 40 thousand dollars and more for an engineer and other specialists in the field of construction. </p><p>  The problem with earnings in America is that after an employee receives cash, the amount of which is indicated in the contract, he is obliged to give part of this money to the tax service.  This is a maximum of 35% of wages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dailyreporter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="house building" class="if uuid-2899187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4268/2899187.jpg"></div><h2>  Europe </h2><p>  Over the past 30 years, the migration of specialists and cheap labor to all European countries has increased.  According to research schedules conducted in 2013, most professional builders migrate from India, Israel, and Ireland.  The rest of the workers go in search of better earnings from Africa, the CIS countries, Asia, Russia, Ukraine and other regions. </p><p>  Compared to Russia, this is how much builders earn in Germany and other European countries: </p><ul><li>  Germany - 120 thousand in terms of rubles; </li><li>  France - 100 thousand rubles; </li><li>  Poland, Czech Republic - 80 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  If the average monthly salary in Russia were 100-120 thousand rubles, then most likely no one would go abroad. </p><h2>  Builders in Germany </h2><p>  In Germany, few people talk about their income, so the average German salary can be found on the labor exchange or special sites.  But in general, foreigners earn less than citizens of Germany, only if you do not own a specialty that is in demand among locals.  When comparing the salaries of Germany and Russia, remember that the German contract indicates the amount of how much home builders earn, excluding taxes, while in Russia the amount of wages is handed out and taxes are paid by the employer or paid separately.  Therefore, the difference in amounts will be significant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cobbemc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="project creation" class="if uuid-2899186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4268/2899186.jpg"></div><h2>  Payroll in Germany </h2><p>  Here are a few factors that affect the amount that an employee will get on hand: </p><ul><li>  Family status. </li><li>  Children. </li><li>  Place of work and position. </li><li>  Tax breaks between husband and wife. </li><li>  Salary amount. </li><li>  Medical insurance. </li></ul><p>  However, newcomers do not go deep into all these details, and in order to know exactly how much money you will get from your net salary, you need to know at least approximately how much will be calculated from it. </p><h2>  Earnings Abroad </h2><p>  Let's analyze how profitable it is to go abroad to earn money, taking into account the costs of travel, food, housing and other factors.  Where is the working environment more profitable, and how much do builders earn in cash? </p><ul><li>  Poland: the minimum wage per year is 10 thousand dollars.  We deduct $ 100 for travel, $ 250 for a visa, 6 thousand dollars a year for food and housing.  In total, $ 3650 per year is left to the net worker. </li><li>  Turkey: the minimum annual salary is 6 thousand dollars.  We take away spending on housing about $ 500 per month, the road - $ 200 and a visa - about $ 180.  About $ 400 remains clean.  Specialists receive salaries from 15 thousand a year and above. </li><li>  USA: the minimum wage per year is 20 thousand dollars.  Directions - $ 600, a work visa for 6 months - about $ 2,500, meals and housing will cost from $ 1,000 per month.  Net income is approximately $ 4,000.  Knowledge of the language is required. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.tradesmansaver.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="civil engineers" class="if uuid-2899189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4268/2899189.jpg"></div><p>  Here are some illustrative examples of how much builders earn in different countries of the world.  These are the minimum indicators, so there is always something to strive for.  There are such vacancies where the employer takes over part of the expenses for visa, food and accommodation.  There is a great demand for good specialists, therefore their salaries are higher, especially if there is a higher education and work experience. </p>
