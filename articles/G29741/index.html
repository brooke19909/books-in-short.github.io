    <p>  Hiding in a multi-bed dormitory or hostel for longer than one month, and even more so constantly, is impossible.  We have to look for an alternative.  And she is!  There is a great option - an apartment-type hostel.  In Moscow they can be found everywhere and with any type of acquisition: </p><ul><li>  room rental for short or long term; </li><li>  buying a room on the secondary; </li><li>  buying a room in a new building. </li></ul><p>  It is worth talking separately about each option. </p><h2>  Purchase in the secondary market and in a new building </h2><p>  In the capital there are a lot of houses that are officially called dormitories.  They were originally built for workers.  Unfortunately, in most of them the apartments have neither personal kitchen nor amenities.  If such a minus is not fundamental, then you can find a room with a low cost.  Moreover, such rooms have a very small area (about 15 square meters). </p><p>  In modern new buildings, the rooms are more comfortable, and the layout allows you to turn it into a full-fledged apartment.  What does this consist of?  The fact is that they began to build houses more often, rooms in which have their own bathroom and kitchen.  There are options with their own loggia.  Of course, you can call such a living space a one-room apartment.  The living room area can be more than 12 square meters.  The cost of a new room depends on the area and conditions, geographical location.  At a lower cost, but quality housing can be purchased either on the outskirts of the capital, or outside the Moscow Ring Road. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Of course, it is best for a young family to choose an apartment-type hostel in Moscow in a new building, where there are own conveniences and even a separate kitchen with a balcony / loggia.  After all, you have to live on one living space for more than one year.  In addition, this option is ideal for single people who want to retire, or for those who do not like to wait long for their turn, to share life with other people. </p><p>  Remember that the room must be chosen carefully.  Do not agree to buy the first one that you like.  If you don‚Äôt have enough money to buy a full-fledged room-apartment, but enough to buy a clean room without amenities, then it‚Äôs better not to rush, if possible, save up for your dream. </p><h2>  One-room apartment or dorm room </h2><p>  Among Muscovites and those who wish to stay in the capital forever, the question sometimes arises: an apartment or a room?  Of course, a <span>one-room apartment is</span> better <span>.</span>  But if the room has a bathroom and a partition with a kitchen, then why, due to a lack of funds for an apartment, not consider such square meters?  They are in this case no worse.  The only difference is that, most likely, there will be no hallway or balcony.  Otherwise, everything is the same. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  It is no coincidence that the name ‚Äúapartment type dormitory‚Äù appeared.  In Moscow, and not only in the capital, as a rule, every dormitory has a concierge or security guard.  Of course, there are exceptions.  But most often, if unpleasant events happen that require the intervention of security or law enforcement agencies, there is always the opportunity to prevent trouble. </p><h2>  Room layout </h2><p>  The layout of the living space in an apartment-type hostel in Moscow may vary slightly.  But most often it consists of: </p><ul><li>  rooms with a window in which a bed or sofa, table, wardrobe and other things are located; </li><li>  a small kitchen with a spacious set and washbasin; </li><li>  front door. </li></ul><p>  A huge plus, of course, will be a private balcony and toilet with shower.  Usually the entrance to the bathroom is located either from the side of the room, or from the side of the kitchen.  Ideally, if there is a place for a refrigerator in the catering unit. </p><h2>  Design your own room apartment </h2><p>  Suppose you bought a living space in Moscow - an apartment-type hostel.  But you want to equip the house so that it resembles a real and full-fledged apartment.  This is easy to do, just choose a design, clearly plan how the sleeping area and living room, as well as the place to work should be fenced. </p>

    <p>  Currently, it is possible to purchase cabinets, racks, which are designed to fulfill the function of a wall / partition.  Often applied and more budgetary devices - screens. </p><h2>  In which areas of Moscow can I rent a room </h2><p>  If you plan to rent, rather than buy a room, for example, in the center, then you can familiarize yourself with the apartment-type hostel on Taganskaya.  For guests are offered 2-, 4- and 6-bed rooms with daily rent.  Of course, such apartments are suitable for shift workers, business travelers. </p><p>  If the place of work is located in the north of the capital or outside the Moscow Ring Road, for example, you can choose an apartment-type hostel in Khimki or Mytishchi. </p><p>  We wish you to find a quiet and comfortable apartment-room of your dreams! </p>
