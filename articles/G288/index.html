It is quite pleasant to the touch, it is easy to wash.  And do not be afraid that during washing the filler will fall out: a cloth of a very dense knit. </p><p>  A monkey can also be associated with wool - this will turn out to be a real monkey.  The boy will like that she is small and neat, and the girl will want to try on beautiful dresses on her. </p><h2>  Do you know what amigurumi is? </h2><p>  This art of knitting small toys appeared in Japan.  And now it is ubiquitous.  And needlewomen from all over the world diligently create small figures of animals and other creatures.  Exactly this - the small size of the toy, which should not exceed 12 cm - is a distinctive moment of amigurumi. </p>

    <p>  Recently, such knitting has received appreciation in Russia, where most often teenage girls and young mothers are engaged in it, who wholeheartedly want their kids to have only high-quality toys. </p><p>  At first, amigurumi were performed both with a crochet and with knitting needles.  But crochet toys became popular. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rules must be not only known, but also observed </h2><p>  If you really want to understand how to crochet a knitted monkey, you should read this article.  First you need to master the simplest knitting skills, because amigurumi are made in a spiral.  In this case, the circles will not connect.  But there is another option, in which the previous circle closes, and the new one must begin with the lifting loop. </p><p>  The main condition for a crocheted monkey to be correctly made (with a description, of course, easier to work with) is that the knitting should be very tight so that the stuffing material does not come out through the cracks.  Therefore, in preparation for work, you need to choose a hook slightly smaller than what is required by the rules for the selected yarn.  By the way, the threads should be natural shades.  So the toys will not only be bright and beautiful, but also have the perfect combination. </p><h2>  What do you need to understand? </h2><p>  Crochet monkey toy <strong> </strong>  Amigurumi style is made from several separate elements.  In this case, the body, legs, arms, head, tail are first knitted, and then all the elements should be connected.  But there are other toys, consisting only of the head and body.  They have no limbs, and you can knit them with one cloth.  But for the toys to be like real ones, the limbs can be stuffed with plastic pieces, and the fiber packing can be immersed in the rest of the body. </p>

    <p>  A crocheted monkey (the diagram and description will be given below), like other toys, has a large spherical head, a cylinder-shaped body and small limbs.  These toys are very pretty.  And they are perfect as a gift not only to children, but also to adults.  In addition, it is now fashionable among young people to take amigurumi with them on trips and photograph them against the backdrop of attractions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Knit torso and head </h2><p>  So <span>crocheted monkey.</span>  <span>The scheme</span> and description will be given below.  The body is better to knit with a darker yarn. </p><p>  1st row - make 2 air loops and 6 sbn (single crochet) - so repeat six times. </p><p>  2nd row - uniform addition of 6 loops, in the 3rd - 4 loops, and in the 4th - 6 loops, in the 5th row - 8 loops. </p><p>  The 6th row - an increase of 6 loops, the 7th - also 6 additions, the 8th - 4 additions, the 9th - two.

    <p>  24 and 25 rows - these will be recesses under the handles, knit without changes. </p><p>  26th row - make a decrease of 4 loops.  At this stage of the work, the body must be filled with the necessary filler. </p><p>  27th row - reduce 6 stitches. </p><p>  28th - decrease 3. </p><p>  The remaining thread does not need to be cut, because later it will need to be sewn with the head to the body. </p><p>  Now we knit the head of a monkey.  To form the center with a coffee thread - from two air loops and six sbn.  Increases start from the 2nd row - from 6 loops, in the 3rd - from 4;  in the 4th - 6;  in the 5th - 8 additions.  In the next 6, 7 and 8 rows - 6 additions.  In the 9th - only 2, and in the 10th - 8. </p><p>  The bottom of the head is ready, now you need to raise the height, that is, from 11 to 23 tiers, knit 58 stitches without changes. </p><p>  In the 24th tier, you need to reduce 15 loops, in the 25th - 10. Now you can fill your head with filler.  In the 27th row, reduce 9 loops, in the 27th - the final row - 6 decreases.  Now you can fasten and cut the thread. </p><h2>  Knit handles and legs </h2><p>  Crocheted monkey turns out to be very cute, if you follow all the descriptions and patterns. </p><p>  Knit the legs like this: 1st row - knit 7 stitches, make 6 sc and tie them into a ring.  The next three rows to knit 2 sc in each loop from the previous row.  Now you can fill with prepared filler. </p>

    <p>  From 5 to 7 rows, you need to reduce as many loops as were added in the rows from the 2nd to the 4th.  Use filler again.  Now you can knit rows with ordinary sbn with a thread of a different color or shade, until the leg reaches the desired length.  Add filler periodically.  Also knit the second part. </p><p>  Now it‚Äôs the turn of the pens: 1st row: knit 7 pieces, make 6 single crochet and tie them into a ring.  Knit the 2nd row 2 sbn for each loop that goes in a row in front of him.  And connect the next two rows with an ordinary column, without making crochets.  5th row: it is necessary to reduce the loops as they added in the second.  The following rows should be knitted with a thread of a different color or shade until the hand is the right size.  The second part fits the same way. </p><h2>  We knit a tail, ears and make a muzzle </h2><p>  So, it becomes clear that a <span>crocheted monkey, the scheme and description of</span> which is a little higher and lower in the text, is not such a difficult toy as it might seem at the beginning. </p><p>  It remains to tie the ears and tail of the monkey. </p><p>  We do ears so: to connect 7 air loops, then 6 sbn.  Connect in a ring.  Knit the 2nd row, skipping 2 sc in each loop of the previously passing row.  From the 3rd to the 5th rows, knit with a crochet, 1 in each previous loop.  These parts are also paired, so you need to connect two little things. </p>

    <p>  The tail fits in the same way as the handles, only more genuine. </p><p>  Now you can collect all the details of the animal in one piece.  To begin, sew handles at the junction of the head and body.  Sew legs to the bottom of the body at an equal distance from each other.  In the middle of the lower body, you can sew a tail.  Sew ears on the head parallel to each other.  It is very simple to make a muzzle: eyes and a nose can be made of ordinary buttons.  And mouth - embroider thread. </p><p>  Crochet monkey ready. </p>
