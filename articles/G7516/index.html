There are a lot of small hotel complexes in the capital, so you can choose something suitable.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cultural and historical center is located the hotel "Pushkin".  From here, you can reach the Kremlin and Red Square within fifteen minutes on foot.  The hotel is located in a historic mansion of the nineteenth century. </p><p>  Back in 2013, the building was overhauled, after which the institution began to receive guests within its walls.  The hotel is convenient in terms of transport interchange.  From here you can get to anywhere in the city, as there are metro stations nearby (Chekhovskaya, Pushkinskaya, Tverskaya).  But at the same time, the mini-hotel is in a very calm place.  The interiors of the institution are made in a classic style and equipped in terms of functionality. </p><p>  The hotel has a total of 61 rooms, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is from 30 to 150 sq. M.  Guests will be interested in visiting the Pushkin tavern, whose interiors are made in the style of the 18th-19th centuries.  Here you can have breakfast in the buffet format, order a business lunch, a set dinner or choose dishes from the a la carte menu. <img itemprop="image" alt="hotels Moscow center hotels" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2115488.jpg"></p><p>  Excellent reviews about the institution allow you to recommend it for leisure and business trips.  Despite the fact that the hotel is located on Tverskaya Street, in the very center, it is quite quiet and calm.  And at the same time, you can walk to the main attractions of the city.  Well, if you need to get somewhere, then there are no problems, since there are several metro stations nearby.  Visitors note nice rooms and nice staff. </p><h2>  Sokolniki </h2><p>  Inexpensive hotels in the center of Moscow are as popular as fashionable complexes.  The institutions of the city are so diverse that you can find here not only elite hotels, but also budget hostels.  Choosing a place to stay depends on your capabilities and preferences.  In the historical district, known as Sokolniki, is the hotel of the same name.  The three-star establishment offers soundproofed rooms with a good decor, made in the best classical traditions.  The apartments are equipped with private bathrooms and desks.  A buffet breakfast is served in the mornings.  If necessary, drinks and food can be delivered to your room. </p><p>  As for the reviews regarding the institution, they are quite contradictory.  All guests note that the hotel‚Äôs location is not very convenient, since you need to walk about fifteen minutes to the metro or drive a couple of stops by trolley or tram, which is not very convenient.  And in the evenings, getting to the hotel is not so easy, because it is located in a quiet, poorly lit quarter, which makes <span>evening walks</span> not very pleasant. </p><p>  Otherwise, the complex is not bad and offers fairly good rooms.  But the soundproofing of the rooms is lame, or rather, it simply does not exist, because even the quietest conversations are heard in the neighboring apartments.  Breakfasts in the cafe are not varied, but there are enough of them.  The cleaning is very high quality, it is carried out daily and on time. </p><h2>  Veliy Hotel Mokhovaya Moscow </h2><p>  The Veliy Hotel Mokhovaya Moscow is a three-star establishment located on Mokhovaya Street.  Hotel guests can count on accommodation in good rooms.  The hotel was opened in 2013, so it is young.

Borovitskaya station is located just 250 meters from the hotel building. <img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels in Moscow in the center" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2115491.jpg"></p><p>  Tourists are quite satisfied with their stay at the hotel.  Of course, the institution has flaws, but they are not too large, and therefore do not spoil the overall impression of the hotel.  The city guests are especially pleased with the proximity to the center itself, which is very important for those who come to see Moscow. </p><h2>  "Gardening" </h2><p>  Another beautiful establishment in the very center of the city is the Sadovnicheskaya Hotel.  It is located literally five minutes walk from the Kremlin, at the intersection of Sadovnicheskaya and Baltschug streets.  The hotel is quite small and equipped with only 50 rooms, among which you can find not only standards, but also presidential apartments.  All are well-equipped and equipped with modern TVs, a seating area, a minibar and air conditioning. </p><p>  A ten minute walk from the hotel is the Novokuznetskaya metro station.  In general, all the most famous attractions are in the immediate vicinity of the complex.   ,  ,    ,     .  ,        .     ,    ,  ,  ,   .      ,     .      . </p><h2> ¬´ ¬ª </h2><p> - ¬´ ¬ª     .          , , ,    .       .       .        ,     . </p><p>  ,        ,        ,        ,      .       .        ,       .  ,      ,      .   ,      ,       ,     . </p>
