The structure of this complex includes the main building, a suburban terminal, a service building with long-distance ticket offices, as well as many service buildings.  The main station building, built at the end of the 19th century, belongs to the monuments of architecture and is one of the attractions of the city.

    <p>  The <span>Kazan</span> railway <span>station,</span> together with the entire station area, is completely fenced and carefully guarded, only passengers and accompanying people are allowed to present tickets.  Turnstiles installed in the terminal and pavilions near the western and eastern platforms are used to access suburban trains.  The passenger flow of the Kazan station for the year is more than 8 million people.  At the same time, 72 long-distance trains, as well as electric trains and diesel trains, are in service of the station. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of the station and service in our time </h2>

The architect of the main building was the architect Heinrich Rush.  Prior to this, there were no railways in Kazan.  Initially, the movement of trains to Sviyazhsk was laid, and only after the construction of the bridge across the Volga was a section of the road to Kazan opened.  The train ride at that time from Moscow to Kazan took 53 hours, now you can get there in 14 hours.

    <p>  After a fire in 1992, which almost destroyed the main building, the station was rebuilt.  Repair work was completed in time for the celebration of the 100th anniversary.  The new railway station in Kazan is actually a convenient and cozy room.  After the reconstruction of the structure, the capacity of the station increased significantly (more than 750 passengers).  There are three waiting rooms, a room for business meetings, an information and information desk, a mother and child room, toilets, catering facilities, ATMs and other office rooms.  The station square is equipped with a parking lot and <span>an underpass.</span>  Near the station is a city square. </p><h2>  Appearance and awards </h2>

It is especially beautiful at night, when the lighting transforms the beauty of architecture and gives it a kind of fabulous mystery.  The walls and floor surface are finished in marble and granite.  On the street in front of the entrance there are sculptures of two snow-white leopards.  <span>The facade of the building</span> is decorated with stucco and lanterns.  Recently, the railway station (Kazan) is the address at which both local newlyweds and numerous tourists like to be photographed.

    <p>  With an increase in the flow of passengers in 1967, they decided to build a second two-story building, the architect of which was M. Kh. Agishev.  After 20 years, the administrative building of the Kazan representative office of the Gorky Railway was built near the station, which generally harmonizes with the architecture of the old station. </p><p>  In the last quarter of 2009, a large team of the Kazan station became the winner in the industry competition organized by Russian Railways.  The competition took into account not only performance indicators, but also the opinions of passengers. </p>
