    <p>  On the territory there is a special playground where children can freely climb, ride the slides and run.  In the restaurant they are waiting for highchairs, a children's menu and even a children's buffet, which operates during lunch and dinner.  Adults can also use a blender and microwave if they need to cook special foods or warm them up for their little ones. </p><p>  At any time, for a fee, you can rent a pram and even use the services of a nanny.  True, this option is only possible for children from 4 years. </p><h2>  Business meetings near the sea </h2><p>  On the Mediterranean coast, they often not only relax, but also work.  After all, arranging conferences and seminars here is becoming popular. </p><p>  For these corporate purposes, Armas Labada Hotel has two conference rooms.  One of them is large: its area is 200 square meters, and depending on the type of seating of guests, it will be able to accommodate 120 or 180 people.  In a small room with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly 30 square meters, 15 to 25 people can perfectly fit. </p><h2>  What vacationers say about the hotel </h2><p>  Of course, studying information about the hotel before the trip, one cannot but get acquainted with the impressions of tourists who have already visited Armas Labada Hotel.  Reviews about this place make it clear that the hotel does not yet comply with the stated 5 *.  Many argue that the rooms require repair and equipment upgrades, as, for example, they have old TVs.  The air conditioning system in the rooms is central, so you cannot set the temperature yourself.  Some point out that in public places it is rather dirty, even on the beach.  And a lot of complaints concern paid Internet in the territory: its cost is high, but the signal level and speed leave much to be desired. </p>
