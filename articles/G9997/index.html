    <h2>  Positive hotel reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists visiting Greece prefer to stay at the Flisvos Beach Hotel 2 * resort.  Reviews about this place are characterized by the following positive comments: </p><ul><li>  compliance of the cost of living with the quality of the services provided, as well as the living conditions; </li><li>  new bedding that smells good thanks to rinse aid; </li><li>  just an ideal location - it is not only close to the sea, but also to all the main facilities of the resort infrastructure; </li><li>  thanks to the work of the owners of the hotel, a friendly, family atmosphere reigns in it, which is carefully supported by professional staff; </li><li>  the balcony offers incredibly picturesque views, and since it is available in all rooms, each of the guests has the opportunity to enjoy this beauty; </li><li>  convenient layout of rooms, which involves dividing a very large space into separate functional areas; </li><li>  despite the fact that breakfast starts at 8 o‚Äôclock in the morning, the dining room actually opens at 6, so you can have a snack early and go to the beach or on an excursion; </li><li>  There is a bus stop very close to the hotel, and therefore you can independently go to any part of the island; </li><li>  in the courtyard of the hotel there is a very clean pool, which absolutely does not smell like bleach; </li><li>  since the reservoir is surrounded by buildings on four sides, it is absolutely not blown by the wind; </li><li>  The huge advantage of the rooms is that there are kitchen utensils and household appliances, which makes it possible to cook food yourself. </li></ul><h2>  Negative hotel reviews </h2><p>  Despite the huge number of positive comments, there were some flaws and negative aspects at the Flisvos Beach Hotel.  Reviews about this place indicate the presence of the following negative aspects: </p><ul><li>  the beds themselves are quite new, but the mattresses are old and squeezed, and therefore it is simply impossible to fully rest on them - in the morning the back and neck are very sore; </li><li>  very old washed towels, which, in addition to gray color, are also characterized by scuffs and even holes (nevertheless, if you leave a tip to the maid, they will replace the towels with new ones); </li><li>  the doors in the rooms creak and slam very loudly, because of which it is simply impossible to relax peacefully while in the apartment; </li><li>  the air conditioner is very old, because of which it practically does not cool the air, but it is incredibly noisy; </li><li>  the rooms on the ground floor are very damp, and therefore mold appears on the walls, which also emits a not very pleasant smell; </li><li>  the hotel does not accept plastic credit cards, and therefore you will have to carry a large enough amount of cash to pay for accommodation and other services; </li><li>  eating in a restaurant is quite expensive, and therefore it is better to order dishes in neighboring establishments; </li><li>  the apartments have only two outlets, and therefore you have to choose which equipment you are going to turn on (in addition, one of the outlets is non-standard, which is why it will not be possible to connect a charger to it); </li><li>  the food in the restaurant, although tasty, but rather monotonous, and therefore very quickly bored; </li><li>  for the use of sun loungers and umbrellas a rather high fee is charged - as much as 5 euros (but on other beaches this service is even more expensive, and therefore vacationers simply have no choice); </li><li>  the cleaning is mediocre enough, but if you want to improve the situation, then by all means leave a tip to the maid; </li><li>  some rooms do not have a hairdryer; </li><li>  due to the fact that the hotel is very old, plumbing works poorly here, as well as very shabby furniture. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the resort </h2><p>  A huge number of comments from travelers allows us to add some impression about the Flisvos Beach Hotel 3 *.  Reviews especially note that this hotel is a kind of economy option.  Nevertheless, the low cost of living does not adversely affect the quality of the services provided.  Perhaps the only drawback is outdated furniture, as well as plumbing.  And in the rooms it would not hurt to make redecorating. </p><p>  One of the main advantages of this institution can be considered its location.  Quite rarely you can find a budget hotel located on the first coastline.  However, the hotel does not have a private beach, and guests are invited to use the public beach.  If you need a sun lounger or umbrella to protect from the sun, then they will be provided to you at an additional cost.  The area in which the hotel is located is the center of tourist life, where travelers can find many shops, restaurants and entertainment venues.  There is also a good traffic intersection. </p><p>  It is worth noting that this hotel is an ideal option for active tourists who spend a minimum of time at the hotel, and therefore do not want to overpay for a room.  For relatively little money, you can get a cozy overnight stay, as well as hearty and tasty food.  The rest of the time is recommended to be spent swimming in the sea and visiting local attractions.  Otherwise, you will certainly be struck by the outdated atmosphere of the hotel, as well as insufficient quality cleaning. </p>
