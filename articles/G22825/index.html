    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the territory of Liking Resort Sanya 4 * (Hainan) there is a swimming pool equipped with a relaxation area with umbrellas and sunbeds.  The reservoir is divided into zones, the maximum depth in it does not exceed the mark of 1 meter 60 centimeters.

The hotel has a tour desk where you can purchase trips to local attractions. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  For beach lovers coming to Sanya, Liking Resort Sanya 4 * can be a great place to spend a vacation, since the hotel is located on the coast.

The guests of the establishment can use the beach infrastructure for free.  In addition, for their vacationers, the hotel provided for the issue of beach towels, which can be obtained in the pool area. </p><h2>  Liking Resort Sanya 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to refer to the reviews of tourists who rested in it.  Indeed, it is thanks to the opinion of the guests that a more realistic picture can be formed.  Liking Resort Sanya (ex. Landscape Beach) 4 * - a good complex located on the beach.  The hotel is focused on a variety of categories of tourists, and therefore it will be comfortable for all guests of the resort to live here.  The convenient location of the institution can be considered a big advantage, because far from every hotel can boast of what is located near the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="liking resort sanya ex landscape beach 4" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1720724.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The complex consists of a number of buildings located in a beautiful green area.  The complete set of all apartments is approximately the same.  However, when choosing a room when booking, remember that some do not have a balcony, if this moment is important to you.  According to tourists, the apartments are very spacious (with high ceilings) and well equipped.  Of course, traces of scuffs on furniture are noticeable.  Bathrobes and bedding are also far from new and need to be replaced.  But as for the equipment in the room, it is all working and there are no problems with its operation. </p><p>  It is worth noting that mosquitoes periodically appear in the rooms, so at night you should not leave windows and balcony doors open.  Fumitox, which is provided for guests in the rooms, helps to cope with insects. </p><p>  The bathroom has detergents, toothpaste, soap, gels, shampoos and toilet paper.  All supplies are replenished by maids as needed.  Three towels are provided for each guest, they are changed daily, but bed linen is available on request.  On the whole, brochures are spread out in the rooms, asking you to change your clothes as little as possible.  Such frugality will supposedly be rewarded with a souvenir.  However, according to tourists, no surprises should be expected, this is just a successful advertising move. </p><p>  As for cleaning at Liking Resort Sanya * (China), it is carried out regularly and at the same time it is of high quality, although not perfect.  But overall the rooms are clean and comfortable.  But the staff does not tip, even if they are left.  And cash bonuses do not affect the quality of service.  The hotel workers are attentive enough and are well disposed towards Russian tourists. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  How are meals at Liking Resort Sanya 4 *?  Reviews of tourists regarding food are usually quite contradictory.  This issue is causing a lot of controversy and complaints.  But this does not apply at all to the Liking Resort Sanya 4 * hotel (China, Hainan).  All guests celebrate a wide variety of breakfast buffets.  Guests can choose a more familiar meal if they don‚Äôt want to try Chinese delicacies.  Every day on the tables there is a huge selection of fruits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="liking resort sanya 4 hainan" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1720726.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At lunch and in the evening, tourists can order food in a restaurant or go to one of the nearest food establishments near the hotel.  Here you can even find a cafe with Russian names and dishes familiar to us.  Therefore, there are no problems with food, even if you absolutely do not want to try local products. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  Liking Resort Sanya 4 * (Dadonghai) - a wonderful hotel, built on the beach.  Such a great location allows you to be on the coast all the time.  Of course, the hotel has an excellent pool with a children's area and a recreation area, but swimming in chlorinated water, when the warm sea splashes just around the corner, is simply illogical.  According to tourists, the hotel‚Äôs beach is a little inconvenient in that the entry into the sea on it is rocky.  On the one hand, the water on the beach is not cloudy, and on the other hand, it is not very convenient to enter the water on such soil.  However, this does not bother tourists at all, since walking a little along the coast, you can sit on neighboring sandy beaches. </p><h2>  Staff service </h2><p>  Hotel Liking Resort Sanya 4 * - a pleasant complex in all respects for a beach-sea vacation.  A good number of rooms, although a little tired, combined with good service is a guarantee of a successful vacation.  It is worth emphasizing that the local staff, like the employees of all the restaurants and cafes of the resort, do not speak Russian at all.  But even in such a situation, it can be explained if necessary.  In the lobby of the hotel near the reception there are always representatives of tour operators who speak excellent Russian.  They help our tourists cope with the language barrier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="liking resort sanya 4 china" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1720728.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In general, the hotel staff is very pleasant and tries to please its guests. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  The city resort of Sanya has excellent infrastructure, impeccable ecology and a wonderful tropical climate that allows you to relax here throughout the year.  Sandy gently sloping beaches and the warmest sea attract couples with children here.  The rich underwater world and clear water are ideal for diving enthusiasts.  The resort has a wide selection of hotels of different levels, among which each tourist will be able to choose an acceptable option.  Beach holidays are complemented by lush tropical nature, the beauty of which can be admired on excursions. </p><p>  Dadonghai is the most popular resort among Russian tourists on Hainan Island.  It is located near the city of Sanya and attracts supporters of outdoor activities.  There are many entertainment venues, cafes and restaurants. </p><p>  The beaches of the resort are located in the bay, their total length is about two kilometers.  White sand, clear water and tropical trees are Dadonghai's business card.  Even in the winter months, the temperature of sea water does not drop below twenty degrees. </p><h2>  Resort Attractions </h2><p>  There are no outstanding historical sights in Sanya, the main places for visiting tourists are museums and natural parks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="liking resort sanya 4 china hainan" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1720729.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  "End of the World" - one of these parks, located near Sanya.  On its territory, tourists can see randomly scattered boulders of the most bizarre shapes.  Each of them has its own name: ‚Äúbroken heart‚Äù, ‚Äúrefuge of a bachelor‚Äù, ‚Äúedge of the world‚Äù, etc. </p><p>  Many tourists try to buy local pearl jewelry.  But before you get these beads, you should visit the Pearl Museum.  Here you can see truly unique pearls, as well as visit the plantation on which they are grown. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Liking Resort Sanya 4 * - a democratic hotel with a good number of rooms and good service.  If you plan to spend your holidays on the beaches of Sanya, then you can consider Liking Resort as a possible option for accommodation.  The main advantage of the hotel, of course, is its location on the very shore of the beautiful sea. </p>
