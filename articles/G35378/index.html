All resort complexes were given their own names, but very often the same name of the boarding house was found in different parts of the coast.  One of the common names is ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù.  A boarding house with this name can be found very often. </p><h2>  Pension "Azov", Urzuf, Ukraine </h2><p>  In the Donetsk region in Ukraine there is a resort village of Urzuf.  This small, quiet resort village was founded more than two hundred years ago by Greek immigrants.  In winter, the village is very quiet and empty, and in summer Urzuf comes to life.  Numerous <span>recreation centers, boarding houses,</span> guest houses and children's camps are filled with vacationers, many cafes and restaurants, an amusement park begin to work, beach activities work. </p><p>  In the center of the village, near the seashore, a minute walk from the beach is located "Azov" - a boarding house with developed infrastructure, which occupies a large territory. <br>  The total area is about 4 hectares.  The resort complex includes two three-story residential buildings, a two-story cottage, an administrative and medical building, a dining room building, a cinema, a beauty salon, several cafes, playgrounds and a huge park area with alleys, flowerbeds, benches and gazebos.
