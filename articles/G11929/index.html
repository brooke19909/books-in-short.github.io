    <p>  The first medieval building on this place was completely not conceived as a castle.  It was a defensive fortress.  She appeared during the reign of Count Baudouin I, nicknamed Iron Hand - the founder of the Flanders House.  The fortress was supposed to reflect the attacks of the Scandinavian tribes (Vikings), terrorizing Europe. </p><p>  The fortress performed not only protective functions.  She declared military power and strength, was called to demonstrate the power and greatness of the rulers of Flanders.  For some time she served as the residence of the counts, changing her appearance with the change of dominant person. </p><h2>  Castle rebuilding </h2><p>  The grandson of Baudouin, Arnulf the Great, having received the reins of government, decided to radically change the structure.  In the X century, he turned the fortress into his own castle.  In its place appeared various wooden buildings (a house for officials, an office, etc.).  In the center on a small elevation housed the main building for the count. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 12th century, the central wooden structure was replaced by a stone tower of three floors.  Around the Castle of the Counts of Flanders a holistic fortified wall arose.  The lower level of the tower was slightly increased by attaching slopes and walled up all the windows.  This provided additional protection against the invasion. </p>

    <p>  On each floor was located in the hall, which were interconnected by stairs.  On the second floor there was a grand hall with fireplaces and large windows, where guests were welcomed.  At the very top were the rooms of the servants and inhabitants of the castle. </p><p>  The castle acquired its modern appearance only in 1180, when Philip I of Alsace came to power.  Twenty-five towers and huge gates appeared on the fortress wall.  The main building has "grown" three more floors.  It was equipped with a place for the nobility to live (before that, receptions were only organized in the castle).  The count's house housed kitchens, rooms of counts and guests of honor.  And the chambers themselves were distinguished by luxurious decoration and decorative details. </p><h2>  Lock device </h2><p>  The powerful ramparts of the Castle of the Counts of Flanders were crowned with no less grandiose gates with the Jerusalem Cross, which was erected by Phillip of Alsace.  Next was a small internal gate that led directly into the courtyard of the castle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To the right of the gate was the building of the count stables, which was later used as a torture chamber.  The gate was connected by a bridge to the entrance to the underground prison.  In the event of an attack, the inhabitants of the castle could take refuge in it. </p>

    <p>  Inside the castle there was a knight's hall, where they concluded contracts, conducted the inauguration of the counts and diplomatic receptions.  For feasts and celebrations there was a separate banquet hall. </p><p>  In the north wing of the castle was a count house.  It housed the rooms of the count and countess, as well as the kitchen.  In the eastern part was the governor's house.  Both wings were connected by stairs to an underground prison.  It was a dark room with walls several meters thick. </p><h2>  The many roles of Gravensten </h2><p>  In the 14th century, under Louis van Malet, the Castle of the Counts of Flanders ceased to serve as a residence for the rulers of the region.  It housed the Ghent Mint, which moved here from the province of Brabant. </p><p>  Later, the courtyard was closed, and officials held meetings in the castle walls.  All rooms, including the counties, turned into office space of the Council of Flanders (judicial authority).  Thus, the medieval castle became the supreme court of the region, where the most serious cases, appeals were considered, decrees, decrees and even peace treaties were legally approved.  There was also a prison for convicts. </p><p>  After 1778, the castle of the counts of Flanders was sold to a textile factory.  The halls of the central tower turned into workrooms, and the workers settled in adjacent buildings.  Additional houses were built in the front castle courtyard, the prison became a spinning mill, and the engine room was located in the count house. </p><p>  In the XIX century, city authorities began to gradually redeem the castle in parts.  Under the direction of Joseph de Valais, the legendary Ghent building was restored to its original appearance, which was close to what it was in the 12th century under Count Philippe. </p>

    <h2>  Castle nowadays </h2><p>  At the end of the 20th century, the castle of the counts of Flanders in Ghent again had to be restored.  This time both architects and historians worked on it, trying to recreate all the important details as accurately as possible. </p><p>  Now the building houses a museum.  It is dedicated to the period when courts passed in the ancient walls, and all the premises were occupied by the Council of Flanders.  This is the Museum of Justice and Arms.  It presents various instruments of torture, shackles, handcuffs and other tools used by court and prison staff. </p><p>  The castle of the counts of Flanders is open to visitors all year round.  An exception is a few festive dates: December 24, 25, 31 and January 1.  Entrance to it is paid, and you can see the attraction from 10 am to 6 pm. </p>
