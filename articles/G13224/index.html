In winter, in the immediate vicinity of the lake, a small hotel complex operates in this place, in which corporate parties are often held. </p><p>  Tourists who have chosen Lake Barkhatovo (Krasnoyarsk) for relaxation, can not only sunbathe on its shore or swim.

There is also a private bath in this recreation center. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, vacationers can use this locker room on this beach.

    <h2>  Barkhatovo, lake: tourist reviews </h2><p>  Opinions about this pond are different.  Some praise the lake, others it seems dirty.  But in any case, in the summer, hundreds of tourists visit the pond.  Many come here with their children. </p><p>  The fishermen, unfortunately, did not deserve especially rave reviews from Barkhatovo.  The lake (the Krasnoyarsk Territory is large, but mostly residents of the regional center and Sosnovoborsk come here) are really popular among fans of sitting on the shore with a fishing rod.  However, experienced fishermen in this pond are not advised to rely on too rich a catch. </p><h2>  Ecological problems </h2><p>  A pretty clean coastline is what characterizes <span>Barkhatovo Lake (Krasnoyarsk</span> Territory).  However, the same cannot be said about the water itself in the quarry.  It doesn‚Äôt look too dirty visually.  The only thing is that a lot of algae always floats on its surface.  However, unfortunately, with regard to the safety of swimming on the lake, everything is far from being as smooth as we would like.  For example, as a result of an inspection of the SES carried out in the summer of 2016, it became known that the water here does not comply with hygiene standards.  Moreover, the pollution indicators exceed the permissible 14 times. </p>

    <p>  The result of the audit, among other things, was that the Krasnoyarsk administration recommended that the townspeople refrain from visiting the lake.  The Velvet company was fined 10 thousand rubles.  The company's management was ordered to immediately eliminate all identified violations. </p>
