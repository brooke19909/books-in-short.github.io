The most ancient person: growth, appearance, basic skills and activities</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  According to scientific evidence, primitive people appeared about 4 million years ago.  For many millennia, they have evolved, that is, improved not only in terms of the development of <span>primitive society,</span> but also externally.  Historical anthropology divides primitive people into several species, which successively replaced each other.  What are the anatomical features of each type of primitive people, and in what period of time did they exist?  Read about all this below. </p><h2>  Primitive people - who are they? </h2><p>  The most ancient people lived in Africa more than 2 million years ago.  This is confirmed by numerous archaeological finds.  However, it is known for certain that for the first time humanoid creatures that move confidently on their hind limbs (namely, this sign is the most important in determining the primitive man) appeared much earlier - 4 million years ago.  Such a characteristic of ancient people as upright posture was first identified in creatures to which scientists gave the name "Australopithecus." </p>

    <p>  As a result of centuries of evolution, they were replaced by the more advanced Homo habls, also known as "skilled man."  It was replaced by humanoid creatures, representatives of which were called Homo erectus, which is translated from Latin as "upright man."  And only after almost one and a half million years did a more perfect look of the primitive man appear, which most closely resembled the modern intelligent population of the Earth - Homo sapiens or "intelligent man."  As can be seen from the foregoing, primitive people slowly, but at the same time, developed very effectively, mastering new opportunities.  Let us consider in more detail what all these ancestors of man were, what their activity was and what they looked like. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Australopithecus: external features and lifestyle </h2><p>  Historical anthropology refers Australopithecus to the very first monkeys that move on their hind limbs.  The origin of this kind of primitive people began on the territory of East Africa more than 4 million years ago.  For nearly 2 million years, these creatures spread throughout the continent.  The oldest man, whose average height was 135 cm, weighed no more than 55 kg.  Unlike monkeys, Australopithecus had more pronounced sexual dimorphism, but the structure of the fangs in males and females was almost the same.  The skull box of this species was relatively small and had a volume of not more than 600 cm <sup>3</sup> .  The main activity of Australopithecus was practically no different from that of modern monkeys, and boiled down to the extraction of food and protection from natural enemies. </p>

    <h2>  Skillful man: features of anatomy and lifestyle </h2><p>  <span>Homo habilis</span> (translated from Latin as ‚Äúskilled man‚Äù) as a separate independent species of anthropoids appeared 2 million years ago on the African continent.  This oldest man, whose growth often reached 160 cm, had a more developed brain than Australopithecus, and his brain was about 700 cm <sup>3</sup> .  The teeth and fingers of the upper extremities of Homo habilis were almost completely similar to human ones, however, large superciliary arches and jaws made it look like monkeys.  In addition to gathering, a skilled man was engaged in hunting using stone blocks, and he was able to use processed tracing paper for cutting animal carcasses.  This suggests that Homo habilis is the first humanoid creature to have work skills. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Homo erectus: appearance </h2><p>  The anatomical characteristic of ancient people, known as Homo erectus, is a pronounced increase in the volume of the skull, which allowed scientists to claim that their brain is comparable in size to the brain of a modern person.  <span>The superciliary arches</span> and jaws of a skilled man remained massive, but were not as pronounced as their predecessors.  The physique was almost the same as that of modern man.  Judging by archaeological finds, Homo erectus led a <span>sedentary lifestyle</span> and knew how to make fire.  Representatives of this species lived in large enough groups in caves.  The main occupation of a skilled person was gathering (mainly among women and children), hunting and fishing, and making clothes.  Homo erectus was one of the first to recognize the need for food reserves. </p><h2>  <span>Neanderthal: a description of the</span> appearance and lifestyle </h2><p>  Neanderthals appeared much later than their predecessors - about 250 millennia ago.  What was this ancient man?  Its growth reached 170 cm, and the volume of the skull was 1200 cm <sup>3</sup> .  In addition to Africa and Asia, these human ancestors settled in Europe.  The maximum number of Neanderthals in one group reached 100 people.  Unlike their predecessors, they had rudimentary forms of speech, which allowed fellow tribesmen to exchange information and interact more harmoniously with each other.  The main occupation of this <span>human ancestor</span> was hunting.  Success in obtaining food was provided by a variety of tools: spears, spiky long fragments of stones that were used as knives, and traps dug in the ground with the help of stakes.  The obtained materials (hides, skins) were used by Neanderthals for the manufacture of clothes and shoes. </p>

    <h2>  Cro-Magnons: the final stage in the evolution of primitive man </h2><p>  Cro-Magnons or Homo Sapiens is the last ancient man known to science, whose growth has already reached 170-190 cm. The outward similarity of this species of primitive people with monkeys was almost imperceptible, as the superciliary arches decreased, and the lower jaw did not protrude forward .  Tools Cro-Magnons made not only of stone, but also of wood and bone.  In addition to hunting, these human ancestors were engaged in agriculture and the initial forms of animal husbandry (tamed wild animals). </p>
