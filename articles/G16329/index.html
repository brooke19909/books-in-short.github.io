    <h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  The reservoir is located in the north of the <span>Astrakhan region,</span> not far from it there is a settlement - the city of Akhtubinsk.  The pond has an elongated shape (from north to west), its length reaches 18 km, its width varies from 6 to 13 km.  The total area is 115 square meters.  km  The distance from the Caspian Sea is 270 km, from the Volga River - 53 km to the east.  Currently, the entire surrounding area is part of the Bogdinsko-Baskunchak reserve, where Lake Baskunchak is rightfully recognized as a pearl of the region.  This region received the status of a conservation object in 1997.  Since that time, special conservation regimes have been operating here that do not allow numerous guests to harm the environment or spoil rare natural sights. </p>

    <p>  Baskunchak is a marble lake, it is called so because of its unusual appearance with placers of salt.  From afar, it looks like ice.  Many first take it for a surface dotted with holes, as if water peeps through a crust of ice.  These ice holes are the result of salt extraction from the surface.  It is in these places that swimming is very beneficial for the body. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Legends </h2><p>  The lake is literally surrounded by myths.  It has been known to people since ancient times, merchants and traders constantly carried their caravans through the adjacent territory.  Legends are composed about its name - in translation from Turkic languages ‚Äã‚Äãit can be translated as "the head of a dog."  They say that once, in ancient times, the lake became so shallow that its bottom was exposed, and a merchant going by decided to shorten his path and drive right along it.  The quick step of the horse and its hooves protected the animal from salt, and the dog running after it wounded its paws on the crystals and died.  Then the rainy season began, the lake was filled with water, and the corpse of the dead dog was preserved in salt and constantly floated to the surface, many travelers saw it.  Another legend also speaks of dog death - in the heat the merchants' caravan passing by saw the lake, travelers stopped near it to take a break.  The dog accompanying the people rushed to drink water, but the animal was poisoned by the excess of salt and fell into the lake.  And the dog‚Äôs head was seen for a long time on the surface of the water. </p>

    <p>  And the most beautiful of the legends tells about the unhappy love of a girl who was forcibly given out as a rich man, and therefore her beloved died.  She cried at the foot of the mountain for several days, and her tears made a salt lake. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The properties </h2><p>  Baskunchak <span>(marble lake)</span> lies 21 meters below sea level.  Its water is very salty, some sources say that it exceeds the Dead Sea.  Its salinity is 300 g / l.  The lake itself is a deepening of the salt mountain, the base of which goes thousands of meters deep.  Its nutrition occurs due to numerous springs and a river with the name Gorkaya.  Neither plants nor animals can exist in the lake - only bacteria with the ability to tolerate such a concentration of salt live there. </p>

    <h2>  Salt production </h2><p>  Baskunchak Lake has been known since ancient times, it is famous for its purest salt - 98%.  It was mined from the 8th century by hand, and sent along the Silk Road.  The first mention of this place is found in historical sources since 1627.  At that time, salt was mined using shovels and crowbars, from the lake to the shore it was delivered on camels.  Since the 20s of the last century, production has improved - machines and combines began to be used, a railway was laid for export.  Up to 300 tons of salt can be mined in one hour using special equipment.  Baskunchak Lake, where one of the main salt deposits in Russia is located, was developed by the Bassol enterprise.  It supplies up to 80% of all the country's reserves.  Moreover, the salt of this particular field is notable for its purity and the most useful properties. </p><h2>  Place for racing </h2><p>  One of the unusual venues for car competitions is Baskunchak, a lake.  (How to get to it is indicated above.) From 1960 to 1963, a high-speed highway was built on it.  During the competition, 29 all-Union records were set.  Races were held on a completely flat ring road, the length of which was 20 km.  The salt crust covering the surface of the lake was a unique venue for the competition - it is absolutely flat.  Later, when salt production increased more and more, the hydrological situation on the lake changed, and its surface became unsuitable for racing.  In this regard, regular competitions in this region have stopped </p>

Tourists recommend that you definitely bring shoes with you where you can go swimming, as there are a lot of sharp salt crystals at the bottom of the lake.  In addition, you will need fresh water - rinse after bathing.  If salt water from the lake gets into your eyes, it burns the mucous membrane, especially children suffer it painfully.  It is customary to swim here carefully so as not to splatter yourself or those standing nearby.  Healing mud is widely used by vacationers right on the shore, but it is better to collect the mud as close to the center of the lake as possible - it is cleaner there.  Salt water literally pushes to the surface, when swimming it leaves a lot of impressions for everyone who came to Lake Baskunchak.

    <h2>  Prospects </h2><p>  Baskunchak is also unique in terms of inexhaustibility - its reserves are constantly replenished naturally.  It is interesting in that human intervention did little to damage this particular ecosystem.  In 1927, scientists tried to get to the very bottom of the congestion and determine the underlying rock.  Wells were drilled, excavations were carried out and work was carried out.  They stopped at around 257 meters - and never reached the bottom.  Despite the endless salt reserves, the lake is still in the conservation area - this means that careful treatment is regulated at the state level.  Baskunchak Lake, where the country's main salt deposit is located, is not only a unique natural site, but also an important resource of the Russian economy. </p>
