  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Christmas tree made from beads. Holiday traditions in a new incarnation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A traditional New Year tree, without it the festive decoration of the house and the New Year mood are unthinkable.  For three centuries, this symbol of Christmas and New Year has been adorning our homes in its invariable form, with bright colored toys, a six-pointed star at the top, and colored, "mischievous" lights running across its branches. </p><p>  But life does not stand still, modern views, fashion trends in art and design break traditions and stereotypes, creating unusual modern forms of such things familiar and familiar from childhood.  So the New Year tree in the hands of designers using a variety of methods, materials and <span>artistic techniques</span> for implementation, sometimes acquires the most bizarre forms.  <span>Christmas trees made of feathers,</span> glass and metal, of various natural materials (cones, moss and hay), of textile, paper and plastic, in their traditional form or in an abstract, barely outlining familiar contours, now decorate houses on <span>New Year's Eve.</span> </p><p>  Everyone can become an artist and designer and create a symbolic <span>image of a Christmas</span> tree for decorating an interior or for a gift, using various artistic techniques and materials.  One of these techniques is the beadwork of volumetric objects - art based on ancient traditions.  A small bead tree will decorate the holiday table, it can be made the center of the original holiday composition.  A Christmas tree made of beads, in the form of a traditional tree, or an abstract New Year symbol will be a good gift to friends. </p><p>  Christmas tree made from beads can be very different.  Her color, size and shape will entirely depend on the imagination of the artist.  But in any case, for work you will need a lot of different sizes of beads of green, white, <span>gold color</span> and wire of different thicknesses. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Christmas tree made of beads </p><p>  To embody the traditional classic Christmas tree, green shades of several shades, a thick wire for the trunk and a thin wire for twigs, a brown thread, a stand and a plaster mix are needed. </p><p>  1. Let's start with the manufacture of the top.  Take a long enough end of a thin wire, string 10 green beads on it, distribute them in the center, bend the wire and twist the loop of beads.  From each end from this central loop in the same way we make three more loops of 10 beads.  It turns out a branch of 7 loops, with one central.  There should be four such branches.  We use beads of different colors, in the center it is lighter, darker towards the edges.  So the Christmas tree will turn out more realistic. </p><p>  2. Now we wind each twig with a brown thread to the wire for the frame sequentially from four sides.  All the eyelets needles are lifted up.  The result was a tetrahedral top of the Christmas tree. </p><p>  3. We make the remaining branches of the Christmas tree the same tetrahedral, collecting them from separate branches consisting of bead loops.  On each subsequent row, we increase the number of loops so that the finished branches are longer, and the tree expands to the base of the trunk, assuming a conical shape.  We fasten each row of branches to the frame trunk as they are manufactured.  This will show how many rows of branches still need to be done.  We understand each row of branches up. </p><p>  4. Install the finished Christmas tree in the stand and fill it with gypsum mortar.  You can decorate the base with sparkles, moss or cotton. </p><p>  DIY Christmas tree made of beads can be made differently.  For example, in the form of an amazing lamp decorating a festive interior.  For work, you will need: one or more cones of transparent plastic of different sizes, white or gold glass beads or large beads, a Christmas tree luminous garland, PVA glue.  We cover the cone with glue and sprinkle abundantly with beads and glass beads.  To white and gold, you can add a little colorful.  We lay a garland on a large tray or dish, set Christmas tree cones on the bulbs from above, decorate the tray with fir branches and balls.  Fabulous Christmas composition is ready. </p><p>  A bead tree can be a replacement for a traditional Christmas tree, or it can be a very beautiful addition to it, decorating the mantelpiece, sitting on a low nightstand or table. </p>
