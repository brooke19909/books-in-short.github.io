And these cultural monuments are worth knowing in more detail for those who are going to settle in one of the one hundred eighty-seven brick houses built in the style of English classicism.  The cottages here are different - there are four types in total.  They, of course, are not the palaces of Catherine, but you will not be crowded there.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe most modest - from two hundred and twenty square meters.  And a lot of land was also given to the <span>English park</span> .  Those who wish can purchase up to thirty hundred parts. </p>

    <h2>  "Stone Chambers" </h2><p>  <span>The Catherine Palace</span> was built in the summer of 1724.  Then, in honor of this event, thirteen guns fired three times.  Fairytale castle appeared a little later.  At first it was a two-story house typical of the eighteenth century with numerous, in the opinion of the present, architectural excesses.  Subsequently, it was significantly expanded, completed and redone.  And now the residents of the cottage village "Mariinsky Manor" can compare the comfort of their home with the royal one, just walking in a magnificent park. </p><p>  Everything here fascinates and delights.  Especially the grandeur of the azure facades.  It is always beautiful here - both in winter and in summer.  It seems that the cottages of the village "Mariinsky Manor" have borrowed positive energy, expression and extraordinary style.  And how else to build in such a dazzling neighborhood!  By the way, to the Catherine Palace - just a stone's throw.  You can walk to him in about ten minutes.  To no less magnificent Pavlovsk - even closer.  Yes, and to St. Petersburg, the whole road takes half an hour at a glance.  The Mariinsky Manor was able to incorporate all of the eighteenth-century classicism ‚Äî Russian, French, and English.  Even traces of ancient art, an attentive look is easy to find. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  There is no royal pomp in the location of the village, but there is a lot of comfort and pure natural wealth.  Near the river is flowing Black.  On its shores, the best poet of all time was mortally wounded, who could not choose an ugly corner for this moment.  It was here that the Mariinsky Manor was located.  The cottage village is located between the river and the marvelous virgin forest - this is the Glebovsky Reserve.  No need to be afraid of its real name - Glebovsky swamp.  On fourteen hectares there are five beautiful lakes.  Seven of the purest spring streams flow from this swamp. </p><p>  The whole territory is covered with islands with birch and pine trees.  The forest strip bordering the reserve is quite wide - these are excellent spruce forests.  Coniferous trees are diluted with aspen, linden, oak, elm.  There are many berries - cranberries, cloudberries, lingonberries, blueberries, blueberries.  And how much information about the birds will give the inhabitants of the Mariinsky Manor!  Not only sparrows and titmouse will visit the cottage village, but also cranes, partridges, ducks, gulls, waders, who love their ‚Äúswamp‚Äù.  In the thick of the forest there are wild boars, moose, wolves, foxes.  Even the bears were seen, but they often have a lot of food, they do not bother people.  The nature of the Mariinsky Manor is exceptionally rich, it won‚Äôt be bored. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  First of all, you must pay tribute to the developer of this project, which is the Chinese holding company "Bi High Invest".  It is part of the huge Hua Ren Real Estate.  Everything is carefully thought out here: there are no excesses, but everything you need is present.  If KP "Mariinsky Manor" is positioned as a business-class village, then not a single detail in the construction of cottages or in the design of the infrastructure will challenge this. </p><p>  The classicism of the buildings - both French and English - is impeccable.  In the second stage, the style changes slightly, but it is clear why.  Facing bricks of different shades deprives the facades and the general appearance of the village of some monotony, throwing the bridge to the present.  Projects of cottages are different.  But everyone has an attic floor where you can live in winter and summer.  Mandatory for every home fireplace.  And the most important thing is that in a single tonality everything that is built in the Mariinsky Estate estate sounds. </p>

    <h2>  Details </h2><p>  The village received its name also from a favorable location: once Maria Fyodorovna, the Empress, owned these lands.  In her honor she received the name "Mariinsky Manor".  Reviews already settled in this village are warm and grateful.  Residents note that the territory is extremely beautiful.  In addition, the developer shows excellent dynamics.  Also clearly marked is the "club" type of complex. </p><p>  Residents get ownership of land, the size of which begins with nine acres.  But you can replenish your own land fund.  The houses are necessarily prepared, they are well finished.  Thick half-meter brick walls reliably stand on a monolith of reinforced concrete foundation.  The roofs are made of natural tiles.  About the windows have already been said - it's just the "nail" of the whole wonderful program.  But not only mansard glasses are good cottages.  Each house also has a veranda, an office, a room for games and relaxation, a sauna. </p>

    <h2>  Offer No. 1 </h2><p>  On nine hundred parts cottages from two hundred twenty five square meters are offered.  The price for this class of housing is low - 12,880,000 rubles.  Given the excellent location, ecological cleanliness and natural diversity, proximity to St. Petersburg, magnificent architectural monuments and museum complexes, the comfort of this village, the prices are even underestimated. </p><p>  Many buyers, which is why at first they do not trust the quality of the buildings.  But everything is explained simply.  The developer is a Chinese company.  But it is worth noting that it does not offer consumer goods to customers.  They have everything calculated.  For all representatives of the company can report.  The property of the homeowner receives all communications that are necessary for a comfortable life.  The improvement of the territory, its fence, the developer also took over.  And he clearly does his job. </p>

    <h2>  Offer No. 2 </h2><p>  Cottages located on eighteen hundred square meters have different sizes: from three hundred and a half to four hundred and a half square meters.  That is, they are twice as large as the previous ones.  However, their price is not multiplied by two - it is significantly lower.  Large houses with huge plots cost from 15.3 million to 16.5 million rubles.  It is because of this discrepancy that large cottages are being bought up much faster.  Although, in principle, the Mariinsky Manor does not keep ready-made houses for a long time. </p><p>  The cottage village reviews were very enthusiastic, because everything is being built here on time and sold much faster.  Moreover, there is an installment plan for the purchase of real estate if the down payment is thirty-five percent.  It is issued at 12% per annum, and the debt must be paid within sixty months.  Many took advantage of this offer because the "Mariinsky Manor" is fabulously good.  The photos presented in the article will not be able to convey all the advantages, but even their impressions are very bright. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Sales of cottages in the "Mariinsky estate" are on the move, which is somewhat strange for the sold housing of such a high class.  According to locals, the development of the village itself is also not in place: they quickly built and go on sale houses of the second stage, the territory is being improved before our eyes.  In addition, internal alleys are laid and the access road is well-repaired.  The minus, according to residents, is the only one: too many households.  One hundred and fifty families for the business class - this, according to the locals, is a bit much. </p><p>  The impression of this village is the most favorable.  Residents say that there are very neatly built cottages, the general improvement is on top.  In 2013, it was not in vain that this place was recognized as the best in its market segment.  The first phase has already been sold.  At the same time, not only the second, but also the third and fourth are being built.  There are not too many competitors at the Mariinsky Manor, since the price tags are low, especially for houses still under construction.  The declared quality at such a cost in our time seems impossible. </p>

    <h2>  Some more opinions </h2><p>  August 2012 was the beginning of sales of finished cottages.  There are thirty-eight in the first turn.  Lots are almost all sold out.  Communications failed: there is electricity, water, natural gas, sewage, Internet, landline telephone, digital television.  Thirty percent cottages of the second stage are ready.  There are forty-three of them. </p><p>  Residents really like that the landscape is actively taking shape here - about two hundred trees have already been planted.  These are high spherical lindens, oaks and arborvitae.  The developers killed two birds with one stone: they decorated the territory, and at the same time created a hedge along each road.  Swans flew to the lake in the center of the village, they liked it there.  The plans include the construction of a supermarket, a medical center, a pharmacy, a restaurant and a sports complex with a swimming pool, as well as a spa and kindergarten. </p>

    <h2>  Fine little things </h2><p>  Not only residents of the Mariinsky Manor will disappear on excursions to nearby attractions.  Here in the village there is such an excellent infrastructure complex that, perhaps, many tourists will want to visit these places.  Already today, many residents of Pavlovsk and Pushkin come here.  Even the inhabitants of more remote areas, villages of the region and cottage villages use one hundred kinds of various services.  Among them - anti-aging procedures, alternative treatment from Chinese healers.  Even a guest house for animals in the village is provided. </p>

    <h2>  Information from the developer </h2><p>  A few years ago, this village would be called elite, thereby inflating prices as high as possible.  However, the Chinese investor is different from its Russian counterparts.  He absolutely correctly assesses the market prospects and its current state.  The ratio of price and quality levels in this village can give odds to almost all objects of economy and business class.  Rich appearance, brick walls, a complete modern set of communications will delight potential buyers. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  It may well be that this place is the only village that has such good consumer qualities.  Only the nuances of the projects of the cottages themselves raise some questions, since much looks at least unusual: spaces by cubic capacity and height are huge, especially living rooms, which even seemed somewhat hypertrophied. </p><p>  On the wealth of infrastructure, there is also the question: "At whose expense does it operate?"  In other villages (of varying degrees of elite), almost all Napoleonic projects of public spaces and infrastructure sooner or later turned into new cottages.  Will it not be here?  Not yet known.  But in general, the village is excellent, although at first glance the project will appeal to lovers of the imperial past most of all. </p>
