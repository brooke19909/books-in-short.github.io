    <p>  On April 13, 1963, Baku announced the infant cry of the future chess champion.  Parents, Weinstein Kim Moiseevich and Kasparyan Klara Shagenovna, were immensely happy.  Both were people of engineering specialties, but loved to while away evenings, playing chess. </p><p>  Little Garik Kasparov (a chess player in the future) from an early age demonstrated a remarkable mind and grasped everything on the fly.  Unbeknownst to everyone, a curious kid watched the chess battles of mom and dad, absorbing all sorts of tricks and decisions into himself like a sponge.  Once, quite unexpectedly, at the age of 5, he suggested a way out of the chess problem, over which parents were puzzling.  At this moment, Kim Moiseevich saw in the son of the future champion. </p><p>  In 1970, after the death of his father, a small chess lover begins to visit a section of the local Palace of Pioneers.  In the first year of study receives 3rd grade and he opens the way to international competitions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From this moment, constant trips begin.  Kasparov (a chess player), whose nationality is Jewish from birth, at that time had a sonorous surname Weinstein.  His mother understood that it would be quite difficult for him to achieve success in chess activities.  And in 1974, the name changed to Kasparov.  Now, little Garik is an Armenian.  Now this position may seem strange, but at that time it was the only right decision.  Anti-Semitic persecution would hardly have allowed a Jew to win and gain fame in chess. </p><h2>  The first victories of a young chess player </h2>

    <p>  Starting a career for a little chess player was quite easy.  Success was accompanied by a talented child.  In 1973, in Vilnius, at the All-Union Youth Games, Kasparov the chess player acquires a mentor in the person of master of sports Alexander Nikitin.  Conquered by his young talent, Nikitin gives him a recommendation to enter the school of an in-depth study of chess art under the supervision of <span>Mikhail Botvinnik.</span>  Without thinking twice, in the same year, Garik and his mother went to Dubna, where she entered the training without any problems.  After some time, Botvinnik himself notices the boy and takes him under his wing, providing all kinds of support. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A year later, Kasparov - a chess player with a capital letter - for the first time becomes a participant in the youth championship of the USSR.  This time he takes only 7th place, which enthuses the observers, because the age of the other participants is at least 6 years ahead of the age of a small chess player.  The following year, the stubborn child returns to the tournament and wins a brilliant victory.  At this moment, young talents are noticed by the highest circles in the game of chess, and since then they have not taken a close look, following the achievements of young Garik. </p><p>  Already at the age of 15, having received a master of sports in chess, a brilliant child participates in the selection to the country's major league.  And again he wins.  In 1980, at a regular tournament in Baku, chess player Garry Kasparov received the title of grandmaster, defeating Igor Zaitsev, the coach of his future opponent Anatoly Karpov. </p><h2>  The fight of two "K" for the title of "World Champion" </h2>

Kasparov ceases to be the world champion, but only officially. </p><p>  After losing, Harry Kimovich, being a multifaceted personality, is not particularly sad and continues to take part in various chess tournaments and championships for another 5 years.  Naturally, winning numerous victories. </p><p>  And <span>on March 10,</span> 2005, he suddenly announced his intention to end his career as a chess player.
