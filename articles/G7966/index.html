    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cost of living in a 3 * Honey Resort hotel <span>(Phuket, Thailand)</span> includes breakfast only.  They pass in the hotel restaurant.  In general, tourists considered them standard for budget <span>hotels in Thailand.</span>  So, in the morning you can eat fried eggs, omelettes, boiled eggs, bacon, pastries, soup, vegetables and fruits.  Throughout the day, guests can also eat at the Hani Resort.  However, many preferred to eat outside the hotel, especially since there is no shortage of cafes and mobile food stalls. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists staying at Honey Resort 3 * (Phuket), their beach holiday was a success!  So, the nearest <span>Kata</span> Beach to the hotel is just a five-minute walk.  Also, if desired, travelers can visit Karon Beach.  You can walk to it in a hurry in 15-20 minutes.  According to our compatriots, many of them liked Kata beach more, since there are not many people on it.  In addition, there are not such big waves that tourists who come to rest with children will like it.  All beaches are municipal property.  For the rental of sunbeds and umbrellas, you must pay.  However, if you wish, you can always sit on a mat or towel directly on a small, pleasant sand.  All beaches have a lot of cafes and bars where you can eat or refresh with your favorite drink. </p>
