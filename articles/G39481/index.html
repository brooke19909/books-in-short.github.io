    <p>  Protaras is a vibrant town that stretches along the famous Fig Tree Bay.  The tourism business has been actively developing here for the past three decades.  Therefore, at present Protaras has become one of the main resorts in all of Cyprus. </p><p>  The bay mentioned by us can rightfully boast the best beaches in the entire region.  Here you can spend days on end splashing in the clear and calm waters, enjoying fruit cocktails and basking in the sun in the smallest sand.  Supporters of secluded relaxation can relax on a rocky island, which a good swimmer can easily reach without a boat.  In addition, tourists in Protaras cannot fail to please the promenade along the coast with a length of 15 kilometers, along which many shops, picturesque houses are built. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to get to the resort? </h2><p>  Protaras has a convenient location in terms of traffic intersection.  The resort can be reached quite quickly from Ayia Napa, which is only ten kilometers away.  Even taxi services will not cost tourists so much.  In addition, municipal buses and minibuses regularly run between cities. </p><h2>  Resort Climate </h2><p>  When planning a vacation, tourists are certainly interested in what the weather is like in Protaras.  The resort itself is surrounded on all sides by beautiful cliffs and is located in the bay, so there are no winds.  Even in January, the temperature never drops below +17 <sup>0</sup> , and the water cools down only to +15 <sup>0</sup> . In the summer, the air warms up to +27 <sup>0</sup> , and the water - up to +23 <sup>0</sup> . The season lasts from April to October.  The temperature maximum can be observed in August and July (up to +40 <sup>0</sup> ).  But since the resort is located in the coastal area, the heat is not felt, it is mitigated by sea breezes.  The weather in Protaras is incredibly comfortable for relaxing. </p>

    <p>  Thanks to its excellent location, the resort has an excellent climate and beautiful nature.  Numerous bays with clear clear water attract thousands of tourists.  In Protaras, the ebbs and flows are virtually invisible, as in the entire Mediterranean Sea.  The water level has very slight fluctuations (30-40 centimeters).  In the mornings, the beaches are a bit smaller, and in the evening a little deeper. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Protaras does not have as many historical places and sights as other Cyprus resorts, but there are still interesting places here.  For example, you can visit the plain of windmills, painted white, with which once the inhabitants watered their land. </p>

    <p>  You can also visit the Agios Elias Church, built on a high cliff.  She has a great story.  And after sunset, the building is transformed, dressing up in the lights of festive illumination.  From a cliff, a stunning panoramic view of the whole city opens.  The resort center has many local guides who can offer you a variety of excursions to nearby cities. </p><h2>  Hotel Amore: reviews </h2><p>  Having a conversation about the hotel, I would definitely like to mention the reviews of tourists who managed to visit it.  Amore Hotel Apts 3 * has an excellent reputation among vacationers.  Of course, the complex is not new, some rooms have long been in need of repair, but they are well equipped.  All apartments have their own kitchen, which is very convenient.  Many tourists (especially with young children) prefer to cook breakfast and lunch on their own, and visit the nearest cafes for dinner.  You can buy products in shops and supermarkets.  There are no problems with this.  It should be noted that the kitchen area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rooms is fully equipped with dishes and all the necessary items for cooking. </p>

    <p>  In general, the rooms are cozy and well decorated, with balconies overlooking a quiet garden or the sea coast.  There are no extraneous noises; nothing prevents tourists from fully relaxing and resting. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  What is a good holiday in Cyprus?  The resort hotels are incredibly diverse in terms of pricing and the services offered, but all of them are aimed at a quiet, relaxing family vacation with children.  Perhaps it will seem a little boring to the youth here, but it is very good to relax with the kids here. </p><p>  The whole city seems to live a measured and calm life, not rushing anywhere.  And this is his special charm.  Protaras is the dream of any resident of a metropolis who in ordinary life never leaves the frenzied rhythm.  And here you can relax and just enjoy the spa life.  This also applies to the hotel, located in a quiet area.  Within walking distance there are several beaches with fine sand and comfortable gentle slopes.  The water is always warm, and the weather is calm, so you can safely bathe even the smallest vacationers.  In principle, active tourists can travel all the beaches of the town and choose a favorite for themselves. </p><p>  You can rent a car at the hotel, it will be much more comfortable and faster to see all the surroundings, as well as go to nearby cities, such as the Ayia Napu entertainment center. </p><p>  The tourism business in Cyprus is developing to this day, offering its tourists all new entertainment and hotels in local resorts.  Every year, the level of service becomes higher, and the choice of hotels is greater, which attracts guests of various categories and financial opportunities to rest. </p>

    <p>  I would like to pay special attention to the staff of the complex.  According to tourists, Amore Hotel Apts 3 * has excellent and attentive staff.  An important factor is the knowledge of the Russian language of almost all the service staff.  Therefore, maids are always very easy to explain.  The rooms are cleaned efficiently and daily.  Bed linens and towels in the hotel are new, without defects and signs of long operation.  Hotel guests are very pleased with the attitude of the staff and the service, noting the friendliness and hospitality of the workers. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Cyprus is a great place to relax.  The tourism business has been established here for a long time.  Tourists enjoy a wide selection of numerous local resorts.  If you are looking for a quiet place for a relaxing holiday, then Protaras is exactly what you need.  Here you will be able to have a good rest away from noisy discos and night clubs and at the same time make your children healthy.  No wonder the city is considered to be a children's resort.  And at the same time, the proximity of Ayia Napa allows active vacationers not to get bored. </p><p>  Amore Hotel Apts 3 * is a good option for an economical vacation.  The hotel has several significant advantages: proximity to the sea, quiet residential area and the availability of kitchens in the rooms.  Proponents of a budget vacation will appreciate it, because for an acceptable amount you can have a good rest with the whole family. </p>
