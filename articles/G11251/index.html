The hotel has a host of advantages over other establishments.  For their guests, staff during the day four times organizes a free shuttle service to the city center. </p><p>  The convenient location of the hotel allows you to independently reach the most interesting places in the region.  But if desired, the staff will offer you travel services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eureka-reservation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Green area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complex" class="if uuid-3210570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3210570.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews, Radisson Blu Resort Sharjah and other hotels of this chain provide a very convenient service called "express laundry."  As a rule, people come to rest for more than two days.  Therefore, there is always a need for washing clothes, especially if you come with children.  In this case, you will like the quick wash of things.  Ready dry laundry is returned to you after three hours. </p><p>  Each room has a telephone.  If you have any questions and want to talk with the concierge, just press the quick service button on the telephone.  For the convenience of tourists, a quick and late check-out service is available at the reception. </p><h2>  Organization of meetings </h2><p>  Radisson Blu Sharjah 5 * (United Arab Emirates) offers its services in organizing various events.

In the walls of the hotel you will find halls for a different number of guests.  The Moroccan hall, made in the Arabic style, is usually used to organize wedding parties.  The hotel has everything you need to organize a great holiday. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  If you want to have a good rest, Radisson Blu Resort Sharjah (UAE, Sharjah) may be exactly the place you are looking for.  The complex has everything you need for a wonderful holiday. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eureka-reservation.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Number of rooms" class="if uuid-3210571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3210571.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel has a gym, gym, two tennis courts, a massage parlor.  The complex has four pools in which a certain temperature of water is maintained.  For kids organized a children's entertainment area.  Everyone has the opportunity to visit the sauna or play table tennis. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  A huge advantage of the Radisson Blu Resort Sharjah 5 * (UAE) is its own sandy beach.  Vacationers who live in cottages by the pool have a separate exit to the coast. </p><h2>  How good is the hotel? </h2><p>  Continuing the conversation about the Radisson Blu Resort Sharjah 5 * (Sharjah), I want to turn to reviews to find out how good it is.  It is worth saying that most of the tourists are very pleased to stay at the hotel.  Of course, the hotel complex has its flaws, but they are not so significant, so vacationers characterize it from the best side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Pools" class="if uuid-3210568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3210568.jpg"></div><p>  According to tourists, the hotel has a very good location.  It is located near Sharjah Airport, so there is no need to take a long bus ride.  The main hotel building has stunning views, especially at night.  It resembles a sail illuminated by lights.  The hotel can not be called new.  It was built a long time ago and has since been very successfully hosting guests. </p><p>  The interior of the building, the high dome, gilding and other elements of luxury are impressive.  It can be seen that once the hotel was amazingly beautiful and luxurious.  Now he no longer has that gloss and splendor, and yet he is impressive.  According to some tourists, the hotel needs to be renovated, but in general the internal condition of the premises and their decoration are acceptable. </p><p>  High ratings of vacationers give reason to recommend it for a vacation. </p><h2>  Reviews about the number of rooms </h2><p>  According to reviews, Radisson Blu Sharjah offers a variety of accommodation in comfortable rooms.  The apartments of the complex are not new, but are maintained in very good condition.  Tourists note that the rooms have everything you need.  All appliances and plumbing are functioning properly.  Among the shortcomings, the absence of balconies and non-opening windows should be highlighted.  Outdoor terraces are available only in higher categories.  All other rooms are deprived of such a convenient and necessary accessory.  Many guests do not like the fact that the rooms cannot be ventilated.  Since the windows do not open, air conditioning has to be saved.  Some rooms have a musty smell of dampness, which is easily explained by the lack of proper ventilation of the room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.groupon.ae" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Room Interiors" class="if uuid-3210577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3210577.jpg"></div><p>  According to tourists, apartment cleaning leaves much to be desired.  All glasses and mirrors are stained and handwritten.  Floors are not perfect either.  The furniture is in good condition, but with traces of scuffs and chips.  All tourists emphasize that the hotel has long been in need of repair and updating.  The rest of the room is quite acceptable for living.  If you come to swim and sunbathe, then the hotel will suit you. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  As for food, the opinion of tourists is mixed.  It is worth noting that it is the question of food that usually causes a lot of controversy.  Some vacationers are satisfied with the quality and variety of dishes, while others are not.  The price includes two meals: breakfast and lunch (or dinner).  You choose your second meal of your own free will.  The staff doesn't care if you have lunch or dinner.  But you must warn about your choice in advance. </p><p>  At breakfast, a standard set is usually provided: eggs, toasts, jams, yoghurts, croissants, fresh oatmeal and more.  For dinner and lunch, a lot of fish, beef and chicken.  Numerous salads and vegetables are also offered.  Some tourists note that the dishes are very fatty and spicy.  But pastries and sweets are praised by all, without exception.  Fine light cakes and pastries taste amazing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="liliatravel.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Event area" class="if uuid-3210582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3210582.jpg"></div><p>  There are always a lot of guests in the dining room, and the staff cannot cope, so you have to call people to clean the table.  By the way, nothing can be taken out of the restaurant.  This is closely monitored by workers.  In general, the food is quite decent.  Sometimes there are difficulties with feeding children, because local food is unusual for babies. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  According to tourists, the hotel complex makes a good impression.  True, some vacationers note that the hotel does not deserve five stars, so the cost of rooms in it is overpriced. </p><p>  Of course, the hotel has its drawbacks, but do not forget about the advantages.  The hotel is a little away from the city, a walk to the central promenade with a quick step takes at least an hour.  The transfer saves the situation, thanks to which you can get to the main shopping centers of the city and other interesting places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="liliatravel.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Recreation Areas" class="if uuid-3210581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3210581.jpg"></div><p>  However, the main advantage of the hotel is its huge private beach.  A hotel site on the coast in the Emirates is a rarity.  The beach is equipped with free sunbeds and umbrellas.  Sometimes it is crowded if people are brought from other hotels.  This also happens regularly.  But a place on the coast can always be found.  It is especially pleasant to relax in the shade of trees.  In general, the hotel has a large and very green area.  According to tourists, it looks like a green oasis on the coast.  To the left of the hotel is the port, but it does not bother travelers.  The water in the sea is always clean and warm, so beach vacations are at their best. </p><h2>  A few words about the staff </h2><p>  The hotel staff makes a good impression.  There are many Russian-speaking workers.  At the reception, the attendants are always attentive and friendly, if necessary, they will show and tell everyone.  Therefore, difficulties do not arise, even if your English is far from perfect.  The staff settles immediately upon arrival, whenever you arrive at the hotel. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  If you want to relax on the coast in a hotel that has its own beach, Radison Blu could be a good option.  Small disadvantages of the hotel are more than compensated by its advantages. </p>
