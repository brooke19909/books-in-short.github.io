Real estate agency</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An initiative exclusively demanded by the population and useful for the infrastructure of large cities is the opening in 2008 of the first Moscow agency Arend Arendovich.  Reviews of his work were at first most sympathetic, but now there is no certainty in the assessments.  The creators positioned their activities as a revolution in rental housing, guaranteed transparency and civilization of their presence in the market.  It must be said bluntly that not everything turned out, Arend Arendovich failed.  Reviews are especially loud about this in the regions. </p>

    <h2>  Position and reality </h2><p>  The goal set and the mission voiced by the leadership of the agency are very convincing, it remains only to follow this goal and fulfill the mission in good faith.  Nevertheless, the improvement and popularization of the Internet service and the implemented model of relations with the client and the state turned out to be insufficiently effective.  On the contrary, there is no longer a social network where numerous groups would not be created, exposing the dishonesty of the Arend Arendovich organization. </p><p>  Reviews flow in an ongoing stream, and few positive assessments of activity are issued clearly not from the heart, but under duress.  This is evidenced by the insincerity of the syllable, and the "duty" phrases.  The task of daily assistance to people in solving housing rental issues posed by the agency is not fulfilled - there is neither quality, nor speed, nor benefit.  But there are numerous frauds of clients by the Arendovich agency, reviews literally shout about it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Claimed benefits </h2><p>  The company's management claims three key points that provide an absolute advantage in the real estate market.  This is a triple saving of client money, which is guaranteed by a real estate agency, together with contractual obligations and a guarantee of settlement.  This is the exemption of the client from any kind of hassle, since it provides quick access to one and a half thousand of the freshest options for choosing housing in any city where the agency branches work.  And this is a time saver, because the client settles in rented housing literally within fifteen minutes (this is a record), a maximum of a week later. </p><p>  In all cities where this real estate agency is present, the formation of the most voluminous quantitative and relevant quality databases is promised.  To do this, we use our own software and special technologies that make it possible to instantly notify the tenant about the appearance of new facilities that meet the requirements, control the quality of the information provided and analyze each service in detail. </p>

    <h2>  Promises to Customers </h2><p>  Renting a house is a troublesome, long business, taking away a lot of nerves, time and effort, which is why people are willing to entrust the search for options to various agencies that have a high-quality database of owners.  As a result, clients from the entire array of offers can choose what is consistent with all the parameters of their requests.  The cost of services is fixed and is not tied to the cost of rental housing.  If the selected option for some reason did not suit the client, then there is a guarantee for sixty days.  That is, the employees of ‚ÄúArendovich Rent‚Äù will find a replacement for the bad choice for free. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, other opportunities were promised to the customers: conclusion of a contract for the future, in advance - up to one year, if the search would be necessary after some time.  Search for objects in other cities where the Arend Arendovich company is represented.  All transactions should have legal support.  Professional support and free consultations were also promised. </p>

    <h2>  How it all began </h2><p>  In November 2008, the creation of a full-cycle agency with the specialization of long-term leases was completed, all the well-known beautiful names of the companies were listed, and one was chosen - Arendovich.  But the Internet service was fully launched only in May 2013, and the population should have received the full provision of information services.  Then all the administrative departments were formed, values, mission, tasks and goals were developed.  Management and marketing were supposed to meet European quality standards.  It all started so well! </p><p>  In June 2013, sales offices were sequentially opened in Saratov (where a lot of negative reviews come from today), in Volgograd (where the absolutely terrible quality of customer service and outright financial fraud was noted), in Ufa (where social networks get a huge amount of resentment about the company) as well as Perm, Voronezh, Chelyabinsk, Omsk (and there is no city from which angry reviews would not come).  All this means that beautiful company names do not help if it is not possible for the company to remain honest and follow the ideals it has drawn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Priorities </h2><p>  Many reviews indicate that the quality of customer service is not important for the work of the company, and in the priorities only significant relief of visitors' wallets.  A good name probably helped build the image of the agency.  After a few years, this turned out to be a ready-made and successful business with perfectly debugged processes that bring monthly profits.  Now the company is the largest on a federal scale, a prominent partner in the sales market, not afraid to quickly expand its business area. </p><p>  Leasing housing is now not the only direction, sales departments are considered the main departments, and reviews are sent to them much less frequently (and the percentage of negative ones is very small).  But innovation in the sale of franchises has a very wide resonance on the Internet.  It was thanks to this method that numerous branches appeared in the cities of Russia and the CIS countries.  The company has developed to its full potential: agents are trained in their own training center, the company has recruiting, an analytical department, advertising, public relations and much more.  But it is precisely on a rental basis that the Arend Arendovich company receives overwhelmingly negative reviews. </p><h2>  Reviews from Voronezh </h2><p>  Almost in every note there is an assumption that a few positive reviews were written by the Arendovich employees themselves.  Indeed, one can suspect this.  They are written with one hand.  And real people who do not hide their contact information write in specially created groups on social networks that none of the actual clients would write such words.  Because the apartments exhibited by the company on its own behalf in most cases simply do not exist. </p><p>  The realtor gives the client one or two phone numbers that never answer, and if they answer, the landlord will never find a minute to meet and show housing.  Moreover, the contract has already been concluded and the Arendovich loan has taken the money!  The database has very meager options, mostly copied from the database of other companies (for example, Avito, and deceived customers have proven several such cases).  According to reviews, in Voronezh the company's agents do not work with the owners on their own! </p>

    <h2>  Reviews from Krasnodar </h2><p>  On Krasnaya Street, in the house 160 there is a quite respectable Arend Arendovich office, but the whole city community does not recommend contacting them for help.  In city forums, the word "scam" in relation to the work of this agency is the most tender.  The companies that were in the hands of the agents note that, first of all, the customer is processed in the spirit of well-known network sales.  However, even the notorious ‚ÄúHerbalife‚Äù did not go down to direct insults from colleagues from other offices. </p><p>  Arend Arendovich, however, does not consider all realtors unrelated to him to be professionals, and blames him for his eagerness and dishonesty.  After that, the client puts out at least five thousand rubles for the execution of the contract and future assistance, which will never be returned back under any circumstances.  And help doesn‚Äôt come either.  Information is provided, but they do not bear the slightest responsibility, and the contract is legally drawn up in such a way that it is impossible to dig in from one side ‚Äî the client is always wrong. </p><h2>  Reviews from Volgograd </h2><p>  In Volgograd, the Arend Arendovich agency is frankly called scammers.  The deception scheme used there is simple.  First, clients rely on promises of rental assistance with a variety of options with reasonable prices and suitable conditions.  A prepayment is charged for the services, which will not be returned to the client in case of failure.  Instead, the client receives multiple addresses and phone numbers.  No one can be found at the addresses. </p><p>  No one answers the phone.  In rare cases, the same girl reports that the apartment has already been rented out.  The company database contains copies of addresses from city sites of free ads, which, in principle, the entire Internet is literally littered with.  There are hundreds of such reviews in the city and in social networks, and maybe even thousands.  It‚Äôs even impossible to assume that Arendovich companies are harmed by competitors.  No, it‚Äôs simply impossible to harm. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews from Samara </h2><p>  This is the only city that has tried to fight deception.  And it worked out there!  A real campaign was conducted on social networks with investigations, copies of documents, testimonies of defrauded clients, with photos and videos attached.  Even former employees of the company were found, interviewed and did not refuse to testify against the Arend Arendovich agency. </p><p>  Former employees admitted that the addresses located in the database are completely "fake", "left".  Information about rented or not rented apartments is not true.  The heat of indignation among the population was so great that State Duma deputies became interested in the company, and a criminal case was instituted against the Samara branch of the agency: Article 159, Part 1 (fraud).  The total damage (only discovered) caused by the victims exceeded fifty thousand rubles. </p><h2>  How it was </h2><p>  The deceived clients did not hesitate to ask the deputy for help, after which the prosecutor‚Äôs audit of the Arend Arendovich agency began.  As it turned out, the deception scheme was exactly the same as in all other cities.  Agency employees were lured by clients who, for a certain amount (usually a little more or less than five thousand rubles), were waiting for help in renting an apartment.  The company was supposed to provide the client with options suitable for his conditions.  None of the options worked, but the agency did not return money to customers. </p><p>  After the prosecutor‚Äôs audit began, the number of clients affected by the actions of the client‚Äôs agency grew day by day.  Documents, contracts, receipts were kept by more than a dozen deceived people, as a result of which a criminal case was opened.  It seems that the company must draw appropriate conclusions and correct the situation.  You can‚Äôt treat clients like that! </p>

    <h2>  Help for seekers </h2><p>  You can quite easily check the quality of filling the database of any agency working with the use of information technology, and find out how real the proposed apartments are.  To do this, move the mouse cursor over the desired photo and call up the menu with the right button.  Then select "Open in a new tab", and after completing this operation, call up the menu again.  Select "Find on the Internet (Yandex). After that, the Internet will give all the information about this photo, all the links to all sites where this photo has ever been posted. </p><p>  In this way, it was determined that without exception the pictures presented by the Arendovich Agency in Samara were downloaded from the Internet (by the way, not only this company acts this way).  That‚Äôs why the same photo walks on various sites - from Moscow to Voronezh, from Ashgabat to Saratov, but in fact even this apartment may not exist in nature. </p>
