    <p>  However, one more question remains relevant: "Which microwave to choose, and what to look for first?"  Because besides the external characteristics and qualities, there are other distinctive parameters that determine the choice of a microwave device. </p><h2>  Difficulty choosing </h2><p>  Before marking the rating of microwave ovens, we determine what exactly the functions of the device should have.  In total, there are three categories of such devices that differ in principle of operation. </p><p>  Types of microwave ovens: </p><ul><li>  solo devices (microwave only); </li><li>  TEN`ovye or quartz grills with microwave waves; </li><li>  grill + convection + microwave. </li></ul><p>  The first option is well suited for the usual thawing of foods and heating food.  For heating, it is not necessary to add oil, as is the case with a frying pan.  Microwave (microwave) waves make the molecules in food move much faster, so the dish turns out to be almost as aromatic and rich as recently cooked, and the thawed preservative remains fresh. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After reviewing the rating of <span>microwave ovens</span> with a grill, you can choose a device that will help you fry meat, chicken or fish.  In addition, such ovens do a good job of cooking pizza and other types of dishes, where it is necessary to preserve to the maximum extent all the nutrients. </p><p>  Naturally, the best <span>microwave oven</span> (rating is indicated below) has both a grill function and convection modes.  Such devices do an excellent job of preparing fragrant baked goods, due to well-distributed hot air throughout the structure.  More or less sensible convection microwave ovens (a quality rating will be presented to your attention in the article) may well compete with the taste characteristics of the resulting baked goods, as if it were cooked in a specialized oven. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, before you take your money to the store cashier, think about how you will use your microwave oven.  If you need a machine that we will warm up sausages, coffee and rolls in the mornings, then a microwave with a large set of functions is completely useless to you.  But when you plan to cook a variety of dishes, doing this often and seriously, then for you the rating of <span>microwave ovens</span> with grill and convection functions.  In addition, the price difference between a conventional microwave oven and a multifunctional device is noticeable at a glance: more modes and features - a higher price tag. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is also not superfluous to clarify for yourself what exactly the distinctive characteristics of the microwave oven you like have.  Reviews, rating of the best models and expert opinions are on the one hand, but you need to take into account parameters such as weight, dimensions, location of the ventilation hole and other factors.  Only after you thoroughly examine and weigh everything, you can go directly to the choice of stove. </p><p>  Top rated microwave ovens: </p><ol><li>  VVK 23MWG-923M / BX. </li><li>  LG MB 4342 BS. </li><li>  Bosch HMT 84G461. </li><li>  Sharp R-8771LK. </li><li>  Curting KMI 925 CX. </li><li>  Siemens HF25G5L2. </li></ol><p>  Let's consider each model in more detail. </p><h2>  BBK 23MWG-923M / BX </h2><p>  The model is included in the rating of microwave ovens due to the good volume of the camera (23 l) and the optimum power of 900 watts.  The device feels great both when working with microwave waves and with a grill.  Management takes place using convenient mechanical switches. </p>
