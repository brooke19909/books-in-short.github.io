This state of affairs was due to the fact that people possessed a relatively small amount of knowledge, the basis of which could be studied in life.  But since then, scientific diversity has increased significantly.  A need arose for a classification and separation system.  The result of need and progress are the branches of modern science.  They are engaged in everything that a person has to meet, starting from psychology and particles, and ending with material entities and global processes.  Specialized branches of science allow us to study the available facts as deeply as possible and draw correct theoretical conclusions on their basis.  And these words are true to everything.  For example, the branches of pedagogical science study information and generate data on how to most effectively engage in training at different stages of his life, despite the fact that various information should be taught.  It should be borne in mind that certain aspects and nuances are aimed at solving particular and general, practical and theoretical, narrow and broad problems.  Therefore, in the framework of the article, we will touch on science as a whole and in general by the example of several of the most revealing forms of activity.

As part of the article, we will consider the most popular areas.  These include the natural and humanitarian directions.  They, in turn, can additionally be divided into directions into:

We cannot say that certain branches of science are not important and can be ignored.  This conclusion is most often the result of acquaintance with an unprofessional carrier.  Here we take the psychology of the masses.  Who better to teach her: a successful professional politician (who shares his knowledge with few people) or a full-time university psychologist?  No, among the latter, of course, there are also nuggets, but the first person acts with the greatest efficiency. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Branches of psychological science </h2><p>  Based on the previous words, this is the most logical continuation of the article.  So, they distinguish general, social, age, pedagogical, medical, labor and <span>differential psychology.</span>  In addition to them, there is also psycholinguistics, psychometry and psychophysiology.  All these industries are united by one thing - the psyche.  This is how widespread the application of psychology is.  And this is not surprising - because it is considered one of the backbone and fundamental scientific disciplines.  Many experts believe that her future is at the intersection of disciplines, which now seem relatively distant.  If it is good to know certain branches of psychological science and to learn to understand them, then in the future it will be possible to use it with significant benefit for yourself or your goals.  But simply memorizing here is not enough - careful study and investigation is needed. </p><h2>  Branches of history </h2>

The branches of historical science deal with economics, politics, and the social, civilian and military aspects.  The past of the state, law, religion and other important aspects is also studied.  There is even a family history science that collects ways to learn something new about their family and ancestors.  How to look for information, where to get information - all this is painted and known.  In addition, there are various <span>auxiliary historical disciplines.</span>  Initially, genealogy should be mentioned.  <span>This science</span> is committed to studying the origin and family ties of individuals and families.  There is also a chronology.  She studies information about different calendars and time systems.  Metrology is devoted to measures of volume, length, weight and area used in the past.  Paleography is engaged in the study of ancient letters and manuscripts of past times.

The most positive organization of this issue and its implementation in practice is facilitated by the branch of legal science.  They got their name according to areas of influence.  So, they distinguish: constitutional, administrative, civil, labor, criminal, environmental and family law.  Each of them operates in a strictly defined area and has clearly defined boundaries.  So, <span>environmental law</span> cannot be applied in family matters. </p><h2>  Small digression </h2>

To say that there is a completely independent branch of science is possible only with certain reservations.  Take, for example, psychology, economics and ecology.  Is there a relationship between them?  Consider a small example: if a person has a low cultural level, then he will not carry out economic activities optimally, because of which the environment will suffer and the general standard of living will deteriorate.  This, in turn, will negatively affect psychological health.  And, as the end result, the cultural level suffers, and the cycle begins again.  Therefore, it should be remembered that everywhere has its own points of contact.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter which disciplines of science are considered.  Industries are closely related.  As a simplified example, we can recall the ancient scientist mentioned at the beginning of the article, who was the bearer of all existing knowledge.

    <h2>  Sectors of the economy </h2><p>  They study various aspects of economic activity.  These include: macroeconomics, microeconomics, the history of economic thought, advertising, management, supply and other working moments.  Using economics as an example, it is best to show the relationship that exists between different disciplines.  So, the state of the economic sector, both at the enterprise level and on a national scale, depends on management.  From the legislative, executive and judicial powers depends on how convenient it is to engage in economic activity.  And their number and activity depends on the comfort for entrepreneurs (read - providing national and state needs). </p><h2>  About chemistry, biology and physics </h2>

So, there is biochemistry, biophysics and a number of other combinations that study a certain field.  An additional example is physical chemistry.  It should be understood that there are narrower specializations.  Very broad, as an example of which chemical physics can be given.  In general, the complex that was created on the basis of these three sciences is so wide that it will take a considerable amount of time to describe it, which, alas, we do not have.

They have entered our lives so much that they are no longer paid attention.  And here numerous branches of science are intertwined.  Technicians, in order to understand various sciences, study, in addition to the previously mentioned physics, electronics, computer science, mechanics, thermodynamics, cybernetics, mechatronics, robotics and other similar disciplines.  And this is not surprising - because a person already works almost on the verge of his capabilities.  Therefore, the future lies with artificial creations.  True, there is such a feature - the study of only one thing does not allow you to create complex structures.  So, for the construction of even primitive constructions, one should know at least radio electronics, which, as you might guess, is a synthesized discipline.  And if we consider the creation of a robot?  Oh, yes, we need a whole range of knowledge from mechanics, mechatronics, robotics and electronics.  And this is only a minimum!  If you want to create a more complex robot that can, for example, interact with other electrical devices, then you also need to connect cybernetics, and much more.  Although technical branches exist separately, their effective application in practice is possible only in certain complex combinations.  This must always be considered.

    <h2>  And what awaits us in the future? </h2><p>  Making predictions is a thankless task.  But let's imagine a little what science will be like in a century.  Initially, a trend should be noted, according to which there is a gradual increase in related disciplines, which are based on the contact in a certain area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwo or more areas of study of the surrounding world.  Also recently, more and more often, there is information that the future is at the intersection of sciences.  And these are not just words, they are confirmed by facts.  Take, for example, the existing information transfer services between enterprises and the tax service.  Here you can see how computer science and economics are successfully combined to obtain the greatest effect.  Now imagine that something similar happens in the field of public administration, and in medicine, and in other areas of human activity.  It is easy to conclude that in the future science will bring a large number of advantages to those who will use its achievements most quickly.  Therefore, it is worth paying considerable attention to your intellectual development in order to be the first. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

A person like the ancient philosophers who knows everything is now almost impossible (except thanks to the cybernetic system for downloading information and processing it through various bioelectric implants).  Therefore, at the same time, one can observe how more and more detailed specialization (molecular biology) occurs and at the same time there is a process of increasing the volume of knowledge (the same biochemistry).  What it will ultimately result in is difficult to predict, we can only observe and participate in this process to the best of our ability, thus bringing a calm and confident future closer.
