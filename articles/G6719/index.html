    <h2>  General conclusions </h2><p>  In general, as people who have been vacationing here say, the hotel is perfect for a fruitful, eventful vacation.  In addition, for a modest amount.  For the Dominican Republic, the above-mentioned rates are really small, given that the hotel serves all-inclusive. </p><p>  And the hotel takes a good place.  From here you can go on the most interesting excursions.  For example, on the Samana Peninsula, where you can watch a variety of whales.  Even humpbacked, but this is from January to March.  You can go to the cold waterfalls, jump from a height into the crystal clear water and enjoy the scenery.  Or go on a sightseeing tour of Puerto Plata.  In general, tourists are advised not to forget about the cultural program while in the Dominican Republic.  There is also something to see. </p><p>  By the way, more experienced tourists recommend taking slippers for the sea with them.  The sunset here is not very convenient, sharp.  In addition, sometimes you can stumble upon sea urchins, and this, to put it mildly, is very unpleasant. </p><p>  In general, it is worth going here.  And do not abandon this idea because of the long flight, which takes almost 12 hours.  As many people who doubted precisely for this reason claim, a vacation is worth it. </p>
