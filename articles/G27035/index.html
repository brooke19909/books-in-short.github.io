The main thing is that it is in harmony with the selected embroidery pattern.  Finished work must be consistent with a specific idea.  Simplified patterns of embroidery are usually intended for beginners.  For lovers with experience are subject and very complex images.  Sometimes simple embroidery is no less beautiful than large embroidered paintings.  To create products of small forms, a small number of colors and a stylistic image of a flower are required.  However, a neat cross-stitch made with love looks beautiful anyway. </p><p>  Particularly good are pansies in decorating napkins, tablecloths, small cards, needle beds and biscuits.  Embroiderers with experience decorate clothes with embroidery.  The process itself provides inner satisfaction, the opportunity for self-expression and the creation of something beautiful.  Cross stitching is both difficult and useful.  Those who engage in this type of needlework deserve respect for their dedication and skill. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Thumbnail for postcard or stand </h2><p>  The cross-stitch pattern for Pansies can be found ready-made, bought at a store, or developed independently in any, even the most intricate, color combination that suits your taste. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pansy pattern" class="if uuid-3198390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116843/3198390.jpg"></div><p>  Nature has endowed them with color diversity.

The center should be noted with a water-soluble marker.  For beginner needlewomen, we recommend dividing the fabric into squares, for example, 10x10.  This technique will help not to get confused and not spoil the work.  The same pattern for embroidering ‚ÄúPansies‚Äù with a cross will look great as a framed picture on the wall. </p>
