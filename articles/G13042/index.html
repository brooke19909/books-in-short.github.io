Almost all countries with attractive landscapes, a distinctive culture and a certain set of attractions are open for curious tourists and people who just decided to have a good and tasteful rest.  Greece takes one of the leading places in the list of countries visited by Russians.  Holidays in it are attractive not only for their affordable cost, <span>sunny beaches,</span> rich culture and history, but also for the level of service.  Lambi Hotel on the island of Crete - a place that we will talk about in this article, get acquainted with the detailed description and reviews of tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lambi hotel" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41269/1399904.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Location and surroundings </h2><p>  The administrative center of Crete is the city of Heraklion (or Heraklion, in honor of the mythological hero Heracles).  Six kilometers west of it is the village of Amoudara.  It has the status of a resort area, has access to the sea bay.  It is here, on the second beach line, that the Lambi Hotel is located. </p><p>  Greece, thanks to its rich past, today has quite contrasting landscapes.  So, the historical reliefs and buildings on the island border on the modern achievements of civilization.  For example, in the western part of Amudara village, you can find a power station that gives an urban look to the area.  And outside the hotel along the main street there are several supermarkets interspersed with old architecture and small souvenir shops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can get to the hotel by bus, taxi or rented car.  Depending on the choice of transport, the price will vary. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Externally, ‚ÄúLambi‚Äù - a hotel with adjoining territory - resembles a paradise.  The three-story building with small balconies, dense greenery and well-groomed lawns creates an atmosphere of simplicity, comfort, relaxation and harmony.  The staff is small, so there is no fuss and noise.  The gates of the hotel are guarded, guests are free to explore the territory and surroundings at any time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lambi hotel 3" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41269/1399907.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Inside, the Lambi Hotel boasts exquisite restraint and charm.  Since the status of three stars implies a budget option, a luxurious gloss should not be expected.  The guests are greeted by a friendly reception desk, ready at any time to receive and accommodate guests. </p><p>  As for the rooms, here you can count on the standard classification of single, double and triple relatively spacious rooms.  They are furnished and done in bright colors.  Each includes a TV with satellite TV, central air conditioning, a paid minibar and safe, telephone, hairdryer.  Every day, according to the rules of the hotel, rooms are cleaned.  The service includes meals with a modest menu of dishes.  But this is not the whole list of qualities of service, which may be limited to the description of the hotel.  Lambi Hotel 3 * provides for additional services operating in the territory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Pools </h2><p>  One of these includes outdoor pools (children and adults), which are located in front of the hotel.  The water in them is fresh, regularly cleaned with special filters.  Recreation in the pool is, according to all rules, accompanied by sun loungers, gazebos and umbrellas that save from the sun, as well as a bar with a <span>variety of cocktails</span> and drinks.  For lovers of diving, a small springboard is provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lambi hotel rooms and rates" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41269/1399903.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Restaurants, bars </h2><p>  The gastronomic possibilities, which the hotel with Greek and international cuisine gladly demonstrates, are realized by the main restaurant.  There is a nutritious buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Here you can find three bars on the territory: the lobby and snack bars are located in the hotel building on the ground floor, and the third is located by the pool. </p><p>  Amoudara village is a lively recreation area, so outside the hotel you can find many taverns, eateries and restaurants with a wider and more varied menu and low prices.  For example, the Khing's Asian House restaurant with Thai cuisine is a popular destination for Lambi Hotel guests, and Uncle George's tavern is the leader in terms of service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Services and entertainment </h2><p>  In addition to room service, the service includes convenient parking, medical assistance, laundry and dry cleaning services, as well as a 24-hour convenience store. </p><p>  Lambi Hotel 3 * involves several types of entertainment for guests.  They include: billiards, a disco, live music in a restaurant and a dance floor, animation for those wishing to create a celebration for children and adults, a TV room. </p><p>  However, as the experience of vacationers shows, the greater interest among tourists is caused by the surroundings.  In the heart of Amu Dara there is an entertainment center called Technopolis.  It includes cafes and restaurants, a cinema (in the building and under the open sky), as well as playgrounds.  Films in cinemas are in Greek and English. </p><p>  For active guests, the hotel has table tennis and cycling.  A playground is available for children on site.  Other sports activities can be found on the beach.  They also refer to the service that Lambi Hotel 3 * offers. </p><p>  Crete, due to its reliefs and access to the sea, offers equally fascinating activities on land and on water.  It can be a simple beach volleyball, as well as exciting windsurfing and scooter rides. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lambi hotel 3 crete" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41269/1399902.jpg" width="595"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  The distance from the hotel to the beach is 250 m. Entrance is free, but sun loungers and awnings have to be rented.  The beach is the property of the hotel, therefore, for all technical problems that arise there, the maintenance staff is responsible.  The beach has a shower and changing rooms. </p><p>  About 30 meters from the coast, a stone ridge reaches almost to the surface of the water.  For the open bay of Amudara, it is an excellent breakwater, but for lovers of distant swims it will become a serious obstacle.  If only because the surface of the stones is inhabited by sea urchins. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Lambi Hotel vacation prices are highly dependent on the season and the choice of travel agency.  The period of the largest influx of holidaymakers is the interval from June to September.  The average air temperature in Crete at this time is 27 degrees, and the water temperature is 24 degrees.  Room rates range from 5 thousand rubles and above. </p><p>  <span>A tour</span> usually includes accommodation, flights and transfers.  Approximately 60-70 thousand rubles can cost an average week-long rest (Seven Nights rate) for two people who decide to visit the island of Crete, namely the Lambi Hotel.  Rooms and rates for holidays can be found on the official website of the service or on the pages of travel agencies.  Photo galleries, reviews and summary tables are available for this.  Additional services and entertainment are usually not included in the price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lambi hotel" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41269/1399905.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  But no matter how fabulous it may be on Lambi Hotel brochures and websites, traveler reviews remain the most important selection criteria.  Real ones can be found today, most likely, on thematic forums.  Since on the services of travel agencies there is a possibility of encountering so-called ‚Äúfake‚Äù comments. </p><p>  So, sunny Greece, Lambi Hotel 3 * in particular, in the eyes of vacationing Russians were not as hospitable, neat and helpful as in the stories of travel agents.  Although any resort can find its skeptic, it is still worth considering the advantages and disadvantages that vacationers noted. </p><h2>  pros </h2><ul><li>  Tourists ‚Äúwith experience‚Äù say that in Greece, as in any other country, you can encounter services of different levels.  Of course, everything will depend on what budget the vacationer has.  The island of Crete is no exception.  Lambi Hotel is only one of the few that meets its category of cosiness and comfort. </li><li>  Check-in occurs immediately upon arrival, without unnecessary crush and waiting.  The food in the restaurant is varied, tasty and satisfying, the products are fresh, and the prices are quite consistent.  There are a large number of fish and meat dishes, salads, a wide selection of pastries, desserts.  If for some reason the guests skip lunch, the staff carefully packs them in a lanchbasket paper bag so that the guests do not remain hungry. </li><li>  The bars are especially fond of.  The staff is charming and smiling, the variety of drinks and cocktails is quite wide. </li><li>  The rooms offer scenic views of the pool and landscaped grounds with fruit trees and flower beds.  Near the hotel there are car rental points, taverns, shops. </li><li>  The rooms themselves are comfortable, clean, and the furniture is in good condition.  The base of the beds is cemented, tiles on the floor, bedside tables as if poured into the wall.  The interior is quite discreet, but refined. </li><li>  For those who came to enjoy the sea and the sun, the resources possessed by the three-star Lambi Hotel (Crete) (reviews say) correspond to its category.  And much attention is paid to beach equipment.  Here the opinions are unanimous.  The shore is clean, lifeguards are on duty at the beach, prices in bars and rental points are acceptable. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Tourists with certain requirements nevertheless found a few flaws in this picturesque Greek resort.  These include: </p><ul><li>  Repeatedly in the reviews of visitors there is information that the air conditioning in the rooms is paid.  The bathtub is adapted only for sitting, therefore there is a risk of flying off its high part during the washing process.  Hot water is not always supplied.  As a rule, only in the late afternoon you can take full-fledged water procedures.  This fact sometimes causes inconvenience to people who relax with young children. </li><li>  Wi-Fi only works on the ground floor near the reception.  The router is rather weak, and the signal quality depends on how many people use the Internet in the lobby.  In the period of a large influx (July, August) it is quite difficult to get online. </li><li>  For young people, the lack of noisy entertainment and a SPA salon in Lambi Hotel 3 * is not attractive.  Crete, with its measured course of life, is most likely suitable for couples, with or without children, who want privacy and relaxation from the hustle and bustle. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  The beach was negatively met.  According to tourists, on the golden sand you can bask, walking more than 300 meters from the territory belonging to the hotel.  Otherwise, you have to be content with pebbles, walking on which it is pleasant to not everyone.  To do this, you need to purchase special slippers. </li><li>  And, finally, among the minuses that the Lambi Hotel has, Russian tourists ranked the lack of Russian language proficiency in staff.  Perhaps for vacationers who speak English or Greek, this will not be a significant drawback.  But the resulting <span>language barrier</span> requires the services of a translator, and this is an additional cost. </li></ul>
