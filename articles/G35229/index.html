Faults and repair of LCD TVs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any disturbances in the operation of electronic devices bring concern and discomfort to their owners.  And the appearance of various <span>bands on the</span> TV <span>screen</span> or computer display does not allow you to enjoy viewing the content to the fullest.  What to do if streaks appear on the screen?  To help determine the cause of the occurrence of vertical and horizontal stripes on the TV screen, as well as find out how to fix it, this article will help. </p><h2>  Identification of the nature of the malfunction </h2><p>  First you need to check the reliability of the contact in all connected connectors, check how tightly the wire connectors "sit" in them and whether the connectors themselves are clogged with dust.  Next, go to the TV menu, make a complete reset and automatically adjust the image to eliminate the possibility of software failures.  If after all these manipulations the bands are preserved, then the problem is in the components of the matrix or the TV itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.avsforum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stripes on the tv screen" class="if uuid-3185874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3185874.jpg"></div><p>  As a result of these malfunctions, both vertical and horizontal stripes can appear on the TV screen, since the causes of their occurrence in most cases are the same.  Similar failures happen with all TVs, and products of flagship brands such as Sony, LG, Samsung, Philips and so on are not immune to them.  Whatever their price tag is, it is just equipment subject to both internal and external influences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As mentioned above, a malfunction can manifest itself in various forms.  It can be one or several vertical stripes - black, white or multi-colored;  color stains on the screen or horizontal lines of different colors and quantities.  Read more about each individual case below.  This will help diagnose the problem before contacting LCD repair technicians. </p><h2>  Thin vertical strip </h2><p>  If a narrow vertical bar appears on the screen of your TV, most likely this indicates a one-time error in the matrix.  An elementary voltage drop can cause it.  In the event of such a malfunction of the LCD TV, do not despair.  It is enough to turn off the TV and wait a while.  The error will disappear by itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fixyourdlp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="horizontal stripes" class="if uuid-3185873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3185873.jpg"></div><h2>  Multiple vertical lines of the same color. </h2><p>  The occurrence of such interference on the screen has already more serious reasons.  If one or several monochrome stripes appear on the screen, this means a breakdown of the matrix itself.  In this case, it is important to contact the service or call the master repairing LCD TVs at home, as over time these bands will grow, and subsequently may occupy the entire screen area.  But do not be too scared, because in the initial stage, repair is still possible.  In more advanced cases, matrix replacement is required. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Multicolored horizontal stripes, ripples, distortion pictures and stains </h2><p>  The appearance of such changes in the image means the loss of the connection of the contact cable to the screen matrix.  You can solve this problem by re-soldering the contacts at the junction.  Now there are many materials - articles and video tutorials on self-repair of various equipment.  However, it should be borne in mind that in them all actions are performed by professionals.  And if you do not have the appropriate qualifications, it is strongly discouraged to independently fix the malfunctions that caused the appearance of colored or white horizontal stripes on the TV screen, since although the problem is not critical, it can significantly aggravate the situation with one wrong move, which in any case will require help skilled craftsmen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.avsforum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="horizontal stripes on the tv screen" class="if uuid-3185882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3185882.jpg"></div><h2>  Thin horizontal strip of white color </h2><p>  Its occurrence means the failure of the personnel scan of the TV.  This can happen due to constant voltage drops, short circuits, or lightning strikes.  From this, the contacts are melted, and cracks appear on the board.  About how much repairs can result, it will be possible to judge only after the diagnosis of the damaged device by the master. </p><h2>  Black stripes </h2><p>  The appearance of vertical or horizontal black bars on the TV screen, in which not a single pixel is visible, means the decoder is out of order.  This breakdown requires the most expensive repair, since the TV matrix in this case is under replacement.  If you do not contact the service, then, as in the case above, defects will grow over the entire screen area. </p><h2>  How to prevent the appearance of stripes on the screen? </h2><p>  To minimize the likelihood of vertical and horizontal stripes appearing on the TV screen, you need to follow a few simple rules.  Do not use too wet or wet rags to wipe the device.  Moreover, do not splash water or other liquids on it.  It is important to prevent moisture from getting inside the case, as it can lead to contact closure or oxidation.  If there is a need for wet cleaning of the TV, it is better to apply the cleaning liquid directly to the fabric, and after that, clean the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.laptoprepair101.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="horizontal stripes on the screen" class="if uuid-3185879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3185879.jpg"></div><p>  Periodic movement of equipment or other similar influences can lead to damage to the cables connected to it or their connectors.  In addition, there is a risk of the device falling, which can lead, in addition to external, to internal damage.  Repair of such a device at a cost may exceed the purchase of a new one.  To avoid this, you need to ensure maximum stability of the TV or use the wall bracket. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.avforums.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="horizontal on tv screen" class="if uuid-3185876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3185876.jpg"></div><p>  You should also periodically clean the inside of the TV from dust, you can use a vacuum cleaner.  The dust accumulated inside can lead to overheating of the loop, which will entail deterioration of contact with a further failure of the matrix.  Such cleaning for the TV is much more useful than wiping the dust of the case and screen. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  This article contains the most common causes of streaks on the screen.  They will help to find out the reason and tell the masters full information about the nature of the breakdown.  If you see horizontal stripes on the TV screen, do not panic.  Any damage must be repaired.  In almost all cities of Russia there are authorized service centers of large electronics manufacturers, where qualified craftsmen will be able to repair or replace a failed part with an original one.  In addition, if a breakdown occurred during the warranty period, repairs can be made absolutely free. </p>
