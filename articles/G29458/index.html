This fact is confirmed by the widest network of representative offices throughout the country and an unimaginably huge number of customers. </p><h2>  Sberbank - one of the most sought-after lending institutions among Russians </h2><p>  Only in the metropolitan metropolis, there are over eight thousand trade and service branches.  Every day, hundreds of Russians enter the doors of the aforementioned institution, and far from everyone knows how Sberbank works.  The information below will help you sort this out. </p>

    <p>  Of course, the question of how Sberbank works is not a problem if you have access to the Internet.  However, not everyone has the opportunity to take advantage of the World Wide Web.  And often there is a need to make a monetary transaction, while it is not known how Sberbank works. </p><p>  Of course, the credit institution in question serves its customers on <span>weekdays</span> and Saturdays, Sunday is considered a weekend for its employees. </p><h2>  Schedule </h2><p>  Typically, a working day starts at half past eight in the morning and ends at half past seven in the evening.  This mode of operation was chosen, in particular, by some metropolitan branches of Sberbank.  At the same time, a lunch break falls on a period of time from 14 to 15 hours Moscow time.  This is how Sberbank works in the ‚Äúthrone‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the eve of the holidays, the service centers of the aforementioned financial and credit institution work on a Saturday schedule or employees "go home" an hour and a half earlier. </p><p>  As for the main divisions of the Russian bank in question, it should be noted that its employees perform their duties at lunchtime, while they have a six-day <span>work week.</span>  It should be noted that the lead Sberbank on Saturday is open until six in the evening. </p>

    <p>  Such units in the Russian capital are easily identified - they all have an individual four-digit code, while the subsidiary offices are assigned an eight-digit code. </p><h2>  Features of the operating mode of additional offices of Sberbank </h2><p>  Any branch of the financial institution in question has an additional office that operates on an individual basis.  It is customary to call him "on duty".  This is where the client can come if he has an urgent need for any cash transactions.  Even if today is a day off or holiday, it will be served without fail. </p><p>  Consider the mode of operation of additional offices of several regional branches of Sberbank, located in the metropolitan metropolis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For example, the Tver branch, located on Leningradsky Prospekt, on weekends is open from half past eight in the morning until six in the evening, while a <span>lunch break</span> is provided from 14 to 15 hours Moscow time. </p><p>  But the additional office, geographically located on Kutuzovsky Prospekt in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Vremena Goda shopping center, has a slightly different operating mode. </p>

    <p>  It opens at ten in the morning and closes at ten in the evening.  At the same time, the above-mentioned duty unit of Sberbank works seven days a week. </p><p>  As for the office located on Uralskaya Street, for example, it should be noted that its working hours are no different: customers are served here from half past eight in the morning until six in the evening.  And if suddenly someone on Sunday asks: ‚ÄúDoes Sberbank work today on Uralskaya Street?‚Äù, The answer will be: ‚ÄúYes, it works, but only until 2 p.m.‚Äù </p><h2>  ATMs are also at the customer‚Äôs service </h2><p>  In addition to supporting <span>structural units,</span> Sberbank equipped all its representative offices with ATMs.  As a rule, they are located in the immediate vicinity of additional offices, in the territory of shopping and entertainment centers, in the vicinity of social infrastructure facilities.  Almost all of them work around the clock.  The work schedule of ATMs located inside commercial facilities is similar to the work schedule of companies that rent premises in them. </p><h2>  Features of the <span>work schedule of</span> units serving legal entities </h2><p>  Branches of the Savings Bank of Russia, specializing in work with legal entities, establish a break in the interval between 14 and 15 hours Moscow time.  Some of them work five days a week or provide for <span>reduced working hours</span> in their work <span>.</span>  As a rule, employees of the office of Sberbank of Russia, working exclusively with <span>corporate clients,</span> ‚Äúleave home‚Äù on Saturday at 2 p.m. </p>

    <p>  If a client suddenly needs to ask for help after the end of a working day on Saturday, he can get it at the duty unit. </p><h2>  Payment terminals and cash desks </h2><p>  We cannot but touch upon the issue of the operating mode of payment terminals and cash desks.  The first, as a rule, are available until the end of the working day in the unit.  If the client needs to contact the box office, it is better to do this in advance, and not a quarter of an hour before the end of the work of the unit.  Otherwise, you can simply not have time! </p><p>  The management of Sberbank of Russia made a lot of efforts in order to improve the quality of the services provided to customers, so that it would be most convenient for them to serve in the above financial and credit institution.  This fact is confirmed not only by the huge number of payment terminals and ATMs, but also by the Internet banking system, which allows you to make money transactions without leaving your home. </p>
