  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Observation as a Research Method</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In scientific research, various methods are used, which are means and techniques with which you can obtain reliable data on the subject of study and use them in the future to derive scientific theories and create practical recommendations. </p><p>  <strong>Observation as a research method</strong> is the most common and popular method of sociological and psychological research. </p><p>  <strong>Observation</strong> is a scientific method of research, which is not limited to a simple statement of facts, but scientifically explains the causes of a particular phenomenon.  It consists in the purposeful collection of facts about the behavior and activities of people for their subsequent analysis. </p><p>  Observation as <span>a research method is</span> characterized by a number of requirements for its implementation.  These include the requirement to preserve the natural conditions for the passage of the studied phenomena, the requirement for purposeful study and phased fixation of the results. </p><p>  In the process of observation, it is necessary to follow the program developed for this, which defines the goals and objectives of the study, determines the object, situation and subject, selects the method for studying phenomena, sets the time limits for the observation and compiles its schedule, selects the method for recording observations, determines the methods for processing the data obtained. </p><p>  In theory, these <strong>types of observation</strong> are distinguished.  By the duration of the conduct - short-term (slice) and long-legged (long).  In terms of coverage, it is selective (individual parameters of phenomena and processes are observed) and solid (all changes to the object within the situation are recorded).  According to the degree of participation of researchers - direct (direct involvement) and indirect (through the use of assistive devices, equipment). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Observation as a research method is divided into two categories: structured and unstructured observation.  Under structured refers to the included study.  It gives particularly high quality results.  Especially effective is observation if the subjects are not aware of the experiment. </p><p>  Separately <span>included is observation</span> as a research method, when a researcher participates in the life of the group being studied, becoming a member of it, and observes the processes inside it. </p><p>  Depending on the object: external (behavior, physiological changes, actions) or internal (thoughts, experiences, <span>mental processes</span> or conditions), variations of this method are distinguished: self-observation and objective observation. </p><p>  Objective observation as a method of <span>sociological research</span> is a research strategy in which external characteristics or changes in the observed objects are recorded.  Such observation often acts as a preliminary step before conducting experiments. </p><p>  The method of self-observation is used to obtain data of an empirical nature through observation of oneself.  Especially often used is such an observation as a <span>method of psychological research.</span>  Elements of this method are the basis of most psychological studies of conditions and processes.  By comparing the results of self-observation with similar self-observation of other people, one can establish kinship or compare the data of internal experience with manifestations of the psyche at the external level. </p><p>  The observation method also includes introspection, which was developed by W. Wundt in the framework of introspective psychology, and phenomenological self-observation.  Introspection is a method of psychological introspection, which consists in observing the course of your own psychological processes, without the use of additional tools, standards and tools. </p>
