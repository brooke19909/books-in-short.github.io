Not far from the reservoir there are many swamps, an array of which is called Zhabinsky.  According to research in 1910-1925, the lake has a meteorite origin.  However, this is not the only version; there are others.  In the center is a beautiful island, and the outer part of the reservoir is represented by the shape of a ring. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="onion lake" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1334199.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  a brief description of </h2><p>  Onion Lake is relatively small.  Its area is 35 hectares, its length is about 2 km, and its width is from 150 to 200 meters.  This body of water is popular with the townspeople, especially in the summer, as there are not many places to relax in the Noginsk district.  It has open shores, the surroundings are pleasing to the eye, look very picturesque.  The lake is surrounded by forest.  Rest in the <span>Noginsk region</span> due to this has the most comfortable conditions. </p><p>  If you look at the map, the lake really looks like an onion.  In the center of the pond is an island with another small pond.  Today it is connected to the main water area.  This place is one of the most picturesque in the area. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Onion Lake <span>(Noginsky District)</span> has many watercourses and combines with peatlands, which is why there are many impurities of peat in the water.  Such a composition affected the color of the water; it acquired a slightly brownish tint.  From the lake flows the small river Retemushka, which is the right tributary of Sherna. </p><h2>  Title </h2><p>  The name Lukovoe Lake (Noginsky District) is probably due to the blacksmith Luka, who owns a forge and a small tavern by the reservoir along the road connecting the Stromynskaya and Vladimirskaya roads.  In carrying out the construction work, the guesses were partially confirmed, at least about the forge.  Ancient coins and nails were found that knocked out the horseshoes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="onion lake noginsky district" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1334200.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lake formation </h2><p>  Deposits at the bottom indicate that the water area formed 10-12 thousand years ago.  Despite the information obtained during the research on meteorite origin, there is still a major version of its formation.  This is an explosion of <span>swamp gas.</span>  The latter accumulated in dolomites and limestones, then under the influence of acidic water in the voids there was a destruction of the relief. </p><h2>  Vegetable world </h2><p>  Of the vegetation in this area, one can meet coastal sedge, reeds, water-red, reeds and quite a few elodeas.  Along the perimeter of the coastline majestically rise birches, less often - pines and spruce.  A visit to the lake is already a traditional rite for many newlyweds.  All year birch trees are decorated with wedding ribbons of various colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in the Noginsk region" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1334201.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  There are several ways to get to the lake: </p><ol><li>  If you get from Moscow by car, it will take up to 2 hours, depending on traffic jams.  The lake itself is located at a distance of about 70 km from the capital.  The guide for the tourist should be the village of Gorki.  After this territory is overcome, you can see several sharp turns.  Next you need to drive about one kilometer and find an open space on the left.  The traveler needs to find a turn to the lake and the parking lot, but they are not very visible.  You need to navigate to the booth with a barrier.  This is the parking lot.  If the tourist on the left sees the buildings and the race to the pioneer camp, then it's time to turn around - he slipped the right turn. </li><li>  If the traveler decided to go from Moscow without a car, you need to keep the path to Kursky Station.  From there, the train leaves for Noginsk.  And also from the metro station "Partizanskaya" you can leave on the 322nd minibus and bus.  The end point of the route for both modes of transport is the same - the area near the bus station in Noginsk.  There are also direct buses to Onion Lake.  Route number 25: Noginsk (ring) - Stromyn (or Dubrovo).  You can also take the number 24, he walks along the same ring, only in the opposite direction.  Just a vacationer will go longer, about twice.  Next you need to get to the stop "Karobanovsky turn".  You can ask the driver to stop near the camp.  You will need to walk about 800 m, and then a long-awaited vacation.  You can also get from Noginsk station by the following routes: 36, 158. On the first option, you will need to go about 20 stops. </li><li>  If a tourist gets from Noginsk already and has a car, then the path will be about 9 km, that is, a little more than 10 minutes. </li></ol>
