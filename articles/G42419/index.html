    <h2>  MTS Account Management: all options </h2><p>  In order for the problem of the disappearance of funds from the account not to concern you, it is necessary to exercise full control over your number.  Thanks to the popularity of the Internet and the remote provision of data, this is very easy.  Firstly, there is such a thing as a personal account.  This is the personal page of the subscriber, which contains detailed information on the number: starting from the tariff plan, the list of connected services, ending with data on expenses.  By registering on the official portal of the mobile operator and periodically checking the status of the account, you can timely identify options that were not connected by you, and quickly get rid of them.  By the way, a mobile application has been developed for smartphones and tablets that replaces your personal account and provides all the same functions that are available on the site.  Secondly, in the absence of the Internet, you can use the technical support services provided by the mobile operator.  The question "Where does the money go to MTS?"  can be asked by a customer service specialist, while specifying the owner of the number.  If there are paid services that may be the reason for the costs, the employee will inform about this and tell you how they can be deactivated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to find out where the money went at MTS?  Method 1 </h2><p>  It is possible to independently determine in which direction the funds are ‚Äúleaking‚Äù from the account in several ways.  Let's consider each of them. </p><p>  Personal Area.  We have already mentioned this way of number management.  Information on which services are connected on the room (as well as which subscriptions, newsletters, options) is reflected in your personal account.  In addition, here you can find out what their cost is, the frequency of charging a subscription fee (if any), and, if necessary, turn it off.  In the list of services for each option, there are commands for controlling: activate / deactivate.  Please note that the list of services includes those that are not connected to the room.  They are available for activation, i.e.  you can use them if you wish (before connecting, make sure that the amount in the account is sufficient). </p>

    <h2>  Bill details </h2><p>  How to find out where the money was spent on the MTS account if there are no paid options on the number?  The most correct solution in this situation would be to take advantage of the granularity.  The service is paid.  The cost of receiving information for one day is three rubles (thus, if money was debited within the last five days, it makes sense to order an account details for this period by spending 15 rubles).  In the decrypted document, which will be sent to the subscriber by e-mail, you can see which calls were made and SMS to which numbers were sent.  Perhaps a decrease in the balance is associated with calls to long-distance numbers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Complaint </h2><p>  If you already managed to resolve the question of how to find out where the money goes to ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù, and now you are thinking how you can return the debited funds from the account, then the following information will be useful.  If the number of services that were not connected by the subscriber is found on the number, he is entitled to demand compensation from the mobile operator.  To do this, it is better to contact the MTS office and draw up a written appeal stating the essence of the claim and demanding the return of funds to the account.  A response to the application will be provided no later than 60 days later. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In this article, we examined how to find out where the money goes to MTS.  It is recommended that subscribers of any mobile operator always keep their account under control.  For this, the user's personal account is quite suitable, which contains not only detailed information, but also tools for managing services and options.  And if you are tormented by the question of how to find out where the money went at MTS, order the details and check.  In case of disagreement with the write-offs, contact the office of the mobile operator to write a complaint.  But note that if it becomes clear that the service was activated by the subscriber himself, for example, through a USSD request, then the return of funds to the account will be refused. </p>
