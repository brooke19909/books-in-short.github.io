    <h2>  Hydrography of the Irgiz River </h2><p>  Irgiz is a river that has a length of 675 km.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãits basin is 24 thousand square meters.  km  Typically, a river is used to irrigate local fields.  High water is typical for March-April.  The water flow is fed by snow water.  In spring, the ice drift lasts no more than a week.  Ice on the river lasts from November to the second spring month.  In some areas, the depth is so shallow that the ice covers the entire water stream - to the bottom.  It often dries in the summer.  Irgiz Overflow Dam controls runoff.  In addition to her, there are several more dams.  It is one of the ways to feed the local canal. </p><p>  The source of the river is in the area of <span>General Syrt.</span>  The course of medium speed, the channel has in some places a loop shape.  The mouth is the <span>Volgograd reservoir</span> (Balakovo).  Irgiz is a river on which two more artificial reservoirs are based: Sulakskoe and Pugachevskoe.  The first has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã20 squares, the second - 10 km <sup>2</sup> .  In the Irgiz basin, there are more than 800 small ponds and reservoirs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="big irgiz" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1359813.jpg" width="500"></div>

Hydronym is relevant to this day.  It has been known about the watercourse since ancient times - since 921.  The prefix in the title - "Big" - arose in the speech of Russian people.  In 1727, the water body was mentioned as Kyrgyzstan, but this hydronym did not take root. </p><h2>  Fishing on the river </h2><p>  Starting the fishing season is already in April.  Fishing in the Samara region attracts many due to the good conditions.  By the way, it is best to do this on weekdays.  This is due to the fact that on weekends there are too many vacationers.  However, if it is not possible to arrive during the working week, you should stop at the junction of Irgiz and Revyaki - on the Trekhrechye.  Due to the action of Revyaki, the current in this place is optimal for fishing.  It is best to come to Trekhrechye in autumn.  The thing is that in the summer, vacationers scare prey here. </p><p>  It is possible to catch asp and catfish.  Irgiz - a river on which it is best to fish for jig baits.  <span>Fishermen who wish to</span> supplement their catch with pike or pike perch are advised to stop at the bend.  In these places there are pits in which the listed fish live.  It‚Äôs difficult to catch the catfish, on the spinning rod it is almost impossible.  This is due to the too large weight of representatives of this species - half a centner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing in the Samara region" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1359806.jpg" width="500"></div>

On the river there is an overflow dam, which is also called "Waterfall" or "Steps".  Due to the convenience of relaxing on it in the summer, a lot of tourists gather here.  In the Saratov region, this is the only place where you can enjoy plenty of bathing, beautiful views, splashes of water strips.  You can also see a beautiful sight - how cars overcome the path, driving through the dam.  You can watch a lot of videos that filmed such lovers to shorten their path. </p><p>  How to get to the dam, being near the river itself?  You can drive up both from the right banks and from the left.  In the first case, you must observe the path near the village of Perekopnaya Luka.  After driving a certain distance, the driver and passengers will be able to see the green coast, where there is absolutely, by the way, no garbage.  You can also get from the village of Sulak.  In this case, travelers will stumble on concrete slabs.  Here you can drive directly to the shore.  It is necessary to pay attention that the sign ‚ÄúSwimming is prohibited‚Äù is installed in this place.  But when did it stop someone?  With children, you can relax near the breakwaters: the depth here is very small, in some places it is not higher than the ankle.  But if you really want to swim, you need to rise just above the dam. </p><p>  The best fishing in the Samara region is in these places!  This can be said with 100% certainty.  An indicator of this is the frequent herons.  Notice!  Waterfalls on the dam often dry out, so you need to come before the heat - in early summer.  Also, those people who want to visit the dam by car should remember that some, taking a chance, went on an exciting journey through the streams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Irgiz Saratov Region" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1359814.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  As already mentioned, you can come here by car.  First you need to get to Balakovo.  You can do this by keeping your path along the Saratov-Samara highway.  After reaching the village, you need to get to Pugachev.  After the driver reaches the Dry Spur, he will see a special signpost.  He needs to turn right.  Then drive 2 km along an asphalt road.  On the way there will be 2 bridges in the form of a dam.  After overcoming the second, you need to drive into the field, there will be a fork in three roads.  Need the one that is most knurled (extreme right).  She will lead to the bank of the river.  Irgiz (Balakovo district).  Drive about 1 km.  The second way to get here is by public transport.  Buses run from Saratov to the following settlements with some frequency: Pugachev, Samara and Ivanteyevka. </p><h2>  Rest on the river </h2><p>  The coastline is equipped with beaches.  Especially popular is the ‚Äúwild‚Äù part that surrounds the Big Irgiz.  It is there, among birch trees and aspens, that tourists often camp and camp for several weeks, or even months.  This amazing place is perfect for fishermen, beach lovers and children.  The water in the water stream is quite warm.  It quickly warms up, especially near the "waterfalls".  Near the beaches there are special tents where you can rent various equipment.  This will allow you to spend time relaxing with even greater benefit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="irgiz overflow dam" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1359809.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Flora </h2><p>  Although aquatic vegetation is not at all pleased with the diversity of species, however, there are many rare representatives of the flora.  For example, a small population of cattail broadleaf.  Egg capsules, reeds and lilies - what could be more beautiful?  They fascinate the eye and do not give up on the enjoyment of nature.  If we consider the territory beyond the coastal zone, then it is worth mentioning the forest area.  Willows and aspens are most common.  They are easy to see every few meters, approaching the river.  Dandelions, wormwood, <span>mouse peas,</span> tansy, plantain and many other plants delight with their abundance in the forest zone.  The right bank of the Irgiz River (Saratov Region) is almost overgrown.  The forest stretched for 150 meters.  Among the main trees are oak, poplar and aspen.  Herbs that easily tolerate the lack of sunlight or like shade predominate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="irgiz balakovo district" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1359811.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fauna </h2><p>  Irgiz is a river, in the basin of which the wildlife is quite rich.  Often there are hares and pheasants.  If you go deeper into the forest, you can see foxes and wild boars.  As a rule, they approach water in places where there are no people.  And without ‚Äúwitnesses‚Äù, wild boars like to swim in the river and mess around on the shore in mud.  On the shore there are toads, midges, ants, vipers and snakes, otters and, of course, mosquitoes.  Among the birds are storks and seagulls. </p>
