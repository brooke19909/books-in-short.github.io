This immediately focuses on its features.  This piece of jewelry should fit snugly around your neck.  It is also called a ‚Äúchoker tattoo‚Äù, because from afar on the neck it looks like an openwork pattern. </p><h2>  Popular decoration of the 90s </h2><p>  Twenty years ago, the popularity of this simple jewelry knew no bounds.  In any store you could find sets of collars, bracelets and rings.  Chokers were black, white, rainbow, and sometimes even glowed in the dark.  Such a trinket could be won in an amusement park or beach attraction.  Fashionistas wore them regardless of the weather and with any wardrobe.  And many even knew how to make a choker tattoo from a fishing line on their own.  Since the creation of a choker does not take much time and does not require effort, craftsmen could make a lot of such jewelry in a day, and sometimes they even took orders from friends to make this popular jewelry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a choker tattoo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31700/802745.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What you need to make a DIY choker tattoo </h2><p>  This task will not require special skills from you.  Even those who have never done needlework are guaranteed to get a good result.  To make a tattoo choker with your own hands, you do not need special devices or rare materials.  All we need is a fishing line of the desired color and thickness and an office clothespin in order to pinch it for a while. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the fishing line is thin, you can weave in two or three threads.  This allows you to combine different colors, and the product will turn out more openwork.  Sometimes, instead of fishing line, other, similar materials are used: an elastic cord, a wire from the headphones, a rubber thread.  Variations in the thickness and structure of the weaving base used make it possible to obtain diverse results. </p><p>  If desired, you can use beads or pendants to decorate our homemade choker. </p><h2>  <span>How to make a</span> choker <span>tattoo</span> yourself </h2><p>  So, you have already prepared everything you need.  Now you can begin the creative process of creating an original decoration. </p><ul><li>  The first thing to do is to measure 2‚Äì2.5 meters of fishing line, bend it in half and fix one end with an office clothespin.  If this thing was not at hand, nothing is scary.  It doesn‚Äôt matter how you fix the edge, the main thing is that as a result, you have a small ring of fishing line left clipped. </li><li>  Next, we begin to weave the choker tattoo.  The circuit used is very simple.  The principle of weaving is shown in the figure. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself choker tattoo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31700/802742.jpg" width="354"></div></li><li>  We make a loop from one end of the fishing line and thread the second end into this loop, then repeat the procedure this time, creating a ring from the second end of the fishing line and passing the first, free edge into it. </li><li>  If the choker tattoo should be decorated with beads, you need to thread them through the fishing line when creating loops. </li><li>  The pendant is fixed in the same way.  You need to carefully try on the choker during weaving in order to attach the pendant in the right place, since in the finished form the pendant will not move freely around the jewelry. </li><li>  Upon completion, you need to carefully fasten the edges of the fishing line to prevent the opening of our product.  This is best done with special crimp balls, which are sold in the store for creativity.  Such a ball is put on both free ends of the fishing line and is flattened.  This fixation looks aesthetically pleasing and firmly fixes jewelry from blooming. </li><li>  If it is not possible to get crimp balls, you can tightly tie the fishing line or solder it by melting its edges on a fire.  Such a choker will need to be worn over the head. </li><li>  Many are interested in how to make a choker tattoo with a clasp.  This is completely uncomplicated.  In specialized stores there is a large assortment of fasteners that are attached to each edge of the product and then joined together with a hook or snap hook. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing line choker tattoo" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31700/802743.jpg" width="570"></div></li></ul><h2>  Is wearing a choker tattoo appropriate nowadays </h2><p>  We learned how to make a DIY choker tattoo out of ordinary fishing line.  It turns out that this is not difficult at all.  But is it worth wasting time on such needlework if the times of popularity of chokers are long gone?  Is it appropriate to wear it now? </p><p>  Naturally, those who adhere to the classic style in clothing will not be able to wear such an ornament.  Also, it will be out of place at official meetings or in a formal working environment.  The choker on owners of a short, dense neck simply looks ugly. </p><p>  But there are many options when the choker is not just acceptable, but will be a great addition to the image.  Admirers of the free style and casual style will appreciate such jewelry.  Also, this accessory should well appeal to lovers of handmade.  The choker looks perfect on female bikers and representatives of various informal movements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tattoo choker circuit" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29559/804143.jpg" width="600"></div>
