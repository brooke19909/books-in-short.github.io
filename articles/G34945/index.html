    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Chunja village is quite large - according to the latest census, about 20,000 people lived in it.  It is located in the Almaty region, a little less than 250 km to the city, so people often go here on weekend tours.  A trip takes an average of four to five hours. </p><p>  Many people know about these unique places, but, unfortunately, few people still know how to get to them.  In addition, on the way to the destination, you can enjoy picturesque views of the valley from the Bolshoi Ketmen pass. </p><p>  The roadway is constantly updated, but if you decide to drive your car, you must carefully monitor the road so as not to get into the pits, which, unfortunately, sometimes occur. </p><p>  On the way to the sources near the highway in the warm season there are small bazaars where you can buy sweets, fruits and various little things needed during the holidays. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Origin </h2><p>  Most hot springs are of volcanic origin.  Chunja hot springs are no exception.  Many millions of years ago there was a huge active volcano.  Some scientists believe that the caldera (the hollow of the volcano) was at least 8 kilometers in size, possibly even 15 kilometers.  Now this volcano is not active, therefore, it does not pose any danger to the inhabitants of the region, however, its existence now brings great benefits to people.  The magmatic channels of the former volcano have not yet been completely closed, therefore, in contact with water, they heat it.  Under high pressure, it hits the surface, forming warm and hot springs. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Chunja and its environs provide an excellent opportunity to enjoy unity with wildlife.  Nearby is an ash grove, which is a natural monument and is protected by the state.  <span>This is a grove of</span> relict trees that are preserved only in this region.  The age of the trees is about 5 million years. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to ash, many other endangered plants listed in the Red Book grow here, so all visitors and tourists are urged to be attentive to the nature around them and try not to tear anything. </p><p>  Around the grove there are many characteristic mounds that are left after the ancient tribes lived here.  And also the unique <span>Charyn Canyon.</span>  It was formed on the ruins of an old volcano.  The mountains offer breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.  This area is also called the Valley of Castles. </p><p>  In these parts the steppe and mountains are combined and intertwined with each other.  In addition to plants, rare species of birds and mammals live here, which are also threatened with extinction.  It is often difficult for the animal world to maintain its position in the vicinity of a person and with the results of his life.  Cities and roads change the natural habitats of the animal world, so everything inevitably changes and often not in a positive way.  In this region, nature has been preserved almost unchanged, and experts are making every effort to protect this area from the harmful effects of man. </p>

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  Chunja hot springs are artesian springs filled with low-mineralized water. </p><p>  Sources differ in temperature, so among them there is an internal division into different types: from warm to very hot.  They do not freeze even in severe frosts, so lovers of extreme sensations often come here to rest in the winter in order to enjoy the warm water procedures when the thermometer drops far below zero. </p><p>  Many believe that there is a <span>hot spring in</span> Chunja with radon water, but in fact it is not.  All water here is of natural mineralization. </p>
