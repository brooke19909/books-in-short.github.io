  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What low-cost hotels in Moscow offer</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At present, for many people, visiting Moscow is a dream, but for some it is just an everyday necessity.  In the warmer months, a huge number of not only foreign tourists arrive in Moscow, but also residents of nearby districts, for example, many students and schoolchildren come from many regions with ending periods of exams and sessions.  Usually, these travelers come accompanied by adults, for example, cool trips at the end of the school year are quite popular.  Students in this regard are more independent, and often prefer to gather in small companies from 3 to 7 people, but, as a rule, they all prefer inexpensive Moscow hotels. </p><p>  All hotels differ from each other, both in terms of the services provided and in the quality of service.  Sometimes a company prefers not to fork out for hotels with additional features, choosing cheap hotels.  This is convenient, because in order to spend the night there is no need to overpay for many of the services. </p><p>  Small hotels in Moscow are successful not only with large companies, very often private clients use hotels, enjoying maximum care, attention and comfort in individual service.  Note that today for 1000-1500 rubles.  Hotels are ready to provide private customers with pretty good rooms.  Note that in private hotels there are usually a small number of rooms, it resembles a warm home environment.  Mini-hotels have rooms of various classes, for example, such as single or double, as well as designed for several people, often up to 5. All of them have differences, both in terms of comfort and price.  Almost all the hotels in Moscow have an equipped kitchen, where each client can either prepare their favorite dishes on their own, or use the inexpensive services of the staff. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Very often <span>hotels in Moscow</span> are located near the metro, both luxury and ordinary inexpensive hotels.  Agree, this is very convenient, but keep in mind that the position of a hotel in the city significantly affects its price, for this reason, choosing a hotel on the outskirts of the capital can save a lot. </p><p>  There are also small, but at the same time expensive hotels, the so-called business class.  These are luxury hotels with European standard services and a wide selection of additional options and amenities.  These hotels are usually used by wealthy businessmen, as well as sports and pop stars.  Prices in this sector reach 5-10 thousand rubles per day for the corresponding comfort and services.  <span>Moscow hotels</span> inexpensively among customers are the most popular, these facilities are supported by companies that have managed to optimize costs in a competitive environment and minimal investment in advertising.  In such hotels, the price per person does not exceed 1.5 thousand rubles per day, which is good news. </p><p>  Roadside hotels located near Moscow deserve special attention.  It is understandable that there are many clients who prefer to live outside the capital, while saving a lot and enjoying the silence and clean air.  And for travelers by car at the entrance to Moscow it is most acceptable to make a short-term vacation here, as it is quite convenient and inexpensive. </p><p>  Consider a few of the cheap hotel options in Moscow. </p><p>  Hotel Rosa Vetrov </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This is a fairly small hotel, only 12 rooms.  The building itself is represented by three floors, located near the metro station Baumanskaya.  It is very good that each room is adapted according to the material requests of the guests.  If you do not need a TV, hairdryer or any other things, why pay for them?  Accordingly, the price will be lower.  Room rate starts from 3000 r.  the only drawback is the slow staff, but friendly. </p><p>  Hotel Vostok </p><p>  This is a two star hotel.  The Vostok Hotel is located next to the Botanical Garden and metro Vladykino.  In total - 137 rooms.  The building consists of 5 floors.  A common standard for guests is a refrigerator and a TV.  The price is wonderful, only 3000 r.  per night.  Just do not be offended if there are no towels or slippers in the room. </p><p>  Hotel Midland Sheremetyevo </p><p>  Each room is equipped with ventilation, a bathroom, a TV and soundproofed windows.  This hotel option is definitely better than the previous one, although the price is 1000 rubles.  more.  Of course, the interior of the rooms is quite original.  Here you can feel with maximum comfort.  The only negative is the price of 4000r.  But, this hotel will be much cheaper than a business hotel with five stars. </p><p>  Moscow hotels are by far the most popular stopping place for many tourists, largely due to the fact that renting an apartment, even for rent, is approximately equal to the cost of an inexpensive hotel with a significant difference in convenience and comfort.  The choice is yours, dear travelers! </p>
