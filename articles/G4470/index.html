In this million-plus city with beautiful straight streets leading down to the reservoir, the domestic military and merchant fleets were once born, and today Voronezh is one of the main and most important railway junctions. </p><p>  It plays the role of a kind of link that connects the northern and southern parts of Russia.  Many trains annually take hundreds of thousands of Russians to the south and back, making a mandatory stop at the main city station of Voronezh 1. People who travel from the south to the east of the country, to and from the Volga, or west to Belgorod, make transfers here. </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Leaving the occupied city in 1943, the Germans left it in ruins.  This fate has not passed and the building of the railway station.  In its present form, the railway station Voronezh 1 was built only nine years after its liberation, in 1954.  The building was designed by the capital architect Skarzhinsky, and the architect Alabyan supervised the construction. </p><p>  Over the course of seven decades, the station was slightly reconstructed several times.  The height of the platforms changed, the interior was repaired, for the safety of passengers, the station area was fenced and metal detectors were installed.  The rest of the building retained the appearance that it received on the opening day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  <span>Voronezh Station</span> 1 is a beautiful monument of monumental Stalinist architecture, designed in the style of classicism, which was very popular in the reviving USSR after a grueling war.  The two-story building is located parallel to the railway tracks.  On the platform side, the facade is a high glass arch with a stained-glass window; on the side of the city, the facade has a horseshoe-shaped shape and extends to Chernyakhovsky Square. </p><p>  On this facade there are sculptures - a compositional basis and the main decoration of the building.  Initially, they were concrete, but over time they began to deteriorate and pose a danger to passers-by, so in 1996 they were replaced with exact copper copies.  The station interior is decorated with ornate stucco and marble. </p><p>  Although the station Voronezh 1 is very modest in size, but thanks to the light yellow color, thoughtful proportions and drawn details, it has an impressive and ceremonial appearance.  It is no accident that this building is one of the symbols of the city and is depicted on the candy wrappers of the famous "Voronezh sweets". </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The internal situation is not very different from the situation of dozens of other regional stations of the country.  Passenger services include waiting rooms, left-luggage offices, a police station, information desk, lounge, information board, shops, toilets, souvenir shops, a restaurant and a buffet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Travelers who see off and meet have all the conditions in order to comfortably wait for the train.  The building is safe, clean and warm.  Passengers in transit can have a hearty meal, buy food on a train, buy a souvenir in memory of Voronezh, or, leaving luggage in a paid storage room, easily explore the city.
