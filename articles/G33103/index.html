Back in the nineties, this amazing state broke into the world market of travel services with its <span>All Inclusive</span> in conjunction with low prices and courteous service.  In the high tourist season, Turkey, and especially the <span>Antalya coast,</span> turns into a large Slavic colony, in a cheerful open-air bar next to the warm sea. </p><p>  By the way, the high tourist <span>season in Turkey</span> lasts longer than in many European resorts.  In April / May, the Mediterranean coast is ready to receive travelers, offering them gentle 20 ° C, but not yet completely warmed up sea.  In the summer season, the frequency of tourist flows rolls to the maximum.  Even the weather in Turkey in October is still pleasant enough for those who did not have time for the last train of the "velvet season" to have the opportunity to warm their darling in the tender, but not sultry autumn sun. </p>

    <p>  The average temperature at the end of the season is 25 ° C during the day and 20 ° C at night.  Most five-star hotels also operate in the winter, attracting tourists with the same “all inclusive”, indoor pools, golf courses and a rich spa program.  Even if the unpredictable weather in Turkey in October can brazenly drop to 16-18 ° C, when the opportunity to get a bronze beach tan becomes doubtful, it is unlikely to spoil your vacation, because there are still so many interesting activities in the Turkish resort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to the possibilities of unlimited alcohol-solar parasitism, Turkey knows what to offer interesting guests, yet this country has a rich history.  The list of places of worship is very long, but the most popular: Agora and the Tyuhe Temple, Side Aqueduct, <span>Manavgat Waterfall, the</span> underground cities of Cappadocia, the salt springs of Pamukkale, Alanya Fortress and many others.  These are just a few of the attractions of the south coast, let alone the majestic Muslim city of Istanbul, the capital city of Ankara or Marmaris and Bodrum - the pearls of the west coast. </p><h2>  Hotels in Turkey </h2><p>  You can rant about the rich cultural heritage of the peoples living in the territory of modern Turkey, and about the remaining sights.  Anyway, the main feature and the main attraction of Turkey for many tourists is its hotels.  And it’s hard to argue with this, because the hotel sector of this country is one of the strongest in the world.  A great number of hotels are built on the Aegean and Mediterranean coasts, but in the summer they are still crowded.  In addition, in terms of hotels, Turkey takes not only quantity, but also quality.  Many hotels in this camp are real works of architectural, interior and marketing art. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in turkey in october" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/1471691.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is also worth noting that there is no authoritative, well-known hotel chain in the world that would not consider it its duty to build a hotel in Turkey.  So, only on the Antalya coast there are several "Rixos", "Hilton", "Sheraton", "Radison", "Kempinski" and many others. </p><h2>  Water Side Resort Spa 5 Side </h2><p>  Water Side Delux Resort 5 * is a brand new hotel, opened in 2015.  It is located in the Side district, near the town of Titreyengel.  This area is known for its perfect flat sandy beaches.  Unlike the predominantly pebbled beaches of Kemer and Alanya, the coastline of Side and Belek is mostly sandy.  More than half of Side's beaches are marked with the “blue flag”. In the village of Titreyengel (Turkey), the picturesque lake of the same name flows. </p>

But Turkish hotels provide parents with the opportunity to take their children to resorts from an early age, eliminating most problems as much as possible. </p>

    <p>  The Hotel Water Side Resort Spa 5 for young guests has two children's pools, water slides, a large playground, a children's play room, a mini club, a cinema, animation and a disco.  The hotel's restaurant also has a children's menu, highchairs, and a cot is delivered to the room if necessary.  All free service for children is only valid during the day.  But if parents need to look after the child in the evening, they can hire a nanny for an additional fee. </p><p>  And of course the beach.  Kids love to splash around in the sea (like adults).  It is difficult to come up with another shore, which is more suitable for families with children.  The sea there is relatively clean, the beaches are sandy, even, the entrance to the water is shallow and gentle, no special shoes are required for swimming. </p><h2>  Water Side Resort Spa 5: reviews </h2><p>  This is a relatively new hotel, therefore there are several huge advantages: it was built taking into account modern tourist needs, and guests don’t spoil the impression of appliances that break down, rooms that need repair, old beds, tired restaurants. </p><p>  Reviews for Water Side Resort Spa 5 are mostly positive.
