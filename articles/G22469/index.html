    <p>  <strong>Dyatlov Pass.</strong>  <strong>What really happened from reliably known</strong> </p><p>  At the beginning of 1959, an unremarkable group of students from the Ural Polytechnic Institute gathered on a hike to <span>Mount Otorten,</span> which is located in the Sverdlovsk Region.  Among the group members, six were students (including the group leader Igor Dyatlov), three graduates, and an instructor at one of the neighboring tourist camps.  The group left by train from Sverdlovsk on January 23.  The last stronghold of civilization for young people was the village of geologists Second North.  Here, one of the participants in the campaign experienced health problems on January 28.  Because he was forced to return to Sverdlovsk, which may have saved him </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dyatlov pass what happened" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/285574.jpg" width="408"></div>  a life.  The remaining nine members of the tourist group went skiing the next day towards the Holat-Chahl and Otorten mountains.

The return of students was to take place on February 12.  The beginning of the organization of prospecting was laid on February 19.  Only after six days of searching, a tent of children was found on the slope of the Kholat-Chakhl mountain - empty and strangely cut with a knife in several places.  The bodies of all the guys were found until May, when the snow completely fell.  At different distances from the tent, with various implicit signs of a death that occurred - some had severe injuries to the skull or chest, others simply froze in the snow without other obvious fatal injuries.  Moreover, the investigation found that all the students left their tent in what they were, without even spending time on getting dressed.  Actually, the question of what made the guys leave their tent, what they were leaving from, is central to the whole story.  The investigation, opened in the spring of 1959, initially had the local tribes of the Mansi people as suspects, but as a result, investigator Lev Ivanov never made any intelligible conclusions about the Dyatlov Pass.  What really happened, the investigation was unable to determine.  And in his conclusion to this day, an amazing phrase is indicated that the cause of death was a certain unknown and irresistible elemental force. </p><p>  <strong>The mystery of the Dyatlov pass: what happened according to modern research</strong> </p><p>  Actually, the incompleteness of the facts and the impossibility to collect the mosaic of events from them somehow fully made the tragedy so popular.  Today there is not a single coherent theory that combines all the oddities of this </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the mystery of the dyatlov pass what happened" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/285576.jpg" width="537"></div>  incidents: the position of the bodies, the unusual color of the skin of corpses, the unclear origin of the injury, the purpose of cuts on the tent, it is not clear where the traces of radiation appeared on the clothes of some tourists, and much more.  And these versions, I must say, today there are several dozen.  The most elaborate and thorough are the assumptions of death from a <span>man-made disaster,</span> criminal (because there were several camps for prisoners nearby, killers could be poachers or even foreign spies), natural ones, indicating, for example, a possible avalanche.  At the same time, as was noted, none of the versions today is able to fully explain what really happened.
