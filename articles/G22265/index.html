If you live in the northern capital, an excellent option in season is to visit the ice rink in Victory Park.  Now we learn more about the site itself, its mode of operation, the services it provides, and their prices. </p><h2>  The history of the rink in Victory Park (St. Petersburg) </h2><p>  This skating rink is located in the picturesque place of the city, which is sometimes abbreviated as St. Petersburg State Unitary Enterprise Moscow Victory Park.  In <span>St. Petersburg, this</span> place has been held sacred since the end of World War II.  The park was laid down on October 7, 1945 by residents of Leningrad who survived the most severe blockade.  Very soon, he became a favorite vacation spot for citizens.  An amazing fact: the park‚Äôs alleys were broken at the site of a crematorium, in which during the war years they burned about 100,000 bodies of Leningraders who died of starvation.  In Soviet times, the park was built many attractions for visitors, including the ice rink. </p>
