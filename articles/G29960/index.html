    <p>  The subject of <span>economic theory</span> is as complex and multifaceted as human life is complex and dynamic.  Therefore, it is impossible to give him such a definition that would be suitable for all stages of the development of society. </p><p>  On the <span>subject of economic</span> theory, attitudes changed as knowledge of human <span>activities</span> deepened.  Her (activity) complication also influenced the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhim. </p><p>  At first it was believed that the subject of economic theory is to increase the material well-being of people, or rather, its causes.  Later, ideas about him were associated, on the contrary, with the rarity of the resources available to the individual.  Of course, the <span>possibilities of people are</span> limited.  But at the same time, there are many options for using available resources. </p><p>  Describing the subject of economic theory, it is worth noting that it does not directly include the study of everything that is accessible to man.  His competence is the study of human behavior associated with the distribution, production, consumption of goods (intangible or tangible).  It is for this reason that this science belongs to the humanitarian field. </p><p>  The subject of economic theory has many definitions.  So, <span>A. Marshall</span> attributed to him the collective and individual actions of people associated with the production and use of material objects symbolizing wealth.  P. Samuelson defined it as human behavior, manifested during the selection of resources that have a limitation, in order to manufacture new goods.  But the most concise and accurate is the wording given by Robbins, an English economist.  He argued that the subject of economic theory is the form of human behavior that occurs during the disposal of rare resources.  The relation between the infinite means and the purposes of their use is taken into account.  When a person has several possibilities of using resources, he is faced with the problem of the right choice. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Economic theory is a creative science.  It is non-stop enriched with knowledge, respectively, the subject of its research is constantly expanding and refined.  In the context of the ongoing socialization and intellectualization of public life, the globalization of processes in the economy, the <span>subject area of</span> this science is developing in the direction of complicating its problems.  Additional layers of social relations are involved in scientific research. </p><p>  The following features are characteristic of the modern development of economic theory: </p><p>  - rejection of the mandatory criteria of truth, claiming universality; </p><p>  - the multidirectionality of scientific creativity, methods and structure of knowledge, the possibility of synthesis of ideas and theoretical concepts; </p><p>  - the expansion of the traditional problems of economic theory on the basis of those dynamic, complex processes that are generated by global tasks and arise in the course of social transformations; </p><p>  - introduction of new methods of analysis into research; </p><p>  - mutual influence and tolerant competition between ideas and cognitive approaches, which helps to expand the vision in conflicting opinions. </p><p>  Modern domestic economic theory must take into account the national historical component, as it takes into account the characteristics of the country's economy, its capabilities, as well as the mentality of the people in this area and other points. </p><p>  Summarizing the above, we can consider the <span>subject of science</span> in the aspect of political economy.  This definition reveals it much deeper and more multifaceted. </p><p>  So, the subject of this science is the laws of development of all systems of the economy and the activities of subjects focused on the successful management of the economy even in conditions of lack of resources in order to satisfy their needs, as a rule, unlimited. </p>
