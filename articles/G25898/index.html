  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Owl egg: description, purpose, photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you want to bring real joy to the baby, have fun and original games with him, have fun, then such a thing as an Owl Egg will bring a lot of new positive emotions to your life!  This soft and comfortable cocoon will give a feeling of inaccessibility, inaccessibility and security from the outside world.  Here the baby will be happy - because there are no prohibitions, and the expanse for activity will increase!  Any flips, skating, jumping, playing snails and turtles - everything is now available! </p><h2>  Owl egg for children - what is it? </h2><p>  A device for games, which is a soft bag in the shape of a ball, where it is possible to hide and hide from the world, as in a warm and cozy house. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eko-gamak.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cozy egg" class="if uuid-2928527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2928527.jpg"></div><p>  The prototype for the appearance of the Owl Egg is Kisling Egg.  It was invented by a German specialist in the sensoric-integral development of children, Ulla Kiesling.  In such a ball-bag, babies feel the same as in their mother‚Äôs stomach.  They can tumble, roll, kick, in short, do whatever they want. </p><h2>  Impressions of specialists from a cocoon egg </h2><p>  Enthusiastic reviews come from both children and adults. </p><p>  Pediatricians notice that while inside, the kids are focused only on what they feel.  This allows you to touch them, and even more so - the children are waiting for such a touch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sometimes children for one reason or another are afraid of somersaults and rifts.  With the help of such a wonderful bag, it suddenly becomes real and quite doable!  There is even a realization that is difficult to dream of working with such children - the achievement of bodily contact, because, being in a reliable cocoon, the child feels in a safe zone.  This is the reason that allows the baby to bear touch, stroking and patting. </p><p>  Specialists use Owl eggs in the rehabilitation of both healthy children and anxious babies with sleep disorders, autism, cerebral palsy, etc. A small person can feel, and therefore, calm down. </p><p>  In modern medicine, which deals with the correction of developmental abnormalities, the egg-cocoon is a powerful and interesting tool that is very often present during classes on sensory and integration. </p><h2>  What is an egg used for? </h2><p>  Each of us in childhood built tents from rugs, bedspreads and other soft devices.  Now our children are doing this.  And this is no coincidence!  Each kid subconsciously seeks to hide from the world in a safe place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.babyblog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="so safe to hide" class="if uuid-2928516" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2928516.jpg"></div><p>  This, of course, is not scary.  The only minus is a pile of blankets and other improvised means, which then need to be disassembled and laid out in places.  This is sometimes very annoying! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In this direction of assistance in the development of the child, as sensory integration, the Owl Egg is used in every way.  Suppose adults can circle or shake the baby, for which special loops are sewn on top.  For them, you can hang the bag on specially provided ropes with carbines - here you have an amazing hammock, which is very similar to a drop!  But you can easily slip out of a hammock-drop, but to get out of a cocoon egg, you must try! </p><div class="photo" data-original="nannyowl.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="original cradle" class="if uuid-2928509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2928509.jpg"></div><p>  To stimulate the development of children, this device is unique in its kind and indispensable assistant.  The little man feels his body, grows and becomes healthy, smart and happy, and the bag perfectly contributes to the development of the proprioceptive and vestibular system.  The child receives a lot of the latest sensations, experiences a lot of the brightest emotions, begins to listen to himself. </p><p>  Through touch and sensation, we all draw information about what is happening around.  It is difficult for children to organize all the information.  They hardly manage to establish relations with the outside world, sometimes very cruel. </p><p>  Even absolutely healthy children are sometimes confused, to say nothing of those that require a special approach.  When the connections between the receptors and the brain are weakened or broken, perception problems begin - the child becomes anxious, irritable and tearful.  Urgent need to come to his aid - this is where the magic of the Owl Egg begins! </p><p>  Everything is streamlined, falls into place, communication is much easier, the assimilation of new knowledge is in full swing, there is an excellent adaptation in the team. </p><p>  So, the Egg is the most effective tool in the development of special kids and entertainment for the rest. </p><h2>  Device </h2><p>  In those products that are on sale, the "shell" are five components. </p><p>  Two layers - external and internal - are sewn from a very delicate and pleasant mixed fabric (cotton with polyester).  Three middle layers are filled with filler, which must be heavy and of high quality.  There should not be any crumpled and unpleasant to the touch materials, otherwise the feeling of comfort and safety will be lost. </p><p>  All layers of quilted - this gives the bag strength and reliability. </p><p>  As you can see from the photo, it‚Äôs easy to get into the Owl‚Äôs Egg.  This is done through a hole located on top. </p><div class="photo" data-original="metodplatforma.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="child rehabilitation" class="if uuid-2928540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2928540.jpg"></div><p>  Also on the sides there are very strong loops for which you can hang the cocoon to the ceiling, swing and carry the bag. </p><p>  The sizes of the eggs offered for sale are different: </p><ul><li>  The tiniest is the size of the XS.  It is intended for babies up to five years, an approximate diameter of 55 cm. </li><li>  For the next size S, the diameter will be 66 cm. Suitable for children from six to eight years. </li><li>  There are even medium and large eggs.  They are played by children from nine to twelve years of age and older.  Sizes M and L correspond to diameters of 70 and 80 cm. </li></ul><h2>  Tools and materials for creating a cocoon </h2><p>  This thing is certainly wonderful, but there is a significant minus.  Its cost is high - not everyone can afford to buy it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="club.season.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fun entertainment" class="if uuid-2928504" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2928504.jpg"></div><p>  But you can sew Owl Egg with your own hands from materials that are available. </p><p>  So, prepare the following tools and components: </p><ul><li>  two blankets from padding polyester; </li><li>  soft fabric - terry and fleece; </li><li>  synthetic winterizer; </li><li>  a zipper that can open on both sides; </li><li>  Velcro tape or zipper; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  needles; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  sewing machine; </li><li>  a piece of old wallpaper - to build patterns; </li><li>  measuring tape and ruler; </li><li>  pencil. </li></ul><h2>  Sew Owl Egg do it yourself </h2><p>  First, as with any sewing job, you will need to take measurements from your baby.  The growth of the child is important - the size of the egg depends on it. </p><p>  The size of the eggs, as already mentioned above, is different, and the diameter should be a mark in 2/3 of the growth.  This is done because a very spacious egg will not give a feeling of comfort; it will not work to take shelter in an embryo position.  A narrow device also does not seem comfortable for the baby. </p><p>  Next, take the wallpaper and build a pattern, focusing on the measurements taken. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mirtilda.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="egg pattern" class="if uuid-2928560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2928560.jpg"></div><p>  Transfer the contours using chalk to a blanket, fabric and synthetic winterizer.  There should be 6 pieces of such petal parts from each type of material.  We sew all parts together, leaving one seam open.  We put all the parts in order - a blanket, synthetic winterizer, fleece, blanket. </p><p>  Based on the age of the child or your preferences, at the last stage, either a zipper is sewn, which the child can open from the outside or inside, or a Velcro tape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="game in the house" class="if uuid-2928514" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2928514.jpg"></div><p>  That's all!  Our wonderful Owl Egg is ready for fun and educational games! </p>
