Abu Dhabi, Fujairah, Sharjah, Dubai - today the fastest growing and most progressive cities in the world. </p><p>  Although in our time the emirate of Dubai bears the title of world financial, tourism, investment "Mecca", the rest of the UAE cities also have a lot of remarkable things, and they obviously should not be ignored.  Naturally, such a bizarre mix of engineering psychedelics, huge money and indefatigable fantasies, like in Dubai, is not shown in any other city, but this does not mean that the neighboring emirates are like desert fishing villages. </p><h2>  Why vacation in Sharjah is more profitable than in Dubai? </h2><p>  North of Dubai, just 20 km away, is another curious emirate - Sharjah.  Its main advantage over Dubai is budget.  Indeed, the prices for hotel rooms, for sunbeds on the beaches, for travel, etc. in Sharjah are lower. </p><p>  That is why it is often chosen by business travelers for meetings, events, conferences, etc. </p><p>  Well, if the soul asks for a holiday, admiration, impressions or the mark ‚ÄúI was in Dubai‚Äù, then this pathos city is located only 10 minutes from calm Sharjah. </p><p>  There is one more cultural nuance that cannot be noted.  The fact is that Dubai has long become a cosmopolitan city, relatively tolerant of tourists, where gin is sold in supermarkets and wine is poured in restaurants.  Well, other "sins" are open and accessible: risky acquaintances, partying, yacht parties, night clubs, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Al Majaz Hotel 3 *" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/2078519.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And all the tourist tales about the orthodox fidelity of the Arabs of Dubai to their own religious canons do not quite correspond to reality. </p><p>  But in Sharjah, tourists are not too worried about tourist tolerance.  The customs in this emirate are more strict.  In public places, Sharjah does not sell alcohol, in hotels they do not have parties, and on the streets there is a dress code: closed shoulders and knees. </p><h2>  Al Majaz Hotel 3 * Sharjah.  general information </h2><p>  A budget but decent three-star hotel in the European style is located almost in the center of Sharjah.  The hotel was built in 2015.  It consists of one building on 14 floors. </p><p>  In total, Al Majaz Hotel has 3 * 168 rooms.  The hotel has all facilities for guests with disabilities.  All hotel rooms are non-smoking, there are public smoking areas.  Pets are not allowed.  The hotel has English-speaking staff.  Check-in occurs after 14:00, check-out is until 12:00. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Hotel Al Majaz Hotel 3 * is located in the central district of Sharjah Emirate.  Dubai International Airport is 17 km, and <span>Sharjah Airport</span> is 16 km. </p><p>  The hotel is 1.9 km from the center of Sharjah.  Near the hotel (less than 10 meters) there is a metro station and a bus stop.  Emirates has free buses.  If you buy a local newspaper, you can find out the timetable and travel absolutely free to Dubai for excursions and entertainment.  You can take a taxi to Dubai for about 1,700 rubles.  Almost 2 km from the hotel is Port Khalid and Sharjah Aquarium. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Within walking distance from the hotel there is the central "Blue Market" - this is a very colorful oriental shopping area where you can "shop around" in an interesting and exciting way. </p><p>  Also nearby is Mega Shopping Center - for European-style shopping enthusiasts. </p><h2>  Points of interest in the area around the hotel </h2><p>  Naturally, there are few tourists who decide to deny themselves a trip to Dubai to look at the Dubai Mall, the Khalifa Tower, the <span>Burj Al Arab Hotel, the</span> Fountain Complex, etc. But there are plenty of places for a pleasant excursion in Sharjah . </p><p>  In the evening, you can spend time walking along the al-Qasb promenade.  Sharjah also has a large aquarium and an amusement park.  For example, the Ferris wheel ‚ÄúEye‚Äù 60 meters high is also popular among tourists.  You can ride for 30 dirhams, it's a little less than 500 rubles.  Sharjah also has its own fountain complex, it is located in Al Majas Park.  To get to the show, you need to come from 19:00 to midnight. </p><p>  But most of all in Sharjah are sights related to culture and traditions: museums, ancient buildings (Sharjah Al-Hish fort, archeology museum, Al Markazi Blue Market, museum of the old Al Mahat airport, King Faisal mosque).  Sharjah was also declared by UNESCO as the capital of Arab culture back in 1998. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Infrastructure on the territory of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Such a sophistication as a vast territory cannot be afford by any budget hotel in the UAE.  The reason is the high cost of each meter of Arab land.  But hotel managers know how to maximize each centimeter of precious area.  By the way, even the most budget hotels never save on the personal space of guests.  The hotel rooms are relatively spacious, but tennis courts or equestrian areas are not equipped. </p><p>  Al Majaz Hotel 3 * (United Arab Emirates, Sharjah) does not have a large territory, but in terms of infrastructure, the hotel knows what to offer guests.  There are two restaurants and cafes, a conference room, a business center, parking, a gift shop, newspapers, a banquet room, a luggage room, and a gym. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Al Majaz Premiere Hotel Apartments 3 *" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/2078517.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Sharjah Beach </h2><p>  Hotel Al Majaz Hotel 3 * Sharjah is not focused on the reception of resort tourists.  It is located 3 km from Al Khan Municipal Beach.  A large number of vacationers find this location uncomfortable, even though the hotel has a free shuttle to the coast.  Sharjah's municipal beaches are all on the selection.  They are well-groomed, smooth, equipped, but crowded.  Most tourists can be seen on Al Khan Beach.  This is a paid beach, the entrance costs 80 rubles, a sunbed and an umbrella - a little more than 300 rubles. </p><p>  The entrance to the sea is smooth and gentle, the waves are not high, the sea is as clean as the Persian Gulf can be. </p><p>  But lovers of a classic sea holiday in combination with European comfort can be advised by Al Majaz Premiere Hotel Apartments 3 *, which has its own beach. </p><p>  Al Cornish Beach is not so crowded.  It is wide and surrounded by palm trees, quite picturesque.  Entrance to this public beach is free, but there is a code of conduct, as locals often relax in this place.  Women are forbidden to sunbathe topless, everyone is forbidden to take alcohol, behave defiantly, etc. </p><p>  Sometimes strong undercurrents occur in the Al Cornish area.  This is always reported on special stands and projectors.  You need to be careful and adequately evaluate your own swimming abilities. </p><p>  Like in Dubai, in Sharjah, Monday is Women's Day on municipal beaches.  Men are not allowed to visit some free beaches that day.  On Mondays, local ladies have the opportunity to sunbathe without hijabs.  This does not always apply to private hotel beaches. </p><h2>  Reviews on Al Majaz Hotel Sharjah 3 * </h2><p>  Tourists, as a rule, spoke positively about the time of their stay at the hotel.  There are no categorically negative reviews about the hotel on any of the resources.  The hotel received a large number of laudatory reviews thanks to the correct price-quality ratio.  The guests were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness, service, courtesy and helpfulness of the staff, stylish, functional rooms, good <span>continental breakfasts.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Al Majaz Hotel 3 * United Arab Emirates" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44221/2078513.jpg"></div>  Also, travelers in reviews of Al Majaz Hotel 3 * found a convenient location of the hotel, proximity to shopping centers and a metro station.  Small parking and the lack of territory as such, a pool, some tourists noted as an inconvenience.  But a large area with parks and gardens is something that, as a rule, hotels in Sharjah and Dubai cannot boast of.
