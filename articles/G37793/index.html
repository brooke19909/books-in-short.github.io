    <h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  Even such a simple product as a <span>crocheted knit dress</span> for a girl of 2 years old (many publications offer schemes in abundance) must be done carefully and in compliance with certain rules.  Therefore, in the first place it is worth conducting such events: </p><ol><li>  Take measurements.  It is required to measure the girth of the chest, the length of the product, the depth of the armholes and the neck.  If the dress will be with sleeves, it is also necessary to measure the length of the arm and shoulder. </li><li>  Choose yarn and knitting pattern. </li><li>  Knit a control sample.  Particular attention should be paid to this stage, since the correct calculations of loops and rows will allow you to complete all the details the first time and avoid blooming.  This is especially true when a dress is crocheted from motifs.  The pattern must be knitted using all types of yarn selected for the dress.  You also need to knit all the patterns that will be used in the knitting process. </li><li>  Make calculations.  To do this, you can draw diagrams of future details on paper and use the mathematical proportion to calculate how many loops and rows you need to knit. </li></ol><p>  Often, if a <span>simple dress is</span> crocheted for a 2-year-old girl (pattern designs for such products are presented in the form of a flat cloth), they do not make a pattern.  A product of this size can only be performed according to calculations.  But the pattern will help in the manufacture of more complex models: from typesetting, Irish lace or with difficult parts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The most common types of dresses </h2><p>  Based on the appearance and method of knitting, dresses can be: </p><ul><li>  With a yoke. </li><li>  Straight. </li><li>  Dense. </li><li>  Fishnet. </li><li>  With one piece canvas. </li><li>  With typesetting canvas. </li></ul><p>  With a little experience, you should not try to crochet a too complicated dress.  For beginners, it is better to consider the manufacturing options for the simplest models.  These include items associated with a single piece of fabric. </p><h2>  Straight dresses </h2><p>  Such models are knitted from the bottom up.  Using pre-calculated numbers, loops are drawn and the fabric is knitted with the selected pattern to a height equal to the length of the product to the armpits.  Then the loops are cut to form armholes and necks and continue to work.  If the dress is warm, then the execution of the neck should begin several rows after the beginning of the armholes. </p><p>  Detail of the backrest is performed in a similar manner.  Further, all parts are steamed with an iron or washed.  At the finish stage, the parts are stitched, and all open sections of the canvas are tied.  A great way to decorate such a <span>simple dress</span> is to use decorative straps and borders. </p><p>  A crochet dress for a 2-year-old girl (solid patterns are easiest for beginners) will not require much time and material.  Depending on the model and pattern, it can take about 300 grams of yarn and from one to three days of work. </p><h2>  <span>Flirty Dresses:</span> Straight </h2><p>  Coquette is the upper part of the dress, connected separately or knitted in one piece with details of the front and back.  Visually, the coquette differs from the rest of the canvas in the pattern, color or direction of knitting. </p><p>  Before crocheting a dress, it is worth considering options for knitting various flirts.  In the form and method of manufacture, they can be: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Straight. </li><li>  Round. </li><li>  Rectangular. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet dress of motifs" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1172399.jpg" width="420"></div></li></ul><p>  The method of implementation of the first is obvious: this is a part connected by a straight canvas, taking into account the shape of the armholes and neck.  The photo above shows an example of a dress with a straight yoke. </p><h2>  Knitting round and rectangular yoke </h2><p>  Round coquette knit in circular rows, evenly expanding the fabric across the entire width of the row.  Quite often, such coquette is performed with openwork, using schemes for napkins. </p><p>  Squared coquets are the most common and simple in execution.  They also fit in a circle, but additions are performed at four points in the row.  The diagram below shows a method for knitting such a yoke. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet dress for girls 2 years scheme" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1172401.jpg" width="377"></div>

    <p>  It is open for fastening the fastener, but you can close the first row of air loops in a ring and then knit a whole yoke.  In the same diagram is a pattern illustrating the circular principle of expansion of a knitted fabric.  It is suitable for making a round yoke or a fluffy skirt dresses. </p><h2>  Ways to expand the canvas </h2><p>  Often, dresses for girls include a skirt that extends downward.  The dress itself can be connected evenly or contain a yoke, but the extension starts from the line of the chest, just below the armhole. </p><p>  In the following photo, <span>a crocheted dress for a girl of</span> 2 years.  The diagrams illustrate the entire knitting process, including the expansion of the bottom of the product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet a dress" class="if" height="493" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1172400.jpg" width="418"></div><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet dress for beginners" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1172398.jpg" width="366"></div>  Here the technique of the formation of two wedges is applied: on the details of the front and back.  The loops are added only along the inner side of the wedge, along vertical lines.  Thus, the sections of the dress on the sides remain flat.  If desired, similar additions can be made on both sides of the vertical lines, then the dress will become very wide and magnificent.

    <p>  Dress crocheted from motifs does not allow expansion, so these models are simply made.  Alternatively, a wide skirt made up of fragments is picked up at the waist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="simple crochet dress" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1172396.jpg" width="373"></div>

    <p>  It is very convenient to expand the fabric while knitting patterns with longitudinal stripes.  On the example of a turquoise <span>openwork dress,</span> you can see that gradually its elements ‚Äúbushes‚Äù increase due to the knitting of more columns.  Also, closer to the lower edge of the product, the mesh size is increased. </p><p>  The described tips and recommendations will tell you how to crochet a dress and avoid the most common mistakes when doing work. </p>
