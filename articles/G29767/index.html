Despite its small size, a lot of vacationers flock here every summer.  What does it attract a large number of tourists? </p><h2>  Description of the lake </h2><p>  Sweet Lake is located in the Chelyabinsk region in the Oktyabrsky district.  From Chelyabinsk to the reservoir 180 km.  Three kilometers from the lake is the village of Kocherdyk. </p><p>  As already mentioned, the size of the lake is small, its area is 0.32 km <sup>2</sup> .  It is also shallow, on average, the depth varies from 1 to 1.5 meters.  In the deepest place only 1.8 m. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sweet lake" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1091315.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are no living creatures in the lake, no fish, no small organisms, no algae.  Reeds grow along the coast, but the birds do not want to twist their houses in it.  Birch trees and pines grow sparse on the shore and the nearest territory, but a huge forest grows a little further in the north and east, where you can pick berries or mushrooms.  Penetrating onion, which is considered a fairly rare plant, was also found in these places. </p><p>  Sweet Lake (Chelyabinsk region) and its environs belong to the Kocherdyk reserve.  Also in the fall in 1987, it was called a hydrological natural monument of regional significance. </p><h2>  Lake features </h2><p>  This small body of water is located in a basin of suffosive origin and is located among the strata of sedimentary continental rocks.  It is possible that Sweet is the remnant of an ancient lake, which at one time was much larger, but in the process of evaporation it accumulated a large amount of salts.  The salt composition of the local water is more alkaline.  But Sladkoe Lake has another feature - there are mineral mud at its bottom that has a healing effect.  By genesis, this self-settling soda-type reservoir is very similar to the lakes in Altai and Kulunda. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sweet lake Chelyabinsk" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1091314.jpg" width="600"></div>

This phenomenon is explained by abundant deposition of mineral salts.  Local water also contains a large amount of alkali, and that is why it seems too soft. </p><p>  Water was sampled, it turned out that in a liter contains 124.8 mg of mineral salts.  The predominant ions were sodium, boron, chlorine, hydrocarbonates, salicylic acid compounds, as well as other salts. </p><h2>  Healing properties </h2><p>  Given the composition of lake water, Sweet is overly popular.  People regularly come to its shores not only from the region, but from other countries.  The lake generously presents all visitors who arrived with health.  Water and lake mud have a healing effect, increase the human immunity, eliminate inflammatory processes and accelerate the healing of wounds.  If there are diseases in the oral cavity, they can be solved on this lake.  But the most successful here is the treatment of skin problems.  That is why in the summer season on the shores of many people wandering in the mud. </p><p>  Healing water and mud help people cope with allergies, diseases of the intestines, stomach, musculoskeletal system, periodontal disease, hair diseases, etc. </p><h2>  Recreation facilities </h2>

Only on one shore there is a recreation center.  Sladkoe Lake mainly accepts tourists who have a rest as a savage.  The existing complex is the former sanatorium "Birch", now called the recreation center "Sweet".  It includes several one-story wooden houses.  The conditions in the rooms are ordinary, not designed for special additional amenities.

At the same time, tourists who want to live longer and not pay anything for this come on the other side of the hot season.  Therefore, almost the whole summer there is a tent camp - some leave, others take their place.  Such unorganized tourism has led to the fact that the territory becomes unsightly.  People do not want to clean up the trash for themselves, go to the toilet ‚Äúwherever they need it‚Äù, make bonfires, but thoughtlessly cut down a birch grove, while also leaving home, they collect dirt ‚Äúin reserve‚Äù.  Also, greedy entrepreneurs take out the healing wealth.

    <p>  Due to such selfish use, the Sladkoye lake becomes smaller every year and turns into a pile of garbage.  Back in Soviet times, this place was recognized as healing.  But the authorities decided not to build sanatoriums, since the resources of this reservoir are limited.  Today, this area lacks such a wise owner who could take control of the use of resources. </p>
