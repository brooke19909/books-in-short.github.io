All stores are inundated with superb models.  They almost put ice in your glass of whiskey.  Nevertheless, not all models for a thousand dollars are suitable for everyone.  Why spend money on an expensive thing, the half of the options of which you still will not use?  There is a great model from the middle price segment.  This is the LG GA-B409UMQA refrigerator.  Its characteristics are such that it will suit almost everyone, even the most sophisticated.  We will definitely consider it in more detail.  But first, let's talk a little about the company itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallpapercave.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="refrigerator lg ga b409umqa reviews" class="if uuid-2952545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2952545.jpg"></div><h2>  A little about the manufacturer </h2><p>  LG was founded in 1947 in Seoul (South Korea) and specialized in the production of household chemicals.  The journey from chemicals to electronics took nearly 40 years.  The first electronic device was released by the company in the 80s of the XX century.  From that moment, LG became a prominent player in the consumer electronics market.  First there were televisions, microwave ovens, refrigerators and other household appliances.  Then the company decided to start producing mobile phones.  During the boom of smartphones, the company tried to keep up, but it did poorly for her.  Nevertheless, her household appliances sold out well.  Currently, the situation with smartphones has stabilized.  LG regularly introduces new models and boasts impressive sales.  At the same time, the company is closely involved in the development and production of household appliances.  The LG GA-B409UMQA refrigerator (two-chamber, silver) is a vivid example of this.  Now let's take a closer look at this product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="mcgrp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="refrigerator lg ga b409umqa specifications" class="if uuid-2952549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2952549.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  So, let's take a closer look at the product.  The LG GA-B409UMQA refrigerator, reviews of which we will analyze in the following sections, has a very modern design.  Its edges are rounded so that it looks more like a spaceship.  The refrigerator itself is two-chamber and quite high.  On the upper door there is a control panel for device options.  The unit is painted in strict silver color and polished.  This allows it to fit perfectly into any interior, and makes its appearance modern.  The refrigerator doors are made of thin aluminum with plastic inserts.  The dimensions of the unit are pretty impressive.  Its height is 189.6 centimeters, its width is 59.5 cm, and its depth is 65.1 cm. The full volume of the refrigerator is 322 liters.  It is clear that with such dimensions it will not fit in a miniature kitchen.  And even if it fits, it will take up unreasonably much space.  However, it is enough to talk about his appearance.  We turn to the characteristics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="max.kg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="refrigerator lg ga b409umqa instruction" class="if uuid-2952559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2952559.jpg"></div><h2>  Key Specifications </h2><p>  What can be said about the technical specifications of the LG GA-B409UMQA refrigerator?  User reviews in this regard are unambiguous: they are excellent at the unit.  And this is true.  This model uses an advanced cooling system - No Frost (and this is with one compressor).  This means that you do not have to defrost the refrigerator (like the old Soviet ones).  Also, the device boasts several operating modes, among which the "Vacation" stands out.  In this mode, the refrigerator is almost inactive and consumes ridiculously little energy.  Speaking of consumption.  This device consumes 369 kWh per year.  This is a great result.  The usable volume of the freezer is 87 liters.  This is quite enough to freeze fruit for the winter.  There will also be plenty of room for meat stocks.  This is one of the quietest refrigerators on the market.  Its noise level is only 42 dB.  Many printers are louder.  Also in the refrigerator there is a very useful option of superfreezing.  It is used in cases where you need to quickly freeze a product through and through (for example, homemade ice cream).  However, let's move on to other features of the refrigerator. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="kurgan.eto1.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="refrigerator lg ga b409umqa description" class="if uuid-2952561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2952561.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional refrigerator options </h2><p>  What else can please the LG GA-B409UMQA refrigerator?  A description of it would be incomplete without listing additional options.  So, this unit has a built-in lock that allows you to protect it from curious children.  This is a very useful option.  There is also electronic control (buttons with a soft coating) and an LCD screen that is bright and informative.  Inside the refrigerator there are special fruit compartments, a ventilation system (to eliminate the unpleasant smell of food), a special shelf for eggs and 7 door balconies.  There is an option to separately adjust the temperature in the freezer and the refrigerator itself.  Also, do not forget about the possibility of outweighing the doors if something prevents them from opening in a given direction (for example, a wall).  We can say that this refrigerator has a pretty good set of options for a budget device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="control Panel" class="if uuid-2953649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2953649.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive feedback from owners </h2><p>  The best way to find out about the properties of the selected product is to read the reviews of those who have already managed to purchase such a model.  And what about the LG GA-B409UMQA refrigerator?  Owner reviews are mostly positive.  Many say that the refrigerator has been working fine for several years.  And yes, it really does not need to be defrosted.  Fans of travel are delighted with the "Vacation" option.  When using it, the refrigerator does not even need to be turned off if a person leaves somewhere for a month or two.  A very useful option is the LG GA-B409UMQA refrigerator.  The instruction manual will give more information on its use.  By the way, it comes complete and has a rather adequate Russian translation.  The owners also claim that the refrigerator is surprisingly quiet.  Even in super freeze mode.  In general, the vast majority of those who purchased this unit consider it to be the best refrigerator for their money.  By the way, they also consider the price a great advantage.  Some admit that it was she who stimulated them to acquire this particular model. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kurgan.eto1.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fridge lg ga b409umqa two-compartment silver" class="if uuid-2952565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2952565.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative owner reviews </h2><p>  However, there are those who are not satisfied with the LG GA-B409UMQA refrigerator.  Negative reviews are very rare.  And almost all of them touch on only one topic - the absence of an economy mode (ECO).  The main argument that dissatisfied owners push on is that in all other models this mode is.  Unfortunately, to reduce the cost of the final product, the manufacturer had to give up some functions.  Before buying a refrigerator, you should familiarize yourself with the full list of technical specifications and options so that the absence of any of them does not become an unpleasant surprise.  If the presence of a saving mode is of fundamental importance, then it is worth taking a closer look at more expensive models of refrigerators. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we reviewed the refrigerator <span>LG GA B409UMQA.</span>  <span>The reviews of the</span> owners of this unit are mostly positive.  Almost everyone is satisfied with the technical characteristics of the refrigerator, its functionality and price.  In general, this refrigerator is one of the best in its price segment.  And it is definitely worth buying, if there is such an opportunity. </p>
