    <h2>  What upsets tourists? </h2><p>  Fans of fishing are just expanse here.  But, sharing their impressions, they complain that earlier in these places it was possible to catch <span>more fish</span> and scallop. </p><p>  This may be due to the fact that there are more tourists.  It is difficult to sit at home and not go on vacation.  Primorsky Krai attracts connoisseurs of irresistible nature, fishermen.  Apparently, therefore, fish in these places is no longer caught in such quantities as before. </p><p>  But in any case, the base ‚ÄúBay Calm‚Äù (Nakhodka) will not disappoint.  Holidays in the bosom of fantastic nature, on the shores of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan, in silence, will be remembered for a long time, and you will want to come back here more than once.  After all, many, having been here once, come again and again. </p>
