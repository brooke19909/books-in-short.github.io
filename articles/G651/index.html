Existing buildings are not always suitable in size, layout and location.  Therefore, often there is a need for the construction of a private building.  To do this, you can perform the work yourself or with the help of experienced specialists.  In order to get a high-quality, safe and reliable structure, all stages of building a house must be correctly implemented, the best materials used and numerous unique technologies must be followed. </p><h2>  Land selection </h2><p>  The first stage of the construction of a residential building is to select the optimal plot of land on which the planned work will be carried out.  When choosing a territory, some important points are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  the existing infrastructure is assessed, since it is preferable that different shops, clinics, kindergartens, schools or other objects significant for each person are located nearby; </li><li>  taking into account the necessary communications to the ground, due to which the comfort of living in the building is ensured; </li><li>  the possibility of creating an asphalt porch is determined, since if there is a primer, it can be difficult to use the house in the rain or in winter. </li></ul><p>  First you need to find out the purpose of the territory and its category, since the land should be specifically intended for private housing construction, otherwise the construction of a residential building on it will act as a serious offense, so the court will decide on the demolition of the object. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thebalance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stages of construction of a residential building" class="if uuid-2270993" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2270993.jpg"></div><h2>  Urban Plan Approval </h2><p>  The stages of building a house necessarily include this process, since without a building permit any building will be considered unauthorized, therefore, there may be difficulties with its design, and even a court decision on its demolition can be made. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During the formation and approval of the urban development plan, the district location and various other legal issues are taken into account. </p><h2>  Create Topographic Survey </h2><p>  This process is included even in the stages of building a house with your own hands, since without it difficulties may arise in the construction of the foundation or walls of a building.  In addition, geological studies are carried out. </p><p>  The main objectives of these actions are to obtain information: </p><ul><li>  main parameters of the existing landscape; </li><li>  all groundwater and its depth are identified, and this factor directly affects the safety of the use of the future structure; </li><li>  Determines the condition and composition of the soil, which has a direct impact on the ability of a particular type of foundation. </li></ul><p>  Based on the data obtained after the study, it is possible to determine which materials are appropriate for construction, as well as which technology will be optimal for this territory. </p><h2>  Project Formation </h2><p>  Designing is an obligatory process, which is part of the construction stages of an apartment building or a private residential building.  It should be carried out exclusively by experienced professionals, so you have to contact the appropriate specialized organization. </p><p>  From a competent project depends on how comfortable and safe it will be to live in real estate, what will be its appearance.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe entire facility and each room is taken into account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="capefearsolarsystems.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stages of building a house from aerated concrete" class="if uuid-2270995" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2270995.jpg"></div><p>  Only experienced architects and designers are engaged in creating the project, and for this they take into account different sanitary standards, building requirements and fire safety conditions.  During this process, the climatic conditions of the area, the allocated budget for construction, the seismological situation and many other significant factors are taken into account. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is impossible to create a project without special skills and special computer programs on its own, as it must not only be correct, but must be accepted by the architectural and construction department of the regional administration. </p><h2>  Search for a construction team </h2><p>  It is important to decide whether the construction of the house will be implemented independently or with the help of invited specialists.  In the second case, you will have to spend a lot of money on the salaries of specialists, but you can be sure that all the norms will be met and the existing project will be implemented correctly. </p><p>  With independent work, you can save a lot of money, but at the same time it is likely to make a lot of mistakes. </p><p>  When choosing builders, their competence, work experience, qualifications, available equipment are taken into account, and it is also advisable to study already completed projects. </p><div class="photo" data-original="richardharrislaw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stages of the construction of an apartment building" class="if uuid-2271000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2271000.jpg"></div><h2>  Site preparation </h2><p>  After all the preparatory processes, the direct construction of the structure begins.  The first stages of building a house involve the <span>preparation of a construction site.</span>  To do this, the following actions are performed: </p><ul><li>  the territory is initially fenced in order to prevent unauthorized persons from entering the construction site who might steal expensive building materials or take other negative actions; </li><li>  then the territory is cleared, therefore various unnecessary living plantations are eliminated, and existing buildings are demolished if necessary; </li><li>  they are brought to the place where the foundation of the future structure will directly be located, utilities; </li><li>  temporary housing facilities are being formed for workers and landowners. </li></ul><p>  It is advisable at this stage of the construction of a residential building to provide for the possibility of protecting concrete and other structures from rain. </p><h2>  Marking </h2><p>  This process requires competent calculation and constant checks.  Based on it, it is determined where the building will be located on the territory. </p><p>  Marking is applied in different ways, but it should be taken with a small margin.  During operation, specialists must use laser or some other measuring equipment. </p><p>  If there are deviations, then in the future it will be almost impossible to correct such an error. </p><h2>  Earthworks </h2><p>  This procedure is included in the stages of building a house from aerated concrete or any other material.  Without earthworks, the process of building any capital structure is impossible.  All works are divided into several stages: </p><ul><li>  leveling the territory; </li><li>  digging a foundation pit for founding a house; </li><li>  laying trenches intended for laying elements of communication networks. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.aconcordcarpenter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY home construction steps" class="if uuid-2271004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2271004.jpg"></div><p>  During this stage of building a private house, you will need to use different specialized equipment, represented by various excavators or bulldozers. </p><h2>  Foundation formation </h2><p>  A significant load acts on it, so the base must be strong and durable.  The type of foundation depends entirely on the available soil, the depth of groundwater and other factors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="webbkyrkan.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="home construction stages photo" class="if uuid-2271015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2271015.jpg"></div><p>  The base may be pile, slab or columnar.  The number of floors in the future building, the material for creating walls and other features are taken into account.  At this stage of building a house from a bar, you can use a light foundation, but if a brick structure is being erected, the foundation should be more durable. </p><p>  During operation, it is important to first make a bed of gravel from sand, as well as use waterproofing materials.  Next, a base is formed, for which concrete can be poured into the formwork or piles can be installed, which are then fastened with a grillage. </p><p>  It is recommended to wait about a year before the implementation of subsequent work, since at this time the foundation will shrink. </p><h2>  Erection of external walls </h2><p>  In the photo, the stage of building a house, involving the erection of walls of a brick structure, consists in the phased laying of bricks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="housebestdesign.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stages of building a house from a bar" class="if uuid-2271025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2271025.jpg"></div><p>  The process depends on the materials used, therefore, blocks of aerated concrete or foam concrete can be glued together, wooden elements can be fastened or other similar work can be performed. </p><p>  The procedure depends on the chosen construction technology.  If a two-story building is planned, then reliable floors of reinforced concrete are laid between the floors. </p><h2>  The construction of internal partitions </h2><p>  At this stage of building a house, you need to focus on the existing project.  It indicates where all the walls of the structure should be located. </p><p>  Partitions can be created from the same material as the external walls, but they are made thinner.  It is also allowed to use other materials. </p><h2>  Communication Summary </h2><p>  To do this, through a special hole in the foundation, water and gas are supplied, as well as a sewer system.  The building is connected to electricity. </p><p>  It is desirable to create trenches for communications at the stage of excavation.  Laying is done on a special dense substrate with the mandatory use of waterproofing materials. </p><h2>  Roof installation </h2><p>  The process depends on the type of roof approved.  Usually a standard gable structure is used, but this takes into account the direction and strength of the wind, the approximate amount of different precipitation, as well as the need to equip the attic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.staydryroofing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="construction stages of a frame house" class="if uuid-2271037" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2271037.jpg"></div><p>  Different materials can be used for roofing, therefore, ondulin, metal tiles, soft roofs or other materials are chosen for this.  The choice depends on the financial capabilities of the owners, their preferences and styling features. </p><h2>  Installation of windows and doors </h2><p>  These stages of the construction of a frame house or a structure made of another material involve the protection of the building from cold and rain. </p><p>  It is advisable to trust the installation to experienced specialists, which will allow you to get a high-quality result.  You can choose plastic or wooden windows. </p><h2>  Home decoration </h2><p>  After the box is built and the communications are completed, you can proceed to the interior decoration, which is considered not too complicated, but at the same time significant, since it depends on it how attractive and optimal the house will be for use. </p><p>  The procedure consists in performing sequential actions: </p><ul><li>  internal wiring of communications; </li><li>  pouring floors, involving the formation of a screed floor or bulk coating; </li><li>  the design of ceilings for which paint can be used, suspended or suspended structures, as well as various other finishing methods; </li><li>  the processing of walls, which consists in their high-quality leveling and puttying, after which finishing materials are used for them, represented by wallpaper, panels or other decoration options; </li><li>  installation of doors between rooms; </li><li>  installation of numerous engineering equipment represented by a heating boiler, lighting devices, various sensors, security system, computers, heating radiators and other similar units and products. </li></ul><p>  The choice of different materials depends on the preferences and capabilities of the owners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.londonflowscreed.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stages of building a private house" class="if uuid-2271046" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2271046.jpg"></div><h2>  Exterior facade </h2><p>  For this, facing brick, siding or other similar work is often used.  They can be carried out while warming the walls, which will improve the comfort of living in the building. </p><p>  If a beam is used for the construction, then external decoration may not be carried out. </p><h2>  Arrangement of adjacent territory </h2><p>  It is important to understand not only what stages of the construction of the house should be implemented to obtain a full and reliable structure, but also how to beautifully decorate the existing site. </p><p>  The arrangement of the territory may consist of several works: </p><ul><li>  installation of a fence, for the creation of which different materials can be used; </li><li>  installation of a gate and gate for the car; </li><li>  the device of different paths, access roads and areas in front of the house; </li><li>  the formation of flower beds, flower beds, sheds from living plantings, hedges and other decorative structures; </li><li>  construction of a swimming pool, artificial pond, bathhouse, terrace, gazebo or other small architectural forms, if they were planned on the territory in the process of creating the project. </li></ul><p>  Using this stage, you can make a really beautiful appearance of the building and the existing territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cgmedicine.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what are the stages of building a house" class="if uuid-2271051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2271051.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the construction of an apartment building </h2><p>  The stages of building an apartment building are similar to the process of erecting a private building, but at the same time they are all controlled by the developer.  They are assigned a foreman to carry out all the work to obtain a reliable and safe building. </p><p>  The construction procedure is guided by a pre-formed project and the available estimate.  All stages are implemented in a predetermined time frame, since if they are violated, then all participants in shared construction will be able to recover a significant penalty from the developer. </p><p>  Thus, the process of erecting any structure should be carried out in the correct sequence of steps.  Each stage has its own characteristics.  The literacy of the implementation of this process depends on how reliable, durable and strong the building will be. </p>
