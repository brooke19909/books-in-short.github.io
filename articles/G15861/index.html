  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Darts Rules</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The word ‚Äúdarts‚Äù is translated from English like darts.  The game consists of a target in which darts are thrown from a certain distance.  This is a fairly old entertainment, invented in England.  Even today, in many countries beer pubs (pubs) love to throw darts in between fresh mugs of beer.  The target, as a rule, is made of pressed agave leaves of the so-called sisal.  It is round and divided into 20 sectors. </p><p>  The rules of the game of darts provide that the target is at a distance of 2.37 cm, at a height of 1.73 cm. Darts should also be of a certain kind.  Their weight should not be more than 50 grams, but most often they use models with an average weight of 20-25 grams.  They are made of nickel, tungsten or brass.  For a novice player, the best material is brass.  The dartboard target sectors are black and white.  The bullseye, that is, the center of the target, is colored red and when it hits it the player earns 50 points. </p><p>  Next comes the green ring, for hitting which the player is given 25 points.  When a red-green color gets into a narrow inner ring, the sector numbers triple, and when they get into a narrow outer ring, they double. </p><p>  The rules of darts dictate the sequence of throws.  Each of the participants must score a certain number of points in three throws.  The maximum possible number is 180. This result can be achieved if all three times get into the inner narrow ring 20 of the sector.  If the player does not fall into the inner narrow ring, then he does not receive points.  If the dart does not remain in the target, then this is also an unsuccessful move.  After three throws, the result is calculated, and the move proceeds to the next player.  The rules of the game of darts must be studied before proceeding with the game.  Before the start of the competition for accuracy, the participants alternately throw darts, and according to the results, the one who will start the competition is selected.  Naturally, the one who managed to get as close to the center as possible is lucky. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Darts Rules 301/501. </p><p>  The score in this case begins with 301 points for each participant.  Further, the points scored in one move (3 throws) are deducted, and the one who first reached zero wins.  The last throw should be made to the bullseye or the outer ring of the sector.  If the result is more points or a unit, then previous throws are not counted, and the result remains the same as before the last series of finish hits.  Each regular game is called a lag, and five lags make up a set.  The winner is the one who won three legs.  In 301, two players play, and in 501, two pairs. </p><p>  Rules for playing darts ‚ÄúAll Five‚Äù </p><p>  Players try to score points in multiples of five for three throws.  With a different amount, moves do not count.  If you scored 50 - this is 10 points, 10 - gives 2 points, 5, respectively, 1 point.  The one who scored 51 points faster than anyone else becomes the winner.  It should be noted that when sorting points, the last series is repeated.  There must be 51 points and neither more nor less. </p><p>  The rules of darts among amateurs differ significantly from those used by professional players.  First try to master the amateur version, which, incidentally, is also not so easy to master, and gradually you will switch to the professional one. </p><p>  <span>The technique of playing</span> darts is the correct throw, which, if desired, can be easily mastered.  Try to keep your body motionless, slightly tilted forward and your <span>elbow joint</span> and wrist involved.  Also try to ensure that the dart in your hand is aimed exactly at the target and is integral with the hand.  The technique of playing darts requires certain skills, so you need to train at least darts daily for at least an hour.  Try to aim at the bull's-eye and with regular exercises you can freely choose any goal necessary for the game. </p>
