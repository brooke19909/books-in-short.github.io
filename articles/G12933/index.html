Someone goes online through tablets, phones.  Someone actively uses a computer or laptop for these tasks.  But today, another way to get into the network is gaining popularity - through a TV.  Of course, not all devices are suitable for these tasks.  But such models are present in stores in a solid assortment.  And for access to the network, as a rule, a modem system is used.  And so the tasks are becoming more urgent: how can I connect a modem to a TV? </p><h2>  Suitable TVs </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.electronicworldtv.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Smart TVs" class="if uuid-2880862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2880862.jpg"></div><p>  An Internet connection is only possible with a TV model with the Smart TV option.  In models without this option, there are no applications for watching videos and opening sites. </p><p>  There are modifications without Smart TV.  However, they have an outlet for a network cable <strong>- LAN.</strong>  And access to the network is possible by cable.  Need a router.  But there are no smart options. </p><p>  Here, the LAN port is provided not for access to the network, but for viewing video and photo content and listening to audio files from devices.  In this case, the processes occur only within the local network.  Uses DLNA technology. </p><h2>  USB port and modem </h2><p>  Modern TVs have USB connectors.  And when buying, people are interested in whether it is possible to connect a modem to a TV of this type. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Experts say that it will not be possible to directly connect this device through the specified port.  The manufacturer does not provide such an option by default. </p><p>  But you can synchronize the modem with the TV using a router or cable. </p><p>  The following are methods for the practical implementation of such a connection. </p><h2>  Most popular methods </h2><p>  There are only two of them: </p><ol><li>  Through the cable. </li><li>  Via wifi. </li></ol><p>  To implement them, you need a high-quality USB modem.  It must support 4G technology. </p><p>  And often people who have this device in their arsenal ask themselves the question: how to connect the modem to the TV?  After all, at the same time, a quality connection should be obtained. </p><p>  To do this, you need to recharge the kit with a router.  A direct connection between the modem and the TV will not bring the intended result. </p><p>  A router is also called a router.  When buying it, you need to study its functional data.  It should be paired with the modem that you use to connect. </p><h2>  Using a Wi-Fi Router </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.netgear.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wifi router" class="if uuid-2880712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2880712.jpg"></div><p>  Before this operation, read the instructions for your TV.  See its performance.  The latest televisions have built-in wireless mechanisms.  Although there are models without these mechanisms.  Then you need an external device.  It must have the same manufacturer as the TV. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Go to the TV settings.  Connect it to the network via Wi-Fi.  Just select your network from the list provided and enter the password. </p><p>  If there are no such settings, then there is no integrated Wi-Fi module.  You will have to use a cable connection or an external adapter. </p><h2>  Cable connection </h2><p>  How to connect a TV through a modem in this way?  After all, such a relationship is more practical and reliable.  The supplied signal is stronger and more stable.  Only in the room you get a lot of wires, but you can somehow hide them. </p><p>  How to connect the modem to the TV in this situation?  It is required to implement the following stages step by step: </p><ol><li>  The router has rear LAN ports. <div class="photo" data-original="www.canstockphoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rear Router Sockets" class="if uuid-2880694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2880694.jpg"></div>  They are so designated.  If the port is only one and is already in use, then it needs to be ‚Äúpropagated‚Äù.  There are auxiliary devices for this: a hub and a switch. </li><li>  Patch cord applied. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.wirewerks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fixture patch cord" class="if uuid-2880699" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2880699.jpg"></div><p>  One of its endings is stuck in an unoccupied port of the router.  The second - to the Internet port of the TV. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  3. Start both devices.  On the TV remote control, press ‚ÄúSetup‚Äù (special button).  In the general menu, stop at "Network".  Submenu is displayed.  In it, select the wired network setting.  Click OK. </p><p>  4. Configure the network address of your television receiver.  A window of this type will appear: </p><div class="photo" data-original="androidas.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Network Address Setting" class="if uuid-2880695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2880695.jpg"></div><p>  In rare situations, people get confused about how to connect the Internet modem to the TV when the IP address is not automatically configured.  Usually it is not static, that is, it is defined by default, it can vary.  In other cases, it must be configured manually.  These are the requirements of a computer network.  For example, this can happen if you have a non-template subnet mask. </p><p>  One way or another, first select ‚ÄúAuto IP‚Äù.  And the TV will independently resolve the issue with its address and coordinate it with the router. </p><p>  The issue with the DNS server is also resolved without user participation in the configuration.  Click OK. </p><p>  Wired connection is established.  The TV now serves as an Internet connection.  To do this, the integrated browser is launched. </p><p>  You can perform additional connection checks.  Try turning on some online footage. </p><p>  This is the solution to the question: how to connect a modem to a TV using a cable?  And so that the connection going through the television receiver is characterized by decent quality, the tariff plan for the modem used must have a high speed.  And it‚Äôs better to take a router more powerful. </p><h2>  Question on TV without smart options </h2><p>  Is the modem connected to TVs that do not belong to the Smart category?  The answer is negative.  This issue is solved by connecting a special console. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.broadbandtvnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Set-top box for Internet via TV" class="if uuid-2880702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2880702.jpg"></div><p>  An HDMI cable is used to connect it to the TV.  The set top box displays an image on the receiver.  It operates on Android itself.  In this way, the TV is converted into a kind of tablet. </p><p>  Typically, manufacturers of such consoles create a very comfortable interface for settings.  Also, the operating system of devices is optimized for operation on a large screen. </p><p>  In stores, such consoles are present in large numbers.  There are models with different parameters and power.  Some may support 4k, others may not. </p><p>  Their price tags are affordable.  The bestseller is Xiaomi Mi Box 3, which works with 4K. </p><p>  Such modifications are no less popular: </p><p>  1.MAG 410. </p><p>  2. Dune HD Neo 4K. </p><p>  3. OzoneHD. </p><p>  4. Apple TV. </p><p>  Such a device is connected in one of the classic ways: through a wire or Wi-Fi.  Further, as a detailed example, the connection of item 4 is presented. </p><h2>  Connecting Apple TV </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.igeeksblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prefix Apple TV" class="if uuid-2880701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2880701.jpg"></div><p>  In its kit there is: </p><ol><li>  The model itself. </li><li>  Wire for power. </li><li>  Remote controller. </li></ol><p>  This arsenal needs to be supplemented with an HDMI cable.  Another option is a component video conductor with an analog audio cable. </p><p>  To access the network, you need access to a Wi-Fi network, an account in the iTunes Store. </p><p>  For the console to work, the following system criteria are needed: </p><ol><li>  MAC OS X 10.4.7. </li><li>  iTunes 7.6 </li></ol><h2>  Connection via HDMI cable </h2><p>  This cable goes to the corresponding port (HDMI) of the console.  The power cord is connected. </p><p>  In the absence of such a port, work with a component video cable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.the-home-cinema-guide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Component video cable" class="if uuid-2880808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2880808.jpg"></div><p>  The principle of connecting its connectors on the one hand to the television receiver connectors is as follows: </p><ol><li>  The green connector is connected to the Y connector. </li><li>  The blue connector is for Pb. </li><li>  Red - to Pr. </li></ol><p>  The connectors on the other hand go to the appropriate jacks on the console.  Its audio ports connect to suitable receiver ports.  To do this, you need an analog audio cable.  The power cord is also connected. </p><h2>  Wi-Fi setup option </h2><p>  The prefix has a submenu "Network Settings".  In it in the proposed list you will see your network.  Enter her password, if necessary.  Indicate the required data: </p><ul><li>  IP address </li><li>  subnet mask </li><li>  your router </li><li>  DNS server </li></ul><p>  Save the changed options.  Wait.  To establish contact, you need about 2-3 minutes. </p><p>  If access to the network is implemented using an Internet cable, then you do not need to additionally configure the console. </p><h2>  Final stage </h2><p>  On it you need to synchronize the system with iTunes.  Open this resource on the computer.  Click the Apple TV icon, and then click "Click to configure."  An automatic setup process will follow.  It will require a five-character password.  Enter it.  And after this process, it will be displayed on the TV.  Name this network as you wish.  Save the changes. </p><p>  Situation: there is no modem, there is a cable. </p><p>  When there is no modem, and there is only a cable provided by the provider company, the situation is complicated.  There are two ways to solve the dilemma: </p><ol><li>  Direct connection to the TV with a cable.  Prerequisites: the format of the connection from the provider through the "Dynamic" or "Static" IP.  In the second option, manually enter the necessary data provided by the provider.  These are the addresses of gateways, DNS, etc. </li><li>  The use of a router.  You must resort to this way when you need to enter a login and password to access the network. </li></ol>
