This beautiful Italian island is located in the Mediterranean Sea, 200 kilometers west of the shores of the <span>Apennine Peninsula,</span> and the <span>island of Corsica,</span> owned by France and known around the world as the birthplace of Napoleon, is only 12 km from it.  By the way, tours to Sardinia are mostly mixed, they combine a beach holiday with an interesting excursion program.  The resort area is interspersed with archaeological and nature reserves.  For a beach holiday, the southern and southeastern shores are especially suitable.  It is here that beautiful hotel complexes are located, on the signs of which 5 or 4 stars flaunt.  By the way, 4-star hotels in terms of conditions and services are almost nothing inferior to five-star ones.  For example, the Tanka Village Hotel (Sardinia), famous throughout the island, provides tourists with the highest level of service.  At the same time, its main advantage is its convenient location and incredible beauty of the beach.  That is why many tourists, choosing tours to Sardinia, prefer this comfortable hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tanka village sardinia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1418903.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sardinia </h2><p>  Many thousands of tourists come to Sardinia annually, and among them there are many fans of windsurfing, swimming, hiking, rock climbing and diving.  The most intense month for the island is August.  During this period, it is difficult to find at least one unbooked place in hotels or guesthouses of the coast, while in the corners of the island remote from the beach, no less interesting life is boiling, and the price for accommodation in guest houses is very low.  Sardinia is autonomous, although officially owned by Italy.  However, the locals, the Sardis, do not like to be called Italians, but consider themselves to be the chosen people belonging to the ancient Nuragic civilization, which is for many centuries ahead of the Etruscans - the ancestors of modern Italians.  This is evidenced by stone monuments belonging to 1500 BC.  e.  The capital of the island is Cagliari - an ancient and very beautiful city with picturesque architecture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="round-the-clock bar" class="if" height="223" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1418901.jpg" width="600"></div>
