This is the case with the Shure SM58 microphones, which have established themselves as a reliable, legendary device for transmitting sound.  In almost unchanged form, it has been produced for more than 50 years.  And relatively recently, a modification of it appeared that allows you to get rid of interfering wires.  The complete base station and the microphone itself have very solid characteristics.  And at the same time they have a cost that cannot be called high for professional equipment. </p><h2>  Packaging and equipment </h2><p>  The kit comes in a sturdy cardboard box with a predominant black color.  Its main advantages are clearly painted on it, and it is also explicitly stated that this model is legendary.  Despite the fact that this may indicate some indiscretion of the designer and manufacturer of the packaging, these words are close to the truth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.idjnow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radio system shure sm58" class="if uuid-2907249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2907249.jpg"></div><p>  Inside it is a soft case with a zipper, which will subsequently be used to transport the kit.  In it, in appropriate places, there is the base receiver itself, the Shure SM58 microphone, a power supply for the base, a pair of batteries with which you can immediately test the performance, as well as a universal holder that fits most modern concert stands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Completing the package with quite detailed instructions for using the microphone and increasing its service life.  It also contains a warranty card with a list of all official service centers located near the point of sale.  The price of Shure SM58 ranges from 30 thousand rubles, which is a pretty attractive offer in comparison with the options presented by well-known competitors. </p><h2>  Base Features </h2><p>  The main advantage of the receiver is its ability to work simultaneously with several Shure SM58 microphones of the same type transmitting a signal at approximately the same frequency.  The maximum number of such transmitters can reach 12 pieces.  The separate microprocessor, which controls the antenna and the signal processing unit, provides separate operation of each of them and the absence of sound mixing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pssl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shure sm58 price" class="if uuid-2907252" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2907252.jpg"></div><p>  When you first start the database in a new place, you can use the QuickScan function, which is responsible for checking the clogging of the ether and selects the optimal frequency with a minimum amount of interference, after which it is synchronized with the microphone transmitter.  You can monitor whether there is a signal reception or not, using the two-color diode indicator located on the front panel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The signal from the Shure SM58 base is transmitted to the amplification equipment by means of interconnect cables, which must be prepared separately.  They can have one of two connection standards: XLR or 1/4. </p><h2>  Characteristics of the microphone and its transmitter </h2><p>  This microphone has established itself as a universal device that allows not only to qualitatively enhance vocals, but also to voice various classical instruments that do not have their own pickups.  This became possible due to the fact that the membrane perceives and processes without distortion frequencies from 50 to 15 thousand hertz, which is enough to transmit most of the sounds heard by the human ear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gear4music.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="microphone shure sm58" class="if uuid-2907250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2907250.jpg"></div><p>  The power of the Shure SM58 wireless microphone is provided by two AA elements.  It can be either ordinary batteries or batteries with the appropriate size and voltage, charged separately.  According to the manufacturer, high-quality batteries should last for 14 hours of continuous operation. </p><p>  A signal is transmitted to the base using coding with frequencies from 524 to 865 megahertz.  This range is not accidental.  It is the golden mean between the operating range and the most accurate transmission without loss and distortion.  The selected parameter is sufficient so that with direct visibility the communication range exceeds 90 meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.idjnow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shure sm58 kit" class="if uuid-2907251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2907251.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive aspects of equipment </h2><p>  Examining the reviews about Shure SM58 left by professionals about this kit, there are several points that they especially liked.  Among them, the following are most often found: </p><ul><li>  High quality sound.  Thanks to its wide range, the microphone confidently perceives sound vibrations and is capable of transmitting them without loss and distortion. </li><li>  Convenient shape.  The microphone has a classic handle and a small pickup.  His weight is quite comfortable, and during a long performance because of him his hand will not get tired. </li><li>  Compatible with any sound amplification equipment.  The Shure SM58 radio system can be easily connected to any microphone input, from specialized mixers to the connector on the back of your home computer. </li><li>  Resistant to damage.  The microphone can survive falls and other types of physical impact with virtually no consequences.  Even if the protective net is bent, the microphone in most cases will continue to work, and replacing it will not be a problem. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pssl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radio microphone shure sm58" class="if uuid-2907253" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2907253.jpg"></div><h2>  The negative sides of the model </h2><p>  Among the main reviews left by users, it is difficult to find any pronounced negative points.  One of these can be called a fairly quick failure of the on / off button of the Shure SM58 microphone with its frequent use.  However, the manufacturer envisioned such a situation, and used standard components during assembly, which can be replaced without problems and searches after purchase in the nearest specialized store.  Otherwise, there are no problems with this microphone. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The microphone has a pleasant combination of basic characteristics that make it optimal for both beginners and professionals.  When buying, you should be careful not to purchase a fake, Shure SM58, the price of which will be more attractive than the original.  Famous models are often copied, and it is easy to find counterfeit goods in small shops.  If you buy the original, then you can use it for a very long time, because it is sufficiently durable, and tolerates various adverse conditions. </p>
