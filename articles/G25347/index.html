Features of making a mascot</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As ancient legends say, the value of talismans has always been of great importance to their owners.  Initially, the main character of many beliefs was a hare, but over time, magical qualities spread to the rabbit. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  Although the first mention of the talismans made from the parts of the body of these animals was found among the ancient Celts, who lived several millennia BC, the spread of the beliefs of the ancient peoples passed very quickly and gained immense popularity.  Now it is believed that the rabbit foot brings good luck, opens up new horizons and contributes to the safe resolution of all problems that its owner may have.  It is best to hang <span>this amulet</span> on a chain of silver or other precious metal.  Then, in addition to the above properties, the fertility, such as rabbits and their wild counterparts, will be added to the owner of the talisman. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rabbit foot" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19510/466008.jpg" width="485"></div>

    <h2>  Application </h2><p>  If the rabbit's foot is attached to a pram, then this is an excellent protection against diseases, troubles and misfortunes.  Also, this amulet is presented to actors who are at the beginning of their career paths.  This gift is presented after the first premiere, but it does not need to be carried with you always.  It is best to leave the talisman near the makeup, then inspiration and a positive attitude will not leave the actor.  If the rabbit's foot is located at the newlyweds' bed, then, according to beliefs, they will soon have a replenishment.  In addition, it contributes to a long family life and marital happiness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History </h2>

    <p>  Of course, such myths should be treated with healthy skepticism, but they are presented not only in European culture and, most likely, have good reason.  Indeed, among the peoples of China, South and North America and Africa, rabbits are considered sacred animals.  In ancient Greece, the hare and its domesticated counterpart were the favorites of Aphrodite.  In the Middle Kingdom, they believed that the jade rabbit that lives on the lunar surface is crushed by the <span>elixir of immortality,</span> and his earthly helpers help him in this.  The Indians of North America claimed that these furry creatures helped them open fire, and treated them with great respect.  In Buddhists, the rabbit is a symbol of self-sacrifice, because ancient legends say that he offered himself to the suffering people.  As you can see from these examples, the veneration of these cute creatures has taken place over the millennia of human history. </p><h2>  Manufacture </h2><p>  For all this time, the rabbit’s foot has not lost its relevance, and the belief in its miraculous power has been strengthened in the minds of many people.  However, its use may have opposite consequences.  If the talisman is lost, it can lead to misfortune.  Therefore, the rabbit's foot is an amulet that must be protected like the apple of an eye.  Only in this case will he have a beneficial effect on the state of things and affairs. </p>

    <p>  Making this talisman, you should consider some simple rules.  Therefore, we will try to figure out what manipulations the rabbit foot needs, how to make this amulet in accordance with all the strict canons that are presented to it: </p><ul><li>  The greatest magical power is part of the body of the animal, which was killed with a silver bullet. </li><li>  After separation, the rabbit's foot is washed, and the slice is sutured with threads matching the color of the fur. </li><li>  Then the mascot is dried in the open air. </li><li>  It retains its properties and does not deteriorate due to the fact that it consists only of tendons.  Therefore, the use of taxidermy methods remains unclaimed for him. </li></ul><p>  After the measures taken, the rabbit's foot can be used for its intended purpose. </p>
