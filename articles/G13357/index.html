Of these, more than 67% are residents of its administrative center, as well as Zheleznogorsk, Kurchatov, Lgov, Shchigrov, Rylsk and Oboyan.  All these cities of the Kursk region have an interesting history, on their territory you can see many tourist attractions.  That is why every year thousands of Russians come there on an excursion and leave with the best impressions of this hospitable land and the people living there. </p><h2>  Kursk </h2><p>  It is believed that on the territory of a modern city, a settlement existed at least in the 8th century.  Like other cities in the Kursk region, today it has a developed industry and is a major center for the production of electricity.  This is not least facilitated by the developed transport infrastructure, represented by a network of highways, a railway station serving trains that run along the Voronezh-Kiev and Moscow-Kharkov lines, as well as an airport, from where flights to St. Petersburg and the capital are regularly made. </p>

    <h2>  Sights of Kursk </h2><p>  Over its long history, the city has repeatedly been destroyed and ruined, but has always risen from the ruins.  Despite this, quite a few architectural monuments of the 19th century have been preserved there, as well as several interesting modern sights.  Of particular note are: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Znamensky Cathedral. </li></ul><p>  This magnificent building was conceived as a kind of monument created in honor of the victory of Russian troops in the Patriotic War of 1812.  Its appearance traces the features of classicism that prevailed in architecture during the construction of this building in 1816-1826.  At the beginning of the new millennium, the Znamensky Church, which was used as a cinema for most of the 20th century, was restored, during which its interior was restored with the utmost precision. </p><ul><li>  Church of the Virgin Mary. </li></ul><p>  A neo-Gothic Catholic church appeared in Kursk in 1896 and immediately became one of its decorations.  He is notable for the fact that the famous artist Kazimir Malevich married and baptized his daughter there.  For many years the church building was used as an anti-religious museum, but at the end of the 20th century it was returned to the Catholic community. </p><ul><li>  Complex "Kursk Bulge". </li></ul><p>  The city went down in history thanks to the famous battle that took place in the region during the Second World War.  In memory of him, in the post-war period, many structures and monuments were erected in Kursk: the Arc de Triomphe, the <span>Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, the</span> monument to G. Zhukov, the stela "City of Military Glory", the alley of military equipment and the Church of St. George the Victorious. </p><ul><li>  Resurrection Church. </li></ul><p>  The church, built in the second half of the 19th century, has an original architectural appearance, making it look more like a small palace.  It is richly decorated on the outside, but, unfortunately, nothing remains of the ancient interior at the moment, since the temple was in ruins for a long time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
