There are several nuances that you need to familiarize yourself with in order to work well in photographs, and one of them is posing.  This article presents poses for standing, sitting, and lying photoshoots, as well as poses for portrait photography. </p><h2>  General rules </h2><p>  Whether the shot will turn out successful depends on the following factors: </p><ul><li>  Properly selected location.  A photo session can be held almost anywhere, but know that it must correspond to the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe photo: for example, shooting a series of wedding photos against the background of factories and factories is not a good idea. </li><li>  Facial expression.  To find a suitable facial expression, you need to stand at the mirror and experiment.  You can raise an eyebrow, look away a little, tilt your head or smile.  It will take some time, but the result is worth it. </li><li>  Makeup should be natural, and not vulgar (this option is valid only in thematic photo shoots).  In advance, try to do an unusual makeup for yourself to make sure that it suits you.  When choosing images for a photo shoot for a girl, don't be afraid to try something new. </li><li>  Clothing.  It is not necessary to wear a new outfit or choose a festive look.  You can take pictures in casual wear that sits well on you, looks neat and, most importantly, you like.  Choose comfortable shoes and clothes in which you can relax. </li><li>  Poses.  To choose the most successful pose, you need to experiment in front of the mirror.  Try to position your arms and legs in different ways, change the tilt of the head, rotate the body, and even take pictures in motion! </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="puzzups.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Images for a photo shoot for a girl" class="if uuid-2919562" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2919562.jpg"></div><h2>  Portrait photography </h2><p>  Before photographing, you should determine your face type and objectively assess its shortcomings.  Subsequently, you can hide them by choosing the right angle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  To visually increase the eyes, you need to look at the lens from the bottom up. </li><li>  For holders of a round type of face, it will be better to take pictures in profile or ¬æ faces. </li><li>  People with a triangular face and a small chin will work well in pictures that are taken from a lower angle. </li><li>  To hide the second chin, you need to position the camera just above the face or support the chin with your hand, but do not lean on it, otherwise the oval of the face will be uneven. </li><li>  If you have a big nose, then when photographing it is better to look directly into the lens or up, as actress Audrey Hepburn did. </li></ul><h2>  Posing Basics </h2><p>  Our article lists the best poses for a standing photo shoot, full length, etc. Below are the basic rules for posing that you need to follow to make beautiful shots. </p><ul><li>  Do not become "at attention", it is better to relax and take a relaxed posture. </li><li>  Do not hide your hands in your pockets: you will look more impressive if you pull all fingers except the thumb out. </li><li>  Propping your face with your hand, position the limb so that the palm is turned away from the lens.  The hand should repeat the oval of the face, and not distort it. </li><li>  To visually lengthen the neck and emphasize the face, slightly lower your shoulders. </li><li>  Bend your knee slightly if you take pictures sideways. </li><li>  Looking at the camera, tilt your head slightly to the side. </li><li>  Smile, because it is a natural smile that can make a photo bright and memorable. </li><li>  Posture should be flat, and shoulders - straightened.  A hunched or stooped person will look tired in the picture. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="dilei.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Studio photo shoot" class="if uuid-2919572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2919572.jpg"></div><p>  Regardless of which pose you chose for a standing or sitting photo shoot, try to position the objects in the photo so that your legs are not cropped in the frame.  This will spoil the overall impression of the frame and visually reduce your growth. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to pose for a girl? </h2><p>  Often, portraiture is produced during a studio photo shoot.  In this case, the photographer will help you take a good pose, and we, in turn, will present you with a list of the best angles. </p><ul><li>  A look from behind a shoulder.  This pose suits girls of any physique and creates the illusion of ease.  The main thing is not to hunch.  It is very important to have a person nearby who will tell you how to raise your head and straighten your shoulders. </li><li>  Taking pictures in full face close-up, do not be afraid to experiment with the position of the hands.  You can find many examples of such pictures on the pages of fashion magazines.  Often variations of this pose are used to advertise cosmetics. </li><li>  If you choose the right image for a photo shoot for a girl, the model will look sexy, leaning forward slightly.  This will emphasize the shape of the fair sex. </li><li>  Portraits are obtained very dynamic and ‚Äúlively‚Äù if the model is in the background, and in the foreground any object is depicted. </li></ul><h2>  Lying pose </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.itsalwaysautumn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="girl on the grass" class="if uuid-2919672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/2919672.jpg"></div><p>  There are no restrictions on the poses for photo shoots for girls.  You can get up, sit down and even lie down!  In order to get a good shot, you can lie on your stomach or side, while leaning on your elbow.  Another option is to lie on your back with your head slightly turned.  Be sure to monitor the position of the hands: they should not just lie along the torso.  This angle is best suited for beach photo shoots.  Please note that these poses are suitable for girls who are 100% sure of the beauty of their body, since all the flaws will be visible very much. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sitting pose </h2><p>  We continue to list poses for a photo shoot for girls.  One of the best angles is sitting on the floor, turning sideways.  You need to lean on your hands, as if transferring body weight to them, bend one leg at the knee, and stretch the other forward.  The bends of the body play a large role in this pose: bend at the waist, tilt your head back a little - all this will make the picture successful. </p><h2>  Standing pose </h2><p>  Probably one of the most popular model poses for a standing photo shoot - with your hands up.  To make the shot ‚Äúlive‚Äù, you can straighten your hair, frame your face with your palms, stretch your arms up. </p><p>  Another interesting option is suitable for almost all girls.  In order to take such a photo, you need to pretend that you do not know what you are being shot: look in any direction you want, the main thing is not towards the camera. </p><h2>  Dynamic poses </h2><p>  There are several more poses for studio photo shoots.  However, they can be used in any location, since they are universal.  For example, you can take one shoulder back and gracefully walk from the hip to meet the photographer.  To make the frame look natural, do not look into the camera. </p><p>  The pictures on which a person relies on something look advantageous.  Numerous variations are allowed: you can raise your arms, throw your head back, take your leg a little to the side - in general, there are no restrictions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="videohive.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Poses for a photo shoot in a studio standing" class="if uuid-2919602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2919602.jpg"></div><h2>  How to pose to a man? </h2><p>  Young people often encounter the following problem: in photographs they stand in the same position, do not change their facial expression, making it very serious.  To fix this is quite easy, the main thing is to take the right pose for the photo shoot while standing and sitting. </p><ul><li>  To emphasize strength and self-confidence, slightly spread legs apart. </li><li>  Bend your fingers, pretending to hold a stone. </li><li>  When crossing your arms over your chest, do not hide your hands. </li><li>  You can stick one or both hands in your pocket to add a pose of ease. </li><li>  When photographing while sitting, put the ankle of one leg on the knee of the other, again, to look more relaxed in the picture. </li></ul><h2>  How to pose for a couple? </h2><p>  If you want to take a picture with your lover, then you must follow the main rule: show sincere emotions.  There is a huge number of poses for a photo session standing or sitting, all of them are united by the fact that models do not hide their feelings on them: hugs, kisses and smiles will not be superfluous here!  You can use any poses.  The most successful of them are listed below. </p><ul><li>  Lovers stand facing each other, and the girl puts her hand on her companion's chest.  Such photos are taken close-up.  You can choose an unusual angle and place the camera over the models. </li><li>  A young man hugs a girl from behind, or vice versa.  This pose allows a large number of variations. </li><li>  There are many lying poses.  A guy can hug a companion, they can lie on his back or on his stomach, and also look in opposite directions. </li><li>  The moment of the meeting can also be captured in the photo.  Among the possible variations of the frame is the location of the pair in the center of the composition.  At the same time, models should not look into the lens. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="newlovewallpapers.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful standing poses for photo shoots" class="if uuid-2919604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2919604.jpg"></div><h2>  How to pose for a child? </h2><p>  Have you ever wondered why children are good at photographs?  This is due to the fact that they simply enjoy the moment and do not worry about how to get better looking and what to wear.  To make the picture look natural, let the child choose the most comfortable pose.  The basic rule that you must follow is to position the camera at the eye level of the model. </p><ul><li>  Have your child lie down on the ground.  One of the variations of this posture is lying on your stomach, propping your head with handles.  The baby can be put on the bed and covered with a soft blanket so that it looks a little.  These pictures are very homely and warm. </li><li>  Take a picture of the child in his natural environment: let him play with his favorite toys, do his homework, read or, for example, draw.  However, he does not have to look into the lens. </li><li>  Take some pictures when the model is laughing.  The pose of the child in this case is not important, since the main thing is to seize the moment and capture the emotions. </li><li>  Very interesting pictures are obtained in which children regale themselves with sweets or inflate soap bubbles. </li></ul><h2>  Location selection </h2><p>  Places of photographing can be divided into three groups: </p><ul><li>  On the street, surrounded by buildings, vehicles and people.  Photoshoots in the city leave a lot of imagination for the model and photographer. </li><li>  In a studio.  Most often, studio photographs are taken by professional photographers. </li><li>  In nature, among plants, outside the city.  You can find colorful landscapes against which wonderful pictures will be obtained. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="videohive.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photosession in the city" class="if uuid-2919614" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2919614.jpg"></div><h2>  Nature photography </h2><p>  There are many poses for a photo shoot on the nature of a girl or man.  However, you should pay attention to other important nuances that can ruin the picture. </p><ul><li>  Do not allow sunlight to directly fall on your face, as this will narrow your eyes. </li><li>  From the foliage, a shadow may fall on the face. </li></ul><p>  Taking pictures in nature, relax.  The most advantageous will be poses in the supine position.  You can easily touch the grass and flowers with your hands, play with your hair - in general, do everything that only comes to your mind! </p><h2>  Seasons </h2><p>  Going to nature or to a photo shoot in the city, use the surrounding landscapes wisely.  Remember that every season is wonderful.  For example, in autumn you need to make bright accents in photographs.  This season is the best time to take shots with an armful of maple leaves or a cup of fragrant tea.  In winter, you can wear colorful hats and scarves to accent them. </p><h2>  City photography </h2><p>  Above were listed beautiful poses for photo sessions while standing, sitting or lying in any locations.  Now we will give you some tips on how to take pictures in the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shutterstock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Model poses for a standing photo shoot" class="if uuid-2919622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23144/2919622.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Do not ‚Äúreach out‚Äù, otherwise it‚Äôs not the buildings that become the background for you, but you for them. </li><li>  Use the law of symmetry: if you place the model in the center and the buildings on the sides, you can get an interesting composition. </li><li>  Take some pictures in public places: cafes, restaurants, museums, libraries.  Try to catch a moment when the model is not looking at the lens.  Then the frame will turn out ‚Äúalive‚Äù. </li><li>  Photoshoots in transport are also very popular.  It is best to spend them in the evening if you do not want to attract attention.  As for poses, they can be absolutely any. </li></ul><p>  Thus, there are a large number of poses for filming.  However, this does not mean that you need to thoughtlessly repeat the poses listed in our article for a photo shoot while standing in the studio or in any other place.  Remember that photographing is a creative process that leaves room for your imagination.  You can experiment to get live shots. </p>
