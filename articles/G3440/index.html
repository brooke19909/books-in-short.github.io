    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  <span>For all Muscovites, the issue of ecology is very relevant.</span>  <span>Of course, it‚Äôs stupid to compare an apartment in the center of a multi-million megalopolis with a village house, but the developer tried to choose an ecologically clean area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMoscow for his property.</span>  <span>On Ryazansky Prospekt, in close proximity to parks and squares, the <span>Sreda</span> residential complex will appear <span>.</span></span>  <span><span>Customer reviews of the</span> site confirm that, despite being close to a busy avenue, the air here is fairly clean.</span>  <span>Ryazan Avenue was not chosen by chance.</span>  <span>This, of course, is an important transport hub of the capital, but the traffic here is not as dense as on other avenues and highways: there are practically no traffic jams.</span>  <span>Accordingly, the impact of the road is minimal.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  <span>Own infrastructure - what offers LCD "Wednesday".</span>  <span>The developer really made sure that every resident, both an adult and a child, felt as comfortable as possible without leaving the complex.</span>  <span>In addition to traditional shops, restaurants and cafes, educational institutions will appear in the complex: a kindergarten with 300 places and a school.</span>  <span>Thus, residents do not have to worry about a place in kindergarten, take the line.</span>  <span>Moreover, children on the territory of the complex will be provided with a high level of safety, they simply will not leave its borders, because all the entertainment they need in the form of games and sports grounds is presented here.</span>  <span>And parents will not have to spend a lot of time to take or take their child.</span> </p><h2>  Landscaping </h2><p>  <span>Own infrastructure is what almost all modern developers offer.</span>  <span>But the PSN Company group went even further, it managed to create a unique project of its kind, an analogue of which simply does not exist today.</span>  <span>9 hectares of the SREDA LCD area were allocated for landscaping.</span>  <span>LCD on Ryazan Avenue will be a unique project.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Layout </h2><p>  <span>LCD "Sreda" (Moscow) was included in the list of five best projects in the nomination "Largest Apartments".</span>  <span>The developer decided to move away from the concept of small compact apartments, proving that spacious, comfortable housing in a landscaped area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe capital can be accessible to everyone.</span>  <span>And large-sized apartments have recently become increasingly popular.</span>  <span>And there is an explanation.</span>  <span>The apartment is perhaps the most impressive purchase, many people buy real estate under the mortgage lending program, so they expect that housing will serve them for quite some time, perhaps for the rest of their lives.</span>  <span>By purchasing a small apartment, the same young family will sooner or later begin to think about expansion, again burdening itself with the chores, worries associated with changing the apartment.</span> </p><p>  <span>European-style studios are an excellent option for young families who want to get their own housing, but are limited in means.</span>  <span>In a one-room apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãonly 37 square meters, the developer managed to place a spacious kitchen-dining room, a full bedroom, a bathroom and even a wardrobe.</span>  <span>Comfort in this case is achieved due to the correct geometric shape of each room.</span>  <span>Two-room apartments are the leader in popularity, because due to the successful layout and large area, they are perfect even for families with small children.</span>  <span>The developer tried to focus on the large kitchen, which can be used as a place for eating and organizing leisure activities, again thanks to the correct zoning of the space.</span>  <span>Well, a two-bedroom apartment in RC SREDA (RC, Ryazansky Prospekt, 2) is a real dream for large families.</span>  <span>Each will receive a separate isolated room, the kitchen space is enough for family dinners, dinners and receptions, and for greater comfort and convenience, the developer has provided an additional bathroom and a spacious dressing room.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Finish </h2><p>  <span>Interested in housing class?</span>  <span>So LCD "Sreda" offers comfort-class housing.</span>  <span>This status is assigned not only due to the developed infrastructure, a variety of excellent planning solutions, but also to the decoration.</span>  <span>In general, ‚Äúturnkey‚Äù finishing of apartments has been very popular recently, but only on condition that it was carried out qualitatively.</span>  <span>For some time, potential buyers refused it, having read negative reviews.</span>  <span>Nobody wanted to overpay for the finish, which, one way or another, would have to say goodbye.</span>  <span>But this definitely cannot be said about the LCD "Wednesday".</span>  <span>The feedback of those who purchased the apartment here confirms that the decoration is done by real professionals using modern building and finishing materials.</span> </p><p>  <span>The opportunity to take part in the design of your apartment is a feature of the project.</span>  <span>This is exactly what the offer of the developer who wants to satisfy the wishes of each client should be.</span>  <span>Residents note that they expressed their preferences to a team of professional designers, on the basis of them they proposed several finishes.</span>  <span>Residents take part in the selection of building and finishing materials, they can control the design at all stages.</span>  <span>You yourself will see how the decoration will be done in your apartment, which will simply save you from unnecessary questions.</span> </p><h2>  About pricing </h2><p>  Apartments in Moscow are an expensive acquisition; many cannot even rely on a small studio in a residential area.  That is why, considering the LCD "Wednesday" (Moscow), it is foolish to miss the question of the value of real estate here.  It's hard to believe, but many can afford an apartment here.  Given the location of the complex, its infrastructure, we can only dream of an apartment in the residential complex "Wednesday".  Prices have already managed to pleasantly surprise potential buyers.  A studio with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã22 square meters can be purchased for just 4,080,000 rubles.  You will get a comfortable "kopeck piece" of an improved layout for a standard family of three for 5,000,000 rubles, and a huge "three-piece" overlooking a picturesque park - for 11,000,000 rubles.  Moreover, the developer offers excellent conditions for mortgage lending without down payment, and also arranges regular promotions, which saves on the purchase of real estate. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  <span>If you are looking for an apartment, have reviewed hundreds of options, but have not found anything worthwhile, pay attention to the unique LCD "Environment".</span>  <span>The feedback of those who have already managed to become the happy owner of an apartment here will be an excellent information base for you.</span>  <span>Yes, the complex is under construction, but today you can see good results and summarize the first results.</span>  <span>The project is successful in every way.</span>  <span>The developer managed the impossible: to harmoniously combine all the charms of metropolitan life and the comfort of a real country house.</span>  <span>A five-minute walk from the complex is a metro station, in general, the facility occupies a favorable location, within walking distance of all necessary infrastructure facilities.</span>  <span>But this is not even the main thing.</span>  <span>The developer thought over his project to the smallest detail, thoroughly studied the needs of modern Muscovites, why the complex gained such popularity.</span> </p>
