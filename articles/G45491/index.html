  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Submersible blender - an indispensable tool for any housewife</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, many housewives cannot imagine their life in the kitchen without a blender.  This device is able to facilitate the preparation of many dishes.  The hand blender will chop nuts in two counts, turn meat into minced meat, mix the ingredients for a cocktail, and also do other work.  Many housewives have a <span>food processor.</span>  Of course, this is a convenient productive thing, capable of performing a large number of tasks, unlike a blender.  However, there are some disadvantages to using this bulky device.  Firstly, harvesters occupy a lot of free space, which is already constantly lacking.  They are not very convenient to use for simple operations.  For example, if you just need to chop the onions, you will have to get the harvester, collect it, and then wash and disassemble again.  A blender is always at hand. </p><p>  If most often you have to grind all kinds of products: onions, cheese, meat, crackers, then for this purpose a submersible blender is best.  If it is necessary to mix the components for a cocktail, a <span>stationary blender</span> made in the form of a glass plastic bowl with rotating knives at the bottom is a good solution. </p><p>  An immersion blender is a plastic or metal leg, which is lowered into a container for work, if you need to mix or grind something.  It will be indispensable if a small child appears in the house, since it will take a few minutes to cook food for children - cereals and mashed potatoes.  The device is very convenient to use for small volumes of work, it does not take up too much space and is suitable for any capacity.  The disadvantage of this device is that it has to be kept on weight all the time, and with a large number of crushed products, your hands may get tired. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An important characteristic is the material from which the blender is made.  If it‚Äôs made of plastic, then the cost of the product will be much lower, but such a device cannot be used for cooking hot products.  In such cases, it is better to purchase a submersible blender with an iron leg. </p><p>  You should also remember the number of speeds and power of the device.  The more power characteristics, the earlier the blender will complete the task, and his hands will be less tired.  The greater the number of speeds, the more convenient it is to choose the optimal mode for a particular product, however, such devices are more expensive. </p><p>  Usually, various parts for a blender or additional nozzles, whisk for whipping, and others are included with the device.  But you should not choose a device just because of an additional pair of nozzles, this bonus may not have to be used.  It is best when choosing a model to be guided by its convenience and practicality in everyday use.  Optimally, if the blender has enough power to carry out all the tasks assigned to it, and will allow you to adjust the speed of rotation. </p><p>  In the modern market of household appliances, blenders of such global manufacturers as Bosch, Philips, Braun, Siemens, Tefal are most widely used. </p><p>  So, for example, the simplest Braun submersible blender has a power of 300 watts, and its cost will be up to 1000 rubles.  And the most powerful and equipped blender with a power of 600 watts, with 15 infinitely variable speeds, a half liter <span>measuring cup,</span> with additional nozzles (crush ice, a whisk for beating eggs, a mashed mixer) and two vacuum containers will cost about 2.5 thousand rubles.  Stationary household appliances are cheaper than submersible. </p><p>  A blender is able to turn cooking from a daily duty into a creative activity and become an indispensable assistant for a long time. </p>
