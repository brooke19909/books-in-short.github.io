The management of entry and entry modes is required to prevent unauthorized entry into the territory and individual zones, as well as to register persons with access rights.  At the moment, there is a wide range of technical tools for implementing this task.  In each case, the installation of access control systems is carried out in accordance with the equipment manual and safety requirements.  At the same time, large facilities cannot do without a special project for the technical organization of the access system, which takes into account the specific conditions of installation activities. </p>

    <h2>  Varieties of Access Control Systems </h2><p>  From the point of view of installation, it is necessary to distinguish between stand-alone and network equipment.  In the first case, the system assumes the possibility of centralized control with the connection of computer equipment.  Such a complex is easier to integrate into the communication infrastructure of the facility, since it does not require the installation of separate cable lines.  Accordingly, both installation work and subsequent maintenance operation will be cheaper.  But for these advantages you will have to pay a low degree of secrecy if we are talking about a lot of protected points, which are managed from one center.  In turn, the installation of access control systems with a network communication structure will require the allocation of communication channels for each monitoring node in a separate order.  In terms of maintenance costs and initial commissioning, this is a more costly option.  But the advantages of network systems include the ability to simultaneously and quickly change the key configuration for blocking devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The main components of the system </h2>

    <p>  The control infrastructure is formed by three main groups of equipment: lock systems, identification tools and control and control equipment.  The devices of the first category include modern digital blockers of doors, gates, barriers and other blocking structures.  As a rule, these are electronic locks, the secrecy of which is checked on connected identifying equipment.  For example, the installation of access control systems with video surveillance is carried out taking into account the optimal coverage area at the checkpoint and even allows you to automatically identify a person.  In this case, the means of recognition and physical obstruction are combined into one complex.  But there are also configurations in which identification is performed at the checkpoint.  Here you can go to the third group of equipment.  These can be computers, interfaces, and controllers controlled directly by the operator.  The dispatcher, upon receipt of a signal, performs identification, after which it gives a signal to the systems of the first group, changing or maintaining their current status. </p><h2>  General installation technology </h2><p>  The main installation work concerns blocking devices.  In the target zone, the same locks, turnstiles, barriers and other devices blocking the passage are installed.  Typical installation of access control systems provides for the integration of supporting equipment, which will securely fix the device.  For example, locks are fastened with screws, screws and brackets to a floor or wall niche.  To do this, the master initially drills holes, grooves, or performs gating for locking elements in accordance with the configuration of the equipment mount.  For turnstiles and barriers, special platforms are provided.  In some cases, their installation is carried out with integration into the foundation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  The nuances of installing wired and wireless systems </h2><p>  As already noted, the most costly in terms of financial and power resources is the installation of network, that is, cable systems.  In this case, a device for wiring lines will be required, which will connect, for example, electromagnetic locks with identification devices and a control panel.  The situation is complicated due to the fact that the <span>laying of communications</span> must be hidden, therefore, in the wall and floor niches, the hammering is performed by a perforator.  Particularly demanding in this regard is the installation of an alarm.  Access control with a warning system will have to have a second emergency communication line.  However, there are combined systems in which signal channels are organized wirelessly. </p><p>  Cable exclusion requires the installation of alternative interfaces.  Today, radio modules are used that allow transmitting information over hundreds of meters within the facility.  At such a distance, you can consider remote installation of video surveillance with access control to dozens of checkpoints.  The only difficulty will be due to the need for an independent energy supply.  Surveillance cameras should be autonomous, that is, with battery power. </p><h2>  Hardware Setup </h2>

    <p>  After installing and connecting functional components, you will need to configure them.  First of all, a link is made between the executive blocking equipment, access cards and the control panel in the <span>control room.</span>  Appropriate keys, addresses and passwords are set via special interfaces to the equipment, through which centralized access control is ensured.  Installation of wireless systems may include the installation of programmable timers.  The user must designate the time intervals in which the equipment will monitor in one mode or another with varying degrees of secrecy and identification methods. </p><h2>  Infrastructure Maintenance </h2>

    <p>  During operation, the responsible person must check the quality of the electrical connections, the correct settings and the physical condition of the system components.  A consumable replacement schedule is also being prepared.  Battery packs are charged at regular intervals, and memory cards are updated.  In wired access control systems, installation and maintenance is carried out with an emphasis on the quality of communication lines.  It is important not only to properly organize a network connection with coverage of important control points, but also to ensure optimal energy-saving indicators and a level of security.  For this reason, fuses, stabilizers and overload monitoring relays can also be introduced into the circuits, including with temperature sensors. </p><h2>  How much does installation cost? </h2><p>  The specific estimate will depend on the characteristics of the equipment, the number of managed access points, etc. The average system can cost 10-15 thousand rubles.  If it is planned to install an access control control system with an alarm system and a video surveillance system at a large facility with modern digital locks, then the amount can reach 30-40 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Finally </h2>

    <p>  The effectiveness of security systems largely depends on the quality of the prepared project.  It should be developed on the principles of economy, ergonomics, functionality and reliability.  In this sense, the installation of access control systems will determine how stable the infrastructure is and is protected from hacking attempts.  For this reason, the modern concepts of organizing such systems are increasingly oriented towards combining several levels of a common security system.  The most effective is the installation, integrating the blocking devices in the structure of the security complex, which may include, for example, motion and shock sensors. </p>
