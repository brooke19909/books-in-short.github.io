    <h2>  Heraklion </h2><p>  It is located in the north of the island in the Heraklion region.  Assessing the resorts of Crete, we can say that this is the largest city in the region.  It is located in places where the picturesque valleys of Malevizia and Messara turn green, and endless olive groves and dense vineyards make up the ecosphere of the region. </p><p>  Heraklion is visited annually by millions of holidaymakers.  Both Greeks and representatives of various European countries go to this place.  The developed transport infrastructure and convenient location of the city, which makes it possible to verify the map of Crete with resorts, allow you to comfortably and quickly get to the necessary point on the coast, while hotel accommodation in the city allows you to save money, since the cost of local hotels is lower than on the Aegean Sea . </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Chania </h2><p>  It is the 2nd largest city of the island.  It is located on the shores of the Aegean Sea.  This city, striking with a harmonious mixture of Venetian heritage and Greek culture, is one of the places that you should definitely visit during a trip to the island of Crete, whose resorts can be chosen for everyone according to taste and prosperity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crete Resorts Description" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/479202.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Tourists love the city for its unique architecture, interesting museums, an abundance of historical and natural attractions, as well as a huge variety of various entertainment establishments.  Looking for youth resorts in Crete, many are considering this one.  Young people who want to dive into the center of the resort‚Äôs vibrant life mostly choose hotels in the center of Chania, families with children and older tourists prefer to relax in its surroundings, where the beaches are more gentle, while the sea is more calm and clean. </p><p>  The main tourist destination of the resort is the port with an ancient lighthouse, as well as its surroundings.  The museums of the city are also quite popular - marine, archaeological, Byzantine art.  Near the resort there is the Zoniana Cave, the picturesque Samarya <span>Gorge, the</span> ruins of Turkish and Venetian fortresses, a female ancient monastery, as well as the ancient city, where ruins of 7th-century buildings have been preserved.  In addition, Chania is an excellent base for further travel to Balos Bay and to Gramvousa Island.  But for a trip to Santorini, the resort is not very convenient, as it is far from the port of Heraklion (most ships leave for this island from here). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Crete Resorts: Rethymnon </h2><p>  This city is the third largest on the island.  It is located 78 km from Heraklion, although it is not inferior in popularity to Chania, while it is much more compact.  Vacationers who come here can get acquainted with its stunning architectural sights - Fortezza Fortress, an old port with a Venetian lighthouse, ancient monasteries, the Rimondi Fountain, which is located in the historical part of the resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crete resorts" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/479203.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The Archaeological Museum is famous for its collections of objects of the Minoan civilization, in addition, an exhibition of statues created during the Greco-Roman period.  In summer, classical festivals are held here, which gather fans to dance and have fun right on the streets. </p><p>  It should be noted that the resorts of Crete, Rethymnon in particular, have a well-developed infrastructure - there are hotels for every budget and taste, shops, shops, restaurants, taverns, bars, clubs and excellent sandy beaches. </p><p>  But lovers of excursions visit the Kurtaliot Gorge, which is densely overgrown with Mediterranean lush vegetation, in addition, the Sentoni Cave, which fascinates with the radiance of bizarre stalagmites and stalactites. </p><h2>  Lassithi </h2><p>  It is located in eastern Crete.  If you do not know, having arrived in Crete, which resort to choose, pay attention to Lassithi.  This is one of the most colorful regions of Greece.  This area is replete with dense green vegetation, while it has a minimal amount of rainfall, when compared with other areas of this island.  Lassithi is the only area in Crete in which olive trees do not grow due to excessively cool winters. </p><p>  In addition to the natural beauties, well-developed infrastructure and magnificent sandy beaches, these places are rich in historical sights, as well as attractive for lovers of ecotourism.  Five-star hotels that satisfy the requirements of the most demanding guests decorate the coast, contributing to the high attention of noble and wealthy people.  They buy luxurious mansions here and use them as country houses.  But for the less demanding, there is a large selection of hotels with 3-4 stars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Greek resorts Crete" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/479204.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Malia </h2><p>  This town is located in the north of the island.  Choosing the best resorts in Crete, it can be safely considered as one of the best destinations for families.  It is easily accessible from Heraklion, which is located only thirty kilometers away. </p><p>  The city can be conditionally divided into 2 parts - the new and the old.  The old part of the resort is represented by flowering cozy courtyards, narrow streets, neat Byzantine churches, but the new one - by modern clubs, shops, discos, bars.  When choosing a hotel, it should be borne in mind that in the center of Malia during the high season it is quite noisy, so if you are not going to take an active part in nightlife, it is advisable to settle closer to the outskirts of the town. </p><p>  Malia is an excellent base for traveling to Heraklion, as well as exploring all sorts of attractions in this part of the island. </p><p>  Not far from the resort are the remains of the palace of the Minoan period, which was not inferior in size to Knossos, you can also look at the ruins of houses of those years and visit the ancient workshop of seals.  All items that were found during excavations are in the archaeological museum, which is equipped in one of the restored buildings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crete which resort to choose" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/479206.jpg" width="503"></div>

    <h2>  Hersonissos </h2><p>  This is a former seaport.  From it there are only a few buildings.  The city won the fame of the most party and youth resort of the island.  In this small town, which is located near Malia, there are the most fashionable discos, clubs, pubs and taverns.  Life is bubbling here - music is played until the very morning, shops are open until late, and fun dancing parties are held on the beaches. </p><p>  There are practically no attractions here - only the Roman basilica, port ancient structures and some medieval buildings.  At the same time, water parks, fascinating excursions to historical places nearby (in Knossos and Heraklion), as well as interesting sea voyages to Athens and Santorini Island, compensate for their lack. </p><h2>  Best Resorts in Crete: Elounda </h2><p>  This is the most fashionable resort of Crete.  Vacationers who prefer luxurious resorts do not think about where to go on the island - they go to Elounda.  This is a favorite vacation spot for movie stars, politicians and other VIPs. The best hotels, fashion stores, luxury restaurants, popular discos and nightclubs are concentrated here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="youth resorts of crete" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/479205.jpg" width="500"></div>
