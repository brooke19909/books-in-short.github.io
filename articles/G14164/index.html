In fact, this is the name of the Vietnamese city.  And Gorky Park itself, as the tourists who have been there, say, is a real outlet for the Russians.  Being in a foreign country, you can literally feel at home.  So, Gorky Park (Nha Trang) - a full description, colorful photographs and reviews of compatriots. </p>

    <h2>  Location of Nha Trang </h2><p>  Vietnam is not a popular tourist destination for Russians.  But, apparently, the situation has been gradually starting to change lately.  Nha Trang is one of the popular <span>resorts in Vietnam,</span> which has earned the love of guests of the country for two reasons: a good location and focused work on the development of a settlement in the tourism sector. </p><p>  Nha Trang is located on the central coast of Vietnam.  Its main street (Changfu) is a six-kilometer boulevard that stretches along the sea.  Nha Trang is located 450 km north of Ho Chi Minh City and 1200 km south of Hanoi. </p><h2>  Where to look for Central Park in Nha Trang? </h2><p>  Gorky Park (and the <span>Central Park of</span> Nha Trang, as the complex is also called) is located on that very main street - Changfu Boulevard.  So, when a person comes to this city, one way or another, he sees an interesting building in the form of a lotus, painted in pink.  From here, facing the sea, you need to go to the right side.  You can also ask the Vietnamese for directions or take a taxi.  By the way, you can get on a cycle rickshaw - locals are happy to help tourists find Central Park. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What kind of entertainment are there in Gorky Park? </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that Gorky Park (Nha Trang) is a very beautiful place.  A good camera + the territory of the entertainment complex = stunning pictures that will cause an involuntary smile at every view.  So you can call this area ideal for photo shoots.  It‚Äôs worth leaving the ‚Äúphotoshoots‚Äù for the evening, because after dark the park plunges into a fabulous atmosphere, because hundreds of thousands of lights are lit, and garlands like creepers hang from the trees. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the territory of the entertainment center there are attractions for children, several bars, restaurants, a relaxation area on the beach is equipped, sun loungers are rented out.  There is also a swimming pool with cutting-edge water purification technology, and even a SPA salon where experienced masseurs work.  In the evening, when it gets dark, a variety of films that are suitable for family viewing are broadcast on the big screen.  Separately, it is worth mentioning that all films are in Russian. </p>

    <h2>  Gorky Park restaurant and bars in the complex </h2><p>  The entertainment center has a restaurant of the same name.  It is mainly aimed at tourists from Russia, as the menu is based on Russian dishes.  Also, vacationers are invited to try other goodies.  These are dishes of Vietnamese and European cuisines. </p><p>  The Gorky Park restaurant offers you to feast on your ‚Äúnative‚Äù borsch, cooked according to a secret recipe of the 19th century, Caucasian kebab, pancakes, dumplings, jellied meat, boiled pork, okroshka, fish soup and even olivier.  The menu has many seafood and fish dishes.  According to vacationers, they cook here very tasty, almost like in their homeland. </p><p>  There are also several bars on site.  Here, the cuisine is completely different - exotic.  For example, the Crazy Frog Bar serves <span>frog legs</span> and seafood.  Ponagar differs in that it is decorated with a large number of tropical plants.  The interior is made, as they say, based on nature, which attracts vacationers.  In addition to fine drinks, it serves European cuisine.  You can sing karaoke (as many Russians do), children are invited to demonstrate their vocal abilities. </p>

    <h2>  Gorky Park (Nha Trang): pools </h2><p>  First, it should be emphasized once again that the park has its own equipped beach, because the complex is located on the coast.  But swimming pools are a good alternative to it - there are 2 of them: deep for adults and shallow for children.  There are several attractions, towers for jumping, you can even do water aerobics to the appropriate music. </p><h2>  SPA salon in Gorky Central Park </h2><p>  Close to the sea there is a SPA center where you can relax and spend time with pleasure.  Massage with warm hands of the master to the sounds of the surf at the sunset time - an old dream?  It‚Äôs easy to do - just get to Gorky Park (Nha Trang).  The masseur will do everything to make this evening the most unforgettable in life. </p>

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  This park cannot but impress the Russian tourist.  Even if you rest here for days on end, it won‚Äôt get bored, as everything is provided on the territory for an unforgettable and interesting vacation.  Many employees of bars and restaurants speak Russian and English, so there should be no problems in communicating with staff. </p><p>  But there is another side to the coin.  Some vacationers believe that flying to Vietnam, to the beach (Gorky Park, Nha Trang) to be among fellow countrymen is at least stupid.  But in general, of course, it‚Äôs good here: the prices are normal (although higher than in other city cafes and restaurants), the atmosphere is festive, and there are many activities for large and small. </p><p>  Special attention deserves the eponymous restaurant.  If it seems that the Vietnamese are not able to cook traditionally Russian dishes, then this is the biggest misconception.  The food here is really very tasty, especially borsch. </p><p>  Various actions are regularly held on the territory of the park, which allow saving, for example, on dishes in a restaurant or on any services.  Events are often organized here, including the New Year for children and adults. </p><p>  Concluding the article, it is worth saying that Gorky Park (Vietnam, Nha Trang) is not the only interesting place in the city.  Many travel companies offer to buy a ticket for some excursion.  In the park itself, you can purchase various packages of services, including programs for visiting the sights of the city.  To distract from the sea and the beach, you can arrange a grandiose shopping. </p>
