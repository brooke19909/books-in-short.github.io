    <h2>  Entertainment Comments </h2><p>  Of course, almost all tourists come to Egypt primarily to enjoy the excellent beaches and swim in the Red Sea, which is famous for the diversity of its inhabitants, which everyone can watch.  The five-star Monte Carlo Sharm El Sheikh Resort hotel we are considering, according to travelers, is perfect for this purpose.  So, the hotel complex is located on the first line and has at its disposal a spacious sandy beach.  It is equipped with sun loungers and parasols.  There is also a bar.  In the sea, according to vacationers, you can go either directly from the beach or from the pontoon.  Very close to the coast is a <span>coral reef</span> with a lot of interesting inhabitants.  So be sure to grab <span>a snorkeling mask</span> from home, or purchase it directly in Egypt.  In addition, wise-experienced travelers recommend purchasing special rubber shoes so as not to injure their legs. </p><p>  The Monte Carlo Sharm El Sheikh Resort Hotel also has plenty of entertainment.  So, there are several pools of different depths.  Therefore, according to the guests of the hotel complex, it will be comfortable here for both children and adults who cannot swim.

After all, there are many sun loungers, so at any time of the day you can find a free spot for yourself.  Near the pools there is a bar with a rich selection of drinks.  The only minus some guests considered the fact that the bartenders were clearly not enough.  Despite the fact that they work professionally and quickly, they cannot manage to serve everyone on time.  Therefore, our compatriots recommend the hotel management to think about the need to hire additional employees. </p><p>  As for the animation, then most of the guests of Monte Carlo Sharm El Sheikh Resort 5 * were very pleased with it.  They note that the guys here are quite coping with their task.  So, you can play a variety of games, take part in fun contests and fun.

So, no one will force you to play water polo or participate in the ‚Äúguess the tune‚Äù contest.  Tourists who come to rest with children also speak positively about the local mini-club and its employees.  According to them, they work with kids here from 10 a.m. until the evening.  They are perfectly watched, come up with different kinds of fun for them in accordance with their age.  In the evening, a mini disco is held.  According to the parents, their children were very pleased with the visit to the club and always went there with pleasure.  And after returning, the kids were happy to share their impressions and talk about what interesting things they did during the day. </p><p>  In addition to entertainment in the hotel itself, many tourists recommend to go outside the hotel complex.  After all, it is located close to the main pedestrian street of Sharm El Sheikh.  So the mass of shops, souvenir shops, restaurants, bars are within walking distance.  In addition, be sure to visit at least a couple of excursions during your vacation.  After all, Egypt is a country with a rich history, which has many world famous attractions.  Therefore, if you have the opportunity to see them, then be sure to use it. </p>
