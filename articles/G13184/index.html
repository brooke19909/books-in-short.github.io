    <h2>  Where is the hotel complex </h2><p>  Imperial De Luxe 5 * is located on the cleanest coast of the Mediterranean Sea, awarded the Blue Flag for its environmental friendliness.  It is located in the village of Beldibi in the tourist region of Kemer, part of the Turkish province of Antalya.  The nearest airport is only forty kilometers from the hotel complex.  This is very convenient, because after landing in the air harbor, the path to the hotel will take you no more than 40-50 minutes.  This fact is surely appreciated by people traveling with young children.  Due to the fact that Imperial De Luxe is located in a small resort village and is located 12 kilometers from the center of Kemer, you will not be disturbed by the almost round-the-clock noise characteristic of most tourist cities both in Turkey and other countries.  At the same time, you can always take a taxi or local minibus to the busiest areas with lots of bars, restaurants, shops, souvenir shops, nightclubs and discos.  As for the sea, since the hotel is located on the first line to get to the beach, you will have to cover a distance of only a few tens of meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kemer, Imperial De Luxe: Description </h2><p>  This hotel first opened its doors to guests in 1998.  Since then, several large-scale restorations have been carried out here, the last of which occurred in 2010.  Thus, today the hotel is quite modern, comfortable and equipped with everything necessary for an excellent pastime for guests.  The territory of Imperial De Luxe cannot be called large.  So, its area is only eight thousand square meters.  However, the area is very comfortable, green and clean.  In total, the hotel has 137 comfortable rooms, including family rooms and apartments for the disabled.  In general, Imperial De Luxe (Kemer) is a great place to relax families with children, as well as newlyweds and groups of young people. </p>

    <h2>  Imperial De Luxe: traveler reviews </h2><p>  Since it is extremely important for many travelers to find out what impressions a particular hotel has left for people who have already been here, we have generalized the comments of our compatriots who spent their summer vacation at Imperial De Luxe (Beldibi, Kemer). </p><p>  First of all, guests pay attention to their rooms.  So, according to our compatriots, they, as stated, are indeed recently renovated, comfortable and furnished with quality furniture.  However, some travelers were confused by such facts as an unclosed bathroom door, very noisy air conditioning without the ability to adjust it, etc. In this regard, they would have awarded the Imperial De Luxe hotel 4 stars, but not 5. </p><p>  As for nutrition, in general, the quality of the dishes was on top.  However, some guests noted that the choice of dishes in a five-star hotel could be a little more diverse.  Also, some visitors were confused by the lack of soups for lunch. </p><p>  Many travelers appreciated the animation at Imperial De Luxe.  According to them, the animators work on their conscience and put a lot of effort to prevent guests from getting bored.  Also at the height was animation designed for kids. </p><p>  As for the pools, there were no special complaints from the guests.  The greatest delight among tourists left, of course, the beach.  The vast majority of travelers were very pleased with the clean territory and warm sea, as well as the water activities available here. </p><p>  Mostly positive impressions of our compatriots were left by the staff of the Hotel Imperial De Luxe.  So, despite the fact that the vast majority of employees of the hotel complex did not speak or understand Russian, they were always very friendly towards the guests and tried to do everything possible to please them. </p><p>  Tourists also liked the local spa.  According to them, they make an excellent massage, peeling and other cosmetic procedures. </p>
