  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to intercept SMS from someone else's phone: programs and methods of tracking</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It‚Äôs not good to follow, read someone else‚Äôs correspondence, but there are times when it is vital.  For example, if a loved one got in touch with a bad company, got into a sect or is threatened, but he refuses to talk about his problems.  The reasons why you need to read someone else's correspondence may be different, if there was a need, then knowing how to intercept SMS would not be superfluous. </p><h2>  Remote way </h2><p>  Previously, remote monitoring services that offered programs that intercept SMS were very advertised for some applications.  The programs were paid and cost a lot, while they did not perform their functions of tracking and transmitting messages to the observer.  They either did not work or showed inaccurate text.  The buyer of such a program could not contact the police, as unauthorized surveillance of another person is considered a violation of the law.  This was used by sellers of such applications and services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to intercept SMS" class="if uuid-3161428" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/3161428.jpg"></div><h2>  Who can catch SMS in the distance? </h2><p>  It should immediately be clarified that remote monitoring tools exist, but for ordinary mortals they are not available.  How to intercept SMS from someone else's phone number (simple SMS, on old mobile devices) only specialists who work in special services or hackers (professional crackers) know and can.  They use special equipment and programs that are not sold on the market for this purpose.  They either develop them themselves, or they are made by qualified specialists.  But even they are not always able to read someone else‚Äôs correspondence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sspblue.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to intercept sms from the phone" class="if uuid-3161453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/3161453.jpg"></div><h2>  Available tools and methods of interception </h2><p>  The lack of special equipment and software does not mean that it is not possible to track relatives, especially if it is necessary for their benefit.  To intercept you need access to the phone of the surveillance object for at least a few minutes.  If the device has a password, just ask for a few minutes to unlock it - see photos or listen to music.  Wait for the person to be distracted, and look at the password and login to enter the messenger or social network.  They can be copied and sent to your mail, and then transferred to a separate file, and deleted from the correspondence.  Then you can enter the messenger or social network from your phone or laptop and read.  Another person will not even notice the tracking, since most users do not pay attention to what time they visited the messenger or a page on social networks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fr.pngtree.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to intercept sms from the phone" class="if uuid-3161434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/3161434.jpg"></div><h2>  How to intercept SMS in old phones (without Internet access) </h2><p>  With simple SMS, which are sent via GSM, the situation is more difficult.  However, if the question is about monitoring their own children and adolescents who are not 18 years old, then there will be no problems.  Since in most cases the parents draw up a SIM card using their passports, they can either check the contents of SMS messages via the Internet or by contacting any service center of a mobile operator. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Spyware </h2><p>  On some web resources, those wishing to conduct surveillance, but not knowing how to intercept SMS from other phones, are offered to purchase programs for installing them on the gadget of the surveillance object.  Despite the fact that this method seems the most convenient and reliable, there is no need to rush with the purchase of such applications. </p><p>  Even if the tracking software is free, this is not a reason to use them.  They are more likely to be either useless or harmful.  The thing is that any program takes a certain resource.  The phone starts to slow down, and if there is not enough space on the disk, the system starts offering to remove this or that application.  If the owner of the device sees such a program on the list, he will either guess who installed it, then there will be no scandal, or he will install an antivirus that will nullify all snooping attempts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="abcnews.go.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to intercept sms from other phones" class="if uuid-3161487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/3161487.jpg"></div><h2>  Screen management software </h2><p>  Some manufacturers produce models of phones and tablets that have a screen synchronization function.  The purpose of this function is to make it convenient to transfer data from a smartphone to output on a large screen.  If the owner of the gadget has not set a security password, then if it is nearby, you can connect to it using the synchronization program via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.  You can use the synchronization function to intercept SMS from your phone and save them to your computer.  But this method has one drawback: Wi-Fi or Bluetooth must be enabled on the mobile phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="trymobilespy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to intercept sms" class="if uuid-3161546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/3161546.jpg"></div><h2>  Password crackers </h2><p>  Such applications can be used only if the login name of the mail, messenger or account in social networks is known.  Although some programs can immediately determine both the username and password, the result of such work is not suitable for viewing mail and messages of a single person.  It‚Äôs as simple as guessing what characters a login consists of.  WhatsApp uses the messenger‚Äôs phone number as a login.  Also, it can often be the email address. </p><p>  All that is needed for a quick hack is the installed special program, broadband Internet access and a powerful computer.  Cracker is not new.  It can be purchased on the Internet, although it will cost dearly.  A normal program will not cost less than $ 100 (6500 rubles).  One should be wary of cheap fakes.  Account hacking time depends on the complexity and length of the password.  If a friend does not suffer from paranoia, then the key will be simple, which means that the process itself will take several minutes.  This is the easiest and most affordable way to intercept SMS. </p><div class="photo" data-original="topspyingapps.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS interception program" class="if uuid-3161541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57537/3161541.jpg"></div><p>  The main condition for successful "catching" SMS is the anonymity and non-disclosure of the information thus obtained.  For invasion of a citizen‚Äôs privacy, Russian law provides for criminal liability.  Therefore, if there is no urgent need for surveillance, then it is better not to risk it.  There are some things you should not be aware of. </p>
