    <h2>  Origin </h2><p>  According to the written writings of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, the Phoenicians came from the northwestern part of Arabia.  Namely, from the coastal region of the Red Sea.  Initially, they spoke the Semitic language, so they were called Semites and assigned to this group.  After some time, the Greeks began to call them Phoenicians.  It is assumed that this word came from the ancient Greek ‚Äúfoynikes‚Äù, which means purple, because in the coastal part of the state there was a special mollusk giving red dye, which was later actively used by the people, dyeing things and items in the corresponding shades of purple. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of existence </h2><p>  Now that we have understood who the Phoenicians are, it‚Äôs better to consider in more detail what the chronology of the events of this ancient state is. </p><p>  It is also interesting that Phenicia appeared so long ago that historians still have some questions regarding the life and history of the people. </p><p>  Initially, the Semites appeared on the Levantine coast of the Mediterranean Sea about V millennia ago as part and continuation of the Canaan civilization and culture.  In the early period of civilization, it was called Canaan.  But around 1500 BC  e.  Phenicia had its own separate culture. </p>

    <p>  The state began to gradually develop.  Subsequently, people called the Phoenicians erected one of the most ancient cities in the world - the Bible (or, as other peoples called it, Goble or Gebal).  The city was expanding, and its economy and trade reached a high level.  It was from him that the name of the Bible came. </p><p>  But closer to the second millennium, Phenicia became even larger and occupied the entire east of the Mediterranean coast.  The city of Sidon appeared, now known for Homer's Iliad, in which he admired the inhabitants of that place because they make magnificent craft items. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The Phoenicians were excellent artisans and merchants, but not warriors.  Throughout their entire existence, they suffered sieges from the Greeks, then from Assyria, which was able to conquer Phenicia and forced the people to pay tribute for two centuries.  After this, the state fought for independence for a long time, until it eventually became the fifth province of Persia in 539 BC.  e. </p><p>  And in 332 BC.  e.  Alexander the Great finally captured eastern Phenicia.  Nevertheless, the western part of the state and the city of Carthage continued to exist for some time. </p><h2>  Language and Writing Phoenicians </h2><p>  Initially, people spoke only Phoenician (until about the 10th century A.D.).  When Phenicia reached its peak, the alphabet also appeared in it.  Thus, writing began to appear.  Such a Phoenician type of alphabet was much more convenient than the hieroglyphics of Ancient Egypt or cuneiform writing in Mesopotamia.  One phoneme - one letter.  Throughout the existence of the language, the number of letters ranged from 30 to 22, but there was no transmission of vowel phonemes. </p><p>  We can say that it was in Ancient Phenicia that the active use of alphabetic writing began.  Due to active trade, good connections with neighboring countries and a convenient geographical location, the language spread throughout the Mediterranean.  Unfortunately, not a single literary monument of Phenicia has survived to this day, because they made notes on papyrus, which in the conditions of that climate very quickly destroyed. </p><p>  From the Phoenician writing came two versions of the alphabet: Greek and Aramaic, because the system of transferring phonemes with letters turned out to be very convenient.  And in the 7th century, the Phoenicians switched to Arabic and Aramaic. </p><h2>  Trade and travel </h2><p>  Phenicia is a very great, developed state of the past.  As already mentioned, the main occupation of the Phoenicians was maritime trade.  Many trade routes passed through the country.  Around the same time as the invention of the Canaanite script, large keel ships for navigation began to be manufactured.  But their ships were indeed very durable for that time. </p><p>  It is believed that the Phoenicians are the first people who were able to go around the entire continent of Africa.  Herodotus also writes in his literary work that they are precisely in the 7th century.  BC  e.  came up with triremes.  It is even known that the Phoenicians traveled to the shores of present-day England. </p>

    <p>  Phenicia was also known for its cedar forests, they supplied timber to Mesopotamia and Egypt.  They used these conifers for shipbuilding.  Unfortunately, such deforestation in what is now Lebanon has led to the destruction of cedar forests. </p><p>  The Phoenicians made olive oil and wine.  They made purple dye from mollusks, each of which brought only a drop of paint.  That is why all things and products of red color were very expensive.  Also successfully made glass and glass products, which were famous throughout the Mediterranean.  A particularly popular item for trade among the Phoenicians was dried fish. </p><p>  But in Phenicia itself from other countries brought papyrus, gold, copper, animal skins, incense, wool, spices, cotton, linen, ivory and much more. </p><p>  The largest city-states were Carthage, Sidon, Tire.  It was they who for the most part pulled and developed the whole country. </p>

    <h2>  Religion </h2><p>  To better understand who the Phoenicians are, one should also learn a little about the spiritual life of their society.  In Phenicia, paganism ruled, and people themselves worshiped various gods.  There were sacrifices, which today causes a lot of controversy.  The neighboring peoples with the Phoenicians considered such customs to be very cruel. </p><p>  Most infants under the age of 5 months were sacrificed.  It is not known exactly how often this was practiced.  But the numerous ashes urns in tafeta are not an indicator of the mass of children's sacrifices.  There is an assumption that the children were cremated regardless of whether they died from another cause or if they were sacrificed to the gods. </p><p>  But who are the Phoenicians, and is it possible, despite everything, to consider them a great nation?  One thing can be said for sure: thanks to Phenicia, we have received many inventions and a special contribution to world culture, therefore we cannot underestimate the strength and power of this ancient state. </p>
