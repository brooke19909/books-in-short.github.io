    <h2>  The emergence of ideas </h2><p>  Like most historical events, the <span>Crusades</span> have economic reasons.  Although they were supported by a higher idea.  What is a crusade from the point of view of a medieval peasant is not difficult to figure out.  First of all, this is a struggle for the most important Christian shrines, which, due to historical events, were located on the territory of <span>Islamic states.</span>  But at the same time, material benefits were very important for the inhabitants of European monarchies.  It was not even about the fabulous riches of Muslim countries, everything was much simpler.  For the European peasant in general and the French peasant in particular, at least some hope of more or less acceptable living conditions was very important.  In those days, France was not going through the best of years, a long famine, coupled with terrible epidemics, undermined the economic power of the empire.  In less than half a century, these misfortunes brought the country's population to complete impoverishment.  The positive results of the Crusades were to restore the faith of the population in the monarchy and the Christian model of worldview. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Church influence </h2><p>  As we know, the church has always had a huge influence on political affairs.  The essence of the Crusades was also formulated by the clergy.  It all started with a passionate speech delivered by Pope Urban II.  He is considered the ideological inspirer of the Crusades. </p><p>  To the question of in which year the crusade was first organized, one can accurately answer: in 1095.  This is the year of the fateful speech of the aforementioned pope, after which the organization of the cross movement began.  The purpose of the latter was not only the liberation of the Holy Sepulcher, but also the capture of unbelievable untold wealth.  Dad fervently convinced the ruined Europeans that all this belonged to them, and only by absurd chance was in the hands of enemies.  All that was required to be done was to go and take it away, which later turned out to be not so easy. </p>

    <h2>  Motivation </h2><p>  Nevertheless, there were quite a few who wanted to take part in the liberation of the main Christian shrine from the hands of infidels.  Still, in addition to the mandatory enrichment of the crusader, and this is what the soldiers participating in the campaigns were called, something else was promised.  It was about absolution (an unprecedented privilege in those days).  Moreover, there were no longer any calls for austerity, from which <span>medieval Europe</span> suffered even so.  It became clear what a crusade was, and why it was organized.  The essence was the need to transfer ownership of the country of milk and honey to those to whom it should rightfully belong.  It was, of course, about Christians from Europe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Organization and implementation </h2><p>  A year after the <span>fiery speech of the</span> pope, the first crusaders rushed to the Holy Land.  There was an army whose purpose was the liberation of the Holy Sepulcher from the infidels, from the peasants.  Strange, but they did not have any stocks and weapons, which already determined the outcome of the campaign.  The result was quite sad: almost everyone was exterminated on the way to their destination. </p><p>  Twelve months later, better-trained warriors made another attempt.  They were already lucky.  Despite the difficulties, the participants of the campaign captured a number of cities, having won them from the formidable Seljuks.  They even managed to take Jerusalem in 1099, which was a huge victory for the Christian world.  It is difficult to describe all the hardships that the crusaders suffered in desert lands.  To the question of what a crusade is from the point of view of an ordinary warrior, the answer will not be so optimistic.  These are constant diseases and lack of water, fear of being killed by formidable Seljuks. </p>

    <h2>  Failures and their causes </h2><p>  To wage war on enemy territory, you need to have a significant advantage, not only quantitative, but also qualitative.  The organizers of the crusades had neither the first nor the second.  Yes, a huge army of well-equipped crusaders advanced behind the Holy Grail, but the vast territory was to cross.  A significant part of the soldiers died on the way to the Holy Land. </p><p>  If we consider the 6 crusades, we can see that only two of them were partially or fully successful.  Even if the army of the crusaders managed to take possession of certain territories, then soon they either lost them as a result of the battles, or surrendered them voluntarily. </p><p>  It is difficult to describe all the difficulties that the army of the crusaders faced in their enemy territory.  The <span>tactics of warfare,</span> which was strikingly different from the Muslim one, also made itself felt.  The armor of the knights, so necessary earlier, in the conditions of incredible heat, only interfered with the movement and maneuverability of the warrior, in no way protecting him from the arrows of the Seljuks. </p>

    <h2>  Significance and Consequences </h2><p>  What is a crusade?  In the events of those times, a lot of events and facts intertwined.  But it should be remembered that in the first place it was an era of tremendous change.  After the campaigns, the socio-political situation in Europe changed.  A new class was born and firmly established in it, the so-called free landowners.  The positions of church leaders were strengthened, because they managed to motivate the vast masses of the people to a rather strange undertaking.  Improving trade relations between Christian and Muslim countries is probably the greatest success for everyone.  Knights who visited one or several campaigns learned more about the life of the Seljuks.  Then, when the hostilities ended, the former enemies began to learn from each other, a new mutually beneficial relationship was born. </p>
