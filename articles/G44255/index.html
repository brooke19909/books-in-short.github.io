A distinctive feature of toys is the thorough thoughtfulness of all the details of the image: from an exquisite hairstyle and a magnificent outfit to the expression of the eyes and the inclination of the head. </p><p>  Thanks to simple patterns of rag, making it will not be difficult even for beginner craftswomen. </p><h2>  Sewing rags: master class </h2><p>  <span>Doll Ballerina</span> is a very elegant and touching handicraft, which will certainly decorate the room of a bedroom or a children's room.  To sew it, you do not need many tools and materials.  It is enough to prepare the following: </p><ul><li>  A piece of flesh-colored fabric. </li><li>  Pattern. </li><li>  Filler.  A synthetic winterizer or holofiber is suitable. </li><li>  Two small transparent buttons. </li><li>  Wool or yarn for hair. </li><li>  A piece of fabric for an outfit.  For example, white satin, tricotin or silk. </li><li>  Little things for decor: lace, beads, braid, Velcro fastener. </li><li>  Scissors, pencil, thread and needle. </li></ul><h2>  Base manufacture </h2><p>  Special attention should be paid to the fabric.  In order for the doll to keep its shape, and the details are not stretched during cutting, it is recommended to take the material tight.  You can use knitwear or calico. </p><p>  Now you need to prepare a pattern of rag.  It can be invented and drawn by yourself.  Or print ready.  For example, you can use the following: </p><div class="photo" data-original="handportal.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ballerina dolls pattern" class="if uuid-2549095" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73342/2549095.jpg"></div><div class="photo" data-original="doctemplates.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ballerina doll pattern" class="if uuid-2549096" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73342/2549096.jpg"></div><div class="photo" data-original="alljobscript.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trapiennes pattern" class="if uuid-2549094" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73342/2549094.jpg"></div><div class="photo" data-original="mirpozitiva.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Doll ballerina" class="if uuid-2549097" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73342/2549097.jpg"></div><p>  Then all the details are transferred to the fabric with a gap to the seams of 6-8 mm and cut out at the office. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Paired elements are stitched together.  In this case, small holes are left for turning out and stuffing.  To make the toy more accurate, experienced craftswomen recommend sewing complex parts manually than using a sewing machine. </p><p>  The resulting workpieces are inverted face-up and stuffed with filler through openings left unshielded.  The body of the ballerina should turn out to be light and graceful, so the toy needs to be compacted evenly.  The appearance of tubercles should not be allowed. </p><p>  The holes are sewn with a neat, hidden seam.  And all the blanks are combined into a single whole.  For the doll to move and change its position, its legs are stitched through small and invisible buttons.  The basis of the doll is ready, it remains to make her hair, make a face and think out the outfit. </p><h2>  Hair making </h2><p>  Hairstyle is one of the most difficult stages of creating a Korean doll.  Not surprising, because it is presented in the form of a complex and intricate composition made of artificial hair. </p><p>  To make a head of hair, you need to wind the yarn on a piece of cardboard.  Please note that the side of the cardboard will correspond to the length of future strands.  Therefore, for the hairstyle of this doll, cardboard with a side of 16 centimeters will be used.  The yarn is cut on one side, and a parting is marked exactly in the center.  The hairstyle is attached to the head of the toy with the help of threads. </p><p>  The hair that has turned out is collected in a high tail.  Then it is divided into two thick strands, each of which is braided into a magnificent braid.  Now the hairstyle can be fixed on the back of the head with the help of invisibility.  If desired, hair can be sprayed with varnish for greater fixation.  The styling is ready. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ballerina clothes </h2><p>  Particular attention is given to <span>puppet costumes</span> that create amazing, stunning images.  With their help, the character and inner world of the craftswoman is revealed.  That is why the choice of dresses for the doll must be approached responsibly. </p><p>  The first thing you should think about a suit: style, model and color scheme.  Here, the fantasy of the craftswomen is simply endless.  If you wish, you can use ready-made clothes for rags, patterns of which are shown below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pinstake.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dress for rag" class="if uuid-2549148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73342/2549148.jpg"></div><div class="photo" data-original="artemmian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dress for the doll" class="if uuid-2549149" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73342/2549149.jpg"></div><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dress pattern" class="if uuid-2549150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73342/2549150.jpg"></div><p>  To sew clothes, you do not need to have special skills.  With your own hands, you can easily create a very delicate and touching dress from improvised materials that will suit both the ballerina doll and the wedding clothes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  According to the scheme, the details are cut at the office.  Then the elements of the pattern are transferred to the fabric.  The bodice of the dress is decorated with white satin, and the skirt is trimmed with lace.  If the availability of fabric allows, the product is sewn from two tiers.  Do not forget about the shuttlecock.  It is necessary to make folds on its upper part, and then sew the shuttlecock to the skirt. </p><p>  All parts of the dress are stitched.  A Velcro closure is sewn on the back.  It can be replaced with small buttons or a zipper.  It depends on the desire of the craftswoman.  A narrow strip is cut from a piece of lace that will adorn the waist of the dress.  With the help of beads or beads, the bodice of the outfit is made out. </p><p>  Thus, it is not at all difficult to sew and decorate clothes for the doll.  Enough to make a little imagination and stock up on free time. </p><h2>  DIY decoration </h2><p>  At the final stage, a person is drawn up.  Eyes and mouth are embroidered with colored threads.  Cilia are drawn with a black gel pen.  A slight blush on the cheeks can be done with dry cosmetic blush.  In some cases, the face is drawn with acrylics, but this method is considered more complicated and requires special skills from the master. </p><p>  Tryapiensa ballerina is ready.  Such handmade craftwork will become not only a wonderful interior toy, but also a warm gift to relatives and friends. </p><h2>  The second option to create a toy </h2><p>  This method of making dolls is a bit simpler.  A step-by-step master class will help prevent mistakes in the process.  For crafts you will need the following tools and materials: </p><ul><li>  A piece of knitted fabric for a beige doll. </li><li>  Satin for the bodice of the dress, pieces of silk and lace for the skirt. </li><li>  Patterns rag. </li><li>  Sheet A4. </li><li>  Scissors, needle, colored threads. </li><li>  Pencil. </li><li>  Non-woven. </li><li>  Filler. </li><li>  Little things for decoration. </li><li>  Empty two liter bottle. </li><li>  Acrylic paint, brushes, sponge. </li><li>  Iron. </li><li>  Sharp knife. </li></ul><h2>  Create a rag doll </h2><p>  The first step is to prepare a pattern of rag.  The scheme you like is transferred to sheet A4, while the details of the legs will not be needed, since instead there will be a voluminous skirt. </p><p>  The next step is a piece of non-woven fabric superimposed on the circuit, and with a pencil the parts are circled around the office.  Since all the elements of the toy must be in duplicate, the material must be folded in half. </p><p>  Details are cut taking into account the gap to the seams of about 1 centimeter.  With the help of a hot iron, all non-woven elements, except for the body, are glued to the knitted fabric.  As a result, two-layer elements of the arms, legs, head should be obtained.  By the same principle, the body is cut out, but from a satin piece of fabric - this will be the bodice of the future dress. </p><p>  Using a sewing machine, paired parts are sewn together, but not completely.  It is very important to leave a small hole for stuffing toys.  Experienced craftswomen advise setting the stitch length to 1.5 millimeters. </p><p>  The resulting elements are inverted with the front side.  So that the future doll does not look mint, all details should be ironed. </p><p>  The body is densely packed with filler.  At the same time, it is worthwhile to ensure that ugly "creases" do not remain on the neck.  For more comfortable stuffing crafts can be fixed with needles. </p><p>  Now that all the elements are well packed, the remaining holes can be darned manually with a blind seam.  Details of the hands and head are sewn to the body.  Part of the toy is ready, now you need to make a skirt frame. </p><h2>  Volumetric skirt from a plastic bottle </h2><p>  To do this, you need a 2-liter plastic bottle from juice or any other drink.  With the help of an ordinary knife, the neck is cut off at the bottle.  If sharp nicks remain, they must be fused with a lighter for safety reasons.  While the plastic is hot, the bottle edge is pressed slightly so that it becomes more rounded. </p><p>  Now the future skirt needs to be measured and the necessary volume determined by eye.  The torso in the plastic blank must stand stably. </p><p>  The next step is decorating the skirt frame with fabric.  To do this, small holes are made in the bottle.  To do this, it is necessary to heat the very tip of the needle above the flame of a burning match or lighter.  At the top of the bottle, 4 pairs of holes are made.  After this, the frame must be sheathed with material. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that the length of the fabric for lining should be equal to the height of the bottle and an allowance of several centimeters (for hem), and the width should be equal to its volume.  It is recommended to sheathe the bottom of the product with lace fabric, make a beautiful apron from a piece of satin fabric.  At the request of the master, you can sew another dress for the doll, just use the patterns of clothes. </p><h2>  Crafts painting </h2><p>  The resulting skirt can be temporarily put aside to return to the body.  The body, arms, legs and head of the doll can be painted if desired.  To do this, you need acrylic paint in a soft pink shade.  A hard brush paints evenly on the entire surface of the workpieces.  With a damp sponge, you can slightly blur the color to make the shade more natural.  After painting, the product is left for several hours to dry. </p><p>  The rags have dried and can be continued.  Now the face is made out.  To do this, eyes and eyelashes are drawn with a black gel pen or pencil.  The mouth is embroidered with a red thread. </p><h2>  Satin Ribbon Hairstyle </h2><p>  To make hair, from the satin ribbon you need to measure 15 long sections 5 centimeters long.  Also need 2 short.  Their length should not exceed a couple of centimeters. </p><p>  The edge of the tape, which is the worst to dissolve, it is recommended to slightly singe a lighter.  Future hair is carefully wound on a pencil or sushi sticks.  Each piece is fixed with a paper clip.  After that, the resulting parts are immersed in boiling water for ten seconds.  After that they will dry all night. </p><p>  The next day, the curls will dry.  The ribbons neatly unfold, while not reaching the scorched edge.  Using a pencil, a hair line is drawn. </p><p>  A strand of hair is folded in half and attached to the head with a few stitches.  Other strands are sewn on the same principle.  The resulting hair can be left loose or put in a high hairstyle. </p><p>  Thus, it‚Äôs not difficult to sew textile <span>dolls</span> with your own hands.  Moreover, making toys will become a fascinating hobby for the whole family, which will ensure a pleasant pastime. </p>
