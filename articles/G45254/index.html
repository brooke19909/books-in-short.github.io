    <p>  Advertising ... Today it accompanies us everywhere: posters and banners, banners and shields, stickers, flags, pennants, television spots, many other tricks call us to buy, visit, try ... And when did the first advertisement appear? </p><p>  Archaeological finds indicate that even in the ancient world this phenomenon was taken very seriously.  Some scholars believe that the history of advertising originates in ancient Egypt.  At least the first papyrus with the announcement of the sale of a slave was found in this country.  A little later, in the territory of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, historians found many planks, bone plates, copper plates containing information about the sale of certain goods.  They date from the 6th or 8th millennium BC. </p><p>  The history of advertising, scientists have found, begins with the advent of trade.  Recorded on a variety of media (papyrus, copper, bone), the information was then loudly read out in the most crowded places.  Even then, the <span>purpose of advertisements</span> was to attract interest, the entrepreneurial penetration into the minds of potential buyers.  Sellers, using sound, visual, written methods, forced buyers to take actions that were attractive and beneficial for the advertiser. </p><p>  The history of advertising indicates that the year 1472 became the most important milestone on the path to this phenomenon.  A <span>printing press</span> was invented a little earlier <span>,</span> namely this year the first print <span>advertisement is</span> dated <span>.</span>  He was found on the door of the church, and it reported the sale of a prayer book. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Print ads first appeared in 1630.  The enterprising Frenchman Theophrast Renodot began to advertise in the French newspaper.  One of the first is information about a worthy reward, which will receive a person who indicated the whereabouts of several stolen horses. </p><p>  Around the same time, the first advertising banner appeared.  It was a piece of paper inserted into the split end of a stick with a written dough, a painted picture.  He was put in the window of one of the inexpensive French zucchini: he advertised his inexpensive kitchen. </p><p>  With the development of industry, the history of advertising began to pick up speed.  Since 1839, photography has been used in this business.  And at the beginning of the 19th century, the first advertising agency appeared, which was not so different from modern ones.  Its employees bought up the pages in the newspaper, and then resold them to advertisers at an inflated price. </p><p>  <span>In Russia, the history of advertising has</span> developed no less rapidly.  The popular in the 10-11th century was called upon by popular prints, which quite quickly gave priority to advertising stands.  A little later, colorful leaflets began to appear in the windows of <span>public buildings,</span> they were decorated with horses, trams.  Many institutions printed calendars with their contacts.  A number of advertising bureaus were opened. </p><p>  Gradually developing and improving, announcements, calendars, etc., have survived to the present day. </p><p>  In the 90s, the history of social advertising begins in Russia.  Today, it plays an important role in creating a positive relationship between citizens and the state.  Social non-profit advertising calls for fighting violence, loving parents, raising children correctly, protecting nature, etc. </p><p>  With the advent of the Internet, the history of advertising is taking a new turn.  The network has not yet become familiar to most people, but the "techies" have already sent the necessary information to each other's email addresses.  Despite the fact that mailing lists already existed, it is believed that the history of Internet advertising begins in the nineties.  This, according to experts, was the ‚Äúgolden time of spam,‚Äù and at the same time <span>banner ads were</span> emerging <span>.</span> </p><p>  Today, advertising on the Web has surpassed all the wildest fantasies and expectations.  But this is not the end of the story. </p>
