There are no special antiquities, with the exception of the term Kallithea, in the vicinity, but the main attraction of the island - its capital Rhodes - is only 14 kilometers away.  Many are impressed by Lindos with its Acropolis.  But here's how to visit all these attractions - here opinions differ.  Some advise you to buy excursions to Faliraki, others say that it is better to simply study the schedule of public transport.  The easiest way is for those who can drive a car - they can rent it.  Many tourists advise renting a car directly at the hotel, especially since the prices there are almost the same as in the village, but it‚Äôs more convenient to arrange.  Just be aware that local roads are completely made of bends, and after sunset it can be scary to drive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Mitsis Alila Resort &amp; Spa 5 Deluxe Faliraki" class="if" height="438" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1798523.jpg" width="600"></div>

Tourists praise not only the conditions of their stay, but food, drinks and the quality of alcohol.  Gorgeous breakfasts, amazing pastries, a huge selection of tea and amazing √† la carte restaurants.  Tourists called the Mitsis Alila Resort &amp; Spa 5 * Deluxe Hotel (Greece) unsuitable for those who are on a diet and lose weight, because it offers vacationers too many temptations.  The cuisine is one of the best, and the restaurants √† la carte must be recorded per day.  The hotel is loved by foodies who want to try everything that is offered here.  The bars are beyond praise, the selection of wines is varied, and the bad ones are simply not served there.  There are no big problems with sunbeds, including near pools.  The hotel has a very nice, pleasant, relaxing atmosphere.  It is designed for a very relaxing holiday.  All entertainment, including music, ends at midnight.  The staff is very friendly, especially if you speak English with the staff.  The audience is extremely sedate, accustomed to a measured life for pleasure, most often English-speaking.  Therefore, animation and service are focused mainly on this category of tourists.  For dinner, everyone tries to dress beautifully.  Tourists want to come back here more than once. </p>
