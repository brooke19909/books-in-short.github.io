Payment for MTS services is what worries many customers of this financial institution.  After all, the mentioned mobile operator is one of the largest in Russia.  The "Thank You" bonus program allows you to save on purchases and on mobile communications at MTS.  But how to pay with accumulated points?  Is it possible to use the Sberbank loyalty system at all in cooperation with MTS?  We have to answer all this further.  We will also get acquainted with the key points of accumulating "Thank you" points from "Sberbank". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay pay thanks from Sberbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2135049.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The Thank You program from Sberbank is a fairly new proposal.  It allows customers to save on their purchases. </p><p>  When paying in stores with bank plastic, a citizen receives special bonus points.  In the future, they can pay for various purchases of up to 99%.  A tempting offer, which in practice is very popular. </p><h2>  Points accumulation basics </h2><p>  How does Sberbank thank you?  Is payment for MTS services possible in this way or not? </p><p>  First, you need to figure out how the accumulation of bonuses in the account of a citizen occurs.  We have already said that it‚Äôs enough for a person to pay with a credit card in stores to get extra ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù points.  But how are they charged? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Usually 0.5% of the purchase amount is taken.  It is in this ratio that points will come.  That is, if you spent 1,000 rubles, 5 ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù bonuses will be credited to the account of a Sberbank client. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Thanks stores from Sberbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2135048.jpg"></div>

    <p>  But if you spend the points received, you will have to remember the following rule: 1 point = 1 ruble.  And, as we have already said, you can pay for purchases with "Thank you" bonuses from Sber in the amount of up to 99% of the total cost of the goods. </p><h2>  MTS and "Thank you" </h2><p>  Some are wondering if the use of the studied <span>loyalty program is</span> allowed in MTS mobile phone stores.  This mobile operator offers many interesting services and opportunities.  And the presence of "Thank you" bonuses can sometimes save a lot of citizen money when buying, say, gadgets. </p><p>  MTS is an official partner of Sberbank.  So, "Thank you" can be spent on certain services of this mobile operator.  The main thing is to know how to do it. </p><h2>  Where to spend? </h2><p>  Thank you partners from Sberbank are diverse.  A complete list of relevant companies can be seen on the official page of the service.  MTS, as we have already said, is a partner of Sberbank.  And it is allowed to spend bonuses received under the "Thank you" program in this company. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But where and how to bring the idea to life?  Today, citizens can spend points on the program "Thank you": </p><ul><li>  in MTS mobile stores; </li><li>  on the operator‚Äôs online portal; </li><li>  to recharge mobile phone bills. </li></ul><p>  In fact, the procedure is very simple.  And everyone can cope with the task.  The main thing is to know how the MTS payment occurs.  Thanks from Sberbank helps to save a lot of money with this program, and accumulate bonus points too. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thanks partners from sberbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2135047.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Payment in the operator‚Äôs cabins </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth paying attention to the fact that payment of MTS "Thank you" from Sberbank allows you to make only with bank transfer.  Realizing the idea, as we have already said, is permitted in any communication salon of a given mobile operator.  But how to do that? </p><p>  It‚Äôs enough, when making a purchase, to give a plastic card with ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù points to the seller, and then inform that you want to pay off the accumulated bonuses from Sberbank.  Further, the buyer says how many points to write off as a purchase.  This is where all the actions end.  The seller will debit the named amount from the "Thank you" bonus account, and the balance will be withdrawn from the credit card.  If there are not enough points, the arrears in bonuses will also be debited from the client‚Äôs usual bank account. </p><p>  All MTS-stores "Thank you" from Sberbank accept for payment of any service.  The exception is the recharge of a mobile phone.  It can be held in MTS with the help of accumulated points, but not in the operator‚Äôs company salon. </p><h2>  Basic rules for use in stores </h2><p>  Of course, the ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù program from Sberbank implies compliance with certain rules.  They depend on how you use the accumulated points. </p><p>  In the case of MTS communication salons, it is necessary to remember the following: </p><ul><li>  exchange rate - 1 bonus = 1 ruble; </li><li>  points must be used within 3 years (the remainder burns out); </li><li>  You can pay up to 99% of the value of the goods; </li><li>  the minimum amount for writing off bonuses is 1 ruble. </li></ul><p>  And, as we have already emphasized, only the use of bank cards from Sberbank is considered.  Cash payment does not allow work with points accumulated under the loyalty program. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to find out thanks from Sberbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2135044.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Web site </h2><p>  Similarly, it is allowed to use ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù from Sberbank with partners of the relevant financial institution.  That is, when paying for purchases not in the MTS salon, you can use the proposed algorithm of actions. </p><p>  When making transactions in MTS via the Internet, you will have to use a special button that is responsible for writing off funds from the Sberbank bonus account.  She will appear in the "Trash" user.  Otherwise, the algorithm of actions remains the same - the number of points deducted as payment for the purchase, as well as the details of bank plastic, are indicated.  Otherwise, to put the idea into practice will not work. </p><h2>  MTS account replenishment </h2><p>  ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù from Sberbank, the payment can be transferred to the recharge account of the Internet or mobile phone.  In this case, money is transferred to the user's SIM card. </p><p>  To use this technique, you will have to go to the "My Account" on the MTS website.  More precisely, in the Internet assistant.  Further the following instruction will help: </p><ol><li>  Go to the "Top-up" section. </li><li>  Select the "Thank you from Sberbank" button. </li><li>  Indicate the details of a bank card. </li><li>  Enter the phone number to be replenished. </li><li>  Prescribe the transfer amount and how many bonuses you need to write off. </li><li>  Confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  With all this, the minimum amount to replenish the account is 500 rubles (of which a maximum of 450 rubles can be closed with points), and the maximum is limited to 6,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Points Check </h2><p>  How many ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù bonuses from Sberbank?  How to find out the number of accumulated points in the user's account.  Usually this information is reported when paying for purchases with bonuses from Sberbank.  But each client can check the information at any time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thanks program from sberbank" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2135045.jpg"></div>

    <p>  To check the account of the loyalty program from Sberbank, you must: </p><ol><li>  Send an SMS with the text "9" to the number 6470. The service is paid.  The message will cost 3 rubles. </li><li>  Insert a bank card into the ATM and in the "Thank you" section of the program, select the appropriate button. For example, "Check balance". </li><li>  Open "My Account" on the portal "Sberbank Online".  There, in the "Bonus Program" section, the necessary information will be displayed. </li></ol><p>  How to act - everyone decides independently.  But many try to find out about the state of the bonus account immediately before paying for the purchase with points.  In stores "Thank you" from Sberbank, you can check without difficulty during the calculation. </p>
