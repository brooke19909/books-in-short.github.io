    <p>  So, many new English names come into the Russian language, of which we know little, and sometimes do not know at all.  Many may be interested in the question of what is a <span>split system?</span>  One thing can be said - this is a conventional air conditioning, the help of which is so necessary for us in the summer, when the heat does not work.  <span>Split systems</span> have found the widest distribution in residential and public buildings as a device designed for <span>air conditioning.</span>  Let's deal with this incomprehensible device. </p><p>  What is a split system, and how does it differ from conventional air conditioners? </p><p>  Such a device includes a pair of separate blocks - an internal one serving as an evaporator and an external one representing a condensing unit.  The equipment of the external unit requires a fan, a condenser and a compressor.  Usually it is mounted on the wall of the building, balcony, roof, attic, in some utility room.  Installation of the indoor unit is carried out directly in the room, it is designed to filter air, as well as to cool or heat it.  The blocks are interconnected by means of two thin copper tubes placed in thermal insulation, laid behind suspended ceilings, under decorative plastic boxes or in wall gates.  Dealing with <span>what a</span> split system is, it is worth saying that the point of view about the simplicity of its installation is fundamentally wrong, this process is very time-consuming, it is difficult to compare with how a refrigerator or a washing machine is installed.  That is why it is unlikely that you can do this yourself. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, we figured out what a split system is, now we can talk about the principle of its action.  It consists in the fact that if you need to cool the room, then the freon enters through the first copper pipe from the heat exchange system of the outdoor unit to the indoor unit, and there it is blown by fans, which causes the appearance of cold air.  If it is necessary to heat the air, the very opposite happens: the external condenser becomes the evaporator, and the evaporator takes over the functions of the condenser.  In a split system there is not only a condenser and an evaporator, there is also a compressor installed in an external unit.  Its primary task is to compress Freon to give it properties that significantly increase the efficiency of the air conditioner.  If it is possible to connect several devices to one unit from the outside, then this will already be a multi-split system.  It is usually used in various organizations. </p><p>  According to the design features of indoor units, it is customary to distinguish: floor, ceiling, wall, column, channel and cassette split systems.  Wall-mounted ones remove heat or cold as efficiently as possible due to the fact that the noisy part of the air conditioner is taken out to the street.  Such air conditioners have the highest build quality, pressure lock, electronic brakes, as well as other positive aspects.  Floor standing is very easy to move from room to room or from apartment to apartment.  Such systems work perfectly for heating, and the low efficiency associated with the suction of outside air is considered a drawback.  Ceiling designed for small volumes of rooms with an elongated configuration.  With their help, you can direct a powerful stream along the ceiling or wall, providing air distribution as evenly as possible.  For large rooms with suspended ceilings, <span>cassette air conditioning is</span> best suited <span>.</span>  A split system of this type has the ability to mix fresh air from the street.  For such systems, the indoor unit is installed behind a suspended ceiling, so that only a beautiful grille is visible. </p><p>  It is customary to install wall split systems in apartments. </p>
