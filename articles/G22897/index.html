Its territory extends near the mouth of the Aramilka River, which flows into the water core of Iset.  A small satellite town of the millionaire of Yekaterinburg, it was founded much earlier than the Ural capital.  We will pay attention to its features, device and remarkable places below. </p><h2>  The secret of the origin of the name </h2><p>  Historians suggest that the name of the city - Aramil - comes from the Turkic language.  There are several variations of his translations: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ ‚Äúaram‚Äù, which means ‚Äúsadness‚Äù; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ "il", meaning "homeland"; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ "areme" - is translated as "a place overgrown with small bushes by the river." </p><p>  And they also tell a sad legend about the missing beauty.  It says that for a long time, a grieving father unsuccessfully called his disappeared daughter Aramil, but she never returned.  The girl, according to the legend, could drown, was kidnapped or lost in the thicket of the forest.  And the place of searches was named after her. </p><p>  Locals believe that their city is called a woman's name.  And they say "in Aramili."  It is this unique feature that sets it apart from the rest, because you can find few populated places whose names are feminine.  The remaining guests of the town say "in Aramil."  In official circles, also tend to male interpretation of the name. </p>

    <h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The city of Aramil in the Sverdlovsk region is one of the Ural centenarians.  In the summer of 1674, the southern fortification post of the Russian state was erected on the border with Bashkiria - Aramilskaya Sloboda.  By 1707, it included more than twenty settlements.  It was here that factories were built that laid the foundation for the formation of cities such as Kamensk-Uralsky, Berezovsky, Yekaterinburg, Sysert and others. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the civil revolution, the city was captured by the White Guards.  Industry has fallen into disrepair.  When the Soviets came to power, the revival of the city began.  On the basis of the cloth factory opened the first FZU.  Aramil children and children from orphanages became pupils.  Also in the 30s, the first secondary school and an institution for training pilots were built. </p><p>  17 collective farms were organized in Aramili.  Gradually, the city became the largest agricultural point. </p><p>  During the Second World War, many industrial enterprises and enterprises were evacuated to the city, because the front line did not pass here. </p><p>  In 1956, the merger of the Aramil region and Sysert.  According to the results of the referendum of 1966, it was decided to secede from Sysert.  In 1966, <span>on September 15,</span> Aramil received the title of city. </p><p>  The city in modern conditions is a small-sized settlement, which is located near Yekaterinburg.  Gradually, new buildings are being built in Aramil.  Most of the town is not equipped with gas, but this problem is being solved. </p><p>  A significant area problem is the Aramil pond.  Since the late 60s, they have been trying to clear it of debris and silt, but failed to do so.  It turned out that most of the garbage comes from the Iset River.  In this regard, swimming in the pond is not allowed. </p><p>  The placement of branches of the largest enterprises on the territory of Aramil and the development of local industry is a perspective for the city. </p><h2>  Modern Aramil </h2><p>  In 2002, by the decision of the Aramil Municipal Duma, the emblem of the city of Aramil was approved.  It is located at number 1020 in the State Heraldic Register. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Today there are 104 streets in the city of Aramil.  The longest of them in the left-bank part of the town is Rabochaya Street. </p><p>  In 2009, actively began to be built at home in the city.  Basically, three-story buildings were erected on the streets of Krasnoarmeyskaya, Rabochaya and Tekstilshchikov.  On the streets of May 1 and Cosmonauts you can find nine-story houses.  All new buildings in Aramil are economy-class housing that meets all the requirements of a comfortable stay. </p><p>  The infrastructure of the city is formed.  Development centers, shopping centers, pools, kindergartens continue to be built, thereby creating new jobs. </p><p>  Actively developers are buying up nearby land.  The location of Aramil relative to Yekaterinburg gives development prospects. </p><h2>  Aramil economy </h2><p>  The satellite city of Yekaterinburg hosts many different industries on its territory.  Enhanced migration distinguishes Aramil from other cities.  More than two thousand visitors were employed at his enterprises. </p><p>  The basis of urban production is light industry.  More than seventy percent of industrial workers are employed in this area.  Cloth factory still remains the main production in the city.  It constantly updates equipment, the staff is more than one and a half thousand people. </p><p>  In the city of Aramil there are small companies of local importance.  This is a small food factory, Sysert district industrial complex, a plant for the production of electrical products and the 2nd branch of the Zvezda association.  Also, a dairy and a bakery, a mill and repair shops of the Selkhoztekhnika regional association produce goods in the city. </p><p>  Three general schools have been built in Aramil.  There is also a municipal technical college. </p><p>  Of the cultural values, residents have the opportunity to visit the Zarya cinema, local clubs, the erected House of Culture and the hospital town. </p><p>  Since October 2011, a plastic packaging factory, Uralplastic-N, was opened in Aramil. </p><h2>  City industry </h2><p>  Over time, the military significance of the prison was lost.  Industry grew, and the settlement turned into a working village.  Residents left military service and were engaged in land development.  Along with other settlements, Aramil became the basis for the formation of heavy industry in the Urals. </p><p>  A few kilometers from the settlement, the Uktus plant was built.  The discovery of large deposits of copper ore laid the foundation for the construction of the Polevsky plant, and then several more valuable ore deposits were found. </p><p>  In 1840, a forge was built.  She produced household items, and in 1857 the production of woolen cloth appeared. </p><p>  The Civil War brought Aramil's cloth factory to decline.  There was no work in Aramil, and those who worked were not paid.  They were mainly engaged in agriculture.  But by 1923, the factory was restored, and its production level increased compared to pre-revolutionary.  The production of coarse cloth for overcoats, and later on patterned fabrics, was debugged.  In addition to cloth production, workshops, a brick factory and a flour mill were erected in the town. </p><p>  In 1941, the Kiev factory was evacuated to the city of Aramil of the Sverdlovsk region.  He was assigned the number 508. The plant was engaged in the production of gunpowder.  In the postwar years, the company began to manufacture artificial fibers.  In the 70s, the factory was reorganized and became known as the Polymercontainer.  Now it was decided to establish plastic production. </p><p>  To date, two mills have been preserved in Aramil, they have been improved and are in working condition.  Modern mill number 3 is one of them.  And mill number 4 is the second. </p><p>  At the end of the 90s, a van truck plant was put into operation and at the same time a stone processing factory (Mramorgaz). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of aramil" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/2044565.jpg" width="NaN"></div>

    <h2>  Holy Trinity Church and the Cloth Factory </h2><p>  Before the Holy Trinity Church was built, two churches existed on Aramil lands, but both were destroyed.  In 1784, at the very end of April, the foundation was laid for the construction of a wooden church in honor of the Holy Trinity.  It was consecrated by Bishop Varlaam in June 1790.  The foundations of a modern stone church were laid out in 1830, and only in 1842 the main church church was consecrated.  The left chapel was consecrated in honor of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the right - in honor of Elijah the Prophet. </p>

    <h2>  Aramil Special </h2><p>  The city of Aramil combines a compromise of the peasant principle, charming nature and rural life.  Of course, the pond remains the main problem of the region.  The administration of the city of Aramil continues to resolve this issue. </p><p>  Aramil is a small town that combines the features of the city and the ancient.  An active life does not boil here, but at the same time you can safely walk and see the sights. </p>
