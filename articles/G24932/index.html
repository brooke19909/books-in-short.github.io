One determining factor in the loan amount is information on a permanent source of income.  This certificate is called 2-PIT.  Accordingly, many questions arise.  What kind of certificate 2-NDFL is needed for a mortgage, for what period to take the document, who draws it up?  In the article we will answer them, and also familiarize ourselves with the rules for providing a certificate for a mortgage for Sberbank PJSC. </p><h2>  What kind of certificate 2-personal income tax? </h2><p>  The abbreviation PIT is deciphered as ‚Äúpersonal income tax‚Äù.  2-NDFL is a document that refers to official regulatory documents and is issued exclusively to an individual personally.  Be sure to indicate the name of the employing organization, the amount of cash payments to the employee and the tax deduction for the required period. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nalog-expert.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="need for a mortgage" class="if uuid-3194764" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3194764.jpg"></div><p>  A working citizen of our country pays mandatory income tax, unless of course he is officially employed.  It is not difficult for such persons to take a certificate of proof of their income. </p><p>  This certificate shows the level of income of a citizen and confirms his solvency.  You can get a certificate in the accounting department of the employer company, it is issued upon written request absolutely free of charge.  The finished document can be picked up after 3 days from the date of application. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2-PIT, in addition to mortgages, can be requested for: </p><ul><li>  visa application; </li><li>  employment in a new company; </li><li>  payment of tax deductions; </li><li>  the calculation of alimony; </li><li>  assignment of benefits and pension payments; </li><li>  establishing custody and adoption of a child. </li></ul><h2>  2-personal income tax for mortgages.  Proof of solvency </h2><p>  The main purpose of a 2-NDFL certificate for a mortgage is to confirm a permanent source of income, which would be enough to pay the debt.  Of course, the bank can take into account the additional income of the citizen, but only if he can document it confirmed. </p><p>  A bank specialist will consider and examine all the certificates, with the help of which the timely solvency of the client can be confirmed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="helder.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage certificate 2 personal income tax period" class="if uuid-3194750" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3194750.jpg"></div><p>  Help contains the following data: </p><ul><li>  Company name; </li><li>  F. I. O. employee; </li><li>  Policyholder TIN; </li><li>  passport data; </li><li>  registration address; </li><li>  employee income taxed at 13% for the requested period; </li><li>  total income; </li><li>  The total amount of tax paid, including alimony. </li></ul><p>  A 2-NDFL certificate for a mortgage is mandatory signed by the chief accountant or company manager, stamped.  Banks require only the original document.  Therefore, if you plan to apply for a mortgage in different banks, ask in advance for the required number of copies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to order 2-NDFL? </h2><p>  Each company sets its own internal rules for issuing certificates for its employees.  You can write to the manager with a statement.  It is permissible to write it in free form, with a request to indicate in the certificate 2-NDFL for a mortgage the period for which income should be calculated.  She should be given into her arms after 3 days, excluding holidays and weekends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fr.freepik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="need help 2 personal income tax for mortgages" class="if uuid-3194752" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3194752.jpg"></div><p>  If during this period you have not been issued a certificate, you can write a second appeal, but by sending it by registered mail with a notification and at the same time file a complaint with the labor inspectorate.  Moreover, if you have already quit your job, and three years have not passed since then, and the document was needed precisely for this period, then you must provide it. </p><p>  Failure to issue a 2-NDFL certificate for a mortgage by the head of the company will be unlawful.  And even more so in the following situations: </p><ul><li>  You are required to pay for the issuance of the relevant document; </li><li>  frequent treatment by one employee; </li><li>  request by the employee for more than 2 copies. </li></ul><p>  Such cases are very rare, and most often the employee on the day of treatment already has a signed certificate in his hands. </p><p>  Pay attention not only to the accuracy of the information written in it, but also to its completeness.  Before you bring 2-NDFL to a banking institution, review it fully, check the date of issue.  Manual corrections or amendments are not allowed in the document. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If the certificate is filled in according to the bank‚Äôs template, handwritten, then you need to do this only in blue ink, otherwise the credit institution will not accept it.  But this will lead to a waste of personal time not only of yours, but also of the chief accountant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thecollegeinvestor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Help 2 personal income tax for mortgage Sberbank" class="if uuid-3194760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3194760.jpg"></div><h2>  For what period is a document required </h2><p>  The Tax Code does not specify for how long a 2-NDFL certificate for a mortgage is needed.  Therefore, banking institutions independently determine this important moment.  When you contact the manager of the credit organization, he will tell you the exact period.  Most often, banks request for the last 6 or 12 months of operation. </p><h2>  Document Validity </h2><p>  The validity of the 2-NDFL certificate for a mortgage depends on the financial institution.  Most companies require a form certified by the employer no later than a month before applying for a loan. </p><p>  Another part of banks accepts with an earlier number.  Therefore, before requesting a 2-NDFL certificate for a mortgage from the employer, the term should be clarified by the lender, since the time of action in each organization is different. </p><p>  Most likely, the form taken in October will not work for the bank to provide you a mortgage loan if you apply for it in January. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.usatoday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage certificate 2 personal income tax term" class="if uuid-3194758" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3194758.jpg"></div><h2>  Requirements for 2-personal income tax at Sberbank </h2><p>  The banking institution of Sberbank PJSC better cooperates with individuals who are officially employed.  And, accordingly, able to confirm their solvency. </p><p>  Sberbank has the following conditions for a 2-NDFL certificate for a mortgage: </p><ul><li>  validity period - up to 30 days; </li><li>  if it is filled out on the lender's form, then its validity is 2 weeks. </li></ul><p>  The planned loan amount affects the period of reflection of customer income: </p><ul><li>  if you take a loan of up to 300,000 rubles.  - information is required for the last 4 months of work; </li><li>  with an amount of more than 1.0 million rubles, income is taken for 8 months; </li><li>  more than one million - information is taken for 1-3 years.  The client can provide a separate certificate for each year, which will not be a violation. </li></ul><p>  Moreover, if you quit several times and your employer changed, then information from previous places of work is provided. </p><p>  Bank managers always recommend their customers to request 2-NDFL last, so as not to redo the certificate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.shouselaw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Help 2 personal income tax for mortgages" class="if uuid-3194749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3194749.jpg"></div><h2>  Information on Sberbank income form </h2><p>  Instead of a 2-NDFL certificate, a branch of PJSC Sberbank may require an official certificate in the form of a bank.  You get a blank template at a lending institution, and take it to the accounting department of the organization where you work.  The director signs such an act, and a seal is also affixed.  As soon as the document is in your hands, check it carefully, it will be invalid during correction. </p><p>  Sberbank receives information about the authenticity of the statement, as it checks the information in the document and tax reporting. </p><p>  To obtain a large loan amount, you will be required to confirm income according to the 2-NDFL certificate in the form of a bank. </p><h2>  Is it possible to apply for a mortgage at Sberbank without 2-personal income tax </h2><p>  Recently, employers have ceased to officially employ workers or in the employment contract they set a minimum salary in order to pay less tax.  In such a situation, it is impossible to obtain a statement of real income, which is required by the bank.  Sberbank PJSC can meet such a client, but only under certain conditions.  Before issuing a mortgage loan without a 2-NDFL certificate, the bank will evaluate the borrower's credit history and track the facts of solvency: </p><ol><li>  Is there a salary card in which bank is open? </li><li>  Are there any other types of credit loans? </li><li>  Is a debit card issued to a client at Sberbank PJSC? </li></ol><p>  If all the questions are answered positively, then most likely Sberbank will be able to issue a loan with a minimum list of documents.  To do this, you will need to provide a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation, fill out an application for a loan, provide any paper confirming income.  With this list of documents, you can count on an amount of no more than 1.5 million rubles.  But if you are not officially working, then this amount will not be given to you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="loans.usnews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what kind of help 2 personal income tax is needed for a mortgage" class="if uuid-3194762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46377/3194762.jpg"></div><h2>  Is it possible to fake a statement of income </h2><p>  On the Internet, they often began to offer a service to purchase completed documents indicating the required income in order to get a mortgage.  Remember, these actions lead to a violation of Russian law! </p><p>  A fake at a credit institution is immediately recognized, the security department is engaged in such checks.  Its employees make written or oral requests to employers.  They can also call the chief accountant or the personnel department and clarify information about the employee, verify the numbers. </p><p>  An easy consequence will be a refusal of mortgage lending with blacklisting of your data, thereby spoiling your personal credit history. </p><p>  But for such actions, criminal punishment is also provided.  Therefore, think well if it is worth the risk. </p>
