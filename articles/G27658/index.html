    <h2>  Magistrate Building </h2><p>  The city has a large number of interesting sights and skillful architectural ensembles.  One of them is the building of the Magistrate.  To see him, people descend to Fire Embankment.  The construction is dated to the period from 1777 to 1780.  Architect - P.R. Nikitin.  The style of construction is 18th century classicism.  At first, the distance between the buildings was equal.  In the 19th century, a brick house was built between the two buildings.  There is a fire tower of great height.  The decor repeats the style characteristic of other elements of the composition.  Reconstruction was carried out, as a result of which the tower became the center of the architectural ensemble.  The original layout was kept unchanged.  Only the introduction of partitions somewhat distorted the historical truth. </p>
