    <p>  Wrap the main rope around the base.  It can be a rectangular piece of cardboard or a small book.  Remove the resulting ring and cut it on one side.  Pull the resulting bunch in the middle with a red woolen thread. </p><p>  In the same place, attach a separate piece of twine.  Then fold the workpiece in half and, stepping back a little from the bend, wrap it across the just attached fragment of twine.  The top of this composition will be the muzzle of our animal. </p><p>  The whole goat with his own hands is formed as follows.  Divide the threads hanging freely into even halves and proceed to create separate <span>parts of the body.</span>  Also cut 24 identical strips from the rope. </p><h2>  Working on the details </h2><p>  Weave one pigtail of 12 threads and two more - each of six.  The first part will serve to create the hands of the figures, and the remaining ones you use to form the ears and horns.  Thus, you will get a real twine goat.  A master class to achieve this goal advises you to complete the following steps. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Fold one of the small braids with a figure of eight and fasten it with a thread in the middle so that it keeps its shape.  You got ears.  Insert them together with the second thin pigtail (these will be the horns) into the previously prepared bundle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself goat" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/821626.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <p>  Wrap part of the workpiece under them a couple of turns of twine, thread the finished handles into it and fasten them.  <span>The goat is</span> almost ready <span>with its own hands</span> .  Now you need to put it on the top cut off from the bottle and start making the skirt. </p><h2>  We are engaged in decoration </h2><p>  Take a small flap of fabric and walk along its edge with the simplest seam.  Pull the ends of the thread so that the pattern is pulled together and forms a cone.  Braid the bottom edge of the product, decorate it with beads, applique or any other decorative elements.  Put the finished skirt on the figure and fasten the thread at the waist. </p><p>  Your New Year goat should have eyes.  They can be made of small cardboard circles: draw colored pupils with a marker on a white background, cut the blank and glue it.  Also, as a material, ceramic clay is excellent, from which you can dazzle any shapes.  Alternatively, sew two beads or buttons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="goat pattern" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/821623.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <p>  Tie neat bows from a thin <span>satin ribbon</span> on the horns of your beauty <span>.</span>  If you want, attach it to her head or throw a square cloth flap on her shoulders, which goes well in color with the skirt. </p><p>  At this stage, a twine goat is finally formed.  The master class recommends complementing her image with a beautiful basket of vegetables or fruits.  To make this accessory, use a small shampoo or perfume cap.  Also, for this case, half of the Kinder Surprise packaging is suitable. </p><p>  Lubricate the base with superglue and cover it tightly with twine.  Wait for the walls to dry, put the contents of the basket inside and glue it to the handles of the figure. </p><h2>  We make a goat </h2><p>  You can also pair the goat for your little animals.  It must be made of braids of different thicknesses.  So, for the body you will need 25 cuts, for the hands - two dozen, on the ears and horns - 6, respectively. </p><p>  Braid separately all these groups of ropes except the body.  Rewind their edges firmly.  Trim the edges with scissors to make them look neat, and cut off any excess.  Now we turn to work on the face.  Attach a few ropes to the central part of the remaining bundle (it will be a beard) and rewind them with red thread (mouth). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from twine New Year" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26514/821625.jpg" width="338"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Then we proceed to the formation of the head.  Fold the workpiece in half and smooth it.  Without affecting the freely hanging strands of the beard, bandage the main bundle at the top.  Now bend the pigtail for the ears with a figure of eight and insert it between the strands.  It will be ears.  Pass the future horns there. </p><p>  Gather the resulting composition together, smooth and adjust its elements so that you have a head formed.  Secure the structure by wrapping the area under it with thread.  Put it on a layer about a centimeter or two wide (you get a neck) and, without trimming the thread, go to the next step.  Insert a pigtail for your hands (the goat‚Äôs outline will tell you how to do it right) and continue to wrap it to form a body. </p><h2>  Final touches </h2>

To make the legs for the goat, at the end of work with the body, braid the remaining threads below in two braids.  Fold them up and wrap them fully.  To make the animal denser, you can add several layers of rope coating to its body or even put a little synthetic winterizer under them.

    <p>  Sew a rag suit for the toy.  As a material, beautiful handkerchiefs are suitable.  Decorate your clothes.  Make a stand for crafts or attach loops to them so that you can hang them somewhere. </p><p>  Now you have beautiful goat and twine goat.  A master class on their creation will help you make wonderful New Year decorations or amulets for loved ones who were born under the sign of this animal.  Such a talisman will bring them a lot of joy, prosperity, happy changes and give vitality.  This amulet will become the guardian of the hearth and well-being in any home. </p>
