    <p>  Many Russians liked the proximity of the airport, as a result of which the transfer was short in duration.  Regarding the food provided, the reviews of our compatriots diverge somewhat, although most people find that the food at Armas Beach Hotel is tasty and quite varied.  In this hotel, in addition to Russians, Germans and Poles also rest.  The staff speaks many languages.  A Russian-speaking girl works at the registration desk.
