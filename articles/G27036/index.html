  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lake Taupo in New Zealand: description, sizes, flora and fauna</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the attractions of New Zealand is Lake Taupo, located on the North Island in the province of Auckland, a region of Waikato.  On the shore of the lake there is a small town with the same name. </p><p>  The lake has an ancient volcanic origin and is a popular tourist center, attracting vacationers and inquisitives. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Looking at New Zealand on the map, it is easy to notice that the lake is located almost in the center of the island. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="-38.791557" data-lng="175.9150389" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="8"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/0/4/9/13049.png"></div><p>  If you look from a bird's eye view, you can see that the lake is an extensive circus-shaped basin, the so-called caldera, which was formed after the eruption of the volcano Oruanui. </p><p>  The strongest eruption occurred approximately 27 thousand years ago, seriously changing the landscape of the island.  According to the research of modern scientists, the last eruption of Oruanui, due to which a lake formation appeared, had an apocalyptic level of danger.  During the explosion of the inner part of the volcano, more than 1200 km <sup>3</sup> of magma particles and subclastic materials rose into the air.  Ashes covered the entire island center, ashes fell even on the central part of New Zealand and Chatham Island, which is located at a distance of 1000 km from the island of North. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the eruption, the deep (almost 200 m) caldera at an altitude of 368 m above sea level was gradually filled with fresh water from underground sources, rivers that changed their course, and rains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.embark.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beauty Taupo" class="if uuid-3015706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/3015706.jpg"></div><p>  The water in the lake is not cold, because the proximity of the magmatic layer causes the activity of geothermal sources, they create warm strong currents at the bottom of Taupo. </p><p>  Lake Taupo can be compared with Baikal, because in the southern hemisphere of the Earth it is the largest storage of fresh water.  For the Maori tribe, the natives of these places, the lake was a sacred place. </p><h2>  Title </h2><p>  In Maori, Taupo sounds like ‚ÄúTupo-nui-a-Tia‚Äù (Taup≈ç-nui-a-Tia).  This can be translated as ‚Äúcloak from Tia‚Äôs shoulders.‚Äù </p><p>  According to the traditions that the locals cherish, Tia called the first of the Maori who visited these parts and saw the lake surface.  Maori consider the lake to be the sea. </p><h2>  Scale in numbers </h2><p>  Even having arrived and looking at the lake, it is difficult to immediately realize its scale, because the blue expanse of the lake extends far and merges with the sky.  If we turn to the numbers, it will become clear that the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLake Taupo is more than 600, or rather, 616 square kilometers.  This is 2 times larger than the other New Zealand Lake Te Anau. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The writer Jules Verne, who mentioned Taupo in the book ‚ÄúChildren of Captain Grant‚Äù as exceptionally deep, with almost no bottom, was mistaken.  In fact, the depth of Lake Taupo is small.  The deepest place is in the lake center, when it was measured, it turned out to be 164 m, and the average depth is about 90 m. Of course, the depth of Tuapo cannot be compared with Baikal, because the famous lake in Russia is the deepest in the world (more than 1600 m) . </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tongarirolodge.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fishing on the lake" class="if uuid-3015719" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/3015719.jpg"></div><p>  The Taupo form is interesting: the oval lake of the North Island differs from the lakes of the South Island similar to the winding rivers.  Taupo is 46 km long and slightly more than 30 km wide.  You will have to spend several days walking around the lake, because the winding coastline stretches for 153 km. </p><h2>  Pool </h2><p>  More than 30 rivers flow into the fresh transparent Taupo, the largest of them are Tangariro and Waitahanui.  Water is collected in the lake from an area of ‚Äã‚Äã3327 km <sup>2</sup> . </p><p>  Only Waikato flows out of the lake. </p><h2>  Natural features </h2><p>  The flora and fauna of Lake Taupo are no different from New Zealand. </p><p>  Some of the lake shores are densely overgrown with beech and coniferous forests, greening at any time of the year.  The undergrowth is made up of thickets of ferns and shrubs.  Most plants are endemic.  <span>The symbol of New Zealand</span> - silver fern - is found in the vicinity of Taupo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The lake is inhabited by natives - tyulka, trout and northern kour - crayfish, as well as brown trout, rainbow and brook imported from the USA and Europe in the century before last.  The trout has taken root, and now it is not difficult to catch a 10-meter individual.  A small smelt, also brought in, is feed for trout. </p><p>  But there are few mammals in the vicinity of the lake.  A thousand years ago, only the fur seals and sea lions inhabited the coast of the islands of New Zealand, and bats lived inland.  European immigrants brought ferrets, ermines, rabbits, possums, which actively bred on fertile land.  European hedgehogs have also taken root here, adapting well to local conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newzealand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cycling routes around the lake" class="if uuid-3015704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/3015704.jpg"></div><p>  In the forests around Lake Taupo, kiwi, kea birds, owl parrot, wingless sultanka live.  There are reptiles that are non-toxic and harmless to humans - these are hatteria and skink.  There are no snakes not only near the lake, but on the whole island.  Unpleasant consequences can be in a person only after meeting with a poisonous spider cathirp. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  The subtropical marine climate on Severny Island, where Lake Taupo is located, is stable, there are no sudden changes in weather. </p><p>  Summer temperature does not exceed +24 ... +27 <sup></sup> , winter is mild, frosts below -10 <sup></sup>  are rare.  Long rains are not uncommon in winter and spring. </p><h2>  The lake as an object of tourism </h2><p>  During the year, about 2 million tourists visit Lake Taupo, staying in the town of the same name.  Of course, most people come for great fishing.  The lake and rivers are teeming with fish, fishermen with excitement catch trout and eel.  A fishing license is inexpensive - 97 New Zealand dollars.  The fish is immediately cooked and served on the table.  Fishermen can rent yachts and fishing equipment. </p><p>  What else do tourists offer: </p><ul><li>  surface of the lake; </li><li>  speed boat trips; </li><li>  water skiing; </li><li>  a visit to the Valley of the Dinosaurs (30 models of extinct animals in full size are presented); </li><li>  rafting along rivers flowing into the lake; </li><li>  bungee jumping into the Waikato and Waikato rivers; </li><li>  excursions to the shrimp farm and to the local observatory. </li></ul><p>  Every year, cycling fans cross the lake in New Zealand.  For this, many cycling routes of varying complexity have been laid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.acaciacliffslodge.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Extreme entertainment on the lake" class="if uuid-3015689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/3015689.jpg"></div><p>  Finally, Taupo attracts those who wish to swim in the crystal clear water, as if poured into a huge volcanic bowl, to have a picnic or to look into a restaurant.  Tourists relax and contemplate the water surface, sitting on the banks covered with emerald grass. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Near the lake there are a variety of attractions, natural and historical-cultural.  It is worth visiting them to get a complete picture of the place where Lake Taupo is located. </p><p>  In the city of Taupo, you can look into the lake museum to find out how the Maori tribes lived on the lake shores, what crafts they did, how the Europeans mastered these lands.  The museum displays interesting exhibits: real canoes, tools, weapons, tackles, the Maori dwelling was reconstructed.  There are stuffed animals and birds, including the extinct moa.  The museum has a small art gallery and a botanical garden. </p><p>  By boat or boat you can reach the northwest side of the lake.  Here, on the cliff of Main Bay, a huge, 10 meters high, formidable face of the leader Ngatoraruanga is carved.  This is the glorious Maori leader who lived a thousand years ago.  The natives believe that as long as the bas-relief is intact, the volcano does not wake up and bring harm.  The image looks ancient, although actually carved at the end of the XX century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.taupolakeadventures.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The face of the deity Taupo" class="if uuid-3015686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/3015686.jpg"></div><p>  You can go to Waitomo Cave, where you will have to board boats again - the cave is almost completely flooded with water.  In silence and darkness, boats sail past the ancient calcareous sag - stalactites and stalagmites.  But the main decoration is fireflies.  Glowing insects have chosen a stone arch, creating the effect of a night sky sparkling with millions of stars. </p><p>  You can not visit Lake Taupo and not visit the Huko Falls.  On the Waikato River, this is the most popular attraction.  From the Maori language, Hook is translated as ‚Äúfoam‚Äù, and this is true.  A stream of water, sandwiched by the mountains, with noise, foam and iridescent overflows rushing from a 20-meter height.  For ease of inspection, a bridge is built over the waterfall. </p><p>  It is interesting to see the discharge of water from Aratiatia Dam near the lake.  Water is discharged twice a day. </p><p>  Looking at New Zealand on a map, one cannot miss Orakei-Koraco Park, where there are numerous geysers in the valley formed by the ancient volcano. </p><p>  Nearby is the geothermal complex "Craters of the Moon", it is here that tourists bathe in hot mineral springs.  The most popular one is called ‚ÄúChampagne Pool‚Äù, the water temperature in it on the surface reaches 76 ¬∞ C. You can only move in the park along specially laid paths, bridges, because the ground is too hot.  Due to the proximity of igneous rocks, the earth and some plants are pink. </p><p>  And another unforgettable tour awaits those who go to Hobbiton. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imgur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Toganriro National Park" class="if uuid-3015711" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/3015711.jpg"></div><p>  The set of the famous film was turned into a museum, which is why it is interesting to all fans of the trilogy.  40 houses, orchards and a mug of ale - what else is needed for happiness! </p><h2>  Drive entertainment </h2><p>  There is a lot of extreme sports near Lake Taupo, tourists are offered: </p><ol><li>  From a height of 3.5-4.4 thousand meters, jump with a parachute. </li><li>  Rope jumping in river gorges. </li><li>  Sightseeing flights on airplanes and helicopters. </li><li>  Jet boat ride on the river. </li></ol><h2>  Volcanoes </h2><p>  Taupo is part of a seismically active volcanic zone, so Toganriro National Park is located on its shore. </p><p>  On the territory of the park are the sacred mountains of Ruapehu, Tongariro, Ngaruhoe.  These volcanoes were considered as sleeping, only Tongariro occasionally breathed multi-colored fumes.  In 2010, Tongariro stepped up, spewing ashes and stones and scaring the locals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lovingnewzealand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Geyser park" class="if uuid-3015716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/3015716.jpg"></div><p>  The ski resorts of Fakanapa (43 pistes), Turoa (17 pistes), Tukino (characterized by gentle slopes) are open on the slopes of the volcano Ruapehu. </p><p>  Specialists of the Institute of Geology, which is located on the territory of the park, study the Taupo volcano, and also show the visitors of the observatory the activity of volcanoes and geysers.  Tourists are invited to create a computer simulation of the zone of volcanic activity and try on themselves earthquakes of various strengths. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Lake Taupo (New Zealand) can only be reached by air.  Airplanes from Wellington, Auckland, Australia arrive daily at Taupo Airport. </p><p>  Sightseeing is possible by shuttle bus.  He leaves every hour from the city center from the stop marked i-SITE, and takes him to all tourist sites.  Ticket price 15-25 USD (1000-1675 rubles). </p><p>  Another option is to rent a car, this will cost 60 USD / day (4000 rubles). </p><p>  It is more convenient to walk around the city on foot, on a motor scooter, and a segway. </p>
