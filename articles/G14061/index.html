Independent planning of the house in which you want to live for decades makes it much more comfortable.  Although design and construction is a difficult and rather lengthy task, it is worth it.  Unfortunately, building your own home today is not the cheapest thing.  Even the cost of the legal part of this issue “buried” for many the idea of ​​building their own home, not to mention how much the land for building costs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Building area" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10770/14332.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Many try to turn to specialists who can give practical advice, but still you need to know the basic definitions for building design: </p><p>  · The living area is described by the area of ​​all residential buildings of the room, this does not include pantries, bathrooms, kitchens, corridors, garages and basements. </p><p>  · The total area includes all the rooms inside the surface walls. </p><p>  · The building area is the area that is limited by the outside perimeter of the building. </p><p>  · Construction volume is the entire volume of the building.  It is bounded by the outer surface of the walls, floor, lower floor and roof. </p><p>  · The elevated floor is characterized by the fact that its floor level is above ground level. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  · Ground floor.  The floor level of this floor is below ground level by less than half the height of the room. </p><p>  · Basement - the same as the basement, only the difference between the floor level and the ground level is more than half of the whole house. </p><p>  · Attic room - located in the attic and has the property of a sloping ceiling. </p><p>  We need to talk in detail about what is the built-up area.  After all, this is a very important part of the work in the entire design of the house. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Built-up area" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10770/14322.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The building area is a necessary part of any finished project of a private house.  This is the area occupied by the building in its completed state.  It is defined as the horizontal projection of the outlines of the house on the foundation.  It is important to understand that you do not need to include in the building area: </p><p>  · The area of ​​basements and underground garages that do not protrude above the surface of the entire territory. </p><p>  · The area of ​​minor parts, for example, ramps, <span>external stairs,</span> roof overhangs, awnings. </p><p>  · Area of ​​auxiliary facilities such as arbors. </p><p>  But how is the built-up area calculated?  In these calculations, it is necessary to take into account the legislation, namely the norms and rules of SNiP 31-01-2003. </p><p>  Despite the fact that on the territory of settlements, basically, building and land use standards that set the boundaries of territorial zones are already in place, you need to be able to correctly calculate the building area.  It has different meanings for each territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Building land" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10770/14339.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <p>  In order to calculate the maximum permissible percentage of development, you need to know the ratio of the sum of the areas to all the buildings of the land plot.  In order to know this ratio, you need to have a site development plan and plans for all the structures that are built on it. </p><p>  If buildings are built according to architectural designs, then the necessary dimensions can be determined from them.  Basically, all topographic schemes today are drawn using special computer programs, and the built-up area in them is calculated automatically. </p>
