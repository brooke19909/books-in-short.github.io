Khanty-Mansiysk Bank offers refinancing with an attractive rate of 12.5% ​​per year.  Russians eligible for MSCs or other state subsidies may apply for a loan agreement without down payment.  For other programs, you must make a deposit for the acquired property. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mortgage Khanty Mansiysk Bank" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38878/1512674.jpg" width="600"></div>
