It is difficult to call Kabardinka the most popular resort on the coast, most often it is preferred by older couples, as well as families with children who prefer a relaxing and peaceful vacation.  Vacationers will probably notice groups of children and adolescents, and all because camps have continued to exist here since Soviet times, many of which are popular. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews about holidays in Kabardinka" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/1403550.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Of course, reviews about holidays in Kabardinka are what you need to build on when choosing a resort.  It is important to consider everything: the geography of the area, climate features, average daily air temperature, as well as sea water.  Kabardinka is famous for its mild, dry climate; the season lasts from mid-May until the end of October. </p><h2>  Resort Features </h2><p>  The resort is literally immersed in greenery, a lot of coniferous trees that fill the air with an amazing and enchanting aroma.  Many people call Kabardinka a health resort.  If you want to strengthen immunity, get rid of respiratory diseases, you definitely should come here at least for a couple of weeks. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in kabardinka reviews tips" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/1403583.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  When to go to Kabardinka? </h2><p>  Ideal for relaxing in Kabardinka early June and mid-September.  At this time there are not many vacationers, the air temperature is comfortable for living, the sea is warm and gentle, the likelihood of a storm is minimal.  In autumn there are so many fruits and vegetables that tourists stock up on vitamins and bring juicy and ripe fruits home. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  Kabardinka offers many accommodation options.  Most often, tourists prefer small private hotels and hotels.  In recent years, demand for the private sector has declined.  Modern vacationers are so finicky and demanding that local residents try to convert their homes into small hotels with all the necessary conditions for a comfortable stay.  If you pay attention to the reviews about the rest in Kabardinka of those tourists who chose private hotels for themselves, then you will understand that there can be no talk of developed infrastructure.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe plots is sometimes barely enough to set up a small garden, put a gazebo and inflate the pool.  That is why lately vacationers prefer recreation centers. </p>

    <p>  Here, for example, the recreation center "Milan" (Kabardinka), reviews of which can be found very diverse.  It is located on the Black Sea coast, equipped with its own pebble beach, which offers stunning views of Novorossiysk.  If you are looking for an inexpensive, but at the same time cozy place to relax on the sea, the best option is the recreation center "Milan" (Kabardinka).  Reviews of tourists emphasize the favorable geographical position, proximity to the sea, its cleanliness.  Vacationers will appreciate the spacious, well-maintained area, equipped with places for recreation, eating and entertainment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Here is another option - recreation center "Eaglet" (Kabardinka).  Reviews about it are quite contradictory.  Among the advantages of leisure, I would like to note good accommodation, transport accessibility and the presence of our own pebble beach, as well as parking.  If you are planning a vacation with children, looking for a quiet and peaceful place, then the Orlenok recreation center (Kabardinka) will be an ambiguous option.  The reviews of tourists who had a rest in the summer of 2016 tell that the comfort of the rooms leaves much to be desired: old worn-out furniture, lack of signs of repair, terrible condition of plumbing, dirt in the bathroom and toilet.  This must be taken into account in the process of choosing the best accommodation option, especially when it comes to holidays with children. </p>

    <p>  Information about the best recreation centers (Kabardinka), reviews about them - all this information must be carefully studied even at the planning stage of recreation.  Far from always, the owners are honest with potential vacationers.  Agree, I would not want to spoil the whole impression of the resort from the first days of my stay in Kabardinka due to the wrong <span>hotel, hotel</span> or recreation center.  You have to spend your entire vacation in this issue, so go to the choice more demanding and carefully.  Reviews about the rest in Kabardinka will help you with this. </p><p>  Pricing policy varies greatly.  It is possible to rent a room worth 800 rubles per night.  If you value comfort, cleanliness in the rooms and developed infrastructure of the hotel territory, accommodation will cost you an average of 2000-2500 rubles per night. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If you are planning an independent trip, it would be nice to know in advance how to get to the resort from Novorossiysk or Gelendzhik - the nearest major cities.  If you want to organize an unforgettable vacation in Kabardinka, reviews, tourist tips will surely help you. </p><p>  So, as already noted, Kabardinka is located between Novorossiysk and Gelendzhik, you can get here in several ways: by plane, train and bus.  There is another option that has recently been chosen by an increasing number of tourists - in a private car.  In this case, it is necessary to move along the M4 "Don" highway, from where there will be an exit to Kabardinka.  Even if this is the first such a long trip for you and your family, you will never get lost, especially nowadays there are a lot of gadgets that will help in organizing navigation.  The duration of your trip, of course, depends on what the starting point of the route is. </p><h2>  Beauty Kabardinka </h2><p>  If you have chosen an airplane, it is important to know that there are three airports in the region: in <span>Gelendzhik, Krasnodar</span> and Anapa.  If possible, it is better to purchase tickets to Gelendzhik, and overcome the remaining 15 km to Kabardinka by shuttle bus or bus.  If you arrive in Anapa, you will have to get to the resort a little longer - through Novorossiysk.  Well, the most inconvenient option is Krasnodar Airport.  Your path will lie through Novorossiysk with several transfers.  The length of the route is 180 km. </p>

    <p>  Not everyone can afford an expensive flight by plane.  Moreover, families of military personnel, railway workers have certain privileges and privileges, therefore trains are still popular.  If you decide to go to Kabardinka by train, it is better to get to Novorossiysk or Gelendzhik, and from there - to the resort by the nearest regular bus. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Tourists can choose a hotel or a recreation center, implying a system of three meals a day.  If you are accustomed to travel to rest abroad, you will have to face the scarcity of local breakfasts, lunches and dinners, even in the best hotels.  Here you will never find an all-inclusive power system.  It is necessary to prepare for this in advance so as not to spoil your vacation.  Simplicity, comfort and silence - all this is a vacation in Kabardinka.  Prices, hotel reviews are about the same.  Most of them offer to refuse food in hotels and pensions, preferring small cafes and restaurants, of which there are many.  Eating in restaurants and cafes, you get the opportunity to get acquainted with Caucasian and Asian cuisine.  On average, lunch in a small local cafe will cost 250-300 rubles.  This year, the cost of barbecue is also pleasing - 1000 r.  per kilogram of juicy mutton. </p>

    <p>  Fresh fruits and vegetables, meat, greens - all this gives Kabardinka.  Rest with children, reviews of which are mostly positive, implies a reverent attitude to nutrition.  That is why many families prefer to cook on their own, especially since almost all pensions, recreation centers and private hotels offer all the necessary conditions for this.  You can always use the stove, refrigerator.  The only thing is that this food option is hardly budgetary, since during the season the prices on the markets are sky-high.  For several months, local residents intend to get the maximum profit at the expense of vacationers.  That is why it is better to purchase basic food products in chain stores, where prices are much lower, but buy fresh vegetables and fruits in the market. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  <span>Kabardinka beaches are</span> equipped with everything necessary for a good rest.  Sports equipment rentals, all kinds of water activities, souvenir shops and local sweets are all within walking distance.  Prices, surprising tourists, reasonable. </p>
