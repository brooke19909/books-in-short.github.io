    <p>  The nature of the region is clean air, pine forests, peaks, as if covered with snow and amazing waterfalls.  In the Saratov region, you can not only enjoy beautiful views, but also significantly improve your health.  One of the famous rivers of Russia - the Volga - flows here.  Residents and guests of the region like to relax on its shores. </p><p>  But not many people know about where the most beautiful places of the region are located, for example, waterfalls in the Saratov region.  How to get to them?  What other places are worthy of attention?  Perhaps the information provided can help you choose a new place to stay. </p><h2>  Waterfalls in the Saratov Region </h2><p>  Is this possible in the steppe zone?  Nevertheless, a real miracle can be seen on the Bolshoi Irgiz River.  Waterfalls (Saratov Region) - this is the name of the inhabitants of the overflow dam on the Sulak reservoir.  The sight opening up is literally mesmerizing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The place made by the work of human hands and polished by time really resembles small waterfalls, or, as the locals call them, ‚Äústeps‚Äù.
