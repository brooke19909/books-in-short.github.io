    <h2>  Turunge (Marmaris) </h2><p>  This village is very comfortable in a small valley among the mountains, and its sea bay is considered to be the most beautiful in the vicinity.  Zeus Turunc Hotel 3 * (Turkey) was not without reason built in these places.  The surrounding landscapes and climate of this village are probably the most successful on the coast of the Aegean Sea.  The air is dry and healing, the beaches are surrounded by picturesque impregnable cliffs that are covered with pine trees, and the bay itself is located in the reserve and closes Turunj from the unpleasant winds that Marmaris guests complain about.  Rest here is measured and calm.  There are few Russians so far, mostly Europeans with children or elderly pensioners.  Hotels are mainly three-ruble or four-star hotels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The village is highly appreciated by lovers of budget holidays.  If Marmaris is often presented as a ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù resort in Turkey, Turundj is more like a Spanish village by the sea.  In the evening, the main street is closed for transport, and it becomes a pedestrian.  Then a variegated, mainly European audience, goes for a walk and buy various trinkets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zeus Turunc Hotel 3 * Standard" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2109028.jpg"></div>
