Until recently, no one had any idea about the presence of ultrasonic waves with an almost unlimited range of applications.  In our time, the use of an ultrasound apparatus is common not only in medicine, but also in cosmetology.  In addition, this device can become indispensable in everyday life and household!  But first things first. </p><h2>  Operating principle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.17ninety.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ultrasound machine" class="if uuid-2600449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95919/2600449.jpg"></div><p>  How does this device work?  Why, thanks to the ultrasound therapy apparatus, can the doctor see the image of a certain organ, and the cosmetologist can cleanse the face and improve blood circulation in the capillaries of the skin? </p><p>  The operation of the ultrasound apparatus is based on the creation of an ultrasonic wave oscillating with a frequency of 1-25 MHz.  When this wave of ultrasound hits various organs and tissues, each individual cell reflects it in its own way, transmitting the signal back to the sensor, after which it is transmitted to the monitor of the device.  It is on this principle of action that its use in medicine is based. </p><p>  In cosmetology, the reflecting ability of tissues is not used, but the ability of ultrasound to literally push the necessary substances into the skin with its vibrations.  Before the procedure, a special cream gel is smeared on the skin, which cleans the pores under the action of an ultrasonic wave. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The video describes in detail the principle of action and the history of the discovery of ultrasound. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="xSRNcleYP30" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSRNcleYP30" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/5/2/3/1/5231.jpg"></div><h2>  Domestic use </h2><p>  Ultrasound is widely used in everyday life today, replacing the usual rodent repellents we are familiar with.  Ultrasound from mice is an innovative tool that allows you to clean the house from them once and for all.  The waves generated by the device disrupt the action of the nervous system of rodents, causing fear and anxiety.  Therefore, mice bypass the home with such devices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The effect of ultrasound on rodents" class="if uuid-2600474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95919/2600474.jpg"></div><p>  There are many different models of this device, the most highly efficient models, according to reviews on the Internet, "GRAD A-500", "TORNADO 400", "ECOSNIPER LS 927M", "GRAD A-1000 PRO +", "TORNADO 300". </p><p>  These devices are not only effective, but also silent in operation, and an additional advantage of the GRAD A-1000 PRO + device is the repelling of not only rodents, but also mosquitoes, flies and cockroaches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Medical use </h2><div class="photo" data-original="media1.s-nbcnews.com" data-author=": Khakimullin Aleksandr, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ultrasound during pregnancy" class="if uuid-2600441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95919/2600441.jpg"></div><p>  The most widespread ultrasound device has acquired it in the field of diagnostics.  The ultrasound diagnostic method is highly informative and allows you to obtain the following data: </p><ul><li>  localization of the pathological process; </li><li>  the size of the organ or foreign entity; </li><li>  organ wall thickness; </li><li>  contours of an organ or pathological formation; </li><li>  location relative to other organs; </li><li>  the presence or absence of fluid in the cavities; </li><li>  tissue density or, in the language of ultrasound diagnostics, echostructure. </li></ul><h2>  Application in cosmetology </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The effect of ultrasound on the skin" class="if uuid-2600470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95919/2600470.jpg"></div><p>  An ultrasound apparatus for the face is a device of much smaller size than that used in medicine.  It fits in your hand and is lightweight so as not to cause fatigue on the hands of the beautician.  Ultrasonic waves beat off from a small metal plate located at the end of the device.  They drive in a product previously applied to the face, cleansing the pores, exfoliating dead cells.  It also improves blood circulation in the capillaries and the outflow of lymph from the skin, increasing the intensity of metabolic processes and rejuvenating. </p><h2>  Main effects </h2><p>  The ultrasound apparatus provides a comprehensive effect on the skin of the face, namely: </p><ul><li>  intensive cleansing; </li><li>  peeling, which allows the body to get rid of keratinized epithelium and microparticles of dirt; </li><li>  massage that improves cell regeneration; </li><li>  bactericidal effect, which is the destruction of bacteria and microorganisms located on the skin of the face. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.classique.lv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ultrasonic Peeling" class="if uuid-2600456" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95919/2600456.jpg"></div><p>  Note!  If you experience unpleasant sensations on the skin of the face, you need to reduce the frequency of ultrasound or increase the amount of gel applied to the face. </p><h2>  How to choose an ultrasonic scrubber </h2><p>  Ultrasonic equipment for face cleaning is an extremely popular product in the beauty market due to the high demand for it.  After all, cleansing the skin with the help of an ultrasound therapy apparatus is almost the most common procedure in cosmetology. </p><p>  It is with high demand that such an abundance of ultrasound devices on the market is associated.  Each of them has its own characteristics and nuances of application.  However, in general, two main types of devices are distinguished: portable and stationary.  Stationary is more effective and provides a deeper cleansing, it is focused on professional salons and has a higher cost.  Portable is cheaper and more suitable for home use. </p><h2>  What they say on the Internet </h2><p>  Reviews on the ultrasonic facial cleanser are pretty straightforward.  People are happy with its use and equate cleaning at home to cleaning in a professional salon. </p><p>  Here are some customer reviews for the FASS2-NC Ultrasonic Massager Cleaner.  They write that the device perfectly cleanses the face, cleansing can even be compared to salon, the skin has cleansed, and the color has become more even.  The effect is even better if the skin is steamed before applying the scrubber.  The device is just super, the skin breathes, the effect is obvious.  Very easy to use, detailed instructions included. </p><h2>  Contraindications </h2><p>  Whatever unique properties the ultrasound has for cleansing the skin of the face, there are a number of contraindications to its use: </p><ul><li>  the period of pregnancy and breastfeeding; </li><li>  the presence of acute infectious diseases; </li><li>  high blood pressure; </li><li>  endocrinological diseases (diabetes mellitus, thyroid problems); </li><li>  the presence of neoplasms; </li><li>  age less than 18 years. </li></ul><p>  Also, you should not carry out this procedure with a superficial arrangement of the capillaries of the face, that is, very close to the skin, since ultrasound can cause their damage and the appearance of small hemorrhagic rashes. </p><h2>  Price range </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.nachi.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ultrasound from mice" class="if uuid-2600476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/95919/2600476.jpg"></div><p>  Prices for an ultrasonic device vary depending on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãits application, whether the device is designed for professional or home use. </p><p>  Prices for the device used in everyday life to scare away mice range from 1,900 rubles to 5,290 rubles for the ‚ÄúGrad A-1000 PRO +‚Äù.  As a rule, devices with an ultrasonic range that can only scare away rodents cost around 2000 rubles, and ultrasound from mice with a wider range and several modes against mice, mosquitoes, flies and cockroaches like GRAD A-1000 PRO + from 5000 rubles. </p><p>  The highest is the cost of ultrasound machines used in diagnostic medicine.  Since it is used only by diagnostic doctors in private and public institutions, they buy it for the money of a hospital or the state budget.  Thus, the price of this device reaches 20 million rubles. </p><p>  If you decide to buy ultrasound to clean your face, you must remember that the cost of a portable device is lower, because it is designed for use at home.  The average cost of 18,000 is 25,000 rubles.  Prices for a professional stationary apparatus start at 200,000 rubles and can reach up to 500,000 rubles, depending on the manufacturer and the number of modes.  Such ultrasound machines are used by cosmetologists for facial cleansing procedures. </p><p>  The ultrasonic device is really widely used today in many areas of life.  But it is very important to familiarize yourself with all the pros and cons of a particular device before buying and using it, in order to achieve maximum results with minimal harm to health and at the lowest cost! </p>
