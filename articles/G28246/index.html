And this is not surprising.  No one wants to spend extra time on their way to their destination, especially if the difference in ticket price is not too significant.  For example, it turns out that flying from Kiev to Budapest is even cheaper than traveling by bus or, say, by train, which means that the choice is obvious.

    <p>  As you know, demand creates supply, which is why in the Ukrainian capital, in addition to the modern Borispol, it became necessary to pay attention to the older Kiev Zhuliany airport.  It was restored, partially reconstructed, and now it is actively serving a huge flow of passengers. </p><h2>  Section 2. General description of the object </h2>

This is the southwestern part of the Ukrainian capital, at a distance of only 8 km from the center.  That is, it can be assumed that getting to it is much more convenient, cheaper, more understandable than to the main air gates of Ukraine, which are located outside the city.

Many would like to know where such an unusual name comes from.  Agree, this is hardly the name of the founder, and something from the history of such a combination of letters is not immediately remembered. </p><p>  As it was established, during the official opening of the air gates, this name was given in honor of the name of the whole housing estate, in which, by the way, they are located. </p><p>  Today, the airport area is 265 hectares.  On its territory, there are also 410 civil aviation repair plants and one of the largest <span>aviation museums</span> in the open air, which showcases aviation equipment, both military and civilian, for viewing. </p><p>  If we take into account the technical side, it is worth noting that the airport in Zhulyany is equipped with one runway, the length of which is about 2310 m and the width is almost 45 m. </p><h2>  Section 3.

But at the very beginning the name was completely different.  Until the 1940s, he was known as Post-Volynsky.  Then they renamed the airport on Chokolovka or Kievsky.

    <p>  Initially, its size was quite modest: the only runway and a small airfield, which were on the outskirts of a tiny village, even by the standards of the village.  The airport served Zhuliany only domestic flights. </p><p>  In 1949, a new terminal was built, which could receive aircraft from different parts of the former USSR.  The situation changes in 1960, after the suburban village itself was annexed to Kiev, and a new terminal was built in Borispol, the official name appeared at a small Kiev airport - Zhuliany Airport. </p><p>  To date, this airport has reached international status. </p><h2>  Section 5.

    <p>  Terminal A is the largest terminal at the airport, which has a capacity of 320 passengers per hour.  It was opened relatively recently - May 17, 2012. </p><p>  On its territory there is everything necessary for the convenience of departing and newly arrived passengers. </p><p>  The terminal building houses check-in and baggage areas, as well as a relaxation area (regular and VIP rooms), 3 Duty Free duty-free shops, 5 bars and 4 restaurants, and rooms for mothers and children are equipped. </p><p>  On the ground floor of Terminal A, namely in the right wing, there is a left-luggage office operating around the clock. </p><p>  The terminal is also equipped with a telescopic ladder, to which aircraft such as <span>Airbus A320,</span> Boeing 737 and MD82 can dock.  Prior to this, passengers were transported to or from the aircraft by bus. </p><p>  The site of Zhulyany airport is working properly.  On it you can not only get all the necessary information related to the nuances of work, but also book tickets for any, even connecting flight. </p><h2>  Section 6. Traveler Reviews </h2><p>  According to passengers using the services of the airport, of course, much can be said about its comfort and quality of service. </p><p>  It is not surprising that travelers liked the fact that there was no running around and no crowds at the airport. </p><p>  Pleasant and helpful staff is always ready to help. </p><p>  The fact that everything is new inside the terminal, including toilets, is also welcomed.  A board with the inscription ‚ÄúZhuliany Airport.  Schedule ‚Äùis in a prominent place. </p><p>  In general, the room makes a good impression.  Everywhere is cozy and clean.  The only drawback, perhaps, is that there are very few seats available in the waiting room, but, most likely, the solution to this problem is just a matter of time. </p>
