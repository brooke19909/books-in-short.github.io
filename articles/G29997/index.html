Despite the fact that the term appeared relatively recently, it managed to become an integral part of modern reality in a short time.  What is it, and how is the living space in a smart style different from the usual? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.phillymag.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.phillymag.com/property/2018/05/12/smart-apartments-3737-chestnut/"><img itemprop="image" alt="living space" class="if uuid-2884185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2884185.jpg"></div><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  Translated from English smart - smart, smart, clever.  A distinctive feature of the "smart" interior is the rational use of space and its functionality. </p><p>  Differences between smart apartments and ordinary housing are noticeable at the planning stage of the house.  In most cases, developers in the design try to cover a large number of square meters, resulting in elongated rooms with a single window.  Such a layout does not allow you to conveniently arrange furniture, and the space needs sunlight.  Such apartments are characterized by a large number of panoramic windows located along the facade. </p><h2>  Layout </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.homedit.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.homedit.com/design-studio-and-playground-apartment-design/"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart apartment" class="if uuid-2884182" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2884182.jpg"></div><p>  Designers of smart apartments in Kiev and other cities are engaged in the development of designers who put themselves in the place of future residents: they determine a convenient place to place a washing machine, a mirror, the number of squares for a berth.  This smart apartment does not require reworking the project and already has a high-quality finish, which eliminates the need for repairs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When <span>planning a smart apartment,</span> as a rule, furniture of standard sizes is taken into account.  Many developers offer to buy an apartment in Kiev, already equipped with furniture.  For those buyers who have a limited budget, such offers can determine the real cost of housing without spending money on an independent home environment.  Built-in furniture is an integral part of a smart apartment, allowing not only to save free space, but also creating an attractive interior.  Bulky cabinets-walls have long sunk into oblivion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bensbargains.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://bensbargains.com/thecheckout/features/10-awesome-tech-upgrades-apartment-dwellers/"><img itemprop="image" alt="apartments in Kiev" class="if uuid-2884181" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2884181.jpg"></div><h2>  Offers of construction companies </h2><p>  According to the ideas of many construction companies about what a smart apartment is, it can be assumed that smart housing is small rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã18 m2.  Minimal space lowers the final cost of housing, which is especially beneficial in the current economic situation. </p><p>  Smart housing does not always imply a minimum quadrature: you can also find two-room smart apartments, in which all available space is used to the maximum.  For example, the euro-room and the euro-grid are rooms of a small quadrature, corresponding to an ordinary one-room apartment, however, due to the competent layout, they are divided into several rooms, a living room and a kitchen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When choosing a smart apartment, you need to check the reputation of the developer: in this regard, smart real estate is no different from ordinary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.101hotels.ru/china/yuyhan/workingliving_smart_apartmenthangzhou_alibaba_branch.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart apartment cost" class="if uuid-2884183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2884183.jpg"></div><h2>  Disadvantages of acquiring smart housing </h2><p>  It is impossible to say that such smart apartments are ideal: the main pitfall is the lack of free space for a large family.  For one person or couple, such a property is the best option. </p><p>  According to experts of real estate companies, the disadvantage of smart apartments is cramped.  Design solutions characteristic of such housing first appeared in the 90s of the last century, simultaneously with the development of the micro-apartment market.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch premises rarely exceeded 25-30 square meters.  Their layout was reminiscent of dormitory rooms with their own bathroom.  Such housing is designed for one person, which is why it is called bachelor apartment - "bachelor‚Äôs apartment". </p><p>  Disadvantages of smart housing: </p><ul><li>  the cost per square meter is more expensive than in ordinary apartments; </li><li>  if the property is in a non-residential fund, you will have to pay utility bills at a commercial rate with the addition of a land tax; </li><li>  when drawing up documentation, you must be careful to avoid collisions with dishonest developers; </li><li>  there is not enough free space for the family; </li><li>  on one floor there are many apartments; </li><li>  only one person can be registered in housing. </li></ul><p>  Despite all the disadvantages, it is worth noting that such smart apartments are popular and quite in demand. </p><h2>  The benefits of smart housing </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.decoist.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.decoist.com/2014-11-17/small-apartment-renovation-foldable-walls/"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart one bedroom apartment" class="if uuid-2884187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2884187.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the minuses, it is worth considering the advantages of smart apartments: </p><ul><li>  minimum cost of housing in the real estate market; </li><li>  apartments are mostly located in the new building, which is important; </li><li>  minimal losses of electricity and heat, savings on utilities; </li><li>  housing quickly pays off when it is rented out; </li><li>  lack of partitions visually increases free space </li><li>  saving on repair work; </li><li>  alternative to rental housing. </li></ul><h2>  The cost of smart apartments </h2><p>  The advantage of smart housing is its low cost.  Buyers who opt for such real estate have small amounts not exceeding 4 million rubles, and therefore prefer small-sized apartments. </p><p>  On the primary market of Kiev there is a wide selection of small studios with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãnot more than 30 m2, ideal for creating smart apartments.  According to statistics, in the first half of 2017, the share of such facilities amounted to 5.2%.  The cost of a square of such real estate is on average 11% more expensive compared to the mass segment.  It can be said that such smart apartments differ in area ranging from 20 to 30 square meters.  For those who prefer such housing and want to save money, options are offered at a low price - from 2 million hryvnia (more than 4.7 million rubles) for options with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã17-18 square meters. </p><h2>  The demand for smart housing in Kiev </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.smartstay.co.uk" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.smartstay.co.uk/why-book-a-smart-stay-serviced-apartment/"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart apartment photos" class="if uuid-2884189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2884189.jpg"></div><p>  In the conditions of the capital's life, we can safely say that such smart apartments are the best option for singles, students, careerists and families of two.  Smart housing is also beneficial for renting: it does not require impressive investments, but it pays off as a full-fledged one-room apartment and many times faster. </p><p>  The Ukrainian buyer has just begun to face what smart apartments are.  This type of real estate is very different from the usual, but not always comfortable, offers of the secondary market like one-room Khrushchev.  For this reason, the share of studios in the primary market is small, but it is constantly increasing. </p><p>  Projects of developers of various segments of housing include a variety of small real estate objects in order to attract specific groups of buyers - students, young couples, business travelers, investors and others.  Despite the fact that such smart apartments are popular, the mass buyer prefers spacious rooms, not wanting to get involved with a mortgage and small, but expensive housing. </p><p>  Small apartments are the best alternative to renting a property.  Compared to <span>one-room apartments,</span> smart housing is more affordable, and after paying off the mortgage it remains the property of the owner. </p>
