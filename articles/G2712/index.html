Two terms, namely Nazism and fascism, were identified by the <span>ideology of the USSR</span> during the Great Patriotic War, since Italy and Germany acted on the same side in this war.  It was then that the phrase ‚Äúfascist Germany‚Äù appeared, which the captive Germans did not like very much.  Nationalism and Nazism are almost indistinguishable for an ordinary person.  But if the meaning of these concepts is the same, how can we distinguish them and <span>what is fascism</span> and Nazism? </p>

    <h2>  Fascism and Francoism </h2><p>  Fascism in translation from Italian means ‚Äúunion‚Äù or ‚Äúbundle‚Äù.  This term means a generalization of extreme right-wing political movements, as well as their ideology.  It also denotes the political regimes of the dictatorial type, which are headed by these movements.  If we take a narrower concept, then fascism refers to the mass political movement that existed on the territory of Italy in the 20-40s of the XX century under the leadership of Mussolini. </p><p>  In addition to Italy, fascism also existed in Spain during the reign of General Franco, which is why it received a slightly different name - Francoism.  Fascism was in Portugal, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, as well as in many <span>third world countries.</span>  If you believe the work of Soviet scientists, then Nazism should also include the national socialism that existed in Germany, but to understand this, you need to understand what Nazism is? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Signs of a fascist state </h2><p>  How to distinguish a fascist state from others?

In the Soviet media, all anti-communist military dictatorships were traditionally called fascism.  An example is the Pinochet military junta in Chile, as well as the Stroessner regimes in Paraguay. </p><p>  Fascism is not synonymous with the word nationalism, so do not confuse these two concepts.  You just need to figure out <span>what nationalism</span> and Nazism are. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is fascism and nazism" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12408/398725.jpg" width="338"></div></h2><h2>  Nationalism </h2><p>  The next term that you need to know in order to understand what Nazism is is nationalism.  It is one of the directions of politics, the fundamental principle of which is the thesis of the supremacy of the nation in the state.  This political movement seeks to defend the interests of any particular nationality.  But this does not always happen.  Sometimes nationalism can form a people not only by the principle of one blood, but also by the principle of territorial affiliation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to distinguish nationalism from Nazism? </h2><p>  The main differences between Nazism and nationalism are that the representatives of the second are more tolerant of other ethnic groups, but do not seek to get closer to them.  In addition, they, as already mentioned above, can be formed on territorial or religious grounds.  Also, <span>this political movement is</span> less likely to run counter to economics, free-thinking and free speech.  It knows how to penetrate into the legal field of the state in a qualitative manner and is able to cope with <span>constructive criticism.</span>  Anyone who understands what Nazism is should know that under him the state follows totalitarian principles, and there is no place for free thought in it. </p><h2>  Nazism </h2><p>  What is Nazism?  The definition of this concept became widely known throughout the world after the end of World War II.  It is the Third Reich that is the main example, thanks to which one can understand what Nazism is.  This concept refers to the form of social structure of the state in which socialism combines with an extreme degree of racism and nationalism. </p>

    <p>  The goal of Nazism was to unite in a vast territory a community of racially pure, Aryan people who could lead the country to prosperity for centuries. </p><p>  According to Hitler, socialism was an ancient Aryan tradition.  According to dignitaries of the Third Reich, it was their ancestors who first began to use the land together, carefully developing the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe common good.  Communism, they said, was not socialism, but was just a disguised Marxism. </p><p>  The main ideas of National Socialism were: </p><ul><li>  Anti-Marxism, anti-Bolshevism. </li><li>  Racism. </li><li>  Militarism. </li></ul><p>  Thus, one can understand what fascism and Nazism are, as well as nationalism.  These are three completely different concepts, which, despite some similarities, are not synonymous.  But, despite the facts, many people still consider them one. </p>
