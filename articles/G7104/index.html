The debt can be different, it imposes an obligation on the person - to return the amount accepted for temporary use.  When a person received the money, his lender must have a guarantee of return.  According to the laws of the Russian Federation, an amount exceeding 10 thousand rubles must be in writing.  If you need less money, you can also verbally agree on the conditions and terms of the return. </p><h2>  Legislative regulation </h2><p>  Before becoming interested in ways where to urgently take 100,000 rubles, lawyers recommend that you familiarize yourself with the restrictions and regulations of the law.  When two people meet, regardless of the degree of their acquaintance, family ties or friendships, in order to agree on the transfer of funds, a transaction is made between them. </p><p>  Article 808 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation.  1 regulates relations if the amount is more than 10 thousand rubles.  Article 162 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, part 1, states that without written agreement, oral claims are not accepted, even when witnesses confirm the transaction. </p><p>  Different institutions in their own way draw up monetary obligations: </p><ul><li>  private loans are confirmed by debt receipts; </li><li>  in banks, loan agreements are used as evidence of a relationship; </li><li>  receipts are issued at pawnshops. </li></ul><p>  So before you are interested in where to urgently take 100,000 rubles, you need to know how to conclude a deal in order not to be deceived.  Article 808 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, part 2, defines obligations between borrowers and lenders.  The process of debt formation is regulated by law and social moral standards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="agroinfo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian money" class="if uuid-2907998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106908/2907998.jpg"></div><h2>  Risk warning </h2><p>  Each of the parties entering into financial relations risks in its own way.  The debtor, reading the ads where urgently to take 100,000 rubles, should know that such loans have little difference from bank loans.  They may be taxed: </p><ul><li>  interest; </li><li>  fines; </li><li>  timing. </li></ul><p>  Therefore, it is necessary to carefully formulate a receipt.  The return must also be correctly executed so that after full settlement the lender does not go to court with claims.  It is necessary to take from him written confirmation of receipt of money.  In any case, if you find the address where to get 100,000 rubles urgently for a receipt, in the event of a trial, this particular paper will become weighty evidence. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bitcoinist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Loan rejection" class="if uuid-2908034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106908/2908034.jpg"></div><h2>  What does paper matter </h2><p>  The document is endowed with legal force, regardless of how it is executed: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  at the notary public; </li><li>  full agreement; </li><li>  by hand in the presence of two persons or with witnesses. </li></ul><p>  A correctly drawn up receipt describing the conditions and requirements becomes a guarantee of a refund to the lender and peace of mind for the debtor that he will not be bothered ahead of time, will not demand more than the required amount. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.finagent.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Credit must be repaid" class="if uuid-2908001" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106908/2908001.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to get 100,000 rubles urgently without a loan? </h2><p>  Verification of the investor who agrees to transfer the funds is mandatory without fail by all possible means.  If it is from an ad on the Internet, it is not necessary to read reviews on this site, deceived people will report this on the forum.  You should always keep in mind that communication with a private trader is not fully protected by law, unlike banks. </p><p>  Where to start the search: </p><ul><li>  Explore offers on bulletin boards </li><li>  A huge amount of information is provided by forums, sites; </li><li>  in print media; </li><li>  ask friends if they went through such procedures; </li><li>  seek help from relatives and friends, financially secure; </li><li>  voice a request to a rich neighbor; </li><li>  forward the message by phone to friends; </li><li>  go to a pawnshop with jewelry; </li><li>  advertise on social networks or on a thematic portal. </li></ul><p>  To do this, you need to go through the usual registration and write briefly: urgently need 100,000 rubles, where to get it? </p><div class="photo" data-original="mw.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Banknotes are not superfluous" class="if uuid-2908010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106908/2908010.jpg"></div><h2>  How much money is needed - so many ways to get it </h2><p>  Many citizens do not consider below their dignity to visit pawnshops.  Such confidence in such institutions began in the dashing 90s.  Workers were detained for wages, they handed over rings and bracelets for a fee, and when they paid it, they received their jewelry back. </p><p>  There is a problem with things there, employees are critical of non-salable goods, but they will not refuse home appliances or a decent computer.  The assessment will be half the real value with a tight buyout schedule, but in this case the question arises: where to get 100,000 rubles, urgently without a loan?  Pawnshop is a great option.  The borrower is not trying to find out how to get a bunch of loans and not pay?  All the same, they will have to give money, but in these institutions they buy out their own property. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.istockphoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The beauty of Russian money" class="if uuid-2908016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106908/2908016.jpg"></div><h2>  Search for private lenders </h2><p>  Citizens familiar with borrowers know that it‚Äôs hard to find them on the Internet.  Usually they work according to recommendations, and phone numbers are passed from word of mouth.  The chain is easier to find information about the applicant.  It is advantageous for lenders to transfer large amounts with pledging: </p><ul><li>  cars; </li><li>  apartments; </li><li>  expensive property. </li></ul><p>  The ads immediately warn that the money will be given after the receipt of a receipt from a notary.  They pay interest for services, only scammers ask for an advance payment. </p><p>  The easiest option is to borrow from a friend.  A friend will not refuse help when they are asked to complete a transaction in accordance with all legislative rules with a notary by providing real estate as a pledge.  If he agrees to borrow money without notarization, the document must be drawn up correctly so that it serves as an evidence: </p><ul><li>  indicate the date of compilation; </li><li>  indicate from what time the agreement comes into force; </li><li>  write the details of both parties; </li><li>  the amount is indicated in numbers and in words; </li><li>  make an obligation to return; </li><li>  signatures are set with full decryption. </li></ul><p>  For credibility, you can call witnesses to fix the deal.  As additional data write: </p><ul><li>  interest rate for using cash; </li><li>  penalties in case of violation of the terms of return. </li></ul><p>  It is recommended to receive and return money only by banking operations, so that there remains a trace of financial transfers.  The conclusion of a written contract and the preparation of a debt receipt is best done with witnesses. </p>
