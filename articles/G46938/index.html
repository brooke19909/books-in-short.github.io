Everyone is especially impressed by the classic original Wopper burger, created by the genius of the founders of the company, David Edgerton and James McLamore in 1950.  It was they who created the tradition of sincerely rejoicing to their customers and preparing dishes only with quality products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since 1959, Burger King has been developing its fast-food restaurant chain outside of Miami, the USA in South America, Canada, and European countries.  The corporation's motto during this period is ‚ÄúHurry up - feed the people!‚Äù. </p><p>  Burger King came to Russia only in 2010 and immediately won its target audience - youth. </p><h2>  Consistent quality standards </h2><p>  Entering the Burger King in Yaroslavl, you can see not only young and carefree people, but also older people, couples with and without children.  Why are these fast food restaurants so attractive to so many different people?  It is worth taking a look at the King Burger menu - in Yaroslavl it is the same as in all parts of the country. </p>
