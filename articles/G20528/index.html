    <p>  The service life of mobile phones is also different, but sometimes the user himself reduces it as a result of not very careful attitude to technology.  The main problem leading to the repair of the phone is getting water into the device.  <span>What to do if water gets into the phone?</span>  And how to help the gadget?  We will talk about this in the article. </p><h2>  How does water affect phone components? </h2><p>  Inside the phone there is a motherboard, thanks to which the device is powered and the uninterrupted operation of all its components is ensured.  Board elements may consist of copper, brass and other metals.  If water gets into the phone, it enters into a chemical reaction with metals, destroying the components of the board.  If the phone gets very wet, the board itself may suffer.  Then, quite possibly, the device will not be subject to repair.  What to do if the phone is drowned?  This will be discussed later. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to do if the phone is drowned? </h2><p>  If water gets into the gadget, then first you need to disconnect the device from power, that is, remove the battery.  This is possible on models with a removable battery.  But what if the smartphone, like most modern models (especially Chinese-made), has a non-removable battery?  You won‚Äôt be able to separate such a battery at home, so in any case, you need to take the mobile phone to a mobile phone repair workshop.  If you are unable to remove the battery, then simply turn off the phone with the button.  It happens that water gets into the phone when you are on vacation and cannot get into the workshop for repairing mobile phones.  Then you need to remove the battery and put the device in a dry room, do not turn it on for at least three days. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the battery, you need to remove the SIM card, memory card, headphones from the phone, remove the case or bumper, in general, everything that can clog the phone and holes.  There is no need to remove the protective film or glass from the screen. </p><h2>  Drying your phone at home </h2><p>  If a small amount of water gets into the phone, and it does not have time to penetrate deep into the device, you can try to dry it at home.  Your assistant will be a regular vacuum cleaner.  Put the phone a short distance from the vacuum cleaner and blow it over for 20-30 minutes.  After leaving for a while unassembled. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Dry rice absorbs moisture well.  What to do if you drowned your phone?  Try to lower it in a bag of rice, immerse the components of the device there.  In this way, you have to dry the phone for at least three days.  After, perhaps the device will work. </p><h2>  The main problems that occur when the phone gets wet </h2><p>  Consider the main violations in the operation of the device when the phone fell into the water and does not work.  If the screen does not work on your device after falling into water, contacts may have closed on the screen.  The workshop will try to repair the contacts, but most likely you will have to change the screen completely. </p>

    <p>  If after a fall on the phone the speakers stopped working, this is not a very serious breakdown.  Specialists will replace the speaker. </p><p>  The camera does not work as a result of water ingress?  What to do?  Everything will depend on the cost of the phone and quality.  If you have a Chinese copy of a famous brand, it will be very difficult to repair due to the low quality of the items.  On original devices (even Chinese-made, but original), the camera can be replaced, but you have to pay a decent amount. </p><p>  If the microphone does not work, try to gently brush it with a toothpick or needle.  If you doubt your abilities, it is better to return the phone to a repair shop. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  If your phone runs on the Android, Windows Phone or iOS operating system and you drowned it, you must do the following: </p><ol><li>  Disconnect the smartphone from power. </li><li>  Remove the battery. </li><li>  Remove all available SIM cards from the smartphone. </li><li>  Dry the smartphone (with a vacuum cleaner, in rice, just in a dry place). </li></ol><p>  A smartphone is a whimsical technique.  Smartphones cannot be overheated, therefore, when drying the smartphone, in no case use a hairdryer or put the device on the battery.  It is best to dry it in a dry, warm room. </p>

    <p>  The most dangerous thing that can happen with smartphones is getting water on the screen.  In this case, pixel stains, dots and stripes will appear on the screen, which are unlikely to be removed.  In this case, the repair of a drowned phone will have to be entrusted to professionals. </p><p>  Even more dangerous for a smartphone is sea salt water.  Salt very quickly corrodes various contacts and connections, so the answer to the question is whether it is possible to restore a drowned phone if sea water has got into it, it is impossible to answer unequivocally.  Everything will depend on the time and extent of exposure to water. </p><h2>  Workshop recessed telephone repair </h2><p>  If none of the above methods helped to dry and restore the machine, go to the workshop.  There, specialists will repair the recessed phone.  To begin with, they must disassemble the phone, inspect the solder points for corrosion changes.  Next, the device will be cleaned with ultrasound.  To do this, the board is placed in a specific liquid and processed.  After the cleaning procedure, the board is dried and examined under a microscope for unrepaired defects.  Then they complete the necessary and collect the phone. </p>
