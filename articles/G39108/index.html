    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The cost of living in this hotel is fully consistent with its category and accommodation conditions.  So, a seven-day vacation here at the height of summer will cost from 500 euros for a double room, from 630 euros for a family room (two adults + two children) and from 750 euros for a four-bed room. </p><h2>  Travel Reviews: Matoula Beach (Rhodes, Greece) </h2><p>  Since the majority of <span>modern travelers</span> in the process of selecting a hotel are mostly guided not by its official description, but by the comments about it from people who have already stayed in it, we decided to save you some time and give generalized impressions of our compatriots who spent their summer vacation in a Rhodes hotel called Matula Beach.  Running a little ahead, we note that most tourists were quite satisfied with their choice.  In their opinion, this hotel in most places not only meets its three-star level, but also surpasses it.  But we will understand everything in detail. </p>

    <h2>  Impressions of Russians about the hotel itself and its room stock </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, Matoula Beach is a comfortable and equipped with all necessary three-star hotel.  Its main building consists of three floors.  However, it does have an elevator.  This is very convenient, because you do not have to carry heavy suitcases and travel bags on the stairs.  In addition, the presence of an elevator will definitely appeal to travelers staying on vacation with a small child.  After all, they will not have to lift the stroller up the stairs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the hotel rooms, our compatriots found them large, comfortable and clean.  Also, guests liked the availability of spacious balconies.  Since there are mosquitoes here in the summer, seasoned travelers recommend taking along with them the means to combat these annoying insects.  But back to the numbers.  According to tourists, they are furnished with very high quality furniture and appliances.  Everything works fine here.  Air conditioning can be used for free (in some other hotels in Greece, this service is paid).  The bathroom has a hairdryer.  Most rooms are equipped with showers, but some of the apartments have full bathtubs.  There are no safes in the rooms.  You can leave valuables for storage in the safe at the reception.  In general, according to many travelers, the equipment of rooms in the hotel not only corresponds to its three-star status, but also completely pulls four stars. </p>

    <p>  Most of the guests remained pretty and the quality of cleaning in the rooms of Matoula Beach Hotel.  Reviews about the work of maids are reduced to the fact that they spend cleaning every day.  Towels are renewed once every two days, and bed linen once a week.  By the way, according to tourists, both towels and bed linen are of excellent quality.  Everything is snow-white and without spots. </p><h2>  Comments from travelers about the hotel and its location </h2><p>  "Matula Beach" is located in a fairly quiet resort village.  So, according to our compatriots, there are shops, taverns, supermarkets, trading shops, tour agencies, car and scooter rental companies and much more.  However, if you are used to daily noisy parties, then this place may disappoint you a little. </p><p>  A big plus, according to many tourists, is the proximity of the hotel to the airport.  So even if you get to the hotel by bus, you will spend no more than a quarter of an hour on the road.  Especially this fact will be appreciated by people traveling with young children.  In just 20 minutes you can take a bus to the <span>Old Town of Rhodes.</span>  Therefore, experienced tourists recommend everyone to visit it at least once. </p>

    <p>  As for the hotel territory, according to Russian vacationers, it is small, but very well-groomed and green.  There are many pines and eucalyptus trees that fill the air with a magnificent aroma.  Near the hotel there is a supermarket with a good selection of goods and products.  The Blue Bay Hotel is just 50 meters away.  If you paid "all inclusive", then you can use its infrastructure. </p><h2>  Matoula <span>Beach Hotel</span> 3 *: traveler food reviews </h2><p>  As for food, the hotel "Matula Beach" will offer you only breakfast.  They, according to our compatriots, is not very diverse, but there is always something to choose from.  In a word, these are standard European breakfasts.  For lunch and dinner, hotel guests who have paid <span>full board</span> can go to the restaurant of the neighboring Blue Bay Hotel.  They can also have a drink there.  According to tourists, the food here is tasty, but at the height of the season the restaurant is too crowded.  The menu always has dishes of meat, fish, a lot of fresh fruits and delicious sweets.  Here you can taste both national Greek and familiar European cuisine.  In addition, for a fee, you can have lunch and dinner in the cafe at the Matula Beach Hotel.  According to the guests, they cook here very well, and the prices for the dishes are very reasonable. </p><h2>  The opinion of vacationers about the work of staff </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, all the staff at Matoula Beach Hotel 3 * (Rhodes, Greece) are very friendly, welcoming and pleasant in communication.  They always quickly try to solve all arising issues.  In addition, the fact that the reception staff speak not only English but also speak Russian is a big plus.  So, our compatriots will not have any communication problems here. </p>

    <h2>  Comments of tourists about entertainment and beach vacations </h2><p>  As for entertainment at the Matoula Beach Hotel, almost all guests note the presence of a pool.  It is medium in size and cleaned regularly.  However, to some, the water in it seemed too chlorinated.  Near the pool you can comfortably sit on the sun loungers located on a pretty green lawn.  Since the hotel is small, sunbeds are enough for everyone.  You can play billiards at an additional cost.  Also near the hotel there is a water park where both children and adults will like it. </p><p>  The neighboring Blue Bay Hotel has both daytime and evening animations designed for vacationers of all ages.  The guests of "Matula Beach", if desired, can go to her.  Also, every 30 minutes from the entrance to the hotel, a road train leaves, which will take you along the seashore to a neighboring village to incendiary Greek melodies. </p><p>  The beach is no more than five minutes walk from Matoula Beach.  It is small pebble.  When entering the water there is a wide strip of pebbles of large and medium size.  Many enter the sea barefoot, but for children it is recommended to purchase special shoes.  Sun loungers and parasols at local beaches are available at an additional cost. </p>
