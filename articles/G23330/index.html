However, in Egypt this is still a rarity.  Nevertheless, Domina Coral Bay Oasis has Wi-Fi not only in rooms and lobby, as is the practice in the Turkish fives, but also throughout its territory.  And this is one of the huge advantages of the hotel.  In addition, there is a great sea.  The hotel's beach itself stretches for almost two kilometers, and divers enjoy a beautiful coral reef garden.  Here you can watch all kinds of fish of incredible colors and predatory moray eels.  There are always free sunbeds on the beach.  Many problems associated with the lack of seats, or with the fact that people occupy the trestle beds better in the morning, simply do not exist here.  At the disposal of those who are afraid of the salty sea, or who arrived in the winter, is a huge pool with warm water.  There is also a good children's "paddling pool".
