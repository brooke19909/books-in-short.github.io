  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Finnish Quarter" in St. Petersburg: photos and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, many residents of large cities prefer to purchase housing in new buildings located on the outskirts of the metropolis.  This decision is very reasonable if only because in the suburbs you can buy apartments much cheaper than in a residential area, not to mention the center.  Therefore, developers are actively exploring the lands of the suburbs, erecting modern <span>residential complexes</span> almost at the border of megacities <span>.</span>  One of such new buildings is the Finnish Quarters residential complex in St. Petersburg.  That's exactly what everyone says about the location of this complex, although it is located in the Vsevolozhsk district, near the village of Luppolovo.  And from the last to the Northern capital is only five kilometers.  So it turns out that regardless of the location of the Finnish Quarter residential complex, in St. Petersburg, in the Vsevolozhsk District, this does not change the essence of the matter.  In any case, all owners of apartments in it can consider themselves residents of St. Petersburg. </p><p>  This retreat was necessary so that there would be no confusion when we talk about what kind of feedback the Finnish Quarter residential complex in St. Petersburg receives from those who already live in commissioned houses and those who are just going to buy an apartment here.  After all, we will talk about a new building located in the suburbs of the metropolis.  Even, to be more precise, practically on its outskirts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Finnish quarter in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1298699.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, what do people say about the Finnish Quarters residential complex and its main characteristics, which are always considered by buyers of apartments in any new building? </p><h2>  About location </h2><p>  Almost everyone who has already bought an apartment here or is going to do so unanimously claims that the developer has very successfully chosen a plot for the Finnish Quarter residential complex.  In St. Petersburg, the Vsevolozhsk district is considered one of the most prosperous in terms of environmental conditions, since there are no industrial zones and large enterprises on its territory. </p><p>  As already mentioned, there are only five kilometers to the borders of the city.  Moreover, what people especially emphasize in their reviews, two metro stations - “Ozerki” and “Prospekt Enlightenment” - are located 15-20 minutes from the residential complex “Finnish Quarter”.  In St. Petersburg, not every resident can boast of such a proximity of the metro to the house.  What can we say about the outskirts. </p><h2>  About the complex and the developer </h2><p>  Construction began in 2013, in 2015 two three-story buildings were commissioned, in which people currently live.  At the end of 2016, six more houses of the second stage will be commissioned.  At the moment, they are selling apartments on the basis of equity participation. </p>

    <p>  Element-Beton IC, the developer of the Finnish Quarter residential complex, in St. Petersburg enjoys well-deserved respect and trust from buyers.  The company’s assets are no longer one successfully completed project of such a plan, which indicates its extensive experience in the real estate market.  In addition, the developer in his work uses the methods and best practices of Finnish builders, which make it possible to build really high-quality housing in the special climate of St. Petersburg. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  “Finnish quarters” are built according to a monolithic-panel technology using three-layer structures, due to which houses are warm, which people certainly mention in their reviews.  In addition, many residents say that the walls in the apartments are extremely thick, so no extraneous noise penetrates through them.  When designing houses, the developer focused on large-scale glazing, which is very popular with the residents of the quarter.  The owners unanimously claim that their apartments, thanks to such a reception, turned out to be bright and spacious. </p><p>  The residents of the complex also like the arrangement of courtyards.  As already mentioned, the design was carried out on the basis of Finnish construction concepts, which was also reflected in the improvement of the territory of the Finnish Quarter residential complex.  In St. Petersburg, not every house can boast such an abundance of sports grounds for children and adults, bicycle paths and relaxation areas. </p><h2>  About transport </h2><p>  Almost everyone who already lives in the handed over buildings unanimously claims that the transport accessibility of the complex is at its best.  Near the houses there is <span>a bus</span> and minibus <span>stop</span> , where you can quickly get to the metro.  Not far from the complex there are two railway stations, from the platforms of which there are trains leaving for <span>Finland Station.</span>  As for motorists, they are pleased that three kilometers away there is a convenient exit onto the roundabout, via which you can get to Nevsky in half an hour or go onto the region’s roads. </p>

    <h2>  About infrastructure </h2><p>  Everyone who has already bought real estate or is just about to purchase apartments in the Finnish Quarter residential complex in St. Petersburg, believes that its infrastructure component is quite good.  Yes, some complain that there are practically no shops in the complex.  However, this is a fixable matter.  After the construction is completed, all the first floors of the buildings will be given over to commercial facilities, so for now, you just need to be patient.  But in just 10 minutes you can easily reach several large supermarkets, including Auchan, Ikea, Maksidom, as well as a large shopping and entertainment center. </p><p>  Nearby there are several schools and kindergartens.  Over time, the territory will also have its own kindergarten, the construction of which is parallel to the construction of houses.  So, people have no particular complaints regarding the availability of infrastructure facilities. </p>

    <h2>  About apartments </h2><p>  In total, 778 residential premises will be put up for sale.  You can purchase both fairly compact studios and 1-2-3-4-room apartments.  "Finnish quarters" (in St. Petersburg such a format is far from rare) belong to the comfort class.  And therefore, housing is offered here appropriate.  All apartments are ergonomic and functional, the rooms are spacious and bright, with large kitchens and halls.  As for the layouts, their choice is more than varied, so that, according to customer reviews, it’s not difficult to choose the right option.  The area of ​​apartments is from 22 to 150 square meters. </p><p>  What people especially like is that living quarters can be purchased with three finishes to choose from.  With draft, prefinishing and finishing.  This gives one an opportunity to save on a purchase, the second to do everything in the apartments with one's own hand, and the third to celebrate a housewarming immediately. </p>

    <h2>  About pricing </h2><p>  As for the cost (and this is from 1 390 000 to 13 000 000 rubles per apartment), then, of course, you cannot name it affordable.  However, none of those who have already bought or are just going to buy apartments, especially grumbles.  After all, this is a comfort-class housing, and everyone understands this.  Nevertheless, a number of experts believe that the developer has somewhat raised the bar, since the new building is still located outside the metropolis, and therefore the cost of housing could be lower. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The Finnish Quarter residential complex in St. Petersburg, of course, is far from the only new building.  Nevertheless, it is still strongly recommended that anyone who is currently looking for suitable housing should definitely include it in their list.  After all, the LCD has a lot of advantages, as evidenced not only by the almost complete absence of negative reviews, but also by the fact that apartments in Finnish quarters are being bought up quite quickly. </p>
