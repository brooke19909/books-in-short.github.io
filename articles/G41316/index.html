    <p>  You arrive in the city and literally fall in love with it.  Volzhsky kindly shows his sights to everyone.  Among the advantages of the city, many tourists note the lack of gas, clean air and hospitality of local residents.  After the bustling Volgograd it is so nice to come here and relax. </p><p>  In the central square bearing the name of Lenin, one can read the following inscription: "Volzhsky is the city of my fate."  Arriving here once, you will certainly return again.  Perhaps you will stay here forever, meeting your fate. </p>
