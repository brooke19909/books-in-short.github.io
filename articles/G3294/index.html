Liberty Island attracts tourists from all over the world with sandy beaches, the azure sea, as well as first-class rum and the famous Cuban cigars.  It is worth noting that the reviews about Cuba differ in the variety of opinions among tourists.  Why?  Let's try to understand our article. </p><h2>  History tour </h2><p>  Initially, the indigenous inhabitants of the island were Indians, whose main occupations were farming and hunting.  At the end of the 15th century, Columbus visited the island as part of the expedition.  The famous traveler noted in his ship's journal that he had visited the most beautiful place on earth. </p><p>  At the beginning of the XVI and until the end of the XIX century, the indigenous inhabitants of the island underwent Spanish expansion.  Then, as a result of the war of the United States and Spain for the independence of Cuba, the Spaniards lost, which allowed the United States to leave troops in the country and establish its own regime.  Thus, Cuba became dependent on the United States. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newacttravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Havana" class="if uuid-2292534" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66454/2292534.jpg"></div><p>  In the second half of the 20th century, as a result of the revolution, the famous Cuban leader Fidel Castro came to power.  As a result of his reign, Cuba became a socialist country.  Also, agrarian reforms and social transformations were carried out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the end of the 20th century, Cuba became an ally of the USSR, from which it received political and economic support until the collapse of the latter. </p><p>  Currently, the <span>president of Cuba</span> is Fidel Castro's younger brother, Raul Castro. </p><h2>  How to get to Cuba </h2><p>  The most convenient and only way to get to Cuba from Russia is by plane.  Currently, the airline market is replete with various offers, the main criteria of which are price, travel time and the choice of transfer points. </p><p>  One of the most advantageous offers for today is provided by the Russian company Aeroflot.  She carries out a direct flight from Moscow to Havana.  Almost thirteen hours will have to be spent in the sky. </p><p>  Also, some tour operators in other cities of our country provide tickets for charter flights. </p><p>  Various sites and applications for smartphones offer many flight options with connections in Amsterdam, Paris, Madrid and other cities.  But when choosing these flight options, it is necessary to consider and think through all the nuances in advance.  For example, a visa, and in the case of a multi-hour transplant - payment for the hotel. </p><p>  It is worth considering that the tropical season on the island lasts from November to April.  According to tourist reviews, Cuba in April and March is the best time to visit this country. </p><h2>  Resorts </h2><p>  Havana is the capital and largest city of Cuba, which is located on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico.

It is best to choose hotels that operate on the all inclusive system, which includes meals in cafes, restaurants and bars of the hotel, because the prices for tourists in local establishments are quite high.  It is worth noting that all hotels in such resorts as Varadero, Cayo Coco, Cayo Largo and Holguin work on this principle. </p><p>  Couples with children need to know in advance about the possibility of finding a child in the hotel, because in some hotels there are age restrictions. </p><p>  For lovers of budget holidays on the island, it is possible to book rooms in the private sector.  Its price usually includes a room with a double bed, which is equipped with a bathroom and air conditioning. </p><h2>  Island Attractions </h2><p>  Old Havana is a part of the capital of Cuba, which was built up in the 16th century.
