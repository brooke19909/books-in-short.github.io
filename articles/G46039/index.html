The great work of many collectives of the entire Soviet Union was approaching its logical outcome.  There were still forty hours of checks, debugging and unrest, but the appearance <span>of the spacecraft</span> already inspired some conviction in the success of such a difficult task.  He was beautiful.  The weather was frosty, and the entire rocket, fueled by a <span>railroad tank</span> nearby, was covered with hoarfrost, sparkling in the sun like diamond dust. </p>

    <p>  The first Soviet satellite PS-1, and it was already in the bow of the ship, was small (weighed less than 84 kilograms), spherical, its diameter was 580 mm.  Inside it, in an atmosphere of dried nitrogen, there was an electronic unit, which by the standards of today's achievements might seem too simple.  However, one should not rush to conclusions - a rather complicated algorithm was implemented on the lamp element base and using mechanical automatic devices.  When the first satellite was separated from its carrier, four pin antennas emerged from it, ensuring stable transmission of the radio signal in all directions.  Orienting the position of the device in space was then a premature measure, and the omnidirectionality of the emitters solved the problem of notifying ground services about the operation of systems and location in orbit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The broadcast was conducted alternately by two one-watt transmitters, after demodulation it was an <span>audio signal</span> in the form of a ‚Äúdash‚Äù, and if the operation of any of the nodes became abnormal, the ‚Äúbeep‚Äù would sound more often.  The call sign accepted by the radio amateurs was to confirm that the first satellite did indeed rotate in orbit. </p><p>  The equipment needed to comply with strict </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The first satellite of the USSR" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10920/21717.jpg" width="600"></div>  temperature mode, and it was supported by built-in fan heaters.

    <p>  The first satellite put into orbit the R-7 carrier, at that time the newest, which had the secret code of the ‚Äú8K71PS object‚Äù.  It was only the fifth <span>launch of a rocket</span> created in the design bureau led by S.P.  The royal.  Its main and initial purpose is the delivery of nuclear weapons, the goal is the American continent.  But this formidable technique was also used peacefully - to launch the first satellite into near-Earth space. </p>

    <p>  It was not easy for the general designer to convince the management of the need for space flights, and when this was possible, the deadlines were very tight.  The work of various ministries and departments was carried out simultaneously, much was unknown, and technologies were developed as tasks and problems arose.  The first satellite was created in the scheduled time. </p><p>  At 10:28 pm Moscow time, October 4, a rocket soared into the sky, and TASS soon announced the realization of a long-held dream of all mankind - travel to distant galaxies became a real opportunity, proven in practice. </p><p>  High on the heads of the inhabitants of the entire planet flew a small star, the first satellite.  The USSR became its homeland, scientists, engineers and workers became its creators, and there was no limit to the jubilation of the whole people, who felt their involvement in this achievement. </p>
