    <p>  The era of the <span>palace coups of</span> 1725-1762  - the thirty-seven-year stage of political instability, which began after the death of Peter I. The palace nobility, which formed the group, actively intervened in the country's politics.  The solution of the issue of inheritance, the struggle for power, the implementation of coups was the main activity of these groups.  He pushed the palace to know about these actions, published in 1722, <span>February 5, the</span> Statute of succession.  This provision abolished the existing order of succession (council election and testament), replacing them with personal appointment at the discretion of the reigning sovereign.  However, Peter I did not take advantage of this Charter.  In 1725, on January 28, the sovereign died without appointing a successor.  As a result, immediately after his death, representatives of the ruling circles began the struggle for power. </p><p>  In the regular army created by Peter I, there was a privileged part - the guard of the Preobrazhensky and <span>Semenovsky regiment.</span>  Later, the Horse Guards and Izmailovsky regiments were added to them.  It was the guard that became the decisive force in the palace coups - whose side the privileged part of the army took, that noble group won.  The Guard, in turn, represented a whole noble class - almost completely formed from it and, accordingly, represented its interests. </p><p>  The heir of Peter I (on the male line) was his grandson Peter Alekseevich.  However, the throne was sought by the wife of the ruler - Catherine.  <span>Peter I</span> had two daughters, who were also heirs, the minor at that time Elizabeth and Anna.  The first palace coup was carried out by A. Menshikov in favor of <span>Catherine I.</span> He himself became an omnipotent favorite under the Empress. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The era of palace coups in Russia was characterized by a quick change of ruler.  During this period there were six on the throne. </p><p>  The era of palace coups ended with the enthronement of the wife of Peter III, Catherine II.  Peter III himself was overthrown quickly enough.  This ruler completely lost his authority after the end of the <span>Seven Years War,</span> as a result of which a <span>peace treaty</span> was signed <span>,</span> where the emperor refused all gains and acquisitions in this battle. </p><p>  The era of palace coups took place in connection with various reasons. </p><p>  Contradictions between different noble groups on the question of Peter's legacy came to the fore.  It should be noted that all of them strove to soften the course of changes in the state - to give respite to both themselves and society.  However, attempts to defend exclusive narrow-class privileges and interests created favorable conditions for unleashing an internal political struggle. </p><p>  At the same time, by and large, the confrontation between the groups was reduced, as a rule, to the support and promotion of a particular candidate.  In addition, the active position of the noble guard was of great importance.  This privileged estate took upon itself, among other things, the right to control the conformity of the policy and personality of the emperor to the legacy left by Peter I. </p><p>  The era of palace coups took place without the participation of the masses.  The population at that time was completely far from politics. </p><p>  The era of palace coups did not entail any changes in the political and social sphere.  Noble groups fought for power, pursuing only their interests.  However, at the same time, each of the six rulers, who was on the throne, pursued a special policy, sometimes even a useful country. </p><p>  Before ascending the throne of Catherine II in the country, in general, the socio-economic situation was stable, moreover, some foreign policy successes were achieved, which created the prerequisites for a more rapid development of the state, new achievements in foreign policy. </p>
