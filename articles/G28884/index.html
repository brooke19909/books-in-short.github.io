    <p>  Here is a version of a classic dress that you can easily sew on your own.  You will need fabric at the rate of 2.8 lengths (product length x 2 + allowance for the hem volume).  The width should be equal to the width of the product x 2.2 + allowance for splendor.  Based on these parameters, the fabric should be enough to sew one cocoon dress with a moderately lush skirt and a length up to the middle of the calf. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  First of all, it is important to choose the material for tailoring the dress.  Due to the specific cut, the fabric should be such that it holds well the shape of the cocoon below.  For this, tweed, wool is suitable.  The dress will be tight and warm.  If you use chiffon or silk, you can get a light and unusual design, hiding in the folds. </p><h2>  Pattern: building and taking measurements </h2><p>  To sew a cocoon dress sitting on a figure perfectly, you need to take measurements: </p><ul><li>  OS - the circumference of the neck. </li><li>  DP - shoulder length (from neck to shoulder line). </li><li>  VG - chest height. </li><li>  ABOUT - hips. </li><li>  CI - product length. </li></ul><p>  There are several options for tailoring dresses.  You can sew a cocoon dress from Gucci using an old knit t-shirt.  To do this, you need to perform several actions. </p><h2>  Stages of pattern construction </h2><p>  1) The T-shirt is folded in half, and the neck and shoulder measurements are taken from it.  If there is no T-shirt, then you need to take measurements and make the calculations: 1/6 OSH + 0.5 = throat width.  The resulting size is divided into 3 parts, the height of the back is obtained.  1 cm is added to this size, and the neck height for the shelf is obtained. </p><p>  To build a shoulder, it is necessary to lay 8 cm from the base point of the neck and 2.9 cm perpendicularly downwards. A line is drawn through this point and through the base point of the neck, it is continued further until it is equal in length to the length of the shoulder, previously measured (DP). </p><p>  2) Measurement of the height of the chest (VG) is postponed down from the base of the neck and added up to 15 cm. Depending on the application, the volume of the dress changes.  The larger the increase, the more voluminous the product will come out.  To focus on the photo on the dress, an increase of 10 cm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  3) The lines of the drawing with the drawn neck for the shelf are copied and then cut along the horizontal line of the chest.  One part is attached in mirror image to the line of the sleeve, the second is attached to the side.  The lines are rounded.  Then from the corner of the sleeve is measured 15 cm in two directions.  At the points obtained, the sleeve openings will end.  Then 1 cm allowances are added along all cut lines.  From 2 to 4 cm is added to the bottom line, depending on how the edge will be processed. </p>

    <p>  Using this method, it is easy to sew a cocoon dress, the pattern does not need accurate measurements and tracing.  This dress is free, voluminous and comfortable. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The peculiarity of this model of the dress is that the sleeve is one-piece.  During the construction of the pattern, the sleeve ridge is drawn at the same time as the dress.  It is possible to sew a sleeve into a cocoon dress using a shoulder seam, while there is no need to draw a hard shoulder seam.  In this embodiment, the fabric easily rests on the shoulder, due to which the appearance of the cocoon is created.  In the classic model from Gucci, the back of the product is made slightly bent forward, while the sleeve is obtained only in front, and the cocoon is formed due to the specificity of the pattern. </p><h2>  Dress hem </h2><p>  Using the above-described option to build patterns, you can sew a dress in which the hem is automatically wrapped down, forming a cocoon. </p><p>  In order to sew a dress on the basis of an old T-shirt, for example, you must separately draw the bottom of the product. </p><p>  To do this, draw a trapezoid whose width along the upper base is equal to the width of the product, and the side is equal to the desired length of the hem (measured from the waist to the desired length of the product down).  The angle of inclination of the side of the trapezoid depends on whether the bottom will be magnificent or not. </p><p>  The resulting trapezoid is placed with the large base down and the lower base divided into 4 equal sections.  In each section, a triangle is cut with a base of 3 cm and a height of 1/3 of the length of the product from the waist.  The sides of the triangles are sewn along the lines received.  Due to the fact that small sections of fabric are cut out, the hem of the dress will be wrapped down, forming a barrel-shaped form.  A cocoon dress should look harmonious, therefore you should not make too many cuts - a barrel effect may be created - such a hem will cut the growth and give a roundness to the figure. </p><h2>  Dressing </h2><p>  You can decorate a cocoon dress.  The Gucci pattern contains the dimensions of only the basic elements.  And to make the model unusual, you can sew, for example, pockets. </p><p>  First, the pocket model and its location are selected.  They can be both external and internal, with or without lining.  Pockets are made on the flap, hidden (in the seam of the product), with a cutting barrel. </p><h2>  Welt pocket </h2><p>  The most convenient option for a cocoon dress is a welt pocket.  Make it fast, but it looks very discreet.  In addition, it is convenient to store a trifle or a phone in such a pocket, due to the model of the dress, the hem of the product will not be bristling. </p><p>  The shape of the pocket is most often a rectangle with slightly rounded edges. </p><p>  To make a welt pocket, from the seamy side of the front part (pattern), grindings are attached and swept in.  Then a cut is made, not reaching 1 cm to the end, and oblique notches are made on the sides.  The edges are turned up and down, and the small triangles are customizable. </p><p>  After that, a burlap is applied from the wrong side, which serves as the pocket itself.  The burlap is superimposed on the lower edge, while the seams are combined.  Then the pair is ironed and sections are grinded. </p><p>  It turns out a hidden convenient pocket. </p>
