    <p>  In summer, on the banks of the Volga River, you can notice a large number of campers.  These are the so-called "savages."  This holiday has its advantages.  So, you can independently determine the route, depending on your desires and the state of the wallet. </p><p>  This article will discuss the theme of <span>wild beaches</span> on the Volga River.  Moreover, it is relevant in the holiday season. </p><h2>  Kalyazin beaches </h2><p>  Extremely beautiful vacation spots on the Volga.  Savage, let's say, you can go to the <span>Kalyazinsky district of the</span> Tver region.  It is 190 km from Moscow.  A couple of hours away, and nature will show you all its wealth.  Forest or sandy beaches of the Volga with their clean air will be remembered by vacationers for a long time.  Every year, more and more tourists rest on Kalyazin beaches, some of whom are selected for only a few days, and there are those who prefer a one-day vacation.  It is not surprising that in the summer the beaches turn into real campsites. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="places of rest on the Volga savage" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/463305.jpg" width="600"></div>

For quick orientation on the ground you need to have a map of the entire area with you.  It is characterized by many small rivers, in which the water is the cleanest.  People who constantly choose for themselves a vacation as a savage on the Volga already know such places.  Those who go there for the first time need to spend some time to find a suitable place to relax. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that not all beaches have a convenient asphalt road.  But, as a rule, country roads by the beginning of the season are often leveled by local transport, so traveling through them will not create difficulties. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest by the river" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/463306.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sandy beaches </h2><p>  On small tributaries, beaches with sand are very difficult to find.  Many of them are located in large villages.  One of these beaches is located in Porechye - a rural center in Kalyazin.  Such places are good for those who decide to take a sunbath at the weekend. </p><h2>  Grassy beaches </h2><p>  Those who prefer to go to the Volga with a tent, opt for grassy beaches.  The grass on them is not very tall, not more than 10 cm. This is due to the influx of a large number of tourists who regularly trample it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Forest shore </h2><p>  You can find the forest shore by turning right after Porechye and driving along the river.  There are a lot of vacationers who prefer to rest as a savage on the Volga.  They come here for a few days with their families.  On such shores it is convenient to dry clothes by pulling ropes among the trees.  In addition, the forest serves as protection in windy conditions. </p><p>  Before going on a vacation by the river, you need to study the weather forecast, and then decide on the warmest time for swimming and barbecue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="to the Volga with a tent" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/463307.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to take with you on vacation </h2><p>  It must be remembered that in the evenings, vacationers face such nuisance as mosquitoes and midges, and in the heat - horseflies.  Therefore, it is necessary to take care of acquiring reliable protection - a spray or cream from insects. </p><p>  In order to safely walk along the bottom of the river, it is better to bring comfortable sandals with you.  This will protect your feet from cuts, because sometimes vacationers throw various rubbish directly into the river, including bottles and cans. </p><p>  It is advisable that the sandals are securely attached to the feet and not fall off when swimming. </p><p>  In order to protect your feet from grass and pebbles, you need to take light slippers.  They are comfortable shoes after bathing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What else do you need to take on vacation as a savage on the Volga?  Disinfectants and disinfectants.  The cheapest and most effective means are diamond greens and hydrogen peroxide.  It is better, of course, that they are not useful, but all the same there will not be any excess medicine, because the probability of getting injured on vacation is quite high. </p><p>  In the summer it is very difficult to maintain the freshness of the products.  There is no electricity on wild beaches, which means that perishable foods like meat and milk are best avoided.  The optimal amount of edible is as much as you can eat in a day.  All products will be available in the area.  Moreover, there are many convenience stores.  But it should be noted that alcoholic beverages are sold only until 22 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="inexpensive vacation on the Volga" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/463308.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Since vacationers spend a lot of time in the sun, one must not forget the sunblock and protection against burns.  But in any case, you should follow the rules of being in the sun in order to bring a beautiful tan from rest, and not skin peeling off from a sunburn. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The main attraction of the city is the flooded bell tower.  You can also visit the museum of local lore.  For lovers of river walks there is a yacht club.  Luxurious yachts will attract the attention of every vacationer. </p><p>  You can also rent boats.  Walking on a boat or <span>jet ski</span> will bring vacationers a lot of positive emotions and memories. </p><h2>  In the fight for cleanliness </h2><p>  In order for the nature of the Volga to please many for many years to come, you need to take care of garbage disposal in advance.  To do this, it is better to take garbage bags with you.  Indeed, nobody cleans the Kalyazin beaches, and a lot of garbage accumulates during the season.  By decision of the district authorities, about a hundred garbage containers were installed at the roadsides.  Therefore, at the end of the rest, it is necessary to collect all the garbage that is available, and even that which was left by other vacationers, and take it to a roadside container.  From there, he will then be taken out by special services.  The cleanliness of the beach should first of all be watched by the vacationers themselves, because, as a rule, one wants to return to such places of rest again and again. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing on the Volga" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/463309.jpg" width="388"></div>
