And if in ancient times a variety of jewelry made of precious metals could serve as a sign of high social status, today one of the essential accessories of a rich person is a cell phone, which now performs not only the functions of a device for communication with the outside world, but also additionally emphasizes the high position of its owner .  In Russia today, one of the most expensive are Gresso phones, which we will talk about in more detail in this article. </p><h2>  About company </h2><p>  Costly phones bear the same name as the company directly producing them.  The commercial organization itself was founded in 2002 and is registered in the prosperous and well-fed Switzerland.  As its concept, the brand chose the creation of high-tech products that combine modern design with exclusive, expensive materials and high, advanced engineering technologies.  The first Gresso phones went on sale in 2005 and were made of ebony and gold. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gresso phones" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/1392996.jpg" width="464"></div>

So, from 2007 to 2015, Gresso phones were delivered to the world market in the format of 14 collections.  Each of the released models is a real work of art, which is worth paying close attention to. </p><h2>  Elite models </h2><p>  By the way, the most expensive cell phone from Gresso is Grand Premiere, which costs $ 50,000.  Gresso Avantgarde is in the second position.  This model in 2007 was included in the top ten most expensive phones in the world according to the authoritative magazine Forbes. </p><p>  In 2009, the company's management decided to release a special lineup of Gresso, which was made in the style of sports car racing.  The phone case is made of titanium alloy and carbon fiber.  There was also a ceramic coating. </p><p>  In 2010, elite premium phones were released, which were included in the women's collection.  They had a red <span>crocodile</span> trim <span>,</span> which naturally made their price high enough. </p><p>  In 2012, the company began to implement a rather limited collection called Regal Black.  These Gresso phones cost $ 5,000 each, and the total number of these accessories was only 333. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="luxury premium phones" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33726/1393091.jpg" width="600"></div>

The operating system used was Android.  All this pleasure at that time cost 150,000 Russian rubles, which quite naturally designated this model as an elite and focused on very wealthy people. </p><p>  In 2014, elite premium phones were supplemented by the Gresso Azimuth model.  The main advantage of this phone was that it was the first of the premium options that supported two SIM cards at the same time. </p><p>  The accessory itself was made of class 5 titanium plate, so the phone's body perfectly resists bending, shock, abrasion.  The front panel is made of specially tempered glass on a mineral basis.  Each key of the phone was processed manually by masters and has a matte color.  This series was released in the amount of 999 copies.  In this case, the model number was engraved directly on the case.  It is worth noting that this Gresso phone, whose prices fluctuated depending on the material of its case, did not have strong technical characteristics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone gresso prices" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33726/1393092.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Today </h2><p>  At the moment, iphone Gresso 6S is the most expensive phone company.  The model was created using yellow and white 18ct gold, as well as diamonds and titanium.  The cost of the product ranges from 250-280 thousand Russian rubles. </p><p>  As the basis for the phone, an Apple smartphone option was used.  It is worth noting that Gresso 6S is presented in four modifications, which differ in the presence or absence of diamonds, the color of the gold used and the pattern of the engraving used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone gresso" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38782/1393015.jpg" width="598"></div>

    <p>  To give the titanium case a very deep black color, which is absolutely uncharacteristic for titanium, special PVD technology is used.  It takes about four hours to engrave, and another five will be needed to polish each phone. </p><p>  Finally, let us point out another point: Gresso also produces cases for expensive phones.  In particular, the mechanism of opening the cover, which is made on the basis of sheets of titanium and has all kinds of hinges, can be considered an innovative development of the organization.  The locks that cover the case are made of magnets and can be opened quite easily, but they cannot be accidentally opened. </p>
