    <h2></h2><h2>  Station History: Start of Construction </h2><p>  The history of the Moscow station dates back to 1842.  This year, Nicholas I adopted a decree on the need to build a railway that would connect Moscow and St. Petersburg.  It was then that it was decided that the station buildings in Moscow and St. Petersburg should be identical.  The architect Konstantin Ton was involved in the work.  The Moscow station was built with the participation of the architect and professor Rudolf Zhelyazevich.  <span>The building plan</span> was developed by the Department of Railways in 1943.  For the convenience of passengers, the place for construction was chosen in the very center of the city.  The construction of the station building and the construction of the railway was carried out in parallel, in the same period.  In Moscow, it ended in 1849, and in St. Petersburg two years later.  As for the iron drogue, initially it counted only two ways.  In addition, it was considered the longest in the world.  Its discovery took place on August 18, 1851.  The first flight was made from St. Petersburg to Moscow.  The emperor and his family rode on the train.  The trip lasted 19 hours, given the fact that Nicholas I was very afraid to move the train over railway bridges.  In front of such sections, he got off the train and overcame them on foot, following the train. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spb moscow station" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/345431.jpg?1393614086676" width="600"></div>
