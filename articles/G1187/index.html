    <h2>  Dessole Sea Lion Beach Resort Mui Ne 4 *: reviews, photos </h2><p>  Every experienced traveler will tell you that preparations for any trip should begin in advance.  And in general, this issue must be approached very seriously.  After all, the better you prepare, the more difficulties and problems you will be able to avoid during your long-awaited vacation, especially if you go to a country and a place where you have never been before.  Seasoned tourists are advised to pay special attention to the choice of a hotel where you plan to spend several days of your overseas vacation.  After all, if you do not like the hotel, then this can seriously overshadow the impression of a vacation.  Therefore, many tourists spend a lot of time trying to find and read reviews from those who have recently had a chance to stay in one place or another.  This allows you to make a more complete and closer to reality impression of a particular hotel, thereby reducing the risk of improper choice.  To save your energy, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized comments of travelers from Russia who recently visited the “Dessole Sea Lyon Beach Resort” (Vietnam).  Ahead of events, we note that the vast majority of our compatriots were satisfied with their choice of hotel.  According to them, the hotel is worth the money spent, and they can safely recommend it to all tourists traveling to Vietnam.  But find out everything in detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  The tourists are generally satisfied with the rooms <span>of the Dessole Sea Lion Beach Resort</span> Mui Ne 4 * <span>hotel</span> <span>(Vietnam), the reviews</span> we are reviewing.  The apartments here, they say, are spacious, clean, tidy, nicely decorated, with large furnished balconies with a nice view.  True furniture and appliances in the rooms are not new.  But everything is very high quality and in working condition.  If something fails, then report it to the reception, and after that the problem will be solved as soon as possible.  Many guests noted very comfortable large beds.  By the way, if you arrive at the hotel with a child, then an extra bed will be installed in your room for your child.  Our compatriots considered the presence of a safe in the rooms a plus, which you can use for free.  Also in all rooms "catches" Wi-Fi.  Wireless internet here is also free.

    <h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  Our compatriots claim that the maids in this hotel are very responsible in their work.  So, the cleaning of the rooms is carried out efficiently and regularly.  Also, as expenditures, maids replenish stocks of bath accessories.  Towels (for both bath and beach) are changed every three days.  Sheets are updated twice a week. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dessole sea lion beach resort mui ne 4 reviews" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1104710.jpg" width="600"></div>

First of all, this applies to those who have previously stayed in Dessole hotels (both in Vietnam and in other countries).  So, after booking a room, be sure to notify the administration that you are a regular customer of Dessole.  In this case, upon arrival, you will be given a compliment from the hotel in the form of a fruit basket.  Also on the day of departure, you can stay in the room for as long as you need, without having to release it by 12:00 or pay extra for the extension. </p><p>  Compliments from the hotel can also be counted by guests who have a birthday, anniversary of marriage, or those who arrived at the hotel to spend their honeymoon during their stay at Dessol Sea Lyon Beach Resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dessole sea lion beach resort mui ne 4 reviews photos" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1104718.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  Many tourists appreciated the fact that upon arrival at the Dessole Sea Lion Beach Resort Mui Ne 4 * (Phan Thiet) they were given the room keys almost immediately.  Even if you arrive at the hotel early in the morning, you won’t have to wait two in the afternoon to check in.  As for the suitcases and travel bags, the hotel staff will deliver them to your room.  Our compatriots were very pleased with this attitude, because the road to the hotel is very long and tiring.  Therefore, every tourist wants to quickly get into the room and relax. </p><p>  On the day of departure, the occupied apartments should be vacated before noon.  If your transfer from the hotel is planned in the evening, then you can leave things in the luggage room and continue to relax or extend the room for an additional fee. </p>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that Dessole Sea Lyon is one of the few hotels in Vietnam that offer guests an all-inclusive holiday.  However, when booking accommodation, you can choose a concept that includes breakfast only.  But our compatriots advise all the same to dwell on “ol inclusive”, as there are not many cafes and other infrastructure in the vicinity of the hotel.  Therefore, eating at the hotel will be most convenient.  In addition, almost all travelers agreed that food is organized at a very high level.  So, the choice of dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner has always been very diverse.  For example, at lunchtime, visitors to the restaurant could taste meat, poultry, fish.  In addition, exotic dishes, for example, from crocodile meat, were often included in the menu.  In the evenings, always grilled seafood.  Also, the menu always had several types of soup, side dishes, appetizers, salads, pastries, sweets, fresh fruits and vegetables.  You could have a snack in the daytime in the snack bar.  Here everyone could eat pizza, hot dogs, hamburgers, flat cakes, etc. The hotel guests were also very pleased with the quality of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, as well as the work of the bartenders. </p>
