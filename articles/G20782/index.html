    <p>  Modern mobile phones are becoming more and more like handheld computers.  A set of multimedia functions gives almost limitless possibilities (now it is not only communication tools, but also gaming devices, devices for listening to music, watching movies and TV shows, free access to the Internet, the possibility of photo and video shooting, reading books), and therefore mobile phones of the latest generations long turned from objects of excessive luxury into a truly irreplaceable assistant.  This is primarily true of the iPod. </p><p>  So, having got your iPod, I want to try everything right away.  Making a call by testing your own microphone and speaker audibility is easy.  As well as deal with graphics.  How to view and edit pictures is also, in principle, understandable.  But how do I upload music to my iPod?  There are some features here. </p><p>  If you can upload music files to a regular phone from a computer via a ‚Äúbluetooth‚Äù or a USB cable, and your favorite song will flow from the mp3 player, then with the Apple products, especially the ‚Äúmobile‚Äù beginner will have to smash his head.  But there is no trouble.  Again, the manufacturer will come to the rescue by providing iTunes to its fan users.  It is completely free and with the same result will fit all fresh iPod models, as  the way to download music is the same for them. </p><p>  Install programs </p><p>  So how to download music to <span>iPod touch?</span> </p><ul><li>  To get started, download the already mentioned iTunes.  All actions with the addition or removal of media files it produces.  Moreover, the manufacturer took care of equipping the radio utility with a wide range of channels.  So, having installed iTunes, the owner of the phone will open wide the door to the music and entertainment world. </li><li>  Another step in downloading music to your iPod is as follows: add it to your music library.  To do this, open the "File" menu, the option "Add file to the music library" or "Add folder to the music library."  The necessary compositions are selected and added, and the process itself can be tracked on the screen - it is displayed in the status window.  The same should be done for those who do not know how to download music to <span>iPod shuffle.</span> </li><li>  When the music library is full, you can transfer music to your iPod and enjoy the sound. </li></ul><p>  Sync </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Such an option as ‚ÄúSynchronization‚Äù allows you to organize files, organize them in a special way.  For this purpose, you should again go to the menu, find the items ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù - ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù - ‚ÄúAdditions‚Äù - ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù.  Find the option ‚ÄúCopy to iTunes Music folder‚Äù and tick it.  Then and on, music will be added to the music library. </p><p>  Thus, when the user is aware of how to download music to the iPod, he must figure out how to listen to it.  For this purpose, the player is connected to the computer via a USB cable, then iTunes is selected.  Next, go to the ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù tab, the option ‚ÄúSynchronize music‚Äù is checked there, and click ‚ÄúApply‚Äù.  Everything, music files are recorded on the phone in automatic mode. </p><p>  ITunes is so smart that it itself converts the music format to the one that is supported by iPod instead of the original one.  The user can only agree to this in the dialog box.  It also synchronizes the player when the music is downloaded to the music library and it needs to be imported into the phone.  It lasts 5-10 minutes, depending on the amount of information processed. </p><p>  Another caveat: before you upload music to your iPod, you can figure out in advance whether all the selected information should be transferred to your mobile, one or more songs, or any available special playlists.  It depends on the user's preferences and tastes, and on the availability of free space in the player‚Äôs memory. </p><p>  When the transfer of files to the mobile phone occurs, the status window will display a message that the synchronization has been completed successfully.  The device is ready to work, and music in a clean, high-quality reproduction will bring great joy to the phone's lovers. </p>
