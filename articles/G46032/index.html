Sorrows that haunted him for many years.  He endured them with patience and piety and emerged victorious.  Joseph's story begins and ends with dreams.  This is a story of intrigue and deception, envy and lies, pride and passion.  An instructive story of patience and fidelity, courage and compassion. </p><h2>  Joseph of Egypt - Who Is It? </h2><p>  Joseph is one of the twelve sons of Jacob, the biblical patriarch.  The grandson of Abraham, Jacob, in his youth bought his birthright by cunning for a lentil stew from his brother Esau. </p><p>  One day Jacob had a dream that he would come out of his family who would carry the ‚Äúlight of the house of God‚Äù and ‚Äúall the tribes of the earth will bow to him‚Äù.  All days Jacob was devoted to God, honored His commandments, and treated his whole family fairly, with respect and love.  Joseph and his brothers were trained in this. </p><h2>  Joseph's childhood </h2>

    <p>  Joseph was a beautiful and happy child.  The father was very fond of this son, who was born when Jacob was already in his advanced years.  He called him: "The son of my old age."  And Joseph made a multi-colored long garment, which became the subject of envy of his older brothers.  After all, long clothes were worn only by those who did not work in the field. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Joseph's Dreams </h2><p>  Once Joseph had a dream in which he and her brothers knitted bundles.  The sheaf of Joseph stood up, and the sheaves of his brothers bowed to him.  Joseph told his brothers about his dream.  And his brothers were even more angry with him. </p><p>  The older brothers were much older than Joseph and considered themselves worthy of respect.  But blinded by hatred, they did not want to understand and accept that their brother in the family is the youngest, therefore the father treats him with special love.  Envy led them astray and gave them the wrong direction, because of it they decided to take revenge, carrying her plan. </p><p>  Soon Joseph had a dream in which the sun, moon, and stars bowed to him, eleven in the number of his brothers.  Joseph told the dream to his brothers and father, who scolded him, saying: ‚ÄúWill we, with your mother and your brothers, bow to you?‚Äù  However, Jacob noticed to himself that the dream of his beloved son is connected with the fulfillment of the prophecy. </p><h2>  Deceit and deceit </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Joseph and his brothers" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1270348.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The whole family of Jacob grazed and raised sheep - she was engaged in cattle breeding.  Once, the brothers left to graze herds in distant pastures, and Jacob sent Joseph to them to find out if the brothers were doing well, were they healthy, were the cattle safe.  The brothers saw Joseph from afar and said, ‚ÄúThere comes the king of dreams.‚Äù  By conspiring, they decided to kill him, and explain to his father the death of his brother by the fact that his wild beast tore him up.  But Reuben, one of them, persuaded the rest not to spill blood, but to throw him in a ditch.  So they did, they threw Joseph into the ditch and took off his clothes to show his father. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The brothers sat on the edge of the moat and, without remorse, began to eat bread.  Then a caravan appeared in the distance, and then the brother of Judah offered to sell Joseph, and not to kill - after all, he was his brother to them.  The caravan came close, and the brothers pulled Joseph out of the moat.  Their cruel hearts did not feel pity - they were confident in their impunity, and their cunning plan was a success.  And to sell a person into slavery meant the same thing as death.  In horror, Joseph screamed and begged for mercy. </p><p>  A handsome man and a young man could bring a lot of money, and the merchants did not hide their excitement and joy from the upcoming profits.  They did not question Joseph.  The brothers were counting on this. </p><p>  The caravan took Joseph to Egypt, and the brothers stabbed a kid and smeared the unfortunate clothes with blood.  Crying and screaming, they returned to their father, who was waiting for them.  Hearing their sobs, Jacob immediately realized that his deepest fear was justified. </p><p>  The darkness of the night was like the darkness of their hearts.  The lies easily came off their tongue, and they told their father that the younger brother had been torn by a predatory beast, and showed bloodied clothes.  Jacob's heart tightened with fear and pain.  The father recognized the clothes of his son and, heartbroken, mourned for many days of his beloved son.  What was he to do?  He screamed and cried out to God. </p><h2>  Sold into slavery </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="king of dreams" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1271209.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Day was replaced by night, fear was replaced by hope.  He prayed to God and Joseph hoped for the best.  The Egyptian slave market at this time was teeming with people: someone walked, looking closely at living goods, and someone shamelessly traded the unfortunate. </p><p>  The handsome young man attracted the attention of many, and the stakes on him continued to grow.  When the price reached the limit, the merchants sold Joseph to the treasurer and the head of Egypt's bodyguards - Potiphar. </p><p>  So the young man got into the house of the second man after Pharaoh.  Potiphar saw that everything that this slave did was successful.  And then he appointed an obedient and polite young man as the manager of his house.  Joseph was wise beyond his years and skillfully managed the house of Potiphar, increasing his wealth. </p><h2>  Beauty and Test </h2><p>  Living in the house of the Pharaoh‚Äôs courtroom, Joseph grew up and matured.  Beautiful face and camp, he liked the wife of Potiphar.  Every day she came to look at him and even tried to seduce.  But an honest and noble young man rejected her and ran away, leaving his outer clothing in her hands. </p><p>  A rich and noble woman, whose beauty many men could not resist, was offended by the fact that some slave refused her.  Then she deceitfully deceived everyone, saying that the servant harassed her.  It was bitter and insulting to Potiphar that he trusted Joseph, and he acted so vilely.  Inflamed with anger, the courtier sent Joseph to prison. </p><h2>  From dungeon to palace </h2><p>  After some time, the butler and baker were guilty before the king of Egypt.  He was angry and ordered the latter to be detained.  And they threw them into prison, where Joseph was already sitting. </p><p>  Once these prisoners had dreams.  In the morning, Joseph found them embarrassed and puzzled, because they could not understand the meaning of their visions.  Joseph explained everything, telling the baker that he would be executed, and the cupbearer promised goodwill in the eyes of the king and predicted faithful service to the pharaoh. </p><p>  Joseph asked the cupbearer: ‚ÄúLet the king of Egypt know about me.  That I was stolen from the land of the Jews and undeservedly thrown into prison. "  Three days later, everything happened as Joseph predicted.  Khlebodar was executed, and the butler again returned to the king to serve.  But he forgot the promise given to Joseph - to put in a word to the king of Egypt.  And Joseph remained in prison. </p><h2>  The meaning of dreams </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Joseph the Beautiful" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1271217.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Two years later, Pharaoh had a dream - skinny and thin cows came out of the river and ate fat ones.  And there were seven of those and other cows.  The dream was very sad and puzzled.  He called all the interpreters and sages to him, but no one could explain his dreams to him.  Then he called all his servants and slaves - the king of Egypt was so saddened by sleep.  Here the cupbearer remembered Joseph.  He told the pharaoh about a young man from the land of the Jews, who was sitting in prison.  He told me that when he and the baker had dreams, everything happened exactly as Joseph explained.  Pharaoh immediately sent him to prison. </p><p>  Joseph appeared before Pharaoh and explained the meaning of his dreams: seven years of abundance come, but then seven years will be a great famine.  He said: ‚ÄúThe dream repeated twice.  Soon it will come true, king.  Dreams do not happen without meaning.  It is necessary to perceive this disaster and to fill the storages during abundance, so as not to die in the years of famine. ‚Äù </p><p>  The <span>king of Egypt</span> liked a sensible and wise young man.  He told Joseph: ‚ÄúYou will be above my house, only by my throne will I be higher.‚Äù  He put a ring on Joseph‚Äôs hand and told all of him to bow.  Joseph was thirty years old at that time. </p><h2>  Joseph's reign </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Joseph egyptian who is it" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1271212.jpg" width="598"></div></h2><p>  Great famine was all over the earth.  But in Egypt, under the wise rule of Joseph, the bread granaries were full.  People from all over the land followed him to Egypt.  Jacob, Joseph‚Äôs father, also sent his sons to buy bread.  He left at home only the youngest son of Benjamin.  The brothers came to Joseph and began to ask for bread, kneeling before him. </p><p>  I asked them about the Joseph family.  The brothers said that their father had twelve, but the younger remained with his father, and the other was gone.  Joseph accused them of betrayal and told them to prove that they were telling the truth - let one of them return home and bring their younger brother. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Joseph the king of Egypt" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1271213.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Brother Benjamin was brought to Joseph.  Tears came to his eyes, and he revealed himself to his brothers.  Pharaoh heard that the brothers came to Joseph and said: ‚ÄúBring your father and family, I will give the best in the land of Egypt for your children and wives.  Come and live here. ‚Äù </p><h2>  Patience is rewarded </h2><p>  Jacob gathered all his cattle and property, all the children and grandchildren.  He brought his whole family to Egypt.  Pharaoh gave them the best lands and entrusted his cattle.  Jacob and his entire family lived in Egypt for many years.  All affairs in the land of Egypt were governed by his son Joseph.  Pharaoh trusted him and appreciated for wisdom and courage. </p><p>  Here is a story of patience and hope that helped Joseph not only survive, but also become second after the king of Egypt.  In order to understand how great and unusual the path of Joseph was, you need to know what Judea, Ancient Egypt represented at that time and what were the relations between the peoples who inhabited these lands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Joseph egyptian aphorisms" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1271214.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  The amazing "Egyptian" </h2><p>  The same story tells that the family of Jacob, who came from Judea, was given a separate meal.  Also, Joseph and the Egyptians were especially served.  "The Egyptians cannot eat with the Jews," because "it is an abomination to the Egyptians."  Then Joseph warns the brothers: "Pharaoh will call you and ask:" What is your occupation? "  Answer: "We were pastoralists until now."  Since "every shepherd of sheep is an abomination to the Egyptians." </p><p>  Despite such a complicated relationship between nations, he won the respect of the king of Egypt.  In those days, it was a strong and powerful country.  And getting the favor of her ruler and recognition was quite difficult.  Joseph succeeded.  He was so valuable in the eyes of the Egyptian people that the pharaoh mercifully treated the whole family of Joseph. </p><p>  Reading this story, you understand how unusual the person was Joseph of Egypt.  The aphorisms associated with it, in our time, remind us of the amazing Egyptian. </p><p>  So, by ‚Äúpharaoh's cows‚Äù a person, as a rule, means someone who doesn‚Äôt do anything for the future, or a situation that cannot be fixed by any efforts.  In an artistic environment, people without talent are so called, taking advantage of the activities of their talented colleagues. </p><p>  Speaking about financial problems and the crisis, publicists often use the aphorism ‚Äúseven skinny cows‚Äù or ‚Äútime of skinny cows‚Äù.  And Joseph the Great can be called a handsome and pure young man who is not familiar with temptations. </p>
