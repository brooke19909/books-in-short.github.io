You are free to choose any side of the world and go there immediately.  However, it is worth paying attention to the East, namely to Vietnam, its resort village Mui ne (Mui Ne) near the city of Phan Thiet and the Mui ne Minh Tam Resort 3 * hotel. </p><h2>  A few words about the resort </h2><p>  Why exactly this resort?  In an interesting country like Vietnam, there are two popular resorts.  If you compare them, Mui Ne is a suburb, and the second resort is already a city. </p>

There are no sellers of unnecessary souvenirs who will offer you to buy this or that trinket every three meters of a walk.  Only on weekends do Vietnamese appear in Mui Ne, is it something of a tradition to them.

    <p>  Here, seven days a week, you, like a millionaire, bathe in the sun and sand in absolute tranquility. </p><p>  I would also like to say about Russian tourists.  There are most of them at this resort, but the behavior of people will pleasantly surprise you.  There will be no night cries about how wonderful it is, or the surprised faces of each palm.  All compatriots coming to Mui Ne are quite adequate and friendly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth adding that most of our people choose the Mui ne Minh Tam Resort hotel in the Mui Ne resort.  Therefore, if you need the presence of compatriots around in order not to delve into the study of the local language, then this hotel is the best choice.  The factor also affects the fact that Mui ne Minh Tam Resort has 3 stars, which means good service and good prices. </p><p>  Next, you will find a fascinating tour of Mui Ne and his wonderful hotel near a very long beach.  So let's go! </p><h2>  Arrival, hotel remoteness and surroundings </h2><p>  Finally, you have purchased tickets, booked a hotel room, and already made a flight.  Local taxi drivers will deliver you from the airport to the hotel.  The distance to it is approximately 220 kilometers, it is approximately five hours drive.  However, the distance is offset by the quality of the taxi.  Cars with air conditioning and freshness in the cabin will take you to your destination with comfort. </p><p>  After a not very long journey, you will be greeted by the hotel's lawns and a very beautiful flora. </p>

The hotel is located very close to the beach - practically on it.  The view is amazing.  A lot of greenery, fresh air, the sound of waves.  This is really an ideal place to relax as a couple or with children!

Vietnam is a country of not very high education, however, good-natured staff easily speaks English and Russian. </p><p>  As a deposit, you will be asked for a passport and with great pleasure they will be taken to your room or terrace for meals.  By the way, the rooms at Mui ne Minh Tam Resort are 34. </p><p>  After checking in you will be offered to get acquainted with the services provided at this hotel.  Three stars - although not a first-class level, but this is more than offset by the quality and quantity of services such as currency exchange at a very favorable rate, professional massage, breakfast in the room, laundry service and much more. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  All rooms are decorated in light colors (dominated by white and beige).  The decorated bed with real flowers and origami in the form of two swans from the bedspread immediately catches your eye. </p>

    <p>  The rooms are fresh and clean.  Lighting is more than enough.  There is a refrigerator, wardrobe, two chairs or armchairs, a TV and a bedside table. </p><p>  In the toilet near the mirror you will find a pleasant surprise from incense and relaxing bath gels with flower petals. </p><p>  From the window of the room you can see all the same beautiful green palm trees and ferns, a luxurious, long, sunny beach.  To be <span>on the beach,</span> you need to overcome only 50 meters.  If you are going to go there, do not forget to get a free umbrella and deck chair. </p><h2>  Mui ne Minh Tam Resort 3 * (Phan Thiet): trips to the city </h2><p>  The Mui Ne resort itself is more like a high-class village.  But if you are still interested in city attractions, then you are in luck.  The hotel is just fifteen kilometers from Phan Thiet. </p>

    <p>  The trip will take you no more than an hour, and you will immediately find yourself among a wide selection of cafes and restaurants.  By the way, on the streets of Phan Thiet, Vietnamese craftsmen in just a couple of minutes and a modest price right before your eyes will make cane juice - a very healthy drink. </p><p>  Green taxis are also on duty near each establishment, so you will not have problems returning to the hotel. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  It's time to see what our compatriots say about Mui ne Minh Tam Resort.  The reviews are mostly positive.  All the same behavior of ours stands out separately.  There are no night parties and very violent behavior. </p><p>  Many visitors to the hotel respond as positively about the service.  If suddenly you find any flaw in the room, the staff will be happy to correct everything for you, that you personally easily check before entering. </p><p>  The Russians also did not forget to visit local institutions.  Within walking distance are a golf club, spas and restaurants with a marine menu.  For a vacation to the fullest, there is a club nearby where you can have a drink and dance. </p>
