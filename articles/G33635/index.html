    <p>  Tenerife is the most impressive in size among the islands that filled the Canary Archipelago.  Since the mid-20th century, Tenerife is considered one of the best <span>islands in Spain</span> in terms of tourism.  And this is quite justified, because the climate of this area is unusually mild and attractive.  More than a million tourists come to rest in Tenerife every year.  The point here is not only in climatic conditions, but also in the most beautiful and famous places of the resort.  Here there are sights of both natural, natural origin, and created by human hands. </p><p>  From Spanish, the name of the island is translated as "snow-white."  This name was acquired by Tenerife because there is a volcano of the same name nearby, periodically spewing out a huge amount of ash.  Another suggestion is that the Spaniards named the island after they saw white people with blue eyes and blond hair on it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you look at Tenerife from a bird's eye view, you can see that it looks like a cone.  The most significant peak of the island is Teide, which rises up to 3718 meters (3 odd kilometers) and is considered the most beautiful point in Spain. </p><p>  A very remarkable fact about Tenerife is that on this island you can literally swim all year round.  That is why such a huge number of guests from all over the world go there. </p><h2>  Resorts Tenerife </h2><p>  Santa Cruz is the capital of this island and has a population of 220,000.  This city got its name from the founder of the cross of conquistadors.  Fans of leisure in Spain come to this city for shopping, as well as to see with their own eyes and even participate in some way in the carnival.  In general, all the brightest events of almost all of Spain are concentrated here. </p><p>  La Orotava is another famous town.  Its name is translated from Spanish as ‚Äúsand carpets‚Äù.  The city is located in the central part of the valley, in honor of which, in fact, is named.  In ancient times, the residence of the king of Spain was located here.  As for today, this area is rightfully declared the historical heart of the island. </p><p>  Puerto de la Cruz is the center of business life in Spain, and also takes into the arms of those who love to go shopping and do not like too measured life.  Travelers come there mainly to visit excursions to significant places and buy something new for themselves. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Las Americas was created specifically for the location and comfortable rest of tourists.  The capital of Tenerife is an hour away by car from this city.  Las Americas is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean from all sides, which creates the feeling of a true paradise on Earth. </p><p>  As for the equipment of the city, there is everything you need for a complete separation: bars, clubs, open-air discos, restaurants, cafes and more.  Also on the territory of the city there is a huge number of hotels equipped according to all the laws of the hotel business and differing at an affordable price and excellent service.  Moving around the Spanish surroundings is absolutely no problem.  So, from Las Americas, you can easily get to the equally popular resort city called Los Cristianos.  Mostly elderly people and families with children go there, as this city offers visitors a more relaxed and measured rest. </p><p>  El Medano is another place for tourism, which is famous for its well-developed water sports (diving, surfing, etc.).  Frequent winds give people the opportunity to go windsurfing and kitesurfing, as well as go for boat trips. </p><h2>  Tenerife beaches </h2><p>  The island is famous for its magnificent, clean beaches with golden sand, locker rooms, sun loungers and other amenities.  A stay on the beach is free for vacationers, but all extras in the form of sun loungers, cocktails and so on are provided for a small fee.  <span>Tenerife's</span> most popular <span>beach</span> is Playa de las Teresitas.  It stands out from the general mass in that the sand with which it is showered was brought there directly from the Sahara desert.  The capital of the island is within walking distance from this place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Almost all the beaches of Tenerife are strewn with black sand of volcanoes, especially many of these beaches in a place called Puerto de la Cruz.  This sand is not only incredibly beautiful, but also good for human health. </p><p>  As for the coasts of the cities of Las Americas and Los Cristianos, it is an inseparable chain of beaches with healing golden sand.  Playa de la Vista is one of such places. </p>

    <h2>  Island Attractions </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, the most common tourist attraction of the island of Tenerife can be called <span>the Teide volcano</span> and the valley at it (national park).  This area is striking in its architectural and landscape forms, climate and beauty of the surrounding area.  Popularity among tourists just rolls over, as more than one million tourists visit this territory every season. </p><p>  The Guimar Pyramids also deservedly occupy a position in the ranking of <span>Tenerife attractions,</span> and I must say that this is by no means the last.  As for their origin, there are many speculations about this, none of which are officially confirmed. </p><p>  The island‚Äôs parks created by human hands (Loro Park, Siam Park and others) have their own unique zest. </p><p>  The end of February and the beginning of March mark the beginning of a great event, famous throughout Spain, whose name is Carnival.  For this period, even the most quiet and calm streets of Tenerife are filled with bustle and universal joy, because the time of miracles is coming.  All residents of the city dress up in colorful clothes, paint their faces and walk along the streets, singing songs and congratulating all passers-by on the holiday.  This carnival can be called the second largest after the Brazilian. </p><p>  Usually all the most exciting and bright moments of the holiday take place in the capital.  However, other cities of Tenerife do not stand aside for this time: everywhere music plays, people dance and sing. </p><p>  Tourists Tenerife is twofold.  This city is either madly liked or repulsed to the same extent. </p><h2>  Hotel Description Catalonia Punta Del Rey </h2><p>  The hotel has a convenient location right next to the beach equipped with everything you need.  As for history, this complex has been operating since 1971, and the latest renovations of the facade and interior were carried out there in 2006. </p><h2>  Great location </h2>

Very close are all the significant places to which the bus carries. </p><p>  Unfortunately, all hotels have their own shortcomings.  This also applies to the Catalonia Punta Del Rey 4 * hotel.  Guest reviews also talk about this.  Near the hotel, the pool does not always work.  There are no locker rooms on the beach as promised.  There is a promenade with a pier, but it is far away.  There is no normal beach nearby, you need to go to it by car for 15 minutes, which is not very convenient.  Cleaning does not cause complaints, everything is always clean, although the furniture is no longer new.  The only downside is the double bed, which is actually two single beds, pushed together, forming a gap into which it is not entirely pleasant to fall. </p><p>  The price is very reasonable, taking into account the euro.  The quality of service is also on top.  You can swim and sunbathe in plenty, climb Mount Teide and feel yourself on the edge of the earth. </p><p>  The food is replete with variety, everything is always fresh and very tasty.  The location of the Catalonia Punta Del Rey 4 * hotel (Las Caletillas) just fifteen minutes from Santa Cruz is also pleasing. </p><p>  In general, this hotel complex is a good place for a relaxing family vacation.  Here you can often meet older people or families with children.  There are some disadvantages, but they are insignificant compared to a fairly high level of service.  In any case, having arrived on the island of Tenerife, it is better to spend most of the time outside the hotel.  After all, there are so many interesting places that are definitely worth a visit.  Tours are not very expensive if you order them on the spot, and not through a tour operator.  The beaches are almost the same everywhere, so do not go too far.  The atmosphere of Tenerife is addictive.  I want to come back here again. </p>
