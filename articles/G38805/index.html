    <h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  Using FTTx technology involves the use of fiber-optic solutions for building broadband networks.  It is worth describing what is meant by this new concept. </p><p>  FTTx is a term that describes the general approach to the formation of cable <span>network infrastructure,</span> in which optics go from <span>the communication center</span> to a specific place designated as ‚Äúx‚Äù, and then, directly to the subscribers, a copper cable is laid.  It is quite possible to lay optics directly to the subscriber device.  By and large, the use of FTTx technology involves only the physical layer.  But this concept also hides a large number <span>of network</span> and data link <span>technologies</span> .  Broadband allows you to provide a huge number of new services. </p><h2>  Interest in similar networks </h2><p>  At present, the massive demand for broadband access is called the main engine of the FTTx market, and it is very difficult to ensure if only ADSL is used.  Optical solutions have been increasingly introduced in large cities, and there is a clear tendency to merge small operators with larger ones that operate on a federal scale.  FTTx technologies are very actively used in villages in which the infrastructure was originally built on the basis of the optical path. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Market prospects </h2><p>  The development of the FTTx market in the Russian territory depends not only on the demand for quality content, but also on the number of large construction projects, as well as increased competition among broadband providers.  Thanks to the dynamic construction of apartment buildings, laying FTTx networks is becoming very fast and economically justified, and competition is making the cost of Internet access lower and lower.  A few years ago, the attention of operators was focused on the corporate consumer, and now ordinary subscribers are increasingly being considered. </p>

    <h2>  Construction Feature </h2><p>  Until recently, FTTx technologies were used by operators who did not have their own infrastructure of the old generation, that is, they were made of copper, and this was explained by the increased cost of forming fiber structures.  However, over the past few years, interest in new networks has become more and more.  Among the reasons for this are the expansion of the range of services, the expansion of passive optical networks (PON) and the spread of Metro Ethernet, the reduction in the cost of fiber-optic products, as well as the success of some operators in the construction of such networks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  New Content Types </h2><p>  FTTx technology connection is becoming increasingly popular in light of the fact that modern users are more and more interested in new types of content with video and high-quality graphics.  The main catalyst for the introduction of fiber-optic systems has become a growing interest in video services.  The transfer of the center of gravity from group broadcasting to individual broadcasting means an increase in the demand of subscribers in the allocated <span>bandwidth,</span> which will soon reach 100 megabits per second per household. </p><p>  High-definition LCD TVs are selling at an ever faster pace, which speaks to the customers need for better quality television broadcasting services than what <span>analogue television</span> can offer <span>.</span>  Using IP-TV is seen by many experts as the most logical development of events.  That is, only in this way the user will be able to choose programs, films, as well as the time of their viewing.  That is why it is believed that with a mass connection using FTTx xPON technologies this will not be a question of the next five years, but just a couple of years.  Each Internet provider at the moment understands that investments in optics are investments for several decades to come, the profit on which will exceed costs by tens of times.  This can explain the active purchase of optical lines, as well as a number of pilot projects, including the laying of optics directly to subscriber equipment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  What are the risks? </h2><p>  In the coming years, the FTTx-based Internet will not be the only option that can guarantee the provision of broadband access services, but the fiber-optic infrastructure has a sufficiently high potential, which allows you to have confidence in the return on all investments.  At the moment, great activity is characteristic of the modernization of backbone networks, and the FTTx technology market is still at the stage of study, design and testing.  However, operators are now showing interest in spectral multiplexing elements, as well as passive optical splitters.  In addition, sales of high-capacity optical crosses, which are also used in FTTx solutions, are expected to grow. </p>

    <h2>  Types of Architecture </h2><p>  FTTx technology (Rostelecom) includes several types of architectures: </p><p>  - FTTN (Fiber to the Node) - the fiber reaches the network node; </p><p>  - FTTC (Fiber to the Curb) - the fiber reaches the microdistrict, block or several houses; </p><p>  - FTTB (Fiber to the Building) - the fiber reaches the building; </p><p>  - FTTH (Fiber to the Home) - fiber reach the home. </p><p>  Their main difference is how close the <span>optical cable</span> is to the user terminal.  The first solutions to appear were FTTN and FTTC.  The first solution to date is used exclusively as a quickly implemented and low-cost one, where there is a copper distribution infrastructure, and the laying of optics is simply unprofitable.  The difficulties associated with this solution are known to everyone: the low quality of the services provided, associated with the specific problems of copper cables in the sewer, a significant limitation on the speed and number of connections in one cable.  FTTC is an improved type of FTTN that does not have the disadvantages inherent in the latter.  In the case of FTTC, copper cables are laid only inside buildings, which means that they are not subject to destructive factors and also do not have a long line length, the quality of the copper wires used in this is also important.  That is why it is possible to achieve greater speed in the area without optical fiber.  This offer is valid for FTTx PON connection.  This architecture is aimed at operators who are already actively using xDSL technology, as well as cable TV operators.  Thanks to the implementation of such an architecture, they can not only reduce costs, but also increase the number of connected users, as well as the bandwidth allocated to each of them.  This type of connection in Russia is most often used by operators of small Ethernet networks, which is associated with the low cost of copper solutions, as well as the need for highly skilled performer for installing an optical cable. </p>

    <h2>  Factors </h2><p>  The issues of equipment placement, which terminates the optical component of the communication line using FTTx xPON technologies, depend on a number of reasons: </p><p>  - the availability of alternative infrastructure or its absence; </p><p>  - the ability to place active equipment in the house; </p><p>  - the number of connected subscribers; </p><p>  - others. </p><p>  Experts say that there is a very specific classification of terminal FTTx devices, which is tied precisely to the point "x".  The proposed set of services depends on the type and number of interfaces used in the terminal device, as well as the mechanism for traffic management.  If you need to maintain the existing infrastructure, you should focus on FTTC / FTTB systems with an optical uplink interface.  Such systems are appropriate for use in large enterprises, in residential complexes and business centers, where there is an existing copper infrastructure. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Networking using FTTx technology is most economically justified in the case of a significant concentration of solvent customers or new construction, when questions about the organization of cable laying are still at the decision stage.  It is desirable that the network be planned so that the point "x" is located as close as possible to the client, that is, the subscriber.  When building new areas, it is best to bring it directly to the building, it will be convenient both at the initial stage and in the future.  This offer is valid for FTTx xpon connection. </p>
