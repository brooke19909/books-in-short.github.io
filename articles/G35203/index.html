    <h2>  Negative reviews about Virginia Hotel 3 * (Rhodes, Kallithea) </h2><p>  Unfortunately, no hotel can do without one or another shortcoming.  The Virginia Hotel Reni Koskinou 3 * (Rhodes Island) was no exception.  The following negative points should be noted: </p><ul><li>  the restaurant room is too small; </li><li>  given that guests have to use the municipal beach, for sunbeds and umbrellas you have to pay 8 euros per day (if you want to save, you can sit right on the sand); </li><li>  distribution lines are constantly being formed in the restaurant; </li><li>  the breakfast menu is repeated every day; </li><li>  there is no clothesline on the balcony; </li><li>  the safe is too small, and therefore nothing can fit in it except passports and money (I would like to be able to hide expensive equipment from prying eyes); </li><li>  the use of air conditioning is possible only for a sufficiently high fee, and without it it is simply impossible to be in the room; </li><li>  only tiny pieces of soap can be found in the bathroom accessories; </li><li>  the hotel has practically no entertainment (only in the evenings old-fashioned music plays in bars); </li><li>  leaving the room, it is impossible to leave the air conditioner on, and therefore every time you will return to the hot, stuffy room; </li><li>  for dinner in the restaurant you can often see products that are left over from breakfast or lunch; </li><li>  at the reception there is neither a first-aid kit with medicines, nor even a patch, and therefore everything needs to be taken with you from home; </li><li>  sweets in the restaurant are very specific - everything is fatty and too high-calorie; </li><li>  safes are not in the rooms, but only in the halls; </li><li>  there are no olives or olives in the restaurant‚Äôs menu, which is not typical for Greece; </li><li>  the shower cabin is too small, and therefore, when bathing, you will constantly come into contact with its walls, which is very unpleasant; </li><li>  there are no bonuses for birthday parties (although in other hotels it is customary to give a cake or a bottle of champagne); </li><li>  due to poor organization of work on booking and accommodation, guests often have to spend the first couple of days in a nearby hotel, and then move back. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Virginia Hotel 3 * is an acceptable budget option on the Greek island of Rhodes.  This place is radically different from the usual resorts with its silence and calm atmosphere.  There are all conditions for recreation for active tourists who prefer to spend most of the time on excursions or on the beach.
