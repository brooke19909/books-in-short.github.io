  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bank chart of accounts. Main sections and features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A bank chart of accounts is a numbered list of accounting items on which various transactions are reflected in accordance with regulation No. 385-P. </p><p>  Regulation No. 385-P replaced the regulation No. 302-P and is effective from January 01, 2013.  All <span>credit organizations</span> in Russia must maintain accounting records in accordance with this document. </p><p>  By general definition, a bank is an organization that accumulates funds in deposits, deposits, and accounts for their subsequent transfer to individuals and legal entities in the form of loans on a paid and repayable basis.  Since banks need to keep detailed records broken down by how long and from whom the money was received, and also for how long and to whom they were given, the bank chart of accounts differs from the chart of accounts of an ordinary organization in a large number of positions.  The bank chart of accounts contains approximately 18-20 times more accounts. </p><p>  The chart of accounts of a commercial bank includes accounts of the 2nd and 1st order, where the latter consist of three digits and indicate consolidated accounting items.  And second-order accounts consist of first-order accounts with the addition of sequential expansion.  They are a more detailed <span>synthetic accounting of</span> operations. </p><p>  The bank chart of accounts includes several main sections: </p><ul><li>  Section 1 on capital accounting.  It reflects the funds transferred to the bank by its founders, reserve funds, retained earnings, <span>share premium,</span> uncovered loss.  Accounts can be either active (money owes to the bank or they are its own), or passive (the bank has obligations to any organization or person). </li><li>  Section 2, which takes into account precious metals, cash.  In the section, accounts are mainly active and reflect the presence of cash and precious metals at one or another stage of circulation (at cash desks, at ATMs, on the way, for precious metals - on the way, in coins, on special accounts, etc.).  Passive accounts are opened for customers storing precious metals in this bank. </li><li>  Section 3, to account for <span>interbank settlements.</span>  A large section reflecting all the relationships between various credit organizations, including non-resident banks and the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Section 4, to reflect customer transactions.  Includes reflection of transactions with customers, including accounting of funds in accounts, accounting of deposits, borrowed funds, loans, other placed funds, past due debts, leasing operations, etc. </li><li>  Section 5. Designed to reflect transactions on transactions with derivative financial instruments, securities.  It reflects the amount of banks' own investments in stocks, bonds, bills of other organizations, with the separation of investments in the assets of government agencies, credit organizations, private companies, as well as with the allocation of investments in securities of foreign organizations and bodies.  Accounts are mostly active.  It also takes into account securities issued by the bank itself (bank liabilities). </li><li>  Section 6 for accounting of various means and property.  The section reflects investments in associates and subsidiaries of a credit institution, in shares of various companies, in fixed assets and land, settlements with debtors and creditors (suppliers, contractors, personnel, etc.). </li><li>  Section 7, which reflects performance results.  Here are accounts designed to reflect income, financial results, expenses, income tax, etc. </li></ul><p>  Also, the bank's chart of accounts includes chapter ‚ÄúB‚Äù, which separately reflects transactions on <span>property</span> transferred to <span>trust,</span> chapter ‚ÄúC‚Äù (off-balance accounts), which are necessary to reflect values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are not directly related to the bank‚Äôs assets, including: forms of securities (own and third-party issuers), operations with currency values ‚Äã‚Äã(checks for collection, currency accepted for examination, etc.), derivatives transactions, leasing, leasing operations, derivative financial instruments, etc. And chapter ‚ÄúD‚Äù (accounts depot)  de recognized securities transactions in quantitative terms. </p>
