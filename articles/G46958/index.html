However, that is far from all.  Sport also helps to increase intellectual development.  A great example is chess.  Most people refer to this game as entertainment and one way to pass the time.  If you delve deeper, you can understand that chess is a very organized and common sport.  It has its own hierarchy, many different organizations that conduct all kinds of tournaments and competitions.  The only difference between chess and other active varieties is that they are not on the list of Olympic Games.  Although there is some kind of compensation for this omission.  So, every two years in the world there is an Olympiad, which attracts not only world chess champions among women and men, but also beginners who want to show their outstanding abilities </p>

    <h2>  The Origin of Sports: Indian Chaturanga </h2><p>  There is a legend according to which this game has firmly entered the life of society.  Once upon a time in India, a brahmin (clergyman) created chaturanga - entertainment, which was a blackboard with squares alternating in color.  Figures were put on these cells.  This game was made for the Rajah King who misses the palace.  The ruling person liked the invention so much that as a reward he invited the brahmin to choose everything that he wished.  And the clergyman timidly asked for grain.  But in such a way that one seed was originally put on the first cell.  There were already two on the second cell, on the third it was necessary to put four grains and so on.  Later it turned out that there was not enough grain in the whole kingdom in order to pay for a wonderful Brahmin gift.  Gradually, the game was slightly modified.  The main difference between chaturanga and chess is the number of players.  If two players take part in the modern variety, then the ancient game made it possible to combine two pairs of people.  The steps in the chaturanga were determined by throwing bones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Management Organizations </h2><p>  Gradually, the game spread throughout the globe.  It is noteworthy that neither religious nor political communities had anything against this entertainment.  Currently, the main organization involved in various tournaments is the International Chess Federation, abbreviated FIDE.  It was founded in the twenties of the twentieth century.  At the end of the second millennium, world chess champion Garry Kasparov created the PSA - the Professional Chess Association, which lasted only three years.  However, in such a short time she managed to “forge” a lot of strong athletes.  The World Chess Champion, who has been trained and confirmed his qualifications in the PSA, is considered the “champion of the classic game.” </p><h2>  Young talent from Norway </h2><p>  Although the sport in question has a long history of development, international tournaments on it began to be held relatively recently.  The last battle for the chess crown took place several months ago.  The tournament, held in the Indian city of Chennai, showed the public a stunning result.  For the first time in the history of championships, such a young man won.  The twenty-two-year-old Norwegian <span>Magnus Carlsen</span> was awarded the title of World Chess Champion.  In a fair fight, the young grandmaster defeated Indian master Viswanathan Anand.  In just ten games, the tournament ended in favor of the young grandmaster.  Today, the current world chess champion from Norway leads the list of the most outstanding chess players around the world.  In this ranking, <span>Levon Aronian</span> is in second place after Magnus Carlsen <span>.</span>  Closes the top three, a native of Russia Vladimir Kramnik.  In addition to his serious passion for chess, Magnus Carlsen has proven himself in the modeling business.  His photos often adorn the cover of the popular GQ magazine. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Back to the homeland of the game </h2><p>  The former world chess champion was born in India.  His name is Viswanathan Anand.  He won the title of best player in the world in 2007.  Grandmaster was born in Madras in 1969.  The first teacher of the Hindu was his mother.  She taught the future famous grandmaster the skill to checkmate.  Viswanathan soon becomes the best player in India.  Since 1993, Anand has successfully participated in various tournaments of world championships.  The title "World Chess Champion" the Hindu gets in 2007, beating Vladimir Kramnik.  A year later, Viswanathan Anand confirms his title, successfully opposing Bonn.  In 2013, a young Norwegian came to the place of an Indian. </p><h2>  The road to the Soviet masters </h2><p>  <span>Vladimir Kramnik</span> is known to society as the fourteenth world chess champion.  The hometown of the talented grandmaster is Tuapse.  There Vladimir was born in 1975.  Kramnik is one of those who with dignity and pride holds the title of champion in “classical chess” according to the Professional Chess Association.  In addition, Vladimir Borisovich is a Honored Master of Sports of Russia in this form. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 1991, Kramnik was awarded the title of International Grandmaster.  Until that moment, his highest achievement was the title of world champion among juniors.  Vladimir has repeatedly brilliantly represented Russia at international competitions in the national team. </p><p>  Kramnik's first significant victory was the triumph of 2000.  It was then in London that the Russian put a “mat” to his compatriot, the previous world champion Garry Kasparov.  Four years later, Vladimir met at the chessboard with Peter Leko.  After a long struggle, the Russian defended his high rank.  In 2006, Kramnik combined the PSA world title with a similar FIDE title, defeating Veselin Topalov in the unifying match.  A year later, he transfers the high title to a native of India - Viswanathan Anand. </p>

    <h2>  Thirteenth World Champion </h2><p>  Another rather famous figure in the chess world is Garry Kasparov.  The grandmaster was born in 1963.  A native of Baku originally bore the name Weinstein.  For the first time his father put him on a chessboard.  Harry was then five years old.  In 1976, the first significant event in the boy’s life took place, and he became the USSR champion in chess among juniors.  Two years later, Kasparov won brilliantly in the Sokolsky Memorial tournament, which was held in Minsk.  Thanks to this event, Harry was awarded the title of master of sports. </p><p>  In 1980, Kasparov graduated from school with a gold medal.  The same year was marked by another important event in the life of a young man.  In Dortmund, he was awarded the title of world champion among juniors.  At that time, Kasparov was the youngest grandmaster in the world. </p><p>  At the age of eighteen, the young talent becomes the champion of the USSR.  The grandmaster first entered the adult sport in 1984.  His opponent was Anatoly Karpov.  The games played by the world chess champions were record-breaking in their duration.  The match lasted several months: from September 1984 to February 1985.  The tournament ended with the victory of Karpov.  The next meeting of the two masters took place in September 1985.  The venue was Moscow.  It was here that the 13th world chess champion was determined.  It was Garry Kasparov, who beat the previous “king of the board and pawn” with a score of 13:11.  Until the beginning of the twenty-first century, the talented grandmaster more than once proved his right to possess a high rank, first according to FIDE, and then according to the PSA.  Fifteen years after the momentous event, the Russian master lost the tournament to his compatriot, Vladimir Kramnik.  Accordingly, the world title was also lost. </p>

    <h2>  Presented title </h2><p>  Anatoly Karpov is the twelfth world chess champion.  A native of the Russian city of Zlatoust, he was born in 1951.  Thanks to his father, Karpov at the age of five first learned about the world of chess.  At fourteen, Anatoly becomes a master of sports in this form.  An interesting fact is that Karpov received the title of world champion.  Having achieved high results in youth matches, the young talent fell into the international tournament.  His rival was supposed to be Robert James Fisher.  However, shortly before the start of the match, the American refused to participate.  Thus, the title of the twelfth world champion received Anatoly Karpov.  In subsequent years, the grandmaster proved that he was worthy to wear the high title he received.  The chess player has been very successful in various competitions.  He won the victory in Milan in 1975.  The Italian triumph was followed by no less impressive successes in Manila, Rovinj-Zagreb and other cities.  Karpov three times became the champion of the USSR.  The grandmaster also holds a world record for the number of victories.  Over the entire existence of this sport, no one has been able to achieve the results that Anatoly Karpov achieved. </p>

    <h2>  American Bobby </h2><p>  Robert James Fisher is the first world chess champion from the United States.  He is known worldwide as Bobby.  Chess Information magazine named the American best player of the twentieth century.  The gift to play chess in it was opened by the sister.  Bobby was actively developing his skills, and already at the age of thirteen he won the title of U.S. Youth Chess Champion.  A year later, he raised his rank at the adult championship, becoming the youngest athlete to achieve dizzying success in such a young age.  At the age of fifteen, Fisher became a grandmaster, leaving behind the result of Boris Spassky, who received this title at seventeen.  The first world tournament Bobby was held with the same chess player.  In 1972, Fischer “mates” the Soviet-French grandmaster and receives the title of champion. </p><h2>  Tenth World Championship Winner </h2><p>  <span>Boris Spassky</span> was born in 1937 in Leningrad.  He learned to play chess at the age of five.  In the fifties of the twentieth century, Boris Vasilievich for the first time took part in the final stage of the USSR championship and won with brilliance.  In the same year, Spassky received the title of international grandmaster.  At the age of thirty-two, he becomes the world chess champion, beating Tigran Petrosyan.  A few years later, he transferred the high title to the American Bobby Fischer. </p><h2>  Soviet grandmasters </h2><p>  <span>Tigran Petrosyan</span> was born in 1929 in Tbilisi.  The title of international grandmaster was received by the Soviet chess player in 1952.  After some time, he becomes a honored master of sports of the Soviet Union.

    <h2>  Passing each other the title </h2><p>  The predecessor of <span>Mikhail Botvinnik,</span> Max Euwe, is the fifth world chess champion.  His birthplace is Amsterdam.  From the age of four, the boy began to be interested in chess.  At the age of ten, he began to participate in competitions.  And in 1935, Max Euwe was awarded the title of world chess champion. </p><p>  The title passed to him, so to speak, by inheritance from Grandmaster Alexander Alekhine.  The Soviet chess player for quite some time confidently dominated other athletes.  Alekhine received the title of world chess champion after the tournament with the invincible Jose Raul Capablanca in 1927.  Once the title was lost.  This happened in 1935 in a match with Max Euwe.  However, after some time the championship was restored.  The Soviet grandmaster is the only person in the history of this sport who died undefeated. </p><h2>  "Chess automatic machine" </h2><p>  In 1888, Jose Raul Capablanca i Graupera was born in Havana.  In the history of chess, it is known as a “chess machine”.  So Capablanca was nicknamed for the lack of errors during the parties.  The Cuban won his league title in 1921.  His opponent was Emanuel Lasker.  Capablanca challenged the eminent grandmaster long before the tournament.  However, Lasker still did not agree to play with the young talent.  Confident victories, one after another, pursued Jose Raul, until in 1927 Alexander Alekhine called him to the match.  Then the crown of the ruler of the chess world changed its owner.  He was a native of the Soviet Union. </p>

    <h2>  Psychology and the game </h2><p>  The second world chess champion is Emanuel Lasker.  He was born in 1868 in Germany.  He holds an amazing record in the world of chess: the champion title belonged to the German for twenty-seven years.  This has never happened in the history of this sport.  Many scientists call Lasker a “pioneer” in the field of a psychological approach to chess craft.  In 1894, at the World Championships in New York, Emanuel won his first victory.  He was awarded the title of champion.  He successfully performed until the age of 68. <br>  In 1836, Wilhelm Steinitz, the first world chess champion, was born in Prague.  His teachings had a huge impact on the further successful development of the entire history of chess.  The world title was awarded to Steinitz at a fairly mature age.  At that time he was fifty years old. </p>
