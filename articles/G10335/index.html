One of the bank’s products is the “Benefit” savings card.  Home Credit Bank offers it to all its customers.  What kind of credit card is this?  And what are its features? </p>

    <h2>  General information about the bonus program of the bank </h2><p>  According to the rules of <span>the</span> bank's <span>loyalty program</span> , when making various purchases in stores, the organization’s client can receive a certain percentage of compensation.  As a rule, it is fixed and depends on the type of banking product.  For example, if you are a holder of Gold or Standard cards (Gold Successful Purchases, Our Cashback Card, Cashback Standard Card), then using them you will receive a bonus within 1-3% of purchase amount.  Moreover, the card “Benefit” (“Home Credit”) of the “platinum segment” will provide you with compensation in the range of 1.5-5%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What does a Good card look like? </h2><p>  A card connected to the Benefit program, as a rule, has an appropriate thematic design.  For example, on some of them you can see a kind of mouthpiece, horn or pipe with graceful handles, sophisticated with various designs and inlaid with precious stones.  At the same time, some cards have white, while others have a black background. </p>

    <h2>  Who can take part in the program? </h2><p>  Not everyone can participate in this program.  According to the terms of the bank, only customers with existing special offers from Home Credit can connect to it.  At the same time, the design of a package of such proposals will cost from 990 to 5,000 rubles per year (depending on the type of open card). </p><p>  According to representatives of the credit institution, this amount includes not only basic card service, but also the accrual, calculation and deduction of points earned by the client during participation in the program.  All this gives you a card "Benefit" ("Home Credit"). </p><h2>  The nuances of registration, participation in the program </h2><p>  For the first time you can connect to the program only at the conclusion of a loan agreement, for example, when applying for a consumer loan or credit card.  Also, <span>a bank client</span> involved in other programs of a financial organization may express a desire and write an application for participation in the loyalty program. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For regular servicing in the system, the bank annually charges a certain fee (in accordance with the current tariffs for cards of different segments).  Moreover, if after this period the client does not express a desire to refuse to participate in the program, payment for the next 12 months will be charged automatically.  In addition, each client has the full right to refuse the service, but no later than 14 days from the date of activation of the service.  This is how the “Benefit” program works.  "Home Credit" disconnects from participation in the system for free.  But it will be impossible to join it again. </p><h2>  What cards can be issued according to the program? </h2><p>  Currently, within the framework of the current loyalty program, you can draw the following cards: </p><ul><li>  “Good Gold Purchases”; </li><li>  “Good Platinum purchases.” </li></ul><p>  For example, if the “golden” credit card “Benefit” attracted your attention (“Home Credit” with its help offers to pay for goods and services at 34.9% per annum), then you will find a revolving credit limit of up to 300,000 rubles and a grace period of 51 day.  Card "platinum" can also pay bills up to 29.9% per annum.  In the case of cash withdrawals for the Gold and Platinum cards, a single interest rate is applicable - 49.9% per annum. </p>

    <h2>  How many bonuses can I earn? </h2><p>  In accordance with the rules of the current program of the bank, making any purchases with the "Benefit" cards (within the country and abroad), you can earn a minimum of 1% of one spent amount.  Moreover, during the whole month the client is allowed to collect no more than 2000 points.  All bonuses received over the limit are canceled by default.

    <p>  Suppose you use a Gold card, give an example of expenses taking into account the bonuses received.  So, you can spend about 7,500 rubles for various trips and trips, 4,000 rubles to pay for refueling and car washing, 5,000 rubles will cost you trips to restaurants and cafes, 15,000 will cost shopping in online stores, about 18,500 rubles will be spent on groceries and other everyday items.  As a result, in a month of such expenses you will be able to earn 5180 bonuses, and in a year - 62 160. Please note that 1 point is equal to 1 ruble. </p><p>  But with similar amounts of expenses, but already using a different Benefit card (Home Credit Bank increases the percentage of compensation for premium plastic holders), the amount of monthly bonus earnings will amount to 5603, and for the year - 67,236 points. </p><p>  As you can see, the amount of compensation depends not only on the amount of purchases, but also on the type of loan product you have chosen. </p>

    <h2>  What can I get additional bonuses for? </h2><p>  In addition to the officially established bonuses that can be obtained for making purchases in any virtual and stationary stores, including foreign and domestic, participants in the Benefit program (Home Credit Bank launched this service in the spring of 2013) can receive additional points.  They can do this only by making purchases from partners of a credit institution.  As a rule, some of them are indicated at the very end of the page on the official website of the homecredit.ru program. </p><p>  For greater convenience, they are all sorted into the following categories: </p><ul><li>  Household appliances and electronics. </li><li>  Childen's goods. </li><li>  Leisure and relaxation. </li><li>  Other </li><li>  Pet supplies. </li><li>  Books. </li><li>  Furniture. </li><li>  Clothes, shoes, accessories. </li><li>  Perfumery and cosetics. </li><li>  Gifts and hobbies. </li><li>  Food. </li><li>  Sports and tourism. </li></ul><p>  Moreover, no matter what category you choose, in any case, additional points await you.  "Benefit" ("Home Credit") - a credit card that allows you to compensate for part of the money spent on purchases.  For example, for the purchase of goods for children of one company you will receive plus 7% of bonuses, another company will bring you 5%, and the third - 10%. </p><p>  In addition, the bank’s partners themselves often hold additional promotions, which, in addition to additional points from Home Credit, also receive a store discount of 10-20%. </p>

    <h2>  What to indicate in the application when registering in the system? </h2><p>  When submitting an online application for a “Benefit” card, it is necessary to indicate the following points in it: </p><ul><li>  FULL NAME; </li><li>  date and year of birth; </li><li>  floor; </li><li>  E-mail address; </li><li>  Telephone number; </li><li>  series and passport number; </li><li>  account on the social network (if available). </li></ul><p>  All that remains is to agree with the rules for processing information and send the completed application form. </p><h2>  Control and usability of program operations </h2><p>  For your convenience, as Home Credit Bank promises, bonuses on the Benefit card can be monitored and controlled using your personal account.  To this end, however, you must first connect to the Internet banking service, and then go through a simple registration procedure.  Entering your personal account, you can perform the following actions: </p><ul><li>  control information regarding payments made and invoices sent; </li><li>  make money transfers; </li><li>  pay by card when purchasing goods from online stores; </li><li>  pay debt on a loan; </li><li>  monitor the timely making of a mandatory monthly loan payment. </li></ul><h2>  Useful tips for program participants </h2><p>  Among the huge amount of important information regarding the Benefit program, we highlighted several important and interesting points.  Firstly, you can get answers to possible questions regarding the search for the nearest branch for the purpose of connecting to the bank's program by calling the hotline 8 (800) 700-10-29.  Secondly, the accumulated points must be exchanged during the year.  Otherwise, they will not be carried over to the next period, but simply canceled. </p><p>  Thirdly, during the <span>grace period</span> and in the complete absence of loan debt, you do not pay interest.  If the grace period is long gone, and you did not manage to repay the loan, the bank will definitely charge you interest, moreover, for the entire interest-free service phase.  And finally, taking part in the loyalty program, the client has every right to use the bank’s credit funds an unlimited number of times. </p><h2>  Where can I spend earned bonuses? </h2><p>  You can spend your accumulated points using your personal account in online banking.  To do this, just enter the appropriate username and password, log in, select the tab "Benefit" and pay attention to the list of goods and services that you can use.  In this case, you can partially or fully pay off the purchase.  In this case, everything will depend on the number of points collected.  After using bonuses, they are deducted. </p><h2>  What feedback can you hear about the program? </h2><p>  As Home Credit promises, Benefit (reviews of this program can be read below) is a special loyalty service that provides a refund and encourages new purchases.  But what do users say about such an attractive program? </p><p>  For example, some of the program participants express their admiration.  According to them, it is very convenient to pay with a “Benefits” card, as money is written off quickly and points are credited with the same speed.  Others, on the contrary, share their negative experiences.  According to their story, it becomes clear that when they tried to pay for goods with accumulated bonuses in one of the partner pharmacy networks, they had a misunderstanding with sellers.  This is due to the fact that most of them are poorly informed about working with points and do not know how to write them off at all. </p><p>  Still others talk about the inconvenience of controlling bonuses through online banking.  According to them, at the same time you can view only the last five payments with the crediting of the corresponding points.  As a result, they had to manually search and transfer all the data for better control into a separate Excel file. </p><p>  Fourth praise the operators of the hotline, with which they were able to resolve disputes with crediting bonuses. </p><p>  In a word, the “Benefit” card is a universal tool.  It allows you to shop at your favorite stores and receive additional bonuses and discounts.  Moreover, the accumulated points can again be spent on the payment of goods and services.  The system is not new, but still relevant and in demand among bank customers. </p>
