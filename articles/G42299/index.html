Amnissos Hotel: photos, prices and reviews of tourists from Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Our compatriots, who like real Greek hospitality, may not chase five-star complexes and palaces.  Just select a class 3 hotel. Amnissos Hotel is exactly what you need.  Because this hotel will give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãauthentic Crete, provide all kinds of amenities, beach vacations and excursions, and after a hot day spent in the sun under the sea breeze or on a variety of walks, it will shelter you in the green of its oasis.  You can have fun here from the heart, and the children will be very pleased.  At least, tourists from Russia highly value this hotel, despite its star rating of ‚Äú3‚Äù.  Amnissos Hotel leaves only positive impressions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="3 Amnissos hotel" class="if" height="208" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/468610.jpg" width="343"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel is located in a small tourist village.  But its location is very beneficial for tourists.  There is a bus stop nearby, from where buses to various cities of Crete regularly run.  From here it is easy to get to neighboring Rethymnon (it is only five kilometers away), as well as to places that are in popularity in the TOP-3.  The Amnissos Hotel is therefore a convenient departure point for <span>Agios Nikolaos,</span> Chania, as well as for Heraklion, where the international airport is located.  The hotel belongs to the city of Rethymno, and next to the hotel begins the area (or village) Adele.  This is one of the most popular resort villages in Crete.  Here you can go to local shops, taverns and bars, try authentic island cuisine and drinks.  By the way, prices in the village are lower than in shops right outside the hotel.  All the shops work until late, and it‚Äôs better to go there in the evening when the heat subsides. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Usually holidaymakers at this hotel fly to <span>Heraklion Airport.</span>  From it to the hotel is only seventy kilometers.  Transfer here is carried out on a comfortable bus with air conditioning, and go about an hour.  This does not take into account the fact that such a shuttle usually delivers vacationers to neighboring hotels.  In the latter case, the trip can last up to two hours.  If you get yourself, then from Heraklion to the hotel there is a shuttle bus that stops right in front of the entrance.  The trip itself here looks like a whole tour.  The road is a winding mountain serpentine among green forests and rocks.  Very beautiful views along the way are noted in their reviews by many tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Rethymno </h2><p>  Half an hour by bus from the hotel Amnissos Hotel Rethymno 3 * - and you are already in a beautiful medieval town.  Here you can stroll through the narrow streets, see the ancient fortress of Fortezza, as well as relax on the largest sandy beach in these places.  By the way, discotheques and night clubs work in Rethymno, so if you like parties, you can go here in the evening.  Buses run every half hour, and tickets can be bought directly at the hotel reception.  If you are late for the last flight from the city, you will have to take a taxi. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, once these places were part of the ancient Minoan city of Amnissos (with which the name of the hotel is connected), subordinate to the Cretan king in ancient times.  Nearby there are caves with beautiful flowing forms, which in ancient times served as a place of worship for a goddess who brings children and patronizes women in childbirth.  Famous Cretan frescoes, such as those found in the Palace of Knossos, are also found near Rethymnon, but they are now in the museum of the city of Heraklion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Amnissos hotel 3 greece" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/467847.jpg" width="309"></div>

    <h2>  The territory of the hotel.  What is here </h2><p>  The hotel was built a long time ago, in 1987.  However, a very high-quality repair was made in 2011, so the modern interior and amenities meet all current leisure standards.  Despite the fact that the hotel has a star rating of ‚Äú3‚Äù, Amnissos Hotel can get all five points for its territory.  She is very well-groomed and beautiful.  Gardens with trimmed emerald lawns, many exotic flowers and magnificent palm-lined alleys, as well as fruit trees (pomegranates, oranges, lemons), oleanders, alpine slides with pine and fir trees, and among all this, five cozy two-story bungalows surrounding the main building.  They are dazzlingly white in color and built in the colorful style of a real Greek village.  In tropical gardens, among ficus, hibiscus and beautiful rose bushes, there are many arbors, high chairs, comfortable <span>wicker chairs</span> all over the place.  And this is only a small part of the real Mediterranean hospitality that distinguishes the Amnissos Hotel 3 *.  Therefore, travelers from the former Soviet Union tend here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Amnissos hotel 3 crete" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/467855.jpg" width="371"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel check-in: rooms </h2><p>  Amnissos Hotel 3 * (Crete) has more than eighty rooms for guests.  Of these, twenty-four rooms are in the main building, and the rest are in the bungalow.  Guests are offered two types of rooms - for two or three people (area 24-27 meters) and for families or companies (up to four guests).  The rooms are equipped with various amenities - a bathroom, a bathroom with a <span>dressing table</span> and a large mirror, hairdryer, telephone, refrigerator.  On the floor - tiles.  The rooms are air-conditioned and have balconies.  You can store valuables in a safe, but this is a paid service.  The interior of the rooms is beautiful, typically Cretan, with wooden furniture and wicker chairs.  But without any "bells and whistles" - it is convenient and stylish.  Change the bed and towels twice a week, and clean every day, with the exception of Sundays.  The terraces in the bungalow are so large that you can sunbathe right there, especially if the rooms are near the pool. </p>

    <h2>  Services and entertainment </h2><p>  Since we are writing about such a tourist-friendly country as Greece, Amnissos Hotel 3 * can be considered typical of it in terms of amenities for vacationers.  There are animation programs, both daytime and evening.  As a rule, entertainment events are held near the pool bar.  Tourists especially enjoy the evening of Cretan music.  For those who don‚Äôt think they can rest outside work or news, as well as discuss with opponents or communicate on Skype and on social networks, a Wi-Fi works.  The hotel has a special room where you can check in with your early arrival or late check-out.  If you want to iron clothes, ask for an iron at the reception.  Independent travelers by car use the hotel parking.  In the evenings you can play billiards, and during the day you can play mini-golf or aerobics.  Some of these services are paid. </p><p>  Hotel Amnissos Hotel 3 * (Greece) takes care of the children.  It offers small guests a special club and a playground for games.  In the evenings, special discos are organized for them.  Children can swim in the pool for babies, and if parents are tired and want to do each other, you can order a nanny (but this is for a fee).  The restaurant has special high chairs. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The food in Amnissos Hotel 3 * reviews left by tourists, especially from Russia, are called beautiful.  There is a restaurant in the hotel, which is served according to the "buffet" system, but you can also order a la carte dishes.  Have a snack at the poolside bar.  Unlike other three rubles, this hotel has all inclusive.  At lunches and dinners, hot dishes are practically not repeated, and breakfasts and salads are very tasty.  A lot of fish, good <span>home-made chips,</span> a variety of fruits.  Breakfasts, the so-called "European" - give natural tea, coffee, several varieties of cold cuts, cheese, homemade yogurt and other dairy products, eggs.  The ‚Äúsalad bar‚Äù system is practiced when you can combine vegetables yourself and pour them with sauces.  There is even an ‚Äúafternoon snack‚Äù at five in the evening, which serves hot drinks, pastries and ice cream.  The hotel prepares national dishes well - barbecue souvlaki, rabbit, squid, lamb on the grill ... The pool bar serves decent alcohol - not only wine and beer, but also brandy, brandy and ouzo.  Tourists write that the drink is good, and the head does not hurt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Amnissos hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/467851.jpg" width="433"></div>

    <h2>  Sea and water treatments </h2><p>  Amnissos Hotel Adele 3 * does not have its own beach.  But this is a feature of the Cretan coast.  Here you can swim on any beach, since they are all municipal.  We can say that this hotel is on the so-called second line, across the road from the sea.  Therefore, sun loungers, umbrellas, deck chairs and other accessories for water recreation on the beach are paid.  You can only use special towels, which are issued on bail.  The beach and the descent into the water are pebble.  But you can go to the right of the hotel along the coast.  There is a nice sandy beach where there are no sunbeds and umbrellas, but you can buy a special rug in the nearest shop, which is very useful.  To any coast go no more than five minutes.  The sea is clear, although there are often waves.  The beaches are cleaned every morning.  The pool is large, nice, clean, with fresh water.  It is also surrounded by a sunbathing terrace with sunbeds and umbrellas - but it's all free. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Amnissos Hotel 3 * Rethymno Adele boasts a coordinated, professional work of employees.  Almost all of them are members of the same family, and they try for tourists ‚Äúnot for fear, but for conscience,‚Äù as they say.  Since most of those who come to this hotel speak Russian, and the hotel staff speaks quite decently in this language.  These are animators, and musicians who have in their repertoire songs of popular domestic artists, and managers.  The staff warmly welcomes visitors, helps carry suitcases without any tips, and also tells where you can go and go.  Since the hotel is small, in a day the staff will know you by sight and by name, as well as your room number. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Amnissos Hotel 3 * Rethymno Adele is called one of the most budgetary.  Two weeks for two will cost 750-800 euros.  That's why tours here are so popular.  As for paid services, renting a safe costs about 15 euros per week, and if you want to use sun loungers and umbrellas on the municipal beach, it will cost 5-6 –Ñ per day.  Bus tickets to Rethymnon - 1.20 Euro one way.  Taxis to the city or back are about 12 –Ñ, so the bigger the company, the cheaper.  Excursions for different operators are different, but in general, prices start at forty euros per person.  However, if you decide not to travel with guides from the hotel, but from local companies, then this can cost you one and a half times cheaper.  A trip to Santorini (from the operator) - from one hundred and twenty euros.  Car rental is about 35 –Ñ per day, but this is if you take a car in the office, not in the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Amnissos hotel 3 greece reviews" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/467858.jpg" width="355"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Those who want to go see local attractions near Rethymno have a place to go.  Nearby is the beautiful freshwater <span>lake Kournas.</span>  There you can ride a catamaran and feed water turtles with bread.  Of the nearby attractions, there are two more ancient monasteries - Monis Preveli (next to it there is also a beach with palm trees) and Arcadia, as well as the beautiful village of Argyroupoli, which stands on a whole cascade of waterfalls.  If you rent a car, you will not regret it.  The whole beautiful and mysterious island of Crete is at your service!  Elafonisi with pink sand, the ancient city of Chania - all this you will see in one day of such a trip.  You can also visit the Palace of Knossos, but it is better not to do this in hot weather.  It is also good to go by ferry to other islands.  Santorini with its white houses and a volcanic beach enjoys the greatest popularity among vacationers. </p><h2>  Amnissos Hotel 3 * (Greece): reviews of Russians </h2><p>  If we summarize what vacationers write about, then briefly their responses can be expressed as follows: to live comfortably, to nourish heartily, to relate mentally.  The rooms were called clean and comfortable, the size also quite satisfied the guests.  The hotel is comfortable and not hot in summer.  The territory is beautiful, nature is nearby - beyond all praise.  The staff is not only attentive and hardworking, but also cheerful, which is also transmitted to tourists.  A very good place to relax with young children, as well as for those who do not like the hustle and bustle.  Beautiful air, turquoise sea, pleasant sun.  In a word, you are like resting in a large, friendly and welcoming Greek family, where you want to return again.
