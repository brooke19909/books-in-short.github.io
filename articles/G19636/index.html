    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Gouves Water Park Holiday Resort is located on Corfu Island.  He is very popular.  The second largest of all the Ionian Islands and the most northern.  And it is here that there is a village called Gouvia.  This place is associated with entertainment, fun, clubs and beach parties.  However, this is exactly how it is.  Therefore, mainly youth companies or people longing for outdoor activities go to Gouvia. </p><p>  Gouves Water Park Holiday Resort is located in close proximity to the sea - you can walk to the beach in a few minutes.  By the way, the airport is not so far from the hotel.  It is called "Ioannis Kapodistrias."  Not far from Gouvia (which is also called Gouves), Heraklion, as well as Hersonissos, are located.  In general, from here you can quickly get to any attractions. </p><p>  The hotel and all its 260+ rooms look modern, despite the fact that the building was built in 2003.  The last restoration was carried out in 2007. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Junior Suite </h2><p>  Finally - a few words about the numbers in this category.  Many people settle in them, coming to Gouves Water Park Holiday Resort.  Apartment reviews are exclusively positive.  Guests assure that it is best to book these spacious and stylish rooms.  Looking at the photo above, you can make sure that this is really a great option. </p><p>  The price of a weekly stay for three adults is slightly less than 100,000 rubles (without discount).  For four apartments will cost less than 115,000 p. </p><p>  However, as you can see, the prices of apartments, and even with the service "full board" are quite modest.  In addition, as the guests say, there is a very polite and courteous staff.  They will always help to resolve any issues, and if guests arrived at the hotel late in the evening, they would definitely leave dinner. </p><p>  There is also a decent level of service, and the location of the hotel is good.  True, some advise taking rooms with increased sound insulation, since in the evening the streets of Gouves are quite noisy.  However, this was previously mentioned - do not be surprised. </p><p>  By the way, since there is an airport nearby, one can hear how airplanes are taking off and landing.  This does not bother many at all, but people who are especially sensitive to sounds may not like it.  As well as a fairly large number of visitors with noisy children of different ages. </p><p>  And the last recommendation from the guests - the rooms here should be booked a few months before the planned trip.  Firstly, there is a chance to get a discount.  And secondly, the hotel is very popular, so by the beginning of the holiday season there are simply no free rooms left. </p>
