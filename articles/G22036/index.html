    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  The first thing that should be noted with attention when talking about Riu Republica 5 * is the fact that only people over 18 are entitled to stay at this hotel.  You can‚Äôt come here with children, the hotel is for adults only. </p><p>  And it is located in the southeastern part of the Dominican Republic, widely known as Punta Cana.  Here, amazing beaches - clean, with snow-white and unique coral sand.  One of the best is Arena Gorda.  And what pleases you most is the hotel is located in close proximity to this beach, famous for its wide coastline.  And, most importantly, Riu Republica 5 * has a private area on the Arena Gorda.  So the guests of the complex can rest there at any time.  Even in the afternoon, in the midst of the holiday season, it‚Äôs spacious here. </p><p>  But this is not all the pluses of the location of the complex.  Punta Cana Airport is a 25-30 minute drive from here.  And about the same amount you need to spend on the road if you want to visit the city of Higuey - a major tourist center of the Dominican Republic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Guests of Riu Republica 5 * are greeted with a bottle of Dominican alcoholic drink called kava.  Guests can immediately ask the concierge for help, if necessary.  The reception here works around the clock, room cleaning is done daily (as well as towel replacement), and new linen is delivered on demand.  There is also a luggage storage room, a hairdresser and a beauty salon.  There is also a boutique.  Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel for free (in apartments, too).

    <h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  Riu Republica 5 * gets excellent reviews, and largely thanks to its prices.  By Dominican standards, all-inclusive accommodation is quite inexpensive.  So, for example, in the autumn season a week for two people will cost 1,700 euros.  But this is if you want a room overlooking the garden.  There are options from the balconies of which you can observe the sea surface.  They will cost 300 euros more. </p><p>  For three people, a standard garden view will cost you 2,200 y.  e. However, it is also worth knowing that prices here vary depending on the season.  And early booking in the Dominican Republic is always more expensive than standard.  In general, it is better to monitor the dynamics of prices and select the most suitable moment for a profitable booking. </p>
