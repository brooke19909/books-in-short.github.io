Man did not have time to significantly change anything here.  There is an opportunity to stroll between the tropical thickets, from which a blissful fragrance emanates, to admire their splendor and multicolor.  Being on the ocean, you will see in front of you a bright blue water, characterized by crystal clearness.  You can soak up the white sand without debris.

    <h2>  Special zone </h2><p>  Tachai Island is included in the heritage of a national park called Mu Ko Similan.  Thanks to this, access to it has become more limited.  Tourists are allowed here without obstacles from November to April.  To restore the nature of this beautiful place, the rest of the time they give her rest and stop contact with tourists.  Whatever you say, human touches leave their mark. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The Andaman Sea,</span> where this item is located, is an excellent environment for the development of wildlife.  There is a distance of 20 kilometers to the archipelago.  Such entertainment, a way of relaxation, like an excursion to the island of Tachai, became available only about two years ago.  So, they have not yet managed to discredit nature, and the administration is making every effort to continue to do so.  Once here, you forget completely about the existence of the world outside.  Reason is immersed in silence, and the soul experiences true grace. </p>

    <h2>  About the aquatic environment </h2><p>  The Andaman Sea, which contains the most beautiful array of coral reefs, will affectionately receive you into its waters.  This water point is half closed and enters the Indian Ocean.  Nearby are <span>the Malacca Peninsula</span> from the eastern part and Indochina. </p><p>  From the south you can see Sumatra.  Thanks to a number of islands, the body of water is separated from the nearby bay.  Its area is more than 600 thousand square meters.  km, and the average depth is 1043 meters.  As much as possible you can sink to the bottom by 4500 m. Tides are characteristic, which increase the water level by 7.2 meters.

    <h2>  Where and how much to buy a ticket? </h2><p>  If you have enough enthusiasm to visit Tachai (island), how to get there becomes one of the main issues that interest many tourists who have not been there.  And really few people managed to visit this paradise because of the short duration of its existence.  There is nothing difficult to visit. </p><p>  Many travel agencies Khao Laki and Phuket are engaged in the implementation of trips there.  To do this, you need to fly directly to one of these cities, where you will be included in the excursion group.  Such a trip can cost about 2000 baht (at least one person).  This price includes a wonderful vacation on the sea coast, snorkeling, a walk in the forest full of tropical plants.  Tours, including diving, are easy to get.  They can cost 4,500 baht per person. </p><h2>  Respite </h2><p>  If you are determined to come here by all means, remember one important detail: you can get here only from November to mid-May.  In other cases, you will need to wait until nature is prepared for your arrival.  The flora, as well as the plant world of the island should be restored.  Still, vacationers harm her a little and scare animals with their presence.  Each year, the start and end dates of the resort are different.  In 2016, they plan to arrange a respite from mid-May to the end of October. </p>
