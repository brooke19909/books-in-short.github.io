    <h2>  Pattern of the basis of a kimono </h2><p>  It is believed that the Japanese kimono is such a dimensionless bathrobe, which will suit any figure.  The standard width of the back in such a product is 60 cm, which, with the help of a belt, is draped directly on the figure and the thing does not seem large.  However, if the volumes are too large, then wedges are added to the main pattern in the side seams.  Another feature of this thing is that the kimono has absolutely no fastener except a belt at the waist. </p><p>  The traditional Japanese kimono is sewn of fabric with a width of about 30 cm. This requires making a stitch detail of the back, but if there is material of a more impressive width, then it is not necessary to make it, unless, of course, it is necessary to recreate the image of an ancient dress. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In cut products use only geometric shapes.  The back is a rectangle with the necessary height and length of 60 cm. </p>

    <p>  The shelves in front of the bottom are 45 cm, and in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe waist, the edge is cut off at an angle of 15 degrees to the neck.  For processing a slice at the throat, a strip of tissue 10 cm wide is used, which in finished form forms a five-centimeter bar. </p><p>  A feature of the traditional female model is the length of the product, which is usually done 20 cm more than it is necessary for growth. </p><h2>  Sleeve pattern </h2><p>  The sleeves are also cut out in the form of rectangles, however, in the traditional dress, these are not narrow narrow sleeves familiar to everyone, strictly on the hand, but rather very wide and corner-sewn elements with a hole for the wrist in the upper corner.  The entrance to the sleeve is also in the upper corner on the other side of the rectangle.  At the same time, the sleeve is sewn into the kimono base not in a full cut, but only in half, and the large side of the sleeve folded in half does not fall on the side of the hand, but on the hanging edge.  And the remaining open edges are sutured with a corner.  Thanks to this, a special look is obtained, which distinguishes the Japanese kimono from others that are similar in cut outfits. </p>

    <p>  Another cut of the sleeve for a kimono is based on a trapezoid, the top of which forms a narrow sleeve, and the bottom is maximally expanded. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Slice Processing Options </h2><p>  What is the best way to process products?  Are there any special secrets and will any special skills and knowledge be required?  Perhaps, even a beginner can easily cope with such a task.  You can sew a Japanese kimono with your own hands, if you only have a straight-line sewing machine, or using overlock seams.  However, the simplest option is the processing of slices with a two-turn turn and stitching of parts <span>with a linen seam.</span>  This assembly method saves processing time, thread consumption and makes the seams more durable.  And he is also good for being suitable both for silk and cotton, as well as for chiffon and satin. </p>

    <p>  If you have an overlock on hand, then it can also be used to process slices.  With its help it will be possible to sew and overcast all parts in one step, without laying additional lines. </p><h2>  Fabric selection </h2><p>  A person who knows Japanese culture will easily say that there are several varieties of kimono.  There are models specifically for married and unmarried girls, men and children, wedding ceremonies and just for publication for any reason.  But if there is no need to delve into such subtleties, then you can use absolutely any material you like for sewing the product.  Japanese girls in kimonos in the photo from the Web are usually dressed in an outfit with floral motifs.  Quite often, colorful fabric is combined with contrasting plain or materials are selected with a sophisticated and delicate pattern, a smooth transition of the background shade from saturated and bright to translucent, barely perceptible.  It is such models that can be taken as the main source in the manufacture of a beautiful kimono.  Japanese women's attire must have a wide belt, and for him, as a rule, take a plain fabric.  It can be in tone with the main canvas or, conversely, become a bright accent. </p>

    <h2>  Dressing </h2><p>  To make the product more effective, it can be sewn multilayer.  It all depends on the purpose of the kimono.  Japanese women's attire can be very modest or, conversely, provocative, and not only color plays an important role here, but also the length and transparency of the canvas used.  Naturally, you should not miss the opportunity to make small design digressions and sew a product from guipure or seductive chiffon.  But here again, one should remember the purpose of the outfit. </p><p>  Japanese kimono for girls can be decorated with various lace and satin ribbons.  Also, a favorite decorative element in the clothes of Japanese women is the large bows on the back, which are attached to the belt. </p><h2>  Wide belt for kimono </h2><p>  A traditional Japanese kimono must have a wide belt.  In more modern models, especially for the home, this part is disregarded and a regular gown belt is used.  But if you need to achieve an impressive image, this element is required.  To stitch it, you need two strips of fabric with a waist about 30 cm wide, Velcro that is matching in color and equal to the width of the belt, as well as a fabric sealant such as non-woven.  However, this option is simplified.  In traditional models, the belt is wound around the waist two or three times and does not fasten, but simply tuck the edge under the bottom layer.  After they tie a thin ribbon over the belt and another piece of fabric is curled behind the belt.  However, for a home-made version, such a kimono is hardly a good solution.  In constant motion, such a belt will constantly weaken.  Therefore, if accurate reproduction by centuries of an established image is not required, these elements can be omitted. </p><h2>  Baby kimono </h2><p>  Japanese kimono, the pattern of which is described above, can be a great option for a New Year's outfit for a girl.  And if you fantasize a little and make it a little longer than a shirt, and then complement it with a multi-layer skirt-sun from the same fabric, an original outfit will come out.  On the hem of the skirt, as well as on the neck and cuffs, you can put on beautiful lace, put on a contrasting wide belt with a large bow on the back, pick up a chic wig with black hair, and a real Japanese woman will be ready to go out. </p>

    <p>  A traditional Japanese outfit for a child differs from an adult solely in size.  For girls, the same fabrics are selected as for women, and for boys, kimonos are made the same as for men.  To create a pattern, the following measurement should be taken as the basis: back width - 40 cm. </p><p>  But the boys today need a kimono unless for a fight.  In this case, you should choose a pattern without a hanging sleeve.  Its length is slightly longer than the line of the hips.  For a complete set, ordinary pants are sewn on an elastic band from the same fabric. </p>

    <h2>  Japanese kimono these days </h2><p>  Naturally, the Japanese traditional outfit will be appreciated only in its homeland.  But lovers of this culture often use this piece of clothing for home hanging out.  That is why the version of the classic Japanese kimono has somewhat changed.  More and more often on the market there are kimono robes with one-piece sleeves, the usual thin belt and internal fixation.  Of course, we can say that such an outfit has nothing to do with the national clothes of the Japanese, but for the home, it is more convenient not to find an option.  Therefore, when sewing, you can slightly deviate from the written instructions and simplify the model. </p>
