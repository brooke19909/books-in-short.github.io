  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How, where and how much do they make a Sberbank card?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sberbank provides its customers with debit cards with different rates.  Some are more expensive, but due to this they have a larger limit for transactions, it is possible to store money in any currency and convert.  Others are cheaper to maintain, respectively, they already have a small limit on the transfer of funds, withdrawals and balances, work with only one currency (usually with the state currency of the country where the account is issued). </p><p>  Also, debit cards are divided into registered and instant.  Cards also have different rates, and there is a difference in how much a Sberbank card is made. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crypto-economy.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank cryptocurrency" class="if uuid-2432798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/83287/2432798.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get a Sberbank card? </h2><p>  Receiving a debit bank card is a fairly simple process, providing for two options for registration. </p><p>  The most popular way to get a card is to contact the nearest contact office of the company.  In this case, the specialist must provide: </p><ul><li>  Passport, or a document confirming the right to reside in the country and a document on temporary registration. </li><li>  If a citizen who wants to open an account changes his name, patronymic or last name after coming of age, you must also provide a document confirming the change in the personal data of the future card holder.  Women who change their last name must be provided with a marriage or divorce certificate. </li><li>  A completed questionnaire that an office worker will issue when issuing an invoice. </li></ul><p>  Sberbank provides its customers with the opportunity to choose a card design, therefore, during paperwork, a specialist will offer you to choose the individual design of the front side of the plastic card.  In this case, it is possible to choose a free design or your own, but for an additional fee. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A less popular, so far only developing, method of issuing a card involves filling out an application for opening an account with the provision of plastic on the official website of Sberbank.  In this case, all registration will take place on the network, so when you receive the card you will need to have only a passport with you. </p><p>  Sberbank instant card is issued only in the branches of this organization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="b2blogger.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="High-tech Sberbank" class="if uuid-2431235" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/83287/2431235.jpg"></div><h2>  How to change the card of Sberbank? </h2><p>  For the replacement of a name card, a reason is important.  There are several possible options: </p><ul><li>  Card expired.  In this case, by the time the old card expires, the new card will already be in the office where the previous one was issued.  Thus, you can change the card at any time in a couple of minutes and not try to figure out the most convenient time to change the card, wondering how much Sberbank card is made of? </li><li>  Other situations: loss of the card, including due to the fault of the bank (jammed ATM), damage to the card, change of name of the account holder.  In such situations, the question of how much a Sberbank card is made is more relevant than ever, since it will be possible to get a new card in at least 10 working days, sometimes the wait is delayed for a month.  In such situations, bank employees may offer to issue an instant card, which can really make it easier to wait for a name card. </li></ul><p>  In order to <span>replace the Sberbank card,</span> you need to write an application for a new card and indicate the reason that prevented the use of the old one. </p><p>  The bank also replaces non-registered plastic at the request of the holder. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lider.media" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Office" class="if uuid-2431241" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/83287/2431241.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to get a card? </h2><p>  Plastic employees are engaged in the issuance of plastic, located directly in the branches of Sberbank.  Thus, you can get a card only at the office of the company and in no other place. </p><p>  Where can I get a Sberbank card if I can‚Äôt come to the bank‚Äôs office on my own? </p><p>  Opportunities to arrange home delivery or work is not provided.  Instead of a citizen who has filled out an application for a card, a representative of the account holder can pick it up with a power of attorney and a passport issued by a notary. </p><h2>  How long does the procedure take? </h2><p>  The procedure for obtaining a card takes 10-30 minutes if an instant issue of non-registered plastic is issued, and 10-30 days in case of issue or reissue of a registered card.  Only a bank employee who knows the situation of a client can say exactly how much a Sberbank card is made. </p>
