In Greece, three whales of island recreation - Crete, Rhodes and Corfu.  In Spain, these are the Canary Islands, located 1,200 kilometers from the mainland and surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.  The article provides information about the best vacation spots and amazing beaches in the resorts of the islands. </p><h2>  Location and climate of the islands </h2><p>  The Canary Islands are located in the Atlantic Ocean, in southwestern Spain and northwestern Africa, off the coast of Morocco.  They are an archipelago of 7 fairly large islands (Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, Tenerife, La Palma, Homer and Hierro) and several small islands. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="28.29156369999999" data-lng="-16.629130400000008" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="7"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/7/5/1/7751.png"></div><p>  Each island differs from each other in landscape and coastal sand strip.  An ideal island climate has temperature fluctuations of not more than 6 ¬∞ C during the off-season, which allows you to relax on them all year round.  In February, the temperature does not fall below +21 ¬∞ C, and in the hottest months of summer (July-August) it does not rise above +28 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  Canary Islands - the best vacation </h2><p>  Such natural conditions are a fundamental factor to come back to the Canary Islands of Spain for resorts.  Many tourists prefer to relax here, especially in winter, and, of course, recommend their friends to relax on the islands.  Accessibility to this center of European tourism plays an important role.  Flying is several hours from European cities, and you are already on the magnificent beaches with the warm sea and exotic subtropical landscapes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.samaratour.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean" class="if uuid-2736166" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2736166.jpg"></div><p>  The most visited by tourists islands with a variety of leisure and entertainment are Tenerife and Gran Canaria.  For a more relaxing and romantic holiday, tourists choose Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. </p><p>  The Canary Islands are internationally renowned for their exceptional stargazing.  From all the islands you can see many constellations, but it is in La Palma and Tenerife that there are two international astronomical observatories, whose work is associated with the study of stars. </p><h2>  Tenerife </h2><p>  Tenerife is the largest and most popular island of the archipelago at a tourist level.  In Tenerife there are many offers of all kinds of holidays for any category of tourists.  The island has the most developed tourist infrastructure.  The best children's resorts of the Canary Islands are located in the southern part of Tenerife with the most gorgeous beaches.  In winter, families from the cold European continent come to these children's resorts.  There is a resort on the island of Playa de Las Americas with a magnificent park of water attractions.  It is interesting for both children and adults.  But the resort is somewhat noisy, since it is here that a fun nightlife takes place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="destinia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apartment Parque Santiago III - IV" class="if uuid-2738034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2738034.jpg"></div><p>  During the day, you can relax on the beach, spend time in the pools of your hotel or enjoy water sports.  If you can‚Äôt sleep at night, you can go to bars or clubs to dance and have fun.  The cultural program offered by travel agencies includes visits to Loro and Teide parks, the Guimar pyramids and the cathedrals of the island. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Gran canaria </h2><p>  The second in the Canary Islands archipelago is Gran Canaria, or "continent in miniature."  That is how tourists who were on vacation characterize it.  The nature of this island is diverse: volcanoes, mountain peaks, forested, and deep ravines.  The coastal strip of the island in the south has coasts with sandy beaches, the northern part is indented with small bays with overhanging volcanic rocks and azure-colored water. </p><p>  The best resorts of the island have the opportunity to relax on the beach, diving, spearfishing, fishing, tennis or golf.  Maspalomas Resort gives tourists the opportunity to experience the underwater world of the Atlantic Ocean. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.just-gran-canaria.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Diving School in Gran Canaria" class="if uuid-2738042" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2738042.jpg"></div><p>  Moreover, you can not only admire its beauties, but also if you want to hunt for its inhabitants.  You can also go diving in the resorts of Playa del Ingles. </p><p>  The cultural program offers excursions to places you should not miss - these are the natural monument of Roque Nublo, Pico de las Nieves, the Botanical Garden or the Caldera de Bundama. </p><h2>  Starry sky over the Canaries </h2><p>  If you intend to relax with children in the Canary Islands, the resort of Caleta de Fuste is ideal for a relaxing relaxation on the island of Fuerteventura in the Atlantic Ocean.  The resort is just seven kilometers from the airport.  In addition to the golden sandy beach, protected from waves and currents, Caleta de Fuste is a place where you can get a new experience by going on a diving excursion or one of the golf courses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Tourists who are interested in the starry sky can take an unusual excursion to Mount Daegu, where from the 669-meter height you can enjoy the night sky of the Canary Islands.  Many tourists who visited the top of the mountain and saw with binoculars a group of newborn M52 stars between Cepheus and Cassiopeia share their impressions with enthusiasm.  The stories about this amazing discovery upon returning from the tour are long enough. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holaislascanarias.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Star Observation - Fuerteventura" class="if uuid-2738101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2738101.jpg"></div><p>  La Palma is one of the most important islands in terms of astronomy that can be found in the world.  Its geographical location and environment make it one of the best places to watch stars.  Perhaps it is because of this that most of the tourism is associated with this feature. </p><p>  But La Palma, like all the islands of the archipelago, offers ideal places for relaxation and enjoyment of the sea.  Santa Cruz - one of the best resorts of the island, opens the door for tourists, delighting them with excellent hotels and recreational activities. </p><h2>  La Gomera </h2><p>  A very popular island thanks to the Garajonay Natural Park, which is considered a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Amazing jungle of constant greenery that emerges from the fog - this fantastic image will meet tourists on <span>an unusual tour</span> of the Garahonai Nature Park in the Canary Islands.  The park got its name from the top of Garakhonai, the highest point of the island - 1,487 m. </p><p>  In addition, the landscapes and access to the pristine nature of the area are tourist attractions.  Garakhonai National Park is a meeting with nature, which takes you to the distant past.  Hiking is the most popular practice on the island. </p><div class="photo" data-original="warps.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays at La Gomera" class="if uuid-2738164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2738164.jpg"></div><p>  But the beaches of La Gomera are ideal for relaxing and sunbathing.  In the idyllic Valle Gran Rey Valley there is a small village with small hotels, apartments and pensions.  For several years it has been a center of alternative tourism.  In its vicinity, I like to relax for the category of travelers who want to temporarily leave civilization and live among the beauty and tranquility of nature. </p><h2>  El hierro </h2><p>  A beautiful island that hosts thousands of tourists every year.  According to experts, this island is one of the best places in the world for diving on the beautiful sea bottom, observing the environment rich in views, which will make the vacation of tourists unforgettable.  But diving is not the only activity that <span>travel agencies</span> on the island provide.  The recreation program is extensive: tours of the natural landscapes, visits to natural nearby volcanoes, hiking in the forest and nature reserves. </p><h2>  Holidays in Greece </h2><p>  Resorts of cities on the islands of Greece are no less picturesque and attractive for tourists.  There are more than 450 of them. Here is a real paradise for travelers.  Each of the islands is a kind of architecture, mythology and generous Greek hospitality.  Those who are used to relaxing in hotels by the sea will be pleased with the offers of the best resorts on the islands: St. Nicolas Bay in Crete, Lindos Blue in Rhodes and Delphino Blue on Corfu. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.athinorama.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rhodes Island" class="if uuid-2739792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2739792.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the usual relaxation by the sea, diving and visiting attractions, travel agencies offer a modern type of recreation - ecotourism.  Greece, with its 11th largest coastline in the world, mountains and hills covering 80% of the territory, is glad ecotourists.  During walks, as well as the history of mankind in ancient temples and castles. </p><h2>  Crete </h2><p>  Crete is the largest island in Greece and the fifth largest in the Mediterranean Sea.  This is a small universe full of natural beauties and historical places.  Variety of landscapes, steep gorges, endless beaches, turquoise waters and magnificent natural environment impress visitors to Crete.  Resorts of the island like to visit Europeans.  Many families come with their children to the St. Nicolas Bay Hotel.  From the landscaped gardens of this hotel you can enjoy magnificent views of Mirabell Bay.  The resort is ideal for families, but water sports fans will not be bored here! </p><div class="photo" data-original="itravelling.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Nicholas Bay, Crete" class="if uuid-2739680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2739680.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most <span>beautiful places</span> in Greece is the eastern region of Crete.  <span>The resort city of</span> Agios Nicholas is located at the end of the deep Mirabell Bay.  In the center of the city there is a very deep (64 meters) beautiful lake, connected to the sea by a canal.  The Greeks call it bottomless. </p><p>  Near Agios Nicholas is another famous resort of Elounda.  Here you can stay in luxurious hotels built along a beautiful rocky coast with bays and caves.  From Agios Nicholas to the east, tourist centers, archaeological sites and beaches with golden sands and crystal clear waters follow each other on the north coast. </p><h2>  Corfu Island </h2><p>  Corfu island is called by the Greeks Kerkyra.  The second most populated island in Greece.  It has about 220 km of coastline.

The most popular are the nearby seaside resorts of the island of Rhodes: Ixia, Ialysos, Kallithea, Faliraki.  Rhodes is popular with lovers of luxury resorts and family vacations, as well as those who want to combine beach holidays with car excursions and sightseeing, from the valley with butterflies and baths of Kallithea to Filerimos Hill and ancient Camiro, or with intense nightlife and cosmopolitanism. </p><p>  If you love the sea, Rhodes will reward you.
