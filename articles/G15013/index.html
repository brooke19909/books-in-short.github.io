    <h2>  About smartphone </h2><p>  Sales of Fly IQ4403 started in the second half of 2013.  For the price, this device was positioned as an entry-level smartphone.  It contains support for the most commonly used functions and applications (radio, music, movies and simple games).  But here you can not expect phenomenal performance, a large screen diagonal or a lot of installed gigabytes of memory.  But at the same time there are nuances that distinguish it against the background of similar mobile phones.  The situation is similar with disadvantages.  Here, too, could not have done without them.  But here the democratic price essentially eliminates them.  To this, it is worth adding the initial positioning of the device by the manufacturer itself - this is a budget-level smartphone.  There are those tasks for which the phone is adapted, and it simply copes with them ‚Äúperfectly‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The computing heart of the Fly IQ4403 is MediaTek's 6572 model CPU. Its clock speed is 1.3 GHz.  It was manufactured according to the 32 nm manufacturing process and in this regard is not inferior even to the flagship solutions of other manufacturers.  All CPUs of the AWP architecture are made precisely with such technological standards.  It consists of two cores based on the Cortex A7 architecture.  That is, in the line of processors of this manufacturer it will be less productive than 6577 (2 cores on Cortex A9) and 6582 (4 cores on Cortex A7).  For most modern tasks, its resources will be quite enough.  But if in 1-1.5 years you want to play some serious game, then it will not be enough.  Already, there are games that are beyond the power of Fly IQ4403 Energie 3 CPUs. The feedback from its owners is additional confirmation of this.  For movies, music, navigation and Skype communication, its performance will be enough.  Moreover, the situation in this regard in the foreseeable future will not exactly change. </p>

    <h2>  Graphics adapter </h2><p>  Phone Fly IQ4403 Energie 3 has a graphics system, which is implemented on the Mali adapter model 400 MP.  It should be noted right away that, like the processor, you should not expect phenomenal results from it.  Its resources will be enough for films, simple games, music, browsing the Internet and reading books.  But in the case when it will be necessary to run a resource-intensive application on this smartphone, its capabilities may not be enough. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Graphic system </h2><p>  The review will be incomplete if you overlook the remaining components of the graphics subsystem.  The screen size of this device is 4.5 inches.  That is, it is easily placed in the hand, but at the same time it remains possible to control the thumb of this hand.  The screen resolution is 864 pixels in height by 480 pixels in width, while their density is 240 DPI.  According to this indicator, the Fly IQ4403 Energie 3 phone is ahead of its main competitors, in which this indicator is worse.  But the type of matrix used in this model leaves much to be desired.  In this case, it is a TFT, which is both morally and physically obsolete.  Therefore, large viewing angles and high-quality images on its screen can not be expected.  Another important point.  This device can simultaneously handle five touches - another plus in comparison with analogs, which in most cases only two tachas are supported. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Only one camera is present in the Fly IQ4403 Energie 3 smartphone. The instruction indicates that it is based on 5 megapixels.  It lacks autofocus.  Additionally installed LED backlight.  But all the same, getting with it a great shot in the dark will certainly not work.  You can record video in HD format with a resolution of 1280 pixels in height by 720 pixels in width.  Also implemented digital zoom.  In the device itself, several modes of operation of this camera are programmatically implemented.  This is a big plus Fly IQ4403 Energie 3. The instruction indicates the presence of the following modes: auto, night, sport, landscape, portrait.  <span>There is no front camera</span> in this gadget.  Therefore, to fully communicate, for example, in ‚ÄúSkype‚Äù or ‚ÄúMail.ru Agent‚Äù will not work.  The maximum that can be achieved is that the interlocutor will see you, but you are not, or vice versa.  As a result, to communicate via Skype using a smartphone, you will have to buy a more expensive device in which two cameras are installed at once. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  RAM </h2><p>  RAM is the weak side of the Fly IQ4403 Energie 3. The reviews only confirm this.  In total, 512 MB or 0.5 GB of the DDR3 standard is installed in this device.  Now this is really not enough for the full operation of many applications.  The situation will be even worse if you try to immediately launch them at about 10. Then the smartphone simply starts to ‚Äúslow down‚Äù.  But not everything is so bad on this side of the Fly IQ4403 Energie 3. Setting it up in a special way and installing additional applications (for example, the "Wedge Master") makes it easy to solve this problem.  But still, the owners of this gadget will have to monitor the amount of free random access memory more often than if 1 GB of RAM were integrated on it.  But this drawback also arises from the installed MTK 6572 central processor, which is not capable of addressing more than 512 MB, which means it is impossible to put more into such a system. </p><h2>  Built-in memory and expansion options </h2><p>  The built-in memory in this smartphone, like in other models based on MTK 6572, is only 4 GB.  At the same time, the user is allocated 2 GB for his needs, and 800 MB is provided for the installation of applications.  The rest of this resource is occupied by the operating system.  With a reasonable approach, this is enough to solve most problems in the next two years.  But the characteristics of the Fly IQ4403 Energie 3 will not be complete, if you do not take into account another important factor.  It has a slot for installing microSD memory cards up to 32 GB in size.  This is enough to store a lot of movies, music and other important information on your smartphone.  It is important only to save them on this drive, and not in the internal memory of IQ4403.  To fulfill this condition, you need to correctly configure the smartphone settings. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The Fly IQ4403 Energie 3 battery has a capacity of 4000 milliamperes / hour.  It will be enough for 2 days of active use.  But with maximum energy saving, the capacity is enough for 9 days.  So for this parameter, this smartphone in its class is one of the best, if not the best.  Not every more expensive device can boast of such autonomy, not to mention the segment of budget solutions, where savings are felt in every detail.  Therefore, if this characteristic is very important for you, then you can safely opt for IQ4403, and it will fully meet your expectations. </p>

    <h2>  Acoustics </h2><p>  To output audio signals, the IQ4403 provides only one speaker.  The sound quality is not the best.  Occasionally, the appearance of noise and "wheezing".  But at the same time its volume is at an acceptable level.  Therefore, the probability of missing an important phone call or SMS is reduced to zero.  So here at Energie 3, everything is not so bad with the sound quality as it might seem at first glance. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  A sufficiently large set of communications is implemented in this device.  First of all, it is worth noting Wai-Fai, whose speed can reach a decent 150 Mbit / s.  At this speed, a high quality movie will load in minutes.  Also there is bluetooth version 4.0.  To organize navigation, a ZhPS transmitter is installed.  It will allow you to determine your location anywhere in the world.  You can connect to the computer using the USB cable Fly Energie 3 IQ4403.  A driver is not needed.  It is enough to select the desired mode on the smartphone screen, and the PC will independently find the necessary software and install it.  The supported version of USB in this case is 2.0.  To connect an external speaker system, a standard 3.5 mm audio jack is provided, which is displayed on the bottom of the smartphone.  It is located next to the microphone.  Not a very convenient solution, since it is with this part that most subscribers put their smartphone in a case.  If this is done inaccurately, then you can break the stereo headset connected to the device.  To install SIM cards, it has two standard size slots (it is also called Microsim).  The first of them, among other things, allows you to work in networks standard 3ZH.  That is, it is possible to <span>transfer data</span> at speeds up to 3.15 Mbit / s.  This will be quite enough for comfortable work on the Internet, and you can even make video calls.  But the lack of a front camera negatively affects this possibility.  Either you will see the interlocutor, or he will see you.  The second slot works only in 2G format, and the speed here is much lower.  The maximum is a few hundred kilobytes, at which web resources will open for a long time.  Therefore, when installing SIM cards, such a nuance must be taken into account without fail. </p><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  This device is presented in two color options.  The first of these is Fly IQ4403 Energie 3 black.  Black color is official.  This design is more oriented to men.  In addition, black is not so noticeable pollution.  But the second color version is Fly IQ4403 Energie 3 white.  As such, it will appeal to the weak half of humanity.  At the same time, do not forget that the white color simply attracts dirt.  But given how neat women and girls are, they shouldn't have a problem with that.  The front of the Fly IQ4403 Energie 3 black or white is made of ordinary plastic.  High resistance to the appearance of possible contaminants such a coating can not boast.  As a result, a protective film in this case simply cannot be dispensed with.  At the same time, the appearance of the model is very similar to the 4th generation of smartphones from Apple.  At the top of the smartphone are light and proximity sensors.  To organize the control, three buttons are displayed on the front panel: ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù.  The back of the smartphone is made of polymer plastic.  Such a coating is resistant to mechanical damage and holds firmly in the hand.  That is, this phone does not seek to slip out of your hands.  But at the same time, the dirt and dust on the back wall of such a smartphone simply attracts you.  This is more noticeable on white.  Cover - a bumper made of rubber, it will not be superfluous.  The back panel also needs protection, and better than using it, this will not work.  Here you can already feel the identity of the company "Fly", and this gadget can not be confused with anything.  Case dimensions 134.5 mm in height and 67 mm in width.  At the same time, the weight of this device is 183 g. It seems to be a lot.  But if you pay attention to the <span>battery capacity,</span> then everything falls into place.  The thickness of IQ4403 is 12.83 mm.  Too much, but this is not the flagship model from this manufacturer.  Therefore, there is nothing wrong with that either.  These are classic sizes for devices with a diagonal of 4.5 inches.  On one side of the case there are two buttons that allow you to adjust the volume of the audio signal.  On the other hand, the on / off button is displayed.  They all perform well.  Feeling them with your finger is not difficult. </p>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The given <span>characteristics of Fly IQ4403</span> Energie 3 allow us to say with confidence that its resources are quite enough for most everyday tasks of undemanding users.  With calls and receiving or sending SMS / MMS, he will do just fine.  You can also surf the Internet without any problems.  For these purposes, all the necessary modules are installed in it: 3Zh, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.  Watch a video (for these purposes it is best to install the Mix Player), listen to music (VinAmp is recommended), read a book (you need the "Ebook Reader" from the Google Market), play simple, undemanding games - all this is possible with this smartphone.  But serious and demanding applications will not work on it.  And this must be taken into account at the selection stage.  Its computing power will be enough for the next two years.  Then it will become just a dialer for two SIM cards with a large battery capacity.  But the applications that previously ran on it and worked great, will continue to function.  We can say that this is a smartphone ‚Äúfor now‚Äù.  And this must be understood. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  As the basic operating system in this smartphone installed "Android" version 4.2.2.  Its code name is "Jelly Bean."  This is not the latest version.  But it is quite enough to solve most problems today.  But not only one modification 4.2.2 is limited to the list of operating systems for Fly IQ4403 Energie 3. The firmware allows you to install more recent versions of Android.  You can put both a proprietary operating system, and from third-party developers.  In the latter case, the warranty is violated, and in case of malfunctions, repairs and maintenance will have to be paid.  Therefore, with the installation of such software, you need to be careful and study the reviews in advance.  And only if there are positive reviews to install it on a smartphone.  Otherwise, you can completely disable the gadget, and then it will be difficult to repair it. </p><h2>  Software part </h2><p>  The operating system itself is installed in its pure form, without add-ons, on the Fly Energie 3 IQ4403.  Social network applications are in the basic configuration.  First of all, these are Facebook, VKontakte and Odnoklassniki.  In addition, a fairly large list of applications from the Russian search engine Yandex has been installed.  This is both a browser and maps for navigation.  For proper design on the device, a sufficiently large set of colorful and bright wallpapers has been installed.  For the rest, a clean ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù version 4.2 with the code name ‚ÄúJelly Bean‚Äù is installed on Fly IQ4403 Energie 3. The programs that are needed in the process of using the device can be obtained from Google Play.  To do this, just register an account in this American search engine.  Then use the appropriate shortcut and go to the software supermarket.  Download it and install it on your smartphone.  Now about the movies.  As 1080 r, they are difficult to reproduce.  Perhaps even a slight slowdown.  With lower resolution and quality there are no problems at all.  Everything moves smoothly and can be scrolled.  To watch the video, it is recommended to install a player such as Mix Player. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The package bundle of this smartphone does not stand out against the background of similar devices.  The box is black.  In addition to the smartphone, there is a battery with a capacity of 4000 milliamps / hours (this advantage of this device has been previously noted), a <span>warranty card</span> and an instruction manual.  In this regard, we get a standard set of Fly IQ4403 Energie 3. The accessories that come with this smartphone are as follows: a charger (sometimes called an adapter) with a detachable USB cable (it can also be used to connect to a personal computer, like most of the same devices) and budget headphones (you should not expect phenomenal sound from them).  The first of them does not make sense - it works, and that‚Äôs enough.  It is great for charging and connecting to a PC.  But headphones are recommended to buy better ones.  Especially for those who like good sound.  This will not allow to completely solve the problem with the speaker system, but it will turn out to improve the sound.  This accessory cuts off the low frequencies, and it is very hard of hearing. </p>
