Probably an incorrect question, but for those who work closely with these amazing animals, it is quite natural.  In the Miami Dolphinarium, once there was just a fantastic event that turned the eyes of many scientists.  A lot of interesting things are happening at the dolphinarium in Nebug, a small resort town near Tuapse.  But first things first. </p>

    <h2>  Case in Miami </h2><p>  On average, to prepare a dolphin for a professional performance, you need to spend a year, or even one and a half painstaking daily work.  But in Miami, an event happened once that shocked the trainers themselves, who managed to get to know their smart pets well.  Several dolphins were delivered to the aquarium, which had yet to be prepared for future performances.  The animals were adapted to the conditions of the dolphinarium, so they were immediately placed in the same pool with the "old men" who knew and knew everything. </p><p>  Together they spent only one night, however, very noisy.  Whistling, creaking, clicking - the sounds characteristic of dolphins - did not stop even for a minute.  The next morning forced people to completely reconsider their attitude to marine mammals, because all newcomers performed the new tricks the first time no worse than experienced artists.  Just imagine, all night they ‚Äúshared‚Äù their knowledge and experience with their newly arrived brethren and taught! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Many interesting stories can tell and trainers from the dolphinarium in Nebug.  Their artists - dolphins Petrovich, Gosha and Yasha, the fur seal Tom and the sea lioness Alice - have been living here for many years and have become heroes of many interesting stories. </p><h2>  Nebug - a tourist paradise by the Black Sea </h2><p>  Located near Tuapse, Nebug becomes a place of attraction for tourists there.  Attracts them a lot.  For example, beautiful nature - 15 km of beaches abutting coniferous forests with valuable tree species.  Even in the heat, the air is saturated with useful essential oils of pine needles, the smell of which is mixed with the aroma of the sea. </p>

    <p>  The <span>sights of Nebug</span> also include a group of dolmens in the valley of the Nebug River and a cascade of waterfalls, the most important of which, Blue, is located in a beautiful shallow gorge.  It is called so because the water in the pond below seems completely blue due to the bottom covered with clay of the same color. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  From the history of Nebug </h2><p>  It begins in 1864, when fifty Cossacks left the ship with their families and arranged a parking near the seashore.  By the time the October Revolution arrived, the settlement had turned into a full-fledged village, which was part of the Black Sea province.  Today, Tuapse district is included in it, Nebug is part of it and the administrative center of a rural settlement, in which up to 4 thousand people constantly live. </p>

    <p>  In fact, the history of these lands begins much earlier.  Dolmens made of bronze and copper, found 13 km from Nebug, told historians about the Adyghe tribes who settled here in ancient times.  To look at these historical monuments in the Nebug River valley, you need to join an excursion - it is difficult to get there on your own.  For lovers of antiquity, dolmens are just a find - very impressive when you touch a thing done many thousands of years ago. </p><p>  However, most tourists come to Nebug to the dolphinarium to admire the marine mammals that are legendary about.  Who has not heard of the amazing cases when dolphins saved a person‚Äôs life?  True, trainers are a little disappointing - dolphins do not save a person out of a sense of compassion.  They are just by nature very curious and love to play, so they are trying to take a closer look at something new, and simultaneously push a person to the surface. </p><h2>  Dolphinarium Aqua World in Nebug </h2><p>  It was opened in 2003 along with the water park, which is why they called it ‚ÄúDolphin‚Äù.  For tourists who rest in Tuapse, it is most convenient to get here, because the distance between Tuapse and Nebug is only 15 km.  Most visitors to the dolphinarium and water park are just vacationers from Tuapse. </p>

    <p>  Very nice highlight of the place - at the exit all visitors are offered free ice cream.  It is clear that it is free of charge conditionally, since its cost is included in the ticket price.  But it‚Äôs still nice to get such a sign of attention from the administration. </p><h2>  The artistic composition of the troupe </h2><p>  The dolphinarium in Nebug is inhabited by wonderful artists, among which there are three bottlenose dolphins.  Petrovich is considered to be the main one in this company; no one disputes his leadership.  Wayward and serious, he scrupulously monitors the order on his territory.  The pride of trainers is the Yasha dolphin, performing the most difficult tricks.  He perfectly understands this and accepts with pleasure the manifestations of love that he gets.  Judging by the reviews, Yasha is really a universal favorite.  The much more complex character of the Goshi dolphin is bright, a little quick-tempered and very extraordinary.  You have to look for a special approach to it, but if you find it, then Gosha is able to work real miracles. </p>

    <p>  The Aqua World Dolphinarium in Nebug would be less interesting if only dolphins lived in it.  Tom, a fur seal, mysterious and artistic, great dilutes the male company - judging by the reviews, visitors especially love her for some extravagance and emotionality. </p><p>  The girls team is led by a sea lioness Alice, who arrived from South Africa.  She is an old-timer of the dolphinarium in Nebug and the most experienced ‚Äúemployee‚Äù.  Extraordinarily plastic, charming, just beautiful.  Rescues trainers in the most peak situations, because they never lose their temper.  Very calm and balanced lady. </p><h2>  Services and prices </h2><p>  Children under 5 years old can get to the show for free.  For large families and combatants, the administration makes discounts when showing the corresponding document.  For everyone else in the Nebug Dolphinarium, the price is universal - 600 rubles.  Performances are shown every day during the high season, at 11 and 17 hours.  Starting in November, when the flow of tourists is noticeably reduced, daily impressions are canceled, and a new schedule is established, which must be specified immediately before the visit. </p>

    <p>  In addition to the main presentation, additional paid services are offered.  You can <span>swim with dolphins</span> or take part in an art auction selling paintings painted by dolphinarium pets right at the time of the performance.  For those who win the auction, there is another bonus - sailing in a boat, including with children.  Dolphins are allowed to photograph during the performance of tricks, the only thing workers ask for so that the flash is turned off. </p><h2>  How to get to Nebug from Tuapse and from other cities? </h2><p>  With Nebug pretty good transport links.  There are regular bus services from both the nearest villages and from <span>Tuapse, Krasnodar,</span> Gelendzhik.  Of course, it‚Äôs more convenient to take a taxi.  Approximate prices of such a transfer: from Tuapse - from 760 rubles., From Gelendzhik - from 2860 rubles., From Krasnodar - from 3630 rubles.  To get directly to the dolphinarium in Nebug at Novorossiyskoye Shosse, 9B, you do not need to give its exact coordinates - all taxi drivers know very well where it is. </p><h2>  Submission Reviews </h2><p>  Finding reviews about the Dolphinarium Nebug on the net turned out to be quite simple.  Thousands of tourists visit it annually and many of them willingly share their impressions on different sites.  There are practically no negative reviews - both children and adults like the performance and wonderful pets of the dolphinarium. </p>
