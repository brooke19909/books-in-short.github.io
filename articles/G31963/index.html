  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mount Brocken in Germany: photos and descriptions, stories and legends</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each nation has its own mystical traditions and legends.  Most Western European and Baltic peoples have one night a year called Walpurgis.  In these countries, this word is translated in different ways, but the meaning is the same - ‚Äúwitch fire‚Äù.  According to legend, that night witches gather for the Sabbath, conjure, worship dark forces and burn bonfires. </p><p>  There is such a night in Germany, from April 30 to May 1.  Brocken Mountain is inextricably linked with Walpurgis Night. </p><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  This mountain is the highest point of the Harz massif.  Its height is 1140 meters.  Despite its small height, it is the most famous and visited in the whole country. </p><p>  Where is Brocken Mountain located?  In the very center of the state, in the lands of Saxony-Anhalt. </p><p>  However, the mountain gained fame not only because of the legends of the witches' covens, but also because of the special climate, which is completely uncharacteristic of the country as a whole.  On the mountain itself there have been many historically significant events. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.britannica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Brocken Mountain in winter" class="if uuid-2551142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2551142.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The easiest way to the top runs through the city of Wernigerode.  A narrow gauge locomotive called the Mephistopheles Express departs regularly from the local station.  By the way, this is the old steam locomotive that still runs on coal and does not use any electricity in it, all the equipment is mechanical.  There is still a beep before departure and everything in the area is covered in a cloud of smoke.  It seems that you have moved to the 18th century.  Although the cars inside are very comfortable.  1.4 hours to your destination. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the Shirke station, passengers are becoming much smaller.  They go out to walk to the top.  The road to the top runs along the railway tracks.  By the way, at the station "Shirke" there is an opportunity to ride a sleigh that moves on wheels on rails. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.columbus-reisen.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train on the mountain" class="if uuid-2551188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2551188.jpg"></div><p>  The path along Mount Broken runs along a mysterious forest, in some places glades are dotted with stones of different sizes and shapes.  Until today, it is not known how they ended up in these places.  Particularly impressionable travelers feel a chill all over their bodies.  Goethe himself, who used to climb here in the old days, described this forest in his work Faust. </p><p>  And the most interesting thing is that the mountain is shrouded in fog for almost 360 days, so anything can seem in such an environment. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  In the town of Vernigorod near Brocken Mountain in Germany, the infrastructure is well developed, there are hotels, shops and everything necessary for travelers to stay. </p><p>  The city itself has been known since the 9th century; therefore, it preserved the most beautiful ancient architectural monuments, castles and town halls, mainly in the Baroque style, and traditional Prussian architecture.  Although the castle itself is located near the town. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  In the 30s of the last century, a radio transmitter mast appeared on Mount Broken.  Even during World War II, the US military did not bomb it. </p><p>  In Soviet times, the mountain was of strategic importance for the GDR, it housed radio and television broadcasting facilities, respectively, the facility was secret, so there was no access for ordinary citizens. </p><p>  In 1961, access was opened, and the most recent Russian soldier left the facility in 1994. </p><h2>  Optical illusions </h2><p>  In what country is Broken Mountain located?  In Germany, although on the mountain itself, weather conditions are surprising for this country.  Here, almost 300 days a year, a thick fog is kept, and atmospheric temperature makes you dress warmer. </p><p>  The most interesting thing is that on the mountain you can watch the so-called ghost of Broken.  In the daytime, the shadow of the person falls on the fog, because of which the figure seems to be enlarged, stretched up.  The man himself is surrounded by a rainbow aura.  Impressive people are scared almost to death. </p><div class="photo" data-original="keywordsuggest.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Optical illusions on the mountain" class="if uuid-2551147" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2551147.jpg"></div><h2>  Mystic </h2><p>  There is a legend about Mount Brocken in Germany.  First of all, Walpurgis Night is one of the most significant pagan holidays in witchcraft.  For other nations of the world, the holiday is called May Eve or Beltey.  This is the night of April 30 to May 1.  It is believed that on this night, witches gather for the Sabbath, and the holiday itself is dedicated to fertility. </p><p>  The name of the holiday is associated with St. Walpurgia.  She was an English nun who came to Germany in 748 to found a monastery.  The nun was extremely popular and was considered a saint.  Even the Roman calendar has her name.  This day is celebrated on May 1.  Now the holiday is celebrated not only in Germany, but also in the countries of Scandinavia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ibtimes.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern holiday" class="if uuid-2551184" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2551184.jpg"></div><h2>  How did it go </h2><p>  It was believed that on the eve of this night, witches got on their brooms and climbed them to the top.  Witches flew to Broken Mountain and Bald Mountain in Kiev.  So writes, in particular, Montague Summers in his book "History of Witchcraft and Demonology" (1926).  And the peoples of Finland have a legend that on the last day of April not a single mountain in the country remained empty, there were witches everywhere.  And the most important thing that should be near the mountain and on it is a pond and a stone slab-altar. </p><p>  Closer to midnight, everyone was late and, as soon as the clock struck twelve, a black goat appeared - a demon or Prince of Darkness.  But this demonic creature visited only 2 or 3 of the largest Sabbaths, where the most loyal fans of the Prince of Darkness gathered.  Demons with a lower status flew to the remaining gatherings of witches. </p><p>  Then there was a kind of reception of neophytes in the ranks.  After the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù procedure, the Sabbath itself began, accompanied by round dances, the witches circled in a frantic rhythm around the fire. </p><p>  Then everything quickly ended, as soon as the hands on the clock approached 4 in the morning.  And all this ended before the first roosters began to sing.  All witches and demons disappeared. </p><p>  If a stray eyewitness got to such a party, then for him everything ended in failure.  As usual, his life ended under a sacrificial knife.  If the eyewitness managed not to fall under the watchful eyes of the witch, then, most likely, he became crazy.  If this did not happen, then he had to keep his mouth shut throughout his life.  It is believed that for this reason, most of the settlers around Mount Brocken today tightly close the shutters on the windows of their houses.  Some residents of Vernigorod even today prefer to hide in their own house on the night of April 30 to May 01. </p><div class="photo" data-original="troytaylorbooks.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Night story" class="if uuid-2551182" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2551182.jpg"></div><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  Today, few of us believe in witches, especially since they gather for the Sabbath.  Therefore, Mount Brocken has a well-developed infrastructure, there are hotels, hiking trails and excellent communication.  But still it is so nice to plunge into the atmosphere, where everything is shrouded in legend. </p><p>  On the day of Walpurgis Night's celebration, a costume action takes place on the mountain, everyone dances here: both mummers and travelers.  Everything happens around Heksentantsplati, which means ‚Äúplace of witches dancing‚Äù.  This is the oldest boulder where, according to the assumptions of historians and believers, the most interesting things happened, witches gathered and performed rituals.  All the action takes place to the music of the famous group "Ramstein", which is most suitable for such an event. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pizzatravel.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tower on the mountain" class="if uuid-2551151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2551151.jpg"></div><p>  There is a thematic museum on the mountain, where you can learn about the history of this place and how important the mountain was, starting from the time of the Inquisition to the present day. </p><p>  If there is such an opportunity, then be sure to plan your trip at the end of April and visit the mountain on that night, when all the most interesting happens.  Indescribable sensations and a ton of new experiences are surely provided to you! </p>
