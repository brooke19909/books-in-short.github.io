Changes again occurred here, in 1926 he would marry for the third time - Tatyana Bakunina, who held the post of professor <span>at the University of Paris.</span> </p><h2>  Paris fate </h2><p>  Living in Paris, Osorgin retained Soviet citizenship until 1937.  After he lived without official documents, since he did not receive French citizenship. </p><p>  After the outbreak of World War II, Osorgin and his wife fled from occupied Paris and settled in the town of Shabri, not occupied by the Germans.  Here he wrote his last significant works - ‚ÄúLetters of Insignificance‚Äù and ‚ÄúIn a Quiet Place in France‚Äù.

She lives with an elderly relative and in the course of the work turns from a young girl into a young bride. </p><p>  This novel is also called the chronicle.

    <p>  Two main ideas in the work of Mikhail Osorgin are love for the world and craving for the world, at first glance, not the most important and ordinary things. </p><p>  Passion for nature lies at the heart of a series of essays published by Osorgin in The Latest News under the pseudonym Everyman.  They were later released as a separate book, The Incidents of the Green World.  They show deep drama. </p><p>  The second fundamental idea is the enthusiasm of Osorgin for collecting books and collecting.  He owns a huge collection of domestic publications, a detailed list of which is presented in the Notes of the Old Bookworm, as well as in a collection of historical short stories, often criticized by representatives of the monarchist camp.  They appeared in print in 1928-1934.  Critics especially eagerly noted in them a disrespectful attitude towards the imperial family and the leadership of the Orthodox Church. </p><h2>  Pensne </h2><p>  In 1924, in Berlin, in the journal Days, one of the most famous stories was published, authored by Mikhail Andreevich Osorgin, Pensne. </p><p>  The work begins with the statement that every thing in our world lives its own life.  The author actively uses such a technique as impersonation.  With its help, inanimate objects acquire human qualities.  For example, the clock at Osorgin paces and coughs. </p><p>  Another favorite technique of the author is a metaphor.  With its help, he manages to give ordinary household things a special, unique character.  The main character of the story is made by Mikhail Andreevich <span>Osorgin pince-nez.</span>  <span>A summary of the</span> work describes its illustrative history. </p><p>  As evidence that things sometimes live on their own, the author cites cases when household items first suddenly disappear, and then they are also unexpectedly.  This playful proof in Osorgin's interpretation is similar to Murphy's law. </p><p>  As an example, the author cites pince-nez, which disappeared at the most inopportune moment - during reading.  His search gradually grew into a general cleaning of the whole house, but even when all the rooms shone with cleanliness, they could not find a pince-nez. </p><p>  His companion comes to the aid of the narrator.  They approach the matter in detail, draw a plan of the room indicating the places where the pince-nez could be, but all the searches are in vain. </p><p>  In the finals, pince-nez is discovered quite by accident.  Moreover, the very fact of his find is considered by the heroes as a completely natural event. </p><p>  The narrator refers to pince-nez as an animate object that has its own character, needs and lives its own life.  In the end, like any other living thing, pince-nez life comes to an end.  It is dying.  The finale is described very tragically, according to all the canons of the dramatic work.  It died scattering into small fragments. </p><p>  A unique and peculiar approach to the image and understanding of the essence of things makes this story noticeable in the work of Osorgin. </p><h2>  In the camp of the Masons </h2><p>  Starting to live in exile, in 1925 Osorgin participated in the organization of several Masonic lodges, while working under the auspices of the "Great East of France" - one of the oldest Masonic organizations.  He was one of the leaders of the lodges "North Star" and "Free Russia", while holding officer posts.  For example, he was a venerable master. </p><p>  By 1938 he was a member of the chapter - the supreme council of the great collegium of the Ancient and the adopted Scottish charter. </p><p>  He died and was buried in the French city of Chabri in 1942. </p>
