For Russia, this is Borodino and Stalingrad, for France - the lifting of the siege of Orleans, for the Serbs - the battle on the <span>Kosovo field.</span>  A similar role for the Hellenes was played by the Marathon battle.  Summary, causes and consequences of this battle, we will consider below.  Victory in this battle not only allowed the <span>ancient Greeks</span> to defend their independence, but also created conditions conducive to their further unification into a single force against an external threat. </p><h2>  Background to the conflict </h2><p>  In the VI century <span>BC</span> , the largest power of that time, the Persian Empire, was formed in the Near and <span>Middle East</span> .  In a number of wars in a relatively short period of time, she won and conquered such great states as Media, Babylon, Lydia and Egypt.  The Persians also captured numerous Greek city-states located on the territory of <span>Asia Minor</span> in modern Turkey. </p>

    <p>  In 499 BC  e.  these policies revolted against Persian rule.  They were significantly supported by Athens, which by that time, thanks to a number of prominent statesmen who had carried out democratic reforms, began to play the most important political and economic role among all Greek city-states. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But the uprising was still crushed by the Persian army.  And for the Persians themselves, Athens' intervention in the affairs of the empire was a good reason for organizing an expansion into the <span>Balkan Peninsula,</span> which they had long dreamed of capturing. </p><h2>  Start of war </h2><p>  In 492, by order of the Persian king Darius I, Thrace was conquered - a country located at the very borders of Greece.  Then the ruler of the empire sent an ultimatum to all the city-states of Hellas, demanding recognition of his supremacy.  Almost all the policies of Greece, fearing the power of the Persians, humbledly complied with this requirement, with the exception of the freedom-loving Athens and Sparta. </p><p>  Deciding to punish the Athenians for obstinacy, Darius I sent in 490 BC.  e.  for their conquest, an expedition, led by the son of his sister Artafern.  The Persians easily captured the island of Nakosos and landed on Euboea, the island where the city of Eretria, allied with Athens, was located.  During a heavy siege, the troops of Darius managed to capture this policy, taking advantage of the betrayal of some local residents.  The city was subjected to brutal looting, and its inhabitants were enslaved. </p><p>  After that, the Persian forces sailed towards Attica - the Greek region where Athens was located.  There they landed near the small town of Marathon.  It was here that the marathon battle, significant for the Hellenes, took place.  Date September 12, 490 BC  e.  became really significant for them. </p><h2>  Before the battle </h2><p>  As soon as the Athenians learned about the landing of Darius forces near their city, they immediately sent an army to meet them.  This was a very unexpected decision for the Persians, because they thought that the relatively small army of Athens would prefer to keep a siege within the city walls, rather than meet with an enemy larger in numbers in an open field. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  However, the Greeks themselves did not immediately make this decision, even though the inhabitants of Plataeus came to the aid of the Athenians.  But the commander Miltiad managed to convince the supreme commander Callimachus of the need for this step.  His insightful speech convinced other strategists not to wait for the Spartan army, which was soon to come to the rescue, but to start the battle that went down in history as early as the Marathon battle as soon as possible.  The plan was precisely in surprise.  At the general council, the command in the forthcoming battle was entrusted to Miltiad. </p><h2>  Enemy forces </h2><p>  According to historians, the Greek army consisted of 9,000-10,000 Athenians and 1,000 Payites.  The main force of the Hellenic army was the hoplites, organized into a phalanx.  To break such a system, consisting of disciplined and experienced warriors, was extremely difficult.  Hoplites headed by Callimachus were located on the right flank of the Greek army, in the center were warriors from the Athenian phylos of Antiochis and Leontis, under the leadership, respectively, of Aristide and Themistocles, the future hero of the Salamis naval battle, and on the left flank there were a thousand plateaus. </p>

    <p>  The Persian army was much more numerous.  According to experts, it totaled 25,000 foot soldiers and a thousand horsemen.  Although, ancient historians, in order to embellish the Hellenic victory, cite figures of 200 and even 600 thousand people.  But the qualitative composition of the Persian army was much worse than the Athenian one, since it, unlike the monolithic Greek phalanx, consisted of rather scattered units and various tribes.  Not all of them were properly equipped.  In addition, the Hellenes were much more motivated, because they fought for their own freedom and land, in contrast to the Persian warriors who went to war only for the interests of the king. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Battle </h2><p>  The marathon battle began with the swift offensive of the Greeks.  They literally ran them one and a half kilometers from the Persians, although this seems incredible, because the Athenian hoplites were heavily armed warriors. </p>

    <p>  First, the most powerful central part of the Persian army supplanted the units of Phil Antioch and Leontis, and began their pursuit.  But the Hellenic army had rather strong flanks, while the Persians they consisted of weakly organized and poorly armed tribes.  For this reason, in these areas the Athenians and plateau triumphed over the enemy.  But, unlike the Persians, they did not begin to pursue the running enemy, but turned their weapons against the center of the army of Darius.  Thus, the Greeks also managed to achieve a decisive superiority of forces in this sector.  This maneuver panicked the entire Persian army, and it began to flee to its ships. </p><p>  This time the Greeks did not stop the persecution and rushed in pursuit of the enemy, which had completely lost its battle formation.  As a result, in addition to the many killed, 7 Persian ships were captured, and the Greeks completed the Marathon battle with complete victory.  The outline of this momentous battle is located below. </p>

    <h2>  Battle results </h2><p>  The Athenians, together with the inhabitants of Plata, certainly won the Marathon battle.  Miltiada's plan is fully justified.  Serious historians do not have different points of view about this.  But according to the number of deaths, the estimates of specialists vary significantly. </p><p>  But it is justifiable to challenge the figures called almost by the contemporary of those events - Herodotus, due to the lack of an appropriate material and documentary base, no one can.  He speaks of 192 killed Hellenes and 6400 Persians.  Moreover, among the dead Greeks there were such famous personalities as Callimachus and Kinegir. </p><h2>  Running for life </h2><p>  As soon as the Battle of Marathon ended, the Greeks sent the messenger Euclus to Athens with joyful news of triumph.  He was so anxious to please his fellow citizens that he ran 40 kilometers separating the Marathon from his hometown, literally in one breath.  Running into the town square, he informed the residents of the polis about the victory and immediately died of a <span>broken heart.</span> </p>

    <p>  True, the historical reliability of this legend is very doubtful, but one of the most popular athletics disciplines, namely 42.195 km run, is called marathon. </p><h2>  The meaning of the marathon battle </h2><p>  The marathon battle did not put an end to the Persian aspirations to gain a foothold in the Balkans, in particular, to conquer Greece.  It only postponed this plan for 10 years when an even larger army of Xerxes, son of Darius, invaded Hellas.  But it was the memory of this victory that inspired the Hellenes at that time, seemingly hopeless resistance.  The marathon battle showed that even with small forces you can defeat a large but poorly organized army of conquerors. </p><h2>  The memory of the marathon battle </h2><p>  The memory of this victory has not lost relevance for millennia.  Such a significant place in the hearts of the Greeks was occupied by the Marathon battle.  His date was always sacred to the Greeks.  But this battle was significant not only for one people, it was important for the whole world history.  This can be evidenced even by the fact that in any school textbook on ancient history the Marathon battle is highlighted.  Grade 5 in Russian schools must study this topic in the course of history.  Every educated person must know about this event. </p><p>  Now only the obelisk says that in the place where the hill now rises, there was once a marathon battle.  Photos of this memorial sign can be seen below. </p>
