    <p>  Since then, any Rixos hotel has become a place known to many tourists for a comfortable pastime.  Turkey (Kemer, Istanbul, Antalya and other cities invariably attract tourists) is the country with which the world began to get acquainted with this hotel chain, and today the largest number of hotels owned by it is concentrated here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where did the network name come from </h2><p>  The hotel chain received this name not by chance.  The thing is that not far from the famous resort center of Turkey lie the ruins of the ancient city of Perge.  Their "home" is the north-eastern part of the Aksu region, which is part of the territorial composition of Antalya.  According to legend, this ancient city was founded when the Trojan War ended.  The heroes Mopsos and Kalkhas arrived in these places from Argos. </p><p>  In 1953, excavations were carried out at the place where the main Hellenic gate of Perge was located.  Then, inscriptions dated 120-121 were found.  BC, which indicate the colonization by the Greeks of these places at the end of the distant 2000 BC.  Statues were also discovered telling about the glorious heroes who participated in the founding of the city: Mopsos, Kalkhas, Rixos, Labos, Machaon, Leontus and Minyasas.  In honor of one of these brave men, Fettah Taminji named his hotel company. </p><h2>  High Rixos Standards </h2><p>  The basic concept of all Rixos hotels is the slogan ‚ÄúAll inclusive - All Exclusive‚Äù, which means ‚ÄúAll inclusive - Everything exclusive‚Äù in Russian. </p><p>  Any hotel is an upscale and luxurious holiday destination located in popular places and resorts.
