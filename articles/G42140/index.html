This product is quite specific, although it is considered a classic of knitting art.  This is partly due to the simplicity of knitting shawls, because here you do not need patterns, fasteners, necks and sleeves.  On the other hand, simple patterns and patterns are great for everyone, that's why modern shawls are knitted using delicate and rather complex ornaments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet shawls from japanese magazines" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1162395.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  The most common types of shawls </h2><p>  Today, traditional triangular shawls are becoming less common, they have been replaced by more convenient and practical modifications.  Although, if it is necessary to manufacture a product in the classical style, only a triangular shawl will do.  In RuNet, the reputation of the best was received by <span>crocheted shawls</span> from Japanese magazines.  They are valued for their beautiful lace patterns that are knitted from fine yarn.  They are distinguished by a large number of rows and the airiness of the finished product. </p><p>  Products with divergent concentric ornaments also look very impressive.  For their implementation, the craftswomen independently develop schemes or adapt what is available under the friend. </p><p>  So, the types of shawls: </p><ul><li>  Semicircular. </li><li>  Triangular. </li><li>  Shawl scarf (stole). </li><li>  Shawl Cape. </li></ul>

Thanks to this, it is convenient to throw shawls on shoulders over other clothes for beauty or to keep warm. </p><h2>  Half Round Japanese Crochet Fishnet Shawl </h2><p>  At the heart of knitting any type of shawl is either a simple fabric created using one pattern, or a typesetting fabric from separate fragments. </p><p>  A semicircular shawl can be connected by one or the other method.  Below is a diagram of the manufacture of openwork shawls using the pineapple pattern. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shawl openwork scheme" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1162402.jpg" width="397"></div>  Knitting should start from the center and expand the fabric, following the pattern.  Not all rows are shown in this diagram, only the general direction is given here and a method for expanding a circular web is demonstrated.  To knit a shawl of the required size, you should continue to expand until the canvas reaches the desired width.

    <p>  I must say that this pattern is very popular, and the principle of expansion can be used not only for shawls.  One ‚Äúpineapple‚Äù is formed in 15 rows, which means that its size can be suitable for a summer hat, beret, bag, top and other products. </p><h2>  Triangular shawl: knit from the corner </h2><p>  Some crochet shawls from Japanese magazines are pretty simple.  For their manufacture, thin threads and openwork pattern were used.  Knitting of such products starts from the corner and is expanded on each side at an angle of 45 degrees.  As a rule, models and diagrams from Japanese magazines are already compiled as necessary.  The knitter should only follow the instructions.  In the figure below, a shawl connected by an even continuous web from the corner is proposed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="japanese crochet magazine" class="if" height="230" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1162399.jpg" width="320"></div>

When the main triangle is ready, it is tied on two sides with decorative trim, and the third is left flat.  Also, long brushes or a fringe of threads are often attached to the edges of the strapping. </p><p>  This design of the edge is characteristic of many types of shawls.  Sometimes the craftswomen transfer the main decorative element to the harness.  In this case, the main triangular fabric is knitted with a simple net, and patterns or lace fragments are used to make the strapping. </p><h2>  Triangular Shawl: Wide Knit </h2><p>  This type of triangular shawl is knitted according to a technique different from the previous one.  The photo below shows a coral shawl, in the center of which a dividing border is noticeable.  This line is formed by the additions forming the triangle of the shawl. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Japanese crocheted fishnet shawl" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1162398.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Start knitting with several loops and the formation of a small triangle.  Often, expansion is performed only in the center of the canvas (at the top of the triangle), adding loops to form a right angle (90 degrees).  However, if the pattern provides for the formation of not a straight, but sharp angle, then the additions are performed according to the following principle: </p><ul><li>  The addition at the beginning of the row. </li><li>  The formation of an angle (45 degrees) in the center of the canvas, at the top of the triangle. </li><li>  The addition at the end of the row. </li></ul><p>  Many shawls crocheted from Japanese magazines have ready-made schemes for proper expansion.  Hoping to get the same shawl as in the magazine, it is better to follow the instructions of specialists, connecting your common sense in addition.  Violation of the proportions will lead to contraction of the canvas or, conversely, to the formation of quilling. </p><h2>  Shawl-tippet </h2><p>  An even wide shawl can be attributed to the simplest in execution.  Here you only need to correctly calculate the number of loops and be careful throughout the knitting process. </p><p>  Almost all Japanese crochet lace are suitable for knitting even shawls.  The photo below shows a selection of simple ornaments that allow you to quickly and easily make a stole. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="models and schemes from Japanese magazines" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1162397.jpg" width="368"></div><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Japanese crochet lace" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1162396.jpg" width="373"></div>  In addition to these patterns, square or round motifs are suitable for making an even shawl.  The canvas can be composed only of these fragments or connect some other patterns (as in the photo with a blue scarf). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rectangular shawl" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1162403.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  Shawl Shawl </h2><p>  Leafing through a Japanese crochet magazine on the Web, you can come across such an interesting kind of shawls as a shawl-cloak.  These products have a shape closer to a circle.  Sometimes, <span>napkins, tablecloths,</span> umbrellas and other sketches designed for knitting large circular canvases are used as patterns for such shawls. </p><p>  When knitting shawl-wraps, the circle is not closed, it is knitted with returnable, and not circular rows.  Thus, a large canvas is obtained with a ‚Äúcut‚Äù going to the center. </p><p>  Crocheted such shawls from Japanese magazines are worn over the shoulders and placed the loose ends in front.  The center of the shawl is located at the back near the base of the neck.  Such a shawl-cape is more comfortable to wear, it better matches the proportions of the human body and does not move out during walking. </p><p>  The described methods of knitting shawls include only general principles for their manufacture.  There are a lot of options for the implementation of projects and each of them has its own specifics. </p>
