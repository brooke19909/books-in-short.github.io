  <section class="page js-page"><h1>'Probusinessbank'. Reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In 1993, the <span>closed joint-stock company</span> Probusinessbank began its work, and only a little later changed its form of activity to a <span>limited liability company,</span> and today it is known as an open joint-stock company.  In 1998, Probusinessbank launched an active business in the banking services market and began to successfully introduce new technologies for controlling costs, which could be considered innovative at that time.  Not tired of developing all new approaches in the field of customer relations, I developed ‚ÄúProbusinessbank‚Äù reviews of an exclusively positive nature. </p><p>  Due to the fact that non-standard methods of promotion were used in the course of work, for example, the targeted mailing of loan offers, a well-coordinated team managed to reach new, previously unexplored market positions, thereby leaving competing links far behind.  And this is not accidental, because a loan at Probusinessbank is a very profitable way to achieve your goals. </p><p>  Today, the organization includes a number of regional banks: Vuz-Bank in Yekaterinburg and Volga in Saratov.  The Ivanovo Oblast, formerly under the control of local administrative structures, is also preparing to become part of the community soon.  The facts are impressive that among the largest <span>customers of the bank</span> are the International Finance Corporation and the European Bank for Development and Reconstruction.  And the client base includes more than 8,000 organizations, enterprises and 25,000 individuals.  It was for them that Probusinessbank became an excellent assistant in business and solving financial problems.  Reviews from all customers indicate that a better and more reliable partner in business and life is simply impossible to find. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, the bank's work is aimed at implementing far-reaching strategic plans for the placement of shares.  And very recently, the first positive results were obtained.  35% of the shares were acquired by four investors, including Renfin and Swiss funds, which amounted to 128 million US dollars, equal to the bank‚Äôs three capitals. </p><p>  Small <span>and medium-sized businesses</span> can receive significant financial support in the form of a loan, in addition, special conditions for obtaining it are practically not required.  An exceptionally standard set: a period of at least 6 months, no bad credit history, no overdue budget debt, and the last thing is the willingness of a person, a business owner, to act as a guarantor.  Given all these simple conditions, it is possible to easily get a loan.  Probusinessbank does not pose any obstacles to this. </p><p>  In addition, you have the opportunity to obtain a loan in order to replenish <span>working capital,</span> acquire fixed assets, and participate in a tender.  And for individuals - this is a range of personal, salary loans for the treatment, rehabilitation, training and recreation.  All searches for a reliable and profitable loan will end exactly when the client first visits Probusinessbank.  The reviews of thousands of satisfied consumers speak for themselves, creating a positive reputation for this financial institution and suggesting a convenient way out of difficult financial situations for you. </p><p>  Modern technologies have simplified life so much that you can apply for a loan directly from your home or office.  To do this, it will only be necessary to fill out an online form.  It is noteworthy that the system will be able to pick up a loan, as if specially designed for you.  And ‚ÄúProbusinessbank‚Äù takes care of such time savings.  Customer reviews especially emphasize a friendly attitude towards borrowers. </p><p>  You can quickly and easily find out all the information about the bank or its products by calling the round-the-clock number, without even waiting for the start of the working day. </p>
