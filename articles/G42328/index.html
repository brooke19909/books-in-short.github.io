    <h2>  History </h2><p>  Chapaevsky Park was founded in 1899.  Previously, there was a Small All Saints Grove.  And the name came from the village of the same name, the grove in those days was not far from it.  In those years, the park was small, about 5 acres, 2 thousand square fathoms.  Already then there were paths, alleys and flower beds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the October Revolution, the park was renamed the PKiO of the Leningrad Region, and the territory was expanded south due to the territory of the former cemetery.  In 1936, the area under the park zone was about 12 hectares, then the park was also called Detsky.  Each entrance had a fountain, a cinema, and children's clubs. </p><p>  Even later, the grove was again renamed Chapaevsky Park, along the alley of the same name. </p><p>  During the reign of Stalin, the Khoroshevsky district began to be actively built up.  Already in 1950, the construction of a sports center began in the park, but due to a lack of funds, the construction of the building ceased in 1952.  In 1980, the House of Culture began to be built on this site, but construction work was also not completed. </p><p>  In the period from 2007 to 2008, the park was updated, and in September a grand opening took place, again under the new name - Aviators Park.  On one of the alleys there is a memorial sign in honor of the dead pilots on the Khodynsky field.  Renaming and busts of aviators in the park appeared due to the fact that there are many specialized universities and aviation enterprises in the district. </p>

    <h2>  Present time </h2><p>  Today, Chapaevsky Park in Moscow is a comfortable corner in the bustling capital.  Here you can just walk along the well-groomed alleys, admire the flower beds and trees.  For dog breeders there is a special area for walking animals.  The park has a playground and a small skate park. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of the monuments there is a bust of A. Yakovlev. During the period of the aircraft designer‚Äôs professional activity, about 200 types and modifications of aircraft were produced, of which 100 were put into serial production.  On aircraft of the Yakovlev Design Bureau 74 world-class records were set. </p><p>  In the park of the Khoroshevsky district there is a bust of the great aviator N. Stroyev. This person graduated from the Kiev Military School in 1908, and in 1941 the Nikolaev Military Academy.  During the First World War, he successfully combined staff work and combat missions as an observer pilot.  During the Second World War, he was the head of the Aviation Department and the head of the Military Department at the Ministry of Aviation Industry.  Since 1946, he was an assistant professor of military training at the Moscow Aviation Institute. </p><h2>  Commemorative sign </h2><p>  The memorial sign ‚ÄúAviators, testers and sky defenders of Moscow who died on the Khodynsky field from 1910 to 1970‚Äù is erected in honor of the aviators who died during the tests (108 people), including Valery Chkalov.  In the future, at this place it is planned to erect the temple chapel of the Archangel Gabriel in memory of all the dead pilots, and according to conservative estimates of 35 thousand people (the period of World War II and those who gave their lives in peacetime). </p>
