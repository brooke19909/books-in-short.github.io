  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The world's water resources: a source of life for the planet</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  From ancient times, water was for man not only a means of quenching thirst, but also a source of life.  The ancient tribes settled along the banks of the rivers, because they gave them food, the opportunity to grow a regular crop and escape from the sweltering summer heat.  But the world's <span>water resources are</span> inevitably reduced every year, and in order to maintain the normal existence of our planet, mankind has to make more efforts. </p><p>  The emergence of these problems is promoted not only by the deteriorating environmental situation, in particular, the greenhouse effect, which leads to the gradual <span>evaporation of water</span> from the surface of the planet, but also the growth of the Earth's population.  The uneven distribution of water across the continents and islands leads to water shortages in individual countries.  It is especially pronounced in such countries as Kuwait, Libya, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and some countries of Central Africa. </p><p>  Main world <strong> </strong>  Water resources are concentrated in Brazil, Russia, the USA and Canada.  But it is worth noting that even on the territory of the above-mentioned states they are distributed so unevenly that some part of the population still experiences water shortages.  So, for example, such large American cities as Los Angeles and New York often take part of the water resources from farmers whose possessions are located near these megacities. </p><p>  The world's water resources are concentrated not only in the largest rivers, freshwater lakes and reservoirs.  The largest water reserves are the centuries-old ice caps covering the poles of our planet.  It is thanks to the gradual melting of these glaciers that the water reserves on Earth are regularly replenished.  But in recent years, researchers at the North and South Poles are increasingly saying that the acceleration of melting leads to a steady reduction in the supply of drinking water on the planet, which could threaten a real catastrophe in the future. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to save the world's water resources and prevent their drastic reduction, the international community annually develops special programs for environmental protection, reduction of the harm caused by the greenhouse effect, and purification of water used by industrial enterprises. </p><p>  Another urgent problem associated with the water reserves of our planet is their constant pollution.  Often, especially in underdeveloped countries, <span>wastewater is</span> not treated and mixed with clean water intended for domestic use.  As a result, the amount of really suitable water for a person is reduced, and all kinds of diseases are developing. </p><p>  <span>Earth‚Äôs</span> water <span>resources</span> require a very attentive attitude, therefore, ecologists in most countries of the world devote a huge amount of time to the problems of erecting water treatment plants at industrial enterprises. </p><p>  The gradual drying up of rivers and lakes, especially in the regions of Africa and South Asia, after several decades threatens an <span>ecological catastrophe</span> in these regions.  Scientists predict that by 2025 the world's water resources will be so reduced that about three billion people on the planet will live on the brink of a "water crisis."  To prevent such a situation, <span>water consumption</span> should now be made more rational, as well as rainwater collection systems, experts say. </p><p>  Also, there is a gradual development of such a relatively new sector of the economy as desalination of sea water.  Countries with increased water scarcity, for example, Kuwait, pay great attention to this problem and are developing new stations for desalination.  Today, water has even become a subject of trade - some countries buy clean water from states in whose territory moisture reserves are much higher. </p>
