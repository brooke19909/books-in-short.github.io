    <p>  The device turned out to be quite plain and very overall.  Suitable Lenovo Ideatab S6000 for users who are not picky in design and size.  Although at 10 inches the length is 26, and the width is 18 cm - the expected parameters, with a thickness of 8.6 mm there is an obvious bust.  The user will definitely need a carrying bag, because this giant is unlikely to fit in his pocket. </p><p>  In addition, the device does not have a wide range of design colors.  The buyer will be offered exclusively Lenovo Ideatab S6000 Black.  Other colors are not provided by the manufacturer.  A limited number of colors hit the overall impression of the exterior.  The tablet is discreet, and the usual black color does not give it much solidity. </p><p>  The device is made entirely of plastic, this is to be expected from a state employee.  The back panel material is corrugated, which is made to improve the comfort of work.  In the hand, the tablet lies confidently, which is surprising at a weight of 560 grams.  Ease of use is entirely due to the corrugated back. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The manufacturer also took care of the <span>oleophobic coating.</span>  Protection helps prevent minor scratches and, more importantly, fingerprints.  With large <span>screen sizes,</span> handprints would be a real nightmare.  However, the device‚Äôs fall protection is far from the best. </p><p>  The tablet was assembled not bad, but squeaks in some places will still bother the user.  Noticeable gaps are not observed, which is very good.  An unpleasant moment was the slightly bending back.  For a budget employee, in principle, the device looks good, although with minor flaws. </p><p>  The front part is reserved for a frontal, large display, sensors and, of course, the logo of the company.  Behind placed the main camera, a glossy company sign and speakers.  At the top there is a headphone jack, as well as a power button.  The manufacturer noticeably overloaded the side panel on the left side.  Here we have a USB connector, a volume control, an HDMI port, a SIM card slot and a place for a USB flash drive. </p><p>  A strange decision to put most of the nests on one side.  Given that the right side is absolutely free, the location of the elements is only perplexing.  Overload of the right side should not affect the comfort of use, however, an unpleasant impression arises. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The Lenovo Ideatab S6000 was equipped with a 10-inch screen.  The diagonal hints that the tablet is perfect for both working with documents and for entertainment.  The sensor that senses ten touches is also pleasing.  Although the user is likely to be enough and five. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The resolution is fully consistent with the budget and is 1280 by 800. The number of pixels would look nice at seven inches, but on the big screen they are noticeable.  At 149 ppi, this is not surprising.  The image is acceptable, although the user will notice the ‚Äúcubes‚Äù. </p><p>  The Lenovo Ideatab S6000 matrix uses IPS technology.  This solution makes the display much brighter and improves its behavior in the sun.  Of course, the screen glare a bit from bright lighting, but the situation is not critical.  Technology has increased viewing angles.  You can view the screen in any position without significant distortion. </p><p>  For a budget device, the display turned out to be very successful.  Good resolution and the matrix make themselves felt.  A picky user will find it difficult to detect flaws. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  Shooting is not the strongest point of any tablet.  The Lenovo Ideatab S6000 was no exception.  The manufacturer installed a 5-megapixel ‚Äúeye‚Äù as the main camera.  Resolution, as in most similar matrices, is 2592 by 1936 pixels.  Actually, you do not have to rely on quality.  Photos come out faded and without small details.  Slightly blurry outlines of objects also hurt the look. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If at hand there is no more advanced device with a camera, the S6000 will do, but the result will be corresponding.  Particular difficulties arise when shooting distant objects.  The approximate distance at which the camera shows good results is 1-2 meters. </p><p>  The device also has a front camera.  An ‚Äúeye‚Äù with ordinary 0.3 megapixels is available to the owner.  The quality of the photo is just awful, so it's better to forget about this feature.  The only thing the front camera can handle is video calls. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2>

    <p>  Stuffing Lenovo Ideatab S6000 H is very powerful, as for the state employee.  The device operates on the basis of the MTK processor.  Actually, another was not expected from the Chinese manufacturer of cheap devices.  Despite the low cost, the processor is powerful.  The reason for the high performance was that the MTK 8125 was created based on the Cortex-A7. </p><p>  The device received 4 cores from the manufacturer with a frequency of 1.2 GHz each.  In total, a good performance was obtained.  Most tasks the device will ‚Äúclick‚Äù. </p><p>  Much worse things are with the RAM.  The device is equipped with only one gigabyte of RAM.  It‚Äôs enough for the RAM to work, but you don‚Äôt have to rely on the launch of really powerful games. </p><p>  There are several variations of the native memory of the Lenovo Ideatab S6000 16GB and 32 GB.  Without that, a large volume can be supplemented with a card.  The tablet works with micro-SD flash drives.  The user can expand up to 64 GB. </p><h2>  System </h2>

    <p>  The firmware of the S6000 tablet does not sparkle with novelty.  The device uses ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù version 4.2.  Although the system has not lost all relevance, many new products will not be available to the user.  The manufacturer on top of the standard version made its own additions.  This is noticeable in folders resembling widgets.  This greatly simplifies file and application sorting for the owner. </p><p>  If desired, the firmware installed in the Lenovo Ideatab S6000 can be replaced with a more recent version.  The user is available to update the system via wireless networks.  Also on the Internet will find several adequate assemblies. </p><p>  The advantage of <span>custom firmware</span> is the lack of useless applications.  In the standard version, the user will encounter applications that cannot be removed.  Unfortunately, such a problem exists on all official systems. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Everyone knows that the <span>firmware of the tablet is</span> very gluttonous, and the manufacturer decided to improve the situation.  A battery with a capacity of 6300 maH was installed in the device.  The duration of work has increased significantly. </p><p>  The maximum load on the device "plant" the battery in 4-5 hours.  We can say that this is a budget employee record with such characteristics.  Economical use increases the device's lifespan up to 9 hours. </p><p>  The main ‚Äúeaters‚Äù of energy are the display, system and Wi-Fi.  By decreasing the screen brightness, disabling unnecessary programs and the wireless network, you can slightly increase the duration of the work. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  The device comes in a branded box in white.  In addition to the Lenovo Ideatab S6000 H, the set includes instructions, warranty, USB cable, network adapter, removable plug.  Completely expected equipment, but one should not forget about useful trifles. </p><p>  Case for Lenovo tablet made of plastic will reduce the amount of damage.  It will also be useful to purchase an HDMI adapter.  Of course, such a cable is not representative of basic necessities, but still useful.  It will have to be completed with a flash card.  A protective film will not be superfluous.  The oleophobic coating can protect against scratches and fingerprints, but the display is not safe from falls. </p><h2>  Two versions </h2><p>  Manufacturers often produce the same devices with different characteristics.  Usually, the parameters of one model can radically differ.  This solution allows you to make a "lite version" with a lower price.  Lenovo also do not resort to this method. </p><p>  In addition to the standard, the Lenovo Ideatab S6000 3G was also released.  Device differences are minimal.  The version with 3G received GPS.  There are minor differences in the "filling."  The standard S6000 has an 8125 processor, while 3G has an 8389. There is no big difference in performance. </p><p>  The amount of memory devices also differ.  There are versions with 16 and 32 GB.  Although the differences are insignificant, they markedly affected the price.  The buyer will have to choose, save, or get the device a little more powerful. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Attracts attention to the Lenovo Ideatab S6000 price.  The device costs 11-12 thousand rubles.  For most buyers, this cost is very attractive and distinguishes the tablet from competitors.  Despite the minor flaws, the S6000 fully justifies itself and its value. </p><p>  Those who want to buy a device will face unpleasant news.  The device is discontinued, it will be very difficult to find it on the shelves.  However, there are pluses.  Prices for outdated products are falling dramatically, which is why the S6000 can be bought much cheaper today. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The model attracts attention with a huge display.  A perfectly balanced screen was enjoyed by many users.  Naturally, there are minor claims to resolution and behavior in the sun, but the advantages overlap the disadvantages.  A significant viewing angle and brightness provide comfortable operation, and a sensor that senses 10 touches is relevant now. </p><p>  The hardware also delighted the fans of Lenovo.  Among state employees there are not many devices with four cores.  The processor is also not bad, because everyone already knows and trusts MTK products. </p><p>  Installing a battery on the 6300 maH was a great solution.  Most of the owners chose the device because of its duration.  Users are keen to avoid relying on recharging, and the S6000 has provided such an opportunity. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the main advantage was the price of the <span>tablet.</span>  <span>The characteristics</span> and capabilities of the device fully justify the cost.  Budget device attracted most of the owners. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  Immediately striking is the unpretentious appearance of the device.  The tablet absolutely does not stand out among the "gray mass" and attracts little.  Large dimensions and thickness of the device also affect.  The execution of the case made of plastic hints at the need to buy a cover for the Lenovo tablet. </p><p>  As with most similar devices, the camera turned out to be a weak spot.  Perhaps the manufacturer should get rid of the rear ‚Äúeye‚Äù at all and improve other characteristics.  The front camera is also not happy, 0.3 megapixels is not the best solution for video calls. </p><p>  Equipping a good filling with their brainchild, the company decided to save on RAM.  As a result, the user will receive a powerful device with one gigabyte of memory.  The operative does not allow the potential of the device to fully unfold. </p><p>  The manufacturer‚Äôs desire to make money on an almost identical product is also upsetting.  After making minor changes and adding 3G, the company increased the cost of the device.  A similar situation looks ridiculous.  With radical changes, the release of an updated tablet would have looked much more interesting. </p><p>  Firmware 4.2 was relevant several years ago.  Now users want to upgrade their gadgets to 5.0.  However, the specifications of the S6000 will not cope with the latest version.  So the owners will be forced to put up with such a flaw. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  At one time, the S6000 tablet looked pretty good.  However, all devices of past years are forgotten after the release of more advanced models.  And although the news surpasses the S6000, it still has not completely lost all relevance.  The device is suitable for entertainment, work or watching movies while traveling. </p>
