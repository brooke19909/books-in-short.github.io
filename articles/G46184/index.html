For its manufacture, special strips of colored paper will be needed.  You can purchase the blanks in the store, or cut them yourself.  If you decide that it is not difficult for you to make strips, make them from two-sided paper.  Now you can begin to work.  First you need to create an umbrella.  Parts of his cap are made of ordinary spirals.  Take the strip and wind it on a toothpick.  Now loosen the clamp and squeeze the circle on one side so that you get a sharp edge.
