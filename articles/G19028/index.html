It is monitored not only by entrepreneurs, the purchase of goods of which directly depends on the position of the dollar against the Russian ruble, but also by ordinary people who prefer to keep their savings in foreign currency.  And often the question arises, where to exchange profitable rubles for dollars, while still not spending on the commission.  So, where to look for such places not only in Moscow and its suburbs, but also in the Northern capital, and in other cities? </p><h2>  Currency Exchange Rules </h2><p>  Before proceeding directly to the currency exchange, a bank client must know that he will have to go through a number of formalities.  For example, when buying a currency, it is necessary to present a passport, moreover, even if you find where to exchange profitable rubles for dollars and intend to complete this operation with an amount exceeding 15 thousand rubles, you will have to go through a more complex identification system with filling in a number of papers that they will provide the bank with much more information about you than the usual presentation of a passport. </p>

    <p>  For example, a special form will ask questions about the purpose of converting such a large amount.  In addition, the customer‚Äôs banking history will be checked.  Another requirement of the form looks rather absurd - confirmation of business reputation: in the case of legal entities, you only need to check the financial condition of the company, its reputation and so on.  But what should a physical person do?  In addition, when exchanging a really large amount of money, a certificate of income may also be mandatory, which will confirm that the funds were earned exclusively by honest means. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Moscow </h2><p>  Perhaps you should start with the largest cities.  Where is it profitable to exchange rubles for dollars in Moscow?  There are hundreds of various banks in the city, the rates at which are at least slightly different, but the difference is a few kopecks.  True, most often they play a decisive role when it comes to large sums of money.  At the moment, Alfa Bank offers the most profitable exchange, and usually the exchange rates at this institution are among the best in the city. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, residents of the capital should pay attention to it. </p><h2>  Odintsovo </h2><p>  As for where it is profitable to exchange rubles for dollars in Odintsovo, it is worth noting that the choice of banks is much less than in <span>Moscow</span> itself <span>.</span>  Only 18 institutions are engaged in foreign <span>exchange transactions</span> , but even among them there are differences in exchange rates.  Alfa Bank is also the leader here, but Uralsib and Raiffeisenbank also deserve special attention. </p>

    <p>  By the way, the spread here in exchange rates is much higher than in Moscow, so it is worthwhile to carefully approach the issue of choosing the most profitable bank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Lyubertsy </h2><p>  Below is some information for those who are looking for where it is profitable to exchange rubles for dollars in Lyubertsy.  As for the best place, the situation does not change - and again, Alfa-Bank provides the most favorable exchange conditions.  But at the same time, those who can serve as well as this institution have changed.  The second place goes to VTB Bank, and it is worth noting that the gap with the leader is very small. </p>

    <p>  The rest require one dollar per ruble, or even two more. </p><h2>  Omsk </h2><p>  Despite the fact that between Moscow and Omsk there are more than two thousand kilometers, Alfa Bank remains the most profitable.  You can also note the <span>banks "Acceptance"</span> and "SIBES", the difference in exchange rate of which is only two pennies.  Alfa-Bank is probably one of those few institutions that, despite the branching of their network, do not set currency exchange rates that are disadvantageous for the population, thereby ensuring customer loyalty.  Therefore, if you are looking for where it is profitable to exchange rubles for dollars in Omsk, feel free to go to Alfa Bank. </p><h2>  Krasnoyarsk </h2><p>  Further away from Moscow is the beautiful city of Krasnoyarsk.  And in it the situation for people looking for where it is profitable to exchange rubles for dollars in Krasnoyarsk is changing significantly.  Here, the leaders are far from Alfa Bank, which has already established itself in other regions, but FINAM Bank, moreover, the exchange rate here is lower than in Moscow and Omsk branches of Alfa Bank. </p>

    <p>  The second place is shared by the Yenisei United Bank and ATB, the currency exchange in which is also more profitable than in central banks.  At the same time, the gap between these banks and the average dollar exchange rate in the country is almost one ruble, which will play a significant role in the exchange of large sums, as was mentioned earlier. </p><h2>  St. Petersburg </h2><p>  The variety of banks in the Northern capital is truly amazing.  How can one not be lost among numerous exchangers for those who are looking for where it is profitable to exchange rubles for dollars in St. Petersburg?  The Baltic Bank offers the best rate, however, it is worth noting that it is higher than the minimum in the capital. </p>

    <p>  A wide network of bank branches allows you to get the maximum amount of dollars for your rubles sold almost anywhere in the city.  Another advantageous place is VTB24: the difference with the leading bank is a few kopecks, therefore, you can probably afford to choose between VTB24 and Baltic Bank, and besides, they are often quite close to the city, so you can go wherever you like. </p><h2>  Complexities of operations with large amounts </h2><p>  Separately, I would like to talk about those who are looking for where to exchange profitable rubles for dollars, intending to engage in the conversion of a fairly large amount.  The additional registration system, which was already mentioned just above, according to analysts, will be the same for all banks.  Therefore, if a client, having come to the attention of one of the banks even with a simple, exclusively passport-based verification of personal data, then begins to perform foreign exchange transactions with other banks, quite logical questions may arise about the origin of the money with which he operates. </p><p>  On the other hand, if a client of a bank has at least once gone through a complicated registration form, then his data will be stored in the bank, therefore, then you will not need to fill in many forms again.  It is believed that such innovations will reduce the volume of illegal financial transactions, including currency trading in <span>black markets.</span> </p><h2>  Currencies </h2><p>  Currencies, by the way, deserve a separate mention.  Usually people who live in cities where there are large markets prefer to change precisely with them, knowing that they are almost the first to receive information about changes in the exchange rate.  On the other hand, sometimes those who choose precisely the foreign exchange company as a place where it is profitable to exchange rubles for dollars, face the fact that instead of American bills they get fake pieces of paper. </p>

    <p>  In this case, the banks are much more reliable: they carefully check each bill being handed over, so the likelihood that you will be issued a fake is absolutely excluded.  The choice is yours: if you are not afraid to take risks, you can also contact the foreigners, however, it is worth saying separately that the supply of dollars is limited for obvious reasons. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, the one who needs to find a place where it is profitable to exchange rubles for dollars, must first choose between a currency operator whose activities are obviously illegal and, by the way, punishable by law, and a bank whose exchange rate is not always as profitable, but the operation itself is completely and completely reliable and legal. </p><p>  Further, if you still chose a bank, you need to find the one in which the rate is the most successful.  Based on the analysis of the exchange rate, in Moscow and Omka it is Alfa-Bank, and its break with competitors shows that the choice should be made in its favor.  In the Northern capital, it is better to prefer the Baltic Bank, where buying dollars will still be slightly more expensive than in the Moscow branches of the leading bank.  The situation in Krasnoyarsk is completely different: there the best option is FINAM, which sells currency cheaper than all banks in the country. </p><p>  The exchange rate depends on a specific region, what the Central Bank sets is only an indicative figure, around which the rest will be grouped with a run of several cents, or even rubles.  So carefully analyze the current exchange rates in your city. </p>
