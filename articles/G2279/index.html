Most residents know him thanks to the play by Natalia Kotlyarevsky, Natalka-Poltavka.  Meanwhile, in this village, which began the twelfth century from the time of its foundation, a large number of cultural and historical monuments are concentrated.  Despite his esteemed age, Poltava still looks young.  She did not waste her perfection, and every year she only becomes more beautiful.  And today the sights of Poltava are included in the list of the most visited places on the planet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Poltava" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/580294.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The architectural ensemble of the Round Square </h2><p>  Perhaps starting a tour of Poltava is, perhaps, with the Round Square and its architectural ensemble.  This is one of the most striking sights of this city.  The complex is located in the center, so getting here is absolutely not difficult. </p><p>  The appearance of the Round Square began to form at the very beginning of the XIX century.  In general, all the sights of Poltava (photos that can be viewed below) began to be established for a long time.  And this is not surprising when you consider the age of the city itself.  So, the architectural ensemble of the Round Square is made in the style of classicism.  The patron of the building was the then-famous Semyon Kochubey.  And construction work lasted from 1805-1840. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The following administrative institutions are included in the ensemble of this attraction: the house of the vice-governor, the house of the governor-general, and the Little Russian Post Office.  There is also an old governor's <span>house, a building of the noble assembly, a house of</span> provincial <span>public places,</span> a communication house and a building of district <span>public places.</span>  Today, all these buildings are converted to the needs of modern residents.  And now they can be called so: the sights of Poltava of the XXI century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="poltava sights guide" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/580293.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  And Kotlyarevsky is still there </h2><p>  To describe the sights of Poltava and the <span>Poltava region</span> and not to mention the house-museum of Ivan Kotlyarevsky means to forget the most intimate of the history of the city.  After all, Poltava is impossible without Ivan Petrovich, as day cannot exist without night, and the moon without sun.  These are two inseparable concepts. </p><p>  So, in the Ukrainian village, on Cathedral Square, is the house-museum of the great master of speech.  In this room, Kotlyarevsky spent almost all of his life.  The writer created most of his literary masterpieces in this house.  Among them are the famous Natalka-Poltavka and Aeneid.  True, the true estate of Ivan Petrovich could not survive until our days.  But at the end of the 60s of the last century, the estate of a classic of Ukrainian literature was recreated from the drawing of the no less famous Taras Shevchenko. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Poltava photo" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/580292.jpg" width="600"></div>

Sights, a guide to which can be purchased at any kiosk, or you can use our article, are proof of this.  The city once sheltered on its territory not only Ivan Kotlyarevsky, but also another genius of Ukrainian literature.  And his name is Panas Rudchenko.  Although he is known under the pseudonym <span>Panas Mirny.</span>  In 1903-1920 he lived in one of the houses of Poltava, which today is the literary and memorial museum of P. Mirny.  The first special to give the institution valuable exhibits was Alexandra Rudchenko, the widow of the writer.  In 1940, the museum began to function.  Today it boasts the presence of a memorial house for the writer, a literary and exhibition exposition, as well as a garden that covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãone and a half hectares.  There are some plantings planted by Mirny himself. </p><h2>  Garden art </h2><p>  Sights of Poltava that fall into this category are the local arboretum.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis garden, so to speak, occupies more than 124 hectares.  During the <span>Poltava battle, the</span> territory of the modern park was occupied by the impenetrable Yakivchansky forest.  It mainly grew oaks.  But when the German fascists came here, it was decided to destroy this beauty. </p><p>  In the spring of 1962, the laying of the arboretum began.  But its official discovery took place only 25 years later.  So, here they planted more than 200 different types of bushes and trees.  But over time, many plantings were destroyed either by time or by human influence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of the city of Poltava" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/580290.jpg" width="479"></div>

    <h2>  Historical heart of Poltava </h2><p>  You can see all the sights of the city of Poltava on Ivanova Mountain.  This place is the best viewpoint of the village.  Here is a huge complex of outstanding architectural monuments.  Here is the symbol of the city dating back to 1909.  And the name is its white rotunda.  Famous food - dumpling, also found a haven on Ivanova Mountain.  A magnificent panorama of the whole Poltava can be seen from the mountain.  On the right side, you can see the Institute Mountain, on the left - the Monastery.  Below is the city itself and the Vorskla flows, and on the hill located in the neighborhood, the Holy Cross Monastery flaunts. </p><h2>  Come to Poltava - eat a dumpling </h2><p>  Sights of Poltava are not only <span>monuments of architecture</span> and nature, but also symbols of the city that do not belong to material attributes.  Dumplings are considered the gem of local cooking.  This is an original Poltava dish that glorified the city both throughout Ukraine and the neighboring countries.  Dumplings a bit like dumplings, but still different from this dish. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Poltava and the Poltava region" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/580291.jpg" width="600"></div>
