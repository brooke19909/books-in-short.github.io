  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Carbon monoxide. Description. Symptoms and consequences of poisoning</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Carbon monoxide <span>(carbon monoxide)</span> is a colorless gaseous body.  It has no taste or smell.  The production of <span>carbon monoxide is</span> possible under conditions in which incomplete combustion of substances containing carbon occurs.  The oxide is soluble in alcohol and benzene, poorly soluble in water. </p><p>  In small quantities, carbon monoxide is present in the atmosphere, as well as in coal seams (in the form of inclusions).  Carbon monoxide is toxic. </p><p>  The component as a constituent is present in many aerosols and gases.  For example, carbon monoxide accounts for about 9-29% in generator gases, about 60% in explosive gases, and about 6.3% in exhaust gases. </p><p>  It enters the body and is released from it carbon monoxide in an unchanged form through the respiratory system.  Having a high affinity for hemoglobin, it (carbon monoxide) provokes its blockade.  In addition, carbon monoxide disrupts oxygen transport, inhibits tissue respiration, slows down the dissociation of oxyhemoglobin, and causes hypocapnia. </p><p>  Carbon monoxide can quickly penetrate the <span>blood-brain barrier.</span>  Poisoning is possible in foundries, in boiler rooms, during testing of engines, in vehicles, in garages, mines, and gas plants.  In everyday life, with illiterate furnace heating or improper operation of gas stoves, intoxication can also occur. </p><p>  When <span>carbon monoxide poisoning</span> occurs <span>, the</span> consequences can be very serious.  To determine the degree of intoxication, you should know about the symptoms of the condition. </p><p>  With intoxication, a mild headache occurs (mainly in the forehead and temples), a sensation of "pulsation" in the temples, tinnitus, muscle weakness, vomiting, dizziness.  Poisoning is also accompanied by increased heart rate and respiration.  A person has fainting conditions, in particular, during physical exertion.  One of the first signs is a violation of the reaction rate and a violation of color perception. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  With moderate poisoning, there are <span>memory</span> lapses <span>, loss of</span> consciousness for several hours.  There is a sharp adynamia, trembling.  Carbon monoxide causes impaired coordination of movements.  After the return of consciousness, an <span>asthenic state of a</span> pronounced character develops. </p><p>  In severe intoxication, a person is in a protracted coma (for five to seven (or more) days).  Brain lesions, seizures, tonic and clonic convulsions, muscle stiffness are noted.  Urination and bowel movements occur involuntarily.  There is also increased sweating.  The complexion of the victim is bright scarlet.  Discontinuous breathing, hypotension, and a tendency to collapse are noted.  Death is likely due to respiratory paralysis. </p><p>  When leaving a coma, a person is stunned for a fairly long period.  Apathy develops.  In some cases, short-term delirium, motor agitation may occur. </p><p>  The prognosis is based on the depth and duration of the coma.  With increased symptoms of central nervous system depression on the second day, the prognosis is poor. </p><p>  After moderate and mild poisoning, mononeuritis of the median, ulnar or peroneal nerve may develop, numbness and paralysis are likely. </p><p>  In chronic intoxication, the victim constantly complains of headaches, excessive fatigue, irritability, tinnitus.  In addition, there is a regular short-term disorientation of orientation.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, pain in the region of the heart are constantly observed. </p><p>  Chronic intoxication contributes to the progression of atherosclerosis or complicates its course (if it was already present).  Frequent consequences of carbon monoxide poisoning are endocrine disorders, thyrotoxicosis, in particular. </p>
