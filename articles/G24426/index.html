It will probably be more correct to say - this is a piece of a huge natural massif, Sosnovka park. </p><p>  This place is loved by many residents who come here to relax.  Everyone can find classes to taste here, whether it is a seeker of loneliness, a family with children or a group of friends.  Rest in St. Petersburg in the lap of nature and near the city is a success. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  In 1941, the city needed quartz sand and clay, which were the material for the manufacture of molds used in the manufacture of shells and mines.  The city was surrounded by the enemy, it became impossible to import them from the region, and then, having previously carried out reconnaissance in different parts of St. Petersburg, they decided to arrange a mining quarry here.  So on the outskirts of the city a pit appeared.  Quartz sand began to be mined here. </p><p>  They loaded the sand with shovels, took them out on gas-generating machines.  Later <span>tram tracks were</span> brought here <span>,</span> they were extended as the quarry was developed.  Then the <span>conveyor belts were</span> arranged, which greatly helped the workers.  The quarry was called the "nutrient point" of casters.  Sand mining was conducted here in the postwar years.  In addition to foundry, builders began to use sand. </p><h2>  The present </h2><p>  Subsequently, in the early 70s, this quarry was filled with water, it was cultivated.  Holidays in St. Petersburg on the banks of the Olginsky quarry became popular. </p><p>  The water here is clean, although vacationers often leave behind mud.  Water is cleaned here every year, samples are taken for analysis.  So the condition of the reservoir is monitored.  There are more than ten sources in the pond that enrich it with clean water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is a sandy beach on the shore, where in hot weather vacationers gather for sunbathing and water procedures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="olga pond" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45651/1582952.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Among representatives of energy practices, this place is known as a place of power.  They come here to pump energy, to put in order thoughts through meditation. </p><p>  The beach on Olginsky Pond has been popular since April, from the first warm days, when the water still did not seem to have warmed up, and the first bathers were already appearing here.  He is not empty in the winter.  This place is popular among walruses who organized a winter swimming club.  For lovers of beach holidays, locker rooms are arranged on the shore.  Vacationers complain that there is only one toilet on the beach, but someday this problem will be solved.  After all, the city authorities take care of this wonderful natural corner. </p>

    <h2>  Animal world </h2><p>  Olginsky pond is famous among fishermen.  Whole crayfish were caught here, whole legends are composed.  They say that crayfish are still found, and the fish is found.  Fishing in St. Petersburg attracts many, so here you can often see vacationers with fishing rods. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Flocks of birds gather near the water.  Ducks, seagulls, pigeons.  Who catches fish, who begs food from vacationers.  The pigeons are so tame that if they reach out, they will cling to it in the hope of refreshments. </p><p>  And in the park, on the outskirts of which the Olginsky Pond is located, Korean squirrels are found.  They, too, can easily take food from the hands of vacationers, which delight everyone, especially the kids. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fishing in spb" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45651/1582953.jpg" width="530"></div>

    <p>  In winter, skate rental is available.  On the paths of the park you can meet many skiers. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  Olginsky Pond - a great place for a family holiday.  Children are happy to bathe, feed birds, squirrels.  In the park for them there are playgrounds and an amusement park.  For older kids, they organize <span>sports competitions.</span>  Children's voices are heard from sports fields where children and adults play together. </p><h2>  Park Sosnovka </h2><p>  Sosnovka Park is a historical place.  In the old days, local places attracted duelists here.  Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov also shot a duel here, for which he was sent into exile in the Caucasus. </p><p>  Not far from the park were the cottages of Vissarion Grigorievich Belinsky and Ivan Sergeevich Turgenev.  They loved to walk along the paths of the park.  The place here is favorable for walks and wellness.  The name of the park suggests that pine prevails here, so valued for its healing properties. </p><p>  During the war years, the city‚Äôs airfield was located here.  Now, in that part of the park, there is a memorial to fallen soldiers and a cemetery for fallen pilots is located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Olginsky pond in the Vyborg district" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45651/1582949.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Along the well-groomed alleys of the park, there are a lot of benches, so there is always where to sit down and relax from an intense walk. </p><p>  It is also remarkable that mushrooms and berries grow in the park, because if you turn away from the beaten path, you can get into a real forest.  And besides the Olginsky pond there are also a couple of smaller reservoirs.  Fishing in St. Petersburg becomes possible near the city and at the same time practically in the forest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beach on olga pond" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45651/1583215.jpg" width="600"></div>
