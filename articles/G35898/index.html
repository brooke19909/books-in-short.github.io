Even a large wardrobe item takes only a few evenings.  Every mother wants her child to look stylish and original and to be comfortable.  Hand-made wardrobe items are the best suited for these purposes.  The simplicity of the patterns and a detailed description of knitting for babies make them accessible even to beginner craftswomen.  In the article we will talk about the features of modeling clothes for newborns and help you choose the right yarn. </p><h2>  Features of knitting for kids </h2><p>  Clothing for newborns should not only please the eyes of parents, but also be comfortable for the child.  It is necessary to give preference to spacious models with external seams.  When knitting for babies, the neck and cuffs should not be made too tight.  They should not pinch and cause discomfort.  For overalls, sliders and panties, sufficient space must be provided for the diaper.  In addition, convenient fasteners for easy change will be useful. </p><p>  The color scheme of clothes for babies is based on delicate pastel shades: beige, mint, lavender, blue, pink, white, pale yellow.  They do not have an exciting effect on the psyche of the child, do not irritate and do not prevent falling asleep.  The general neutrality of the background can be diluted with bright details: buttons, ribbons, applique, stripes on the cuffs.  Fine decor in the form of beads, beads or sequins should not be used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kit for girls" class="if uuid-2666324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2666324.jpg"></div><p>  As fasteners, large buttons are suitable that the baby can not swallow, and a variety of ribbons. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is important to remember that in the first months of life, babies grow very quickly, so you should knit a wardrobe with some margin in size.  One of the delights of knitting is that when a child grows out of clothes, it can be dissolved and tied to something new. </p><h2>  Yarn selection </h2><p>  Children's skin is very delicate, so when choosing yarn for knitting for babies, this feature should be taken into account.  Children's things are knitted from natural <span>yarn: cotton,</span> viscose, bamboo, acrylic, wool.  Use synthetic threads is not worth it, they can cause allergies.  In addition, synthetics are poorly breathable, which is of great importance for children's skin, prone to diaper rash.  The yarn should be lint-free, as the child can inhale or swallow the fibers.  Threads should be chosen smooth, without the addition of lurex and beads. </p><p>  Wool is a natural and warm material, however, it can irritate a baby‚Äôs delicate skin or provoke an allergic reaction.  When choosing a woolen thread, you need to attach the yarn to the face to make sure that it is not pricked.  Mercerized wool is suitable for knitting children's clothes, it is soft and smooth. </p><h2>  Popular models </h2><p>  The most popular knitted things for babies are all kinds of hats, mittens and booties.  For summer models of hats, thin cotton and bamboo yarn are suitable, it perfectly passes air.  Winter hats made of acrylic and wool retain heat and do not allow your head to sweat.  <span>Mittens for kids</span> knit without a thumb.  Beautiful and neat booties are obtained when crocheting.  They keep their shape well and allow you to experiment with design.  But it‚Äôs better to knit socks with knitting needles, the structure of the knitting is softer and more elastic. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cute booties rabbits" class="if uuid-2666323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2666323.jpg"></div><p>  Knitting for kids allows you to create beautiful models of envelopes and overalls.  Knitting needles are also suitable for knitting blankets.  They turn out to be very warm and soft. </p><p>  Little girls in romantic fishnet dresses and crocheted sundresses look like real princesses.  Young gentlemen in cardigans with neat patterns are not far behind. </p><h2>  Knitted toys </h2><p>  Knitted toys - an independent type of needlework.  Lovely little animals and little men will appeal to any kid, especially if a toy is made by a mother or grandmother, putting love and warmth into it. </p><p>  The most popular in recent times is the Amigurumi technique that came from Japan.  These are small animals and dolls crocheted or knitted.  Knit toy parts in a circle, in a seamless way.  For work, a thinner hook is used than the selected thread.  This allows the toy to easily maintain shape.  As a filler, cotton wool or synthetic winterizer is suitable. </p><p>  Small toys can be hung on a carousel above the crib or on a stretch in a stroller.  A cute bunny or teddy bear can be the first friend of the baby. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted amigurumi toy" class="if uuid-2666328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82192/2666328.jpg"></div><p>  Hand-made things have a special energy, so the baby will be cozy and comfortable in them.  Children's clothes are knitted only from natural threads without impurities.  Preference should be given to pastel shades.  Things should be spacious, not hamper the baby‚Äôs movements, do not rub delicate skin and let in air. </p>
