Kostroma province of that time: what do we know about it?  What monuments remained after wars and defeats?  The city of Kostroma was a significant posad for the Russian state.  Transformation accelerated the growth of the economy and culture.  The architecture of those times still adorns historic cities. </p><h2>  Geography </h2><p>  The Kostroma province is located in the European part of the Russian Empire.  Its borders: from the west, it borders with Yaroslavskaya;  in the south - with Vladimir and Nizhny Novgorod.  Northern neighbor - Vologda;  East - Vyatka. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Kostroma province was formed in 1719.  It was renamed governorship by 1778. It consisted of 12 counties.  The area occupied by the Kostroma province was almost 84 thousand square kilometers.  By 1926, the number of counties was reduced to 7. It was liquidated, like the rest of the provinces, in 1929.  Subsequently, it became known as the region. </p><h2>  Administrative division </h2><p>  Counties of the Kostroma province, which were part of it: </p><ol><li>  Buisky. </li><li>  Vetluzh district. </li><li>  Galich. </li><li>  Barnavinsky. </li><li>  Kinesham. </li><li>  Kologrivsky. </li><li>  Kostroma. </li><li>  Makaryevsky. </li><li>  Nerekhtsky. </li><li>  Soligalichsky is the largest and most developed. </li><li>  Chukhlomsky. </li><li>  Yurevetsky. </li></ol><h2>  Coat of arms </h2><p>  <span><span>Initially, it was executed in the form of a shield divided into four equal parts.</span></span>  <span><span>The first depicts a silver cross, the second and fourth are made in golden color, and on the fourth part - a crescent moon, turned upside down.</span></span>  <span><span>Such a coat of arms was canceled in 1878 and a new one was adopted, depicting the imperial crown, the Varangian ship and oak leaves connected by the St. Andrew ribbon.</span></span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
