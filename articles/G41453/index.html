    <h2>  What to do with little guests? </h2><p>  If the visitors are still very young and do not know how to swim, and parents want to escape from their worries and at least have a little rest, the kids can be left in a soft children's room with the "talking" name "Fidget" under the supervision of a qualified teacher.
