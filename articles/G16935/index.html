How to sell real estate online</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When people decide to move, they consider an incredible number of different options by browsing the most popular real estate sites.  This is perhaps the fastest and most convenient way to find the right accommodation.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter whether it‚Äôs a purchase, sale or temporary lease.  For example, kvartirant.ru, like other Internet sites, offers a variety of options for all visitors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.schaller-immobilien.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="popular resource cian ru" class="if uuid-2889453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2889453.jpg"></div><h2>  List </h2><p>  There are the greatest number of online resources ready to provide information to potential newcomers.  However, most are interested in the most popular real estate sites.  After all, they provide the greatest audience coverage.  This means that the chances of finding a potential seller, buyer or tenant are significantly increased. </p><p>  So which sites are on this list?  They are as follows: </p><ul><li>  <span>cian;</span> </li><li>  realty yandex; </li><li>  domofond; </li><li>  realty mail; </li><li>  mirkvartir; </li><li>  kvartirant. </li></ul><p>  It is these online resources that are most popular among Russian-speaking users.  You can use several sources at once to quickly find the most attractive offer or trust only one of them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.weissflog-immobilien-sachsen.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sell real estate online" class="if uuid-2889454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2889454.jpg"></div><h2>  Top 3 most popular </h2><ol><li>  Cian.ru.  On this resource, users will find real estate ads located in various parts of Russia.  Diversity concerns not only territorial coverage, but also existing proposals.  Perhaps this is where users can satisfy absolutely any request related to real estate.  It can be a daily rent or for a long period.  Cian.ru customers are offered offers on apartments located in new buildings and on the secondary market.  You can also purchase or, on the contrary, sell commercial real estate, residential cottages, houses, land plots, summer residences and any other objects at Cyan. </li><li>  Realty.yandex.ru.  This site has many sections, so it has great chances to satisfy the most demanding customers.  Need to sell or buy an apartment?  Or maybe you are interested in houses, cottages, cottages or land for development?  All of the above property is easy to find on Realty.yandex ru.  I must say that this online aggregator also collects ads placed on other resources.  The result is a wide range of offers, among which each buyer can find the desired object. </li><li>  Domofond.ru.  This site has split off from a large ad base called Avito.  Its peculiarity is that it does not collect all offers in a row, but concerns only immovable objects.  Here, users can sell, buy or rent housing.  Offers vary in value, from cheap rooms to luxury cottages.  Domofond.ru differs from other resources in that it provides access to the news section regarding real estate.  For site visitors, this information may be useful. </li></ol><p>  These were the most popular real estate sites.  However, these are not the only resources on which you can find objects of interest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.marbea-immobilien.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sell a house online" class="if uuid-2889456" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2889456.jpg"></div><h2>  Mirkvartir.ru </h2><p>  Here, potential buyers are available ads on real estate located in different parts of Russia, even the most remote.  Despite the fact that the name indicates the word "apartment", there are many other facilities offered here.  It is worth saying that Mirkvartir.ru is a wide selection of real estate intended for various potential clients.  These are houses, town houses and other housing.  Commercial property is also available, which will be relevant for those planning to do business.  There are options for those who are looking for temporary housing - for example, for a day. </p><h2>  Realty.mail.ru </h2><p>  The reason for its relevance lies in a wide range of proposals.  This resource was created for customers from various cities of Russia.  This is another resource on the list of the most popular real estate sites. </p><p>  Here you can sell or buy an apartment both in the capital and in the suburbs of some remote town.  In addition, it is pleasantly surprised by the wide range of Realty.mail.ru offers, from living rooms to commercial warehouses intended for business. </p><h2>  For Moscow </h2><p>  There are some free real estate sites that, unlike previous resources, do not cover all of Russia, but only the metropolitan area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Metrprice.ru.  For residents of Moscow or Moscow region, as well as those interested in real estate in these regions.  For visitors, the site has collected a database of various objects, including new buildings and secondary housing. </li><li>  Restate.ru.  The base of offers is slightly wider, since in addition to Moscow, there are ads for real estate in St. Petersburg.  These are residential apartments and houses, as well as commercial facilities, which will certainly interest businessmen.  In addition to the database of ads Restate.ru will delight its visitors with an abundance of various information.  Here are collected expert advice, analytical data and so on. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="conplore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="popular site realty mail ru" class="if uuid-2889457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2889457.jpg"></div><p>  So, the list of free real estate sites for the sale, purchase and rental of various objects is surprising in its diversity.  A potential customer can use one of them.  For example, when buying real estate in Moscow, you can use a specialized site that accumulates offers exclusively from this region.  However, if you use several of these sites, you can get a wider coverage of offers. </p><h2>  Sale Features </h2><p>  It is important not only to find a useful resource with ads, but also to be able to use it correctly.  That is why many are interested in how to sell real estate over the Internet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that this is a rather convenient way, as it is popular with both buyers and sellers.  There is a high probability of finding the right object without spending a lot of precious time on it and without attracting realtors, not all of whom can boast of professionalism. </p><p>  Also, do not forget that the Internet, due to its anonymity, attracts a huge number of scammers.  That is why it is important to pay attention to paperwork.  If you do not have enough of your own knowledge, you can attract a professional lawyer who will correctly execute everything, observing the interests of both the seller and the buyer.  By the way, the latter has more risks in the real estate market. </p><h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  So, if your goal is to sell real estate via the Internet, first of all you need to familiarize yourself with possible ways.  The buyer is in a better position, looking at bundles of ads from owners and agencies.  A seller in the real estate market cannot afford such a luxury.  Its task is to attract the attention of potential visitors to their own property. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.boechzelt-immobilien.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="popular portal mirkvartir ru" class="if uuid-2889458" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2889458.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, you need to evaluate the market.  This will allow you to set an adequate price, not to cheapen or scare potential customers. </p><h2>  How to evaluate? </h2><p>  So, the seller has several options available that will allow you to find out the value of his property. </p><p>  For example, you can act on your own.  View dozens, and preferably hundreds of similar ads.  And you need to pay attention not to everything, namely to those that are similar to your proposal for the location and other parameter.  In this way, you can find out the approximate value of the property being sold. </p><p>  At this stage, you can already place an ad or go ahead and invite a realtor.  However, it is worth saying that his assessment is not always objective.  Remember that the task of the realtor is to realize the property as soon as possible.  Therefore, it is in his interests to exhibit a price that is not the most favorable for the seller.  Be prepared for this and do not rely solely on his opinion.  Use both methods better.  So you can figure out an approximate range of prices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moneypark.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="real estate site kvartirant ru" class="if uuid-2889459" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2889459.jpg"></div><h2>  Ad preparation </h2><p>  In addition to the price, you need to create an ad text that attracts a potential customer.  In it, the greatest emphasis should be placed on the advantages of the property being sold.  The more detailed the description, the fewer questions the seller will have to answer in the future.  In addition, it will reduce the number of empty calls. </p><p>  Also, the seller needs to take care of high-quality photos.  It is necessary to demonstrate the object in the best light.  However, do not overzealous and use Photoshop.  Ultimately, the buyer will still visit the object, and if the reality does not coincide with the photos provided, it is likely that he will be disappointed, the transaction will not take place, and the cunning seller will only waste time and increase the number of empty impressions. </p><h2>  Ways of advertising </h2><p>  So, when the preparation is completed, you need to think about where to look for potential buyers.  For this, several options are available to the seller and the realtor. </p><ol><li>  Specialized sites.  The easiest and fastest option.  A high concentration of potential buyers is going here, which increases the chances of realizing the property faster.  However, some sites charge a fee for publishing real estate ads. </li><li>  Social networks.  Many narrowly focused groups have been created that allow the seller and the buyer to meet.  Before publishing a pre-prepared announcement, you need to familiarize yourself with the rules. </li><li>  Contextual advertising.  This is a paid method, which, in addition, requires certain skills for setting up a company.  The bottom line is that the ad will appear in search results on well-known Internet sites.  This greatly increases audience reach.  In this case, the seller needs to pay each click on the advertising link.  However, no one guarantees whether the potential visitor will turn into a real buyer or not. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="premier-immobilien.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="free real estate sites" class="if uuid-2889462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2889462.jpg"></div><h2>  Brief Summary </h2><p>  Now you know not only on which sites to advertise real estate, but also how to sell it correctly.  To summarize, it is worth recalling that not all real estate sites are free.  Some sellers require you to pay for an ad.  If this is important for you, pay attention to similar resources, which are completely free for users. </p><p>  When placing an ad for the sale of real estate, pay special attention to an adequate assessment.  To do this, you can view the ads of competitors or invite a professional realtor.  Attention should be paid not only to the assessment of real estate, but also to the compilation of the text of the announcement, as well as photographs.  The more complete idea about the object the potential buyer receives, the better for him and the seller. </p><p>  For potential sellers of real estate, there are several ways to advertise your own property.  Specialized sites are the most popular of them, but, I must say, not the only one.  You can be puzzled by the search on social networks, as well as try contextual advertising. </p>
