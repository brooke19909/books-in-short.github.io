    <h2>  Interesting to know </h2><p>  Reviews Miramare Resort &amp; Spa is extremely positive.  However, the hotel is really good.  Friendly and attentive staff work here, restaurants serve delicious food and quality drinks, and clear water at sea.  All because a mountain river flows into it.  It is especially good here in autumn or winter, when the climate of Crete allows you to enjoy the mild warmth and refreshing sea water.  Yes, and tourists in the fall and winter there are fewer. </p><p>  Guests who were at the hotel claim that it is definitely worth renting a car and exploring the island yourself.  A car can be ordered directly at the hotel.  The prices here are not overpriced, but the same as in the city, they will only make out many times faster. </p><p>  Well, the hotel also performs daily cleaning, towels are changed with the same regularity, and linen is changed every other day.  Shower gels, shampoo and olive soap are regularly replenished in the bathroom. </p><p>  In general, if we summarize, we can conclude - this is an excellent hotel for a romantic, youth and active vacation.  And at reasonable prices for Crete.  It is worth going here on vacation and see for yourself.  You will not have to feel sorry, which is confirmed by numerous reviews. </p>
