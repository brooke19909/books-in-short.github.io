However, there are also negative sides, because of which people think about whether to move to Krasnodar.  Reviews of the city and life in it can be found in our material. </p><h2>  Seismic zone </h2><p>  The unofficial capital of the Kuban has been developing very rapidly lately.  According to scientists, over the past years, business activity has grown significantly.  Another advantage of this city over others is the speed of construction.  According to the pace of exploitation of the <span>living space,</span> Ekaterinodar (this is the first name of the settlement) reaches the level of Moscow and St. Petersburg.  In total, more than 100 large and experienced companies work in this area of ​​Russia. </p>

    <p>  Due to significant competition, each company is trying to offer customers the most profitable product and price.  Therefore, many people want to buy new apartments in this city and move to live in Krasnodar.  The reviews of people who bought houses in the former Yekaterinodar are positive.  Developers make sure that their work is at a high level. </p><p>  There are a lot of private sectors in the city.  The settlement itself is located in a zone of seismic activity, so skyscrapers are not built here.  In the entire history of earthquakes have not been recorded.  But in recent years, scientists have recorded hits with an intensity of 4 to 5 points. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Administrative boundaries </h2><p>  Good prospects and the opportunity to purchase affordable housing attract people from all over the country to this region.  Since 2008, the population has been growing steadily and steadily.  According to recent estimates, the number of inhabitants amounted to almost 830,000 people. </p><p>  It should be noted that even with so many inhabitants, the city of Krasnodar seems to be a province to many.  Responses of people who have moved are often negative, as it is difficult for new residents to adapt in an unusual environment. </p><p>  In the district, in addition to Krasnodar itself, 29 more settlements are included.  The city is divided into four distinctive regions.  The largest of them, with an area of ​​475 km², is Prikubansky.  This is where most of the population lives.  4% of the total area of ​​the capital of the Kuban is occupied by the Western District.  Its territory is 22 km². </p>

    <h2>  Prestige and convenience </h2><p>  First, Ekaterinodar was built on the banks of the river.  After laying the railway track, its areas stretched to the side, to the north.  The main street is Red.  The territory adjacent to it is considered to be the middle of the city.  Aurora, the Old Center and the DEM are the main <span>areas of Krasnodar.</span>  Reviews moved here are very diverse.  Here, Khrushchev’s and Stalin’s houses are more concentrated.  Housing prices in different parts of the city do not differ much. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Immediately in the center are the sleeping areas.  There are elite buildings that ordinary people call the “Field of Miracles” because of the bizarre and extraordinary high-rise buildings. </p><p>  Spare parts are one of the best areas for living.  So say the migrants.  The prices are moderate, the center is close.  On the territory there are universities and hospitals.  Here is a very large and clean park. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  It is hard for many foreigners to survive the hot season.  First, people from other parts are pleased with the early warm spring and the lingering mild autumn.  The indicators of thermometers in April and May range from +12 ... + 17 ° .  The same temperature outside in September and October.  Winter in this area is mild and short.  Snow falls very rarely and does not lie for a long time.  In January, February, an average minimum of 0 ... + 2 ° C is observed.  But there are frosts up to -25 degrees. </p><p>  However, it affects Krasnodar with summer temperature indicators.  Feedback from Siberia is extremely negative.  It’s very difficult for people who are used to long winters and low temperatures to get used to the weather with the constant “+” sign.  In July, often the air warms up to +40 ° C. </p><p>  Therefore, immigrants say that there is practically nothing to breathe in the concrete jungle.  Nowhere to hide from hellish sunshine.  During this period, the beaches of Krasnodar are crowded. </p>

    <h2>  How to survive the hot season? </h2><p>  However, people who have recently moved to this settlement are pleased that the Sea of ​​Azov and the Black Sea are about 100 km away.  Almost everyone who has their own car, as local residents say, can leave the stuffy city for the weekend. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If some visitors are frightened by climatic conditions, then others believe that the weather is quite normal.  Many say that although the summer is very hot, in other regions there may be a higher temperature.  Even +35 ° C in the shade does not frighten anyone.  Krasnodar has a lot of greenery and dense trees. </p><p>  Reviews moved to permanent residence often relate to weather conditions.  Often people get into disputes.  But guests believe that in the hot season it is better to think carefully about your daily schedule.  For example, children, the elderly and those who endure heat, it is better to walk until 10 in the morning and after 18 in the evening. </p>

    <h2>  Disappointment of the year </h2><p>  You can hide from the sun in shopping centers, cafeterias and shops where air conditioners are constantly working.  All day cool and in offices.  Those who are sitting at home can install their own unit. </p><p>  However, as residents of the city claim, it is impossible to hide from the heat in buses and minibuses.  It is especially difficult for those people who are forced to get to the office by public transport. </p><p>  However, many are attracted by the entertainment that Krasnodar offers.  Responses of people who have moved often relate to the water park.  There, inhabitants tired of the heat can relax and recharge with positive energy.  However, in January 2015, local newspapers reported that the water town was closed.  Since then, new entertainment complexes of this type have not been opened. </p><h2>  The subtleties of moving </h2><p>  But in general, as the immigrants note, there are many centers in Krasnodar where you can have fun and have fun.  On the territory of the settlement there are more than 15 large trade and entertainment institutions.  They will find something to their liking both visitors from cities with a million inhabitants and people from small villages. </p><p>  The centers are crowded with shops and cafeterias.  Prices in neighboring establishments often vary.  However, many visitors claim that the cost of the same products on the market and in the shopping center is not the same.  So, often at natural points you have to pay more. </p><p>  Almost no different from other major administrative centers of Krasnodar.  Feedback from Chita is usually positive.  This is not surprising, because the former Ekaterinodar is much larger than the Transbaikal settlement.  However, people who moved to the Kuban from Moscow or St. Petersburg are usually unhappy, because in the previous areas they could be offered much more entertainment and opportunities. </p>

    <h2>  Food for the soul </h2><p>  Nevertheless, this city will not let you get bored, - its new residents are sure.  Here you can play bowling, billiards and go ice skating.  There are two large libraries in which readers can find any book.  You can have fun and useful time in front of the professional scene.  In general, more than 10 major theaters offer such services. </p><p>  Often different stars come to Kuban with tours.  Those who recently settled in the city will be interested in visiting museums.  Among them there is a house that acquaints all concerned with the life and work of Vladimir Vysotsky.  Also, visitors are welcomed by the Hall of Modern Art. </p><p>  Life in Krasnodar can be interesting.  Responses of people who have moved also often relate to numerous parks and squares.  The settlers claim that they were struck by the cleanliness and culture of the green gardens.  Under the branchy trees it’s good to relax both in the summer heat and to walk in the winter frost.  Most residents note that the former Yekaterinodar is a very clean settlement. </p><h2>  Educational programs </h2><p>  A big minus for new residents is constant traffic jams.  Particularly difficult to move around the city center.  There are fewer cars only at night.  However, the local population claims that such a problem is absolutely normal and characteristic of other large settlements.  Almost all main streets suffer from a large flow of cars during rush hours.  When heavy rains are predicted, city dwellers are also preparing for “lakes” on low sections of roads. </p><p>  Educational performance is very high in Krasnodar.  The responses of people who moved from Chita and other cities are less positive, because there was no such choice of higher educational institutions.  In general, there are about 35 universities in the territory that offer various conditions, professions and tuition fees. </p><p>  Children can go to regular and specialized schools.  There are gymnasiums, lyceums and private classes.  Together, the number of such educational institutions exceeds 100. </p>

    <h2>  Corruption problem </h2><p>  The government pays a lot of attention to sports.  The pride of the city is the trampoline school.  It brought up more than one generation of masters.  A lot of positive feedback is received by the Kuban stadium.  It can immediately accommodate about 35,000 spectators. </p><p>  Often, residents of other regions complain about Krasnodar.  Feedback from Siberia has a special negative.  People say corruption and bribery are rampant in the area.  For places in kindergartens and schools have to pay.  Almost all government agencies collect round "voluntary" donations.  The number of charitable foundations in which you need to give money is increasing every year. </p><p>  Many claim that terrible quality water flows from taps.  Drinking it is almost impossible.  Wells are also not clean.  You have to spend money on the purchase of drinking water. </p><h2>  Other details </h2><p>  The main cause of air pollution is transport.  According to recent estimates, there are about 300 cars per 1000 people.  In summer, the situation is further complicated by the fact that trucks pass through the city.  Therefore, it is almost impossible to avoid congestion on major roads. </p><p>  A lot of environmental damage is done by the local oil and fat factory.  Its evaporation can be felt a few kilometers from the plant.  Due to the unpleasant smell, apartments in this area are rented out and sold much cheaper than in other parts of the city.  Unfortunately, this fact is rarely found in the reviews of people who moved to permanent residence in Krasnodar. </p>

    <p>  On hot summer days, not everyone has the time and opportunity to go to sea.  Ecologists allow fishing in the main river, the Kuban, but swimming is prohibited here because of the extremely polluted state of the water. </p><p>  Migrants note that finding housing and work in this city is very simple.  The average salary ranges from 31,000 rubles.  Krasnodar gives a lot of opportunities and prospects to new members of their community. </p>
