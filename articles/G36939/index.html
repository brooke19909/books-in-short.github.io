  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fundamentals of sociology and political science as modern sciences</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The term sociology was first coined by Auguste Comte, a French scientist.  Sociology, as an object, studies society, individuals in it, as well as the principles of building the relationship between them.  <span>The task of sociology</span> is the explanation and practical solution of social problems in society. </p><p>  Political relations in any society are studied by political science.  The sphere of issues studied by the subject of political science includes analysis of the role and correlation of the main components of any political system: the state, various public organizations and political parties. </p><p>  The foundations of sociology and political science, as subjects that study the basic aspects of the functioning of society, allow us to consider society as a single sociocultural and political organization;  provide an opportunity to comprehend the patterns of development of social relations in society inextricably linked with the regulation of socio-political;  allow you to study the laws that determine the development of relations between the individual and society, and also provide an opportunity to analyze social structures and the nature of the relationship of the elements of this structure. </p><p>  The formation of political science as a science makes it possible to regulate socio-political relations, and the whole range of interrelated problems that make up the concept of democracy;  allows you to study the principles of foreign policy of states, as well as the development within the state of various political forces and their impact on the nature of international relations of the state. </p><p>  Considering the foundations of sociology and political science, it can be argued that these two areas of functioning of modern society can be considered exclusively in the totality of their manifestations.  Political relations (internal and external) can be analyzed only in conjunction with the totality of social relations, which include economic, social and ideological relations. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The structure of political science</span> as a science of the laws of the <span>development of politics,</span> combines several areas and represents such sciences: </p><p>  - political philosophy.  This section defines the basic principles of ideas about the place and role of politics in the system of <span>social relations.</span>  Political philosophy defines the principles of the formation of some fundamental moments in political science (an apparatus that defines concepts and categories in political science). </p><p>  - the history of political thought: a subject that studies the stages of evolution of ideas about the life of the state in the aspect of its politics, as well as studying the components of <span>political life that</span> existed in different eras. </p><p>  - <span>Political sociology</span> is a very extensive field of study of political events, phenomena and processes based on the collection and analysis of empirical data.  The foundations of sociology and political science, as sciences, make it possible to synthesize knowledge about various aspects of the development of society into a single science. </p><p>  - political psychology - a science that studies the political behavior of an individual and in society, as well as its motivation.  Of particular interest in this section of science is the study of the political behavior of the masses. </p><p>  - <span>political anthropology</span> studies a person who (in any form) is engaged in political activities.  This field of knowledge studies the prerequisites, motivation, conditions for people to enter the political sphere, the factor of personal interest in political relations, and also establishes ‚Äútraces of presence‚Äù in human politics and the human factor. </p><p>  Studying the foundations of sociology and political science, taking into account modern phenomena in the political and social life of states, we can conclude that these sciences are in constant development and dynamics. </p>
