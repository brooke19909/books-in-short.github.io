Step-by-step instructions will help you cope with the tasks. </p><h2>  Bank help </h2><p>  You can implement the task with the help of bank employees.  It is very comfortable.

    <h2>  ATM </h2><p>  How to activate VTB 24 card through an ATM?  It is not difficult to do this.  In just a minute, a citizen will be able to bring the idea to life. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The activation guide is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Put the plastic in the ATM of the financial institution under study. </li><li>  Enter a pre-invented PIN. </li></ol><p>  Perhaps this is all.  As soon as the system detects plastic, it will activate.  For security reasons, you can perform some kind of operation.  Under such circumstances, the card will definitely go through activation. </p><p>  To do this, you need: </p><ol><li>  Select "Operations" from the ATM menu. </li><li>  Click on "Request balance". </li><li>  Choose a way to display information. </li></ol><p>  Done!  We disassembled one of the methods.  But that is not all.  If desired, the citizen has the right to implement the task in other ways. </p><h2>  Telephone </h2><p>  For example, via telephone.  This is not the most common, but the situation is taking place.  Only the owner of the plastic can use it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to activate VTB 24 card via ATM" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2114630.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What exactly needs to be done?  How to activate VTB 24 card via phone?  The following instruction will help: </p><ol><li>  Dial the bank hotline number, which is indicated on its official website and on the card itself (on the back). </li><li>  Wait for operator response. </li><li>  Report on the need to activate banking plastic. </li><li>  Name the card number. </li><li>  Say the data requested by the operator.  Usually this is the owner's full name, passport information and code word. </li><li>  Wait a few minutes. </li></ol><p>  After the actions taken, the operator will fill out an application for activation of the plastic.  And in a few minutes it will be possible to use it.  There will be no difficulties in this case.  Immediately after completion of the process, it is allowed to use all the possibilities of plastic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Internet to help </h2><p>  How to activate VTB 24 card via the Internet?  The thing is that this option is used very actively.  But it is not as popular as the operation through an ATM.  Not everyone trusts online activation. </p><p>  To use this technique, the client must: </p><ol><li>  Get a bank card. </li><li>  Link plastic to a specific phone number.  This innovation appeared not so long ago. </li><li>  Register at VTB24-Online. </li><li>  Log in to your online banking profile. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  This will be enough to activate.  As soon as the client passes authorization on the service, his plastic will be determined as active.  You can enjoy all the benefits of online banking! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to activate VTB 24 salary card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2114631.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  registration </h2><p>  Note that far from always users know how to register in the service.  Where can I get login information?  Without this information, plastic activation via the Internet will not work.  This is a normal occurrence. </p><p>  What do I need to register for online banking?  Previously, it was enough to fill out an electronic form on the website of the company under study.  But recently, they decided to protect customers from scammers.  Now the login and password for Internet banking can be obtained exclusively at VTB 24 branches. </p><p>  How to act specifically?  A citizen must follow this type of instruction: </p><ol><li>  Prepare for surgery.  To do this, you need to bring along your phone, card and passport. </li><li>  Contact VTB 24 employees. </li><li>  Inform them about the desire to receive data for authorization in online banking. </li><li>  Fill out the application in the prescribed form. </li><li>  Wait for login details.  Usually they come to the specified mobile device tied to plastic. </li></ol><p>  Nothing difficult, incomprehensible or special.  As soon as a citizen completes the steps listed above, he will be able to use Internet banking.  After the first authorization, a bank card will be activated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to activate VTB 24 card via phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2114629.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Mobile banking </h2><p>  Also, you will have to bind the plastic to the mobile phone.  Otherwise, there will be problems with activation via the Internet.  In fact, the operation will become unavailable. </p><p>  To connect mobile banking to VTB 24 plastic, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Download a specialized application. </li><li>  Take passport, plastic and phone. </li><li>  Go to any department. </li><li>  Write an application for connecting banking. </li><li>  Get login information. </li><li>  Pay in advance a mobile banking package. </li></ol><p>  It is done!  Together with the username and password from the mobile bank, the client will be given a special card with codes.  They are needed to pass a security check.  When all combinations (and there are 112 of them) are spent, you will have to contact the VTB 24 department for new codes.  Not very convenient, but safe. </p><p>  If you go through authorization in a specialized application from the financial institution under study and request a plastic balance, you can hope for its successful activation.  But this alignment is rarely used to solve the task before us.  It is better to use the previously listed methods to achieve the ultimate goal. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  How to activate <span>VTB 24 salary card?</span>  Today, each client of the mentioned organization can choose a solution.  After processing the plastic, it is mandatory to activate it.  Or it remains to wait at least a day - then access to account operations will automatically open. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to activate VTB 24 bank card" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2114628.jpg"></div>

    <p>  When making plastic, the client receives a service agreement, as well as a card sealed in an envelope.  It will work only after activation.  We have already talked about how to bring an idea to life.  Everyone chooses how to act. </p><p>  How to activate <span>a VTB 24 bank card?</span>  The answer to this question will not cause any more trouble.  All actions are free.  An exception is the connection of mobile banking.  But this technique cannot be called direct activation of a bank card. </p><p>  If the client does not plan to work with plastic right away, he can just wait.  And then in a day a person will be provided with a full range of services by credit card.  Otherwise, it is recommended to activate yourself.  All of these methods are available at any time. </p>
