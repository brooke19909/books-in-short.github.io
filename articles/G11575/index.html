This rule is not spared and Doogee smartphones.  Knowing the shortcomings of the company will greatly facilitate the choice of apparatus and will avoid many problems. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Dodge phones have a pretty attractive appearance.  This applies even to state employees of the company.  Naturally, many decisions of designers were borrowed from market leaders, but this is a common practice. </p><p>  The material used for the device case also affects the appearance.  Cheap models are made mostly of plastic, but some flagships are made of various alloys.  Sometimes even leather inserts are found.  For example, the F5 model is made of an alloy resembling aluminum. </p>

    <p>  Without a doubt, the manufacturer does not save on materials.  Although unusual solutions periodically create unnecessary problems.  The body of the same F5 resembles metal, but the material can crack when bent.  Such a flaw in the flagship is very unpleasant. </p><p>  The Dodge Titan phone with additional protection has become more reliable.  This is the founder of a series consisting of three low-power smartphones.  All design elements are designed to increase the durability and strength of the device.  The device received not only plastic, but also rubber inserts.  In addition, the device was protected from moisture, drops, shock and dust. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Design is definitely a strong point, as the company pays attention to even low-cost devices.  Of course, most state employees are made of plastic, but there is no doubt in its quality. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  There are frankly weak spots in the manufacturer.  One of them is the camera apparatus.  Almost all state employees became owners of a five megapixel matrix, and the first Titan received even less - only 2 megapixels. </p><p>  Middle-class Dodge phones have 8 megapixels each, which is comparable to some low-cost devices.  If a good camera is not expected from a cheap device, then advanced series should have at least 13 megapixels. </p>

    <p>  This problem did not concern only the highest category of devices.  Almost the entire F series received excellent matrices.  Some flagships even use Samsung's camera technology.  And this is already pleasing. </p><p>  Some decisions of the company also cause fair bewilderment.  So, the five-megapixel camera from the X5 model absolutely without any changes migrated to the updated version with Pro postscript.  Although the novelty is more expensive, dramatic changes have not happened. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  You can evaluate the efforts of the company by seeing the display of the same "Dodge X5".  The phone from the budget series received as much as five inches with an excellent resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The screen of Doogee devices, of course, deserves attention.  Typically, a lower resolution is set to this display size.  Adds attractiveness and good color reproduction of almost all devices. </p><p>  The surprise was that most of the devices have an IPS matrix.  This gives Dodge devices high viewing angles, and also improves behavior in the sun.  Not even the most successful "Titan" with a diagonal of 3.5 inches received IPS technology. </p><p>  The manufacturer installed an LCD and even a TFT matrix in some smartphones, but the result, as we see, was not impressive.  Each of these technologies has its own shortcomings. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  "Dodge" prefers MTK processors, which are loved by many Chinese companies.  Of course, they are not famous for their high performance and power, but they can significantly reduce the cost of the device. </p><p>  When choosing a Dodge mobile phone, you should pay attention to the number of cores, as well as their clock frequency.  Although the company has set the bar high in this characteristic.  Even a weak ‚ÄúTitan‚Äù acquired two cores, each of which has one gigahertz. </p>

    <p>  The operating time on the devices of the company varies depending on the class of the device.  For example, the Dodge X5 (a budget series phone) was equipped with one gigabyte, and the F5 flagship received as much as three GB.  In the cheapest and easiest devices, the company sets a minimum of 512 megabytes. </p><p>  You should pay attention to the amount of memory built into the device.  A rare case for Doogee when the device has less than 8 gigabytes.  Such an exception was the first "Titan", which has a built-in 4 GB, and several more models.  The company's devices support flash drives up to 32 GB, and flagships up to 64 GB. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  Like many modern devices, Dodge phones are not the best centenarians.  The estimated duration of the public sector is 5 hours of active use.  The middle class and flagships will last only 3-4 hours. </p><p>  This situation arises from the "gluttonous" screens and the powerful stuffing of devices.  Standard batteries are not enough to meet all the needs of the devices.  Even in the F series, only 3000 mAh batteries are installed.  An advanced device is definitely not enough. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Adds attractiveness and the price requested for the Dodge phone.  The cost of the company's devices is very affordable and attractive.  The price ranges from about three to ten thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  For such a low cost, the owner will receive a good device that can perform most tasks.  Unfortunately, the Dodge flagships lag far behind famous brands.  They can be compared with the middle class. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Dodge phones have attracted the attention of users with quality displays.  Among other Chinese manufacturers, the company's screens stand out against the general background.  Although the diagonal of all devices is standard, the Dodge wins due to the large number of pixels. </p><p>  Not left behind and the design of phones.  The well-designed looks of both cheap and expensive devices greatly improve the Doogee experience.  It should be noted and the hardware of the gadgets.  Although the filling was not the most advanced, it satisfied a lot of requests.  The low cost attracts the company‚Äôs devices.  Even among Chinese counterparts, the price stands out markedly. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The original choice of case materials has become a real problem for some owners.  Alloys give similarities to metal, but have many disadvantages.  Lack of flexibility and the likelihood of cracks - this is what had to pay for a low cost.  The leather inserts of some devices feel like plastic, which many users did not like. </p>

    <p>  The autonomy of Dodge smartphones is also poor.  Batteries with a small capacity and greedy filling tie owners to sockets.  The only solution is to <span>replace the battery</span> or reduce the operation of the device. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Doogee is not a market leader, the manufacturer has something to offer.  Naturally, you have to come to terms with some of the shortcomings of the company, but definitely, it's worth it.  The company is developing very rapidly and will make itself known for sure. </p>
