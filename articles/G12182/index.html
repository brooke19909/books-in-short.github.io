In the modern world, it is not customary to live with parents, which is why, upon reaching a certain maturity, young people think about buying their own apartment.  Families planning to have a baby also need their own nest.  Of course, you can rent an apartment, but paying for someone else's property is the height of recklessness.  It is better to acquire your own housing, albeit on the terms of a mortgage.  Krasnodar is a large southern city, which is currently being actively built up.  It is here that excellent <span>residential complexes</span> with thoughtful layouts and developed infrastructure appear annually.  We want to bring to your attention LCD "Svetly" (Krasnodar, Moskovskaya, 144).  Feedback from the first buyers and residents will help evaluate the project from all sides. </p>

    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  What is so important for modern buyers?  Tired of boring and monotonous layouts and cramped courtyards, many of us dream of getting a spacious apartment located in a developed area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  And all these wishes are embodied in the Svetly residential complex (Krasnodar, Moscow, 144).  Two monolithic brick buildings, located parallel to each other, became a full decoration of this street. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location, transport accessibility </h2><p>  The developer claims that the Svetly residential complex (Krasnodar, 144 Moskovskaya St.) boasts an excellent location.  What do the inhabitants say?  So, this is a really large and densely populated area, surrounded by all the necessary infrastructure.  A tram stop is just a 7-minute walk away.  The only drawback is the lack of a proper storm system.  After the rain, Moskovskaya Street is flooded, it is simply impossible to move along the sidewalks.  The administration of the district promised to solve the problem with powerful pumps within the shortest period of time. </p>

    <p>  Car owners emphasize a new asphalt road.  Due to thoughtful transport interchanges, you can reach anywhere in the city within 15-20 minutes.  No car?  Not a problem, because public transport stops are only a few minutes away: bus number 71, tram number 15 and minibuses number 62 and 93 pass here. </p><h2>  Beautification </h2><p>  Modern complexes are distinguished not only by thoughtful layouts and developed infrastructure.  Construction companies pay much attention to the improvement of the surrounding area.  The Svetly residential complex was no exception (Krasnodar, Moskovskaya 144).  Responses of residents focus on the noble combination of white and beige in the decoration of facades.  All entrances are equipped with a passenger and freight elevator.  A pleasant surprise for the residents was free wireless Internet in the courtyard of the houses.  The yard is equipped in a closed fenced area and is under round-the-clock video surveillance, so parents can be absolutely calm for their children playing here.  By the way, as for the sites: these are excellent game and sports areas that meet all modern requirements, completely isolated from transport.  All entrances are equipped with comfortable ramps, so people with disabilities will be no less comfortable to live in the complex. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Ample parking is provided for residents and their guests. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  <span>Residential complex</span> on the street  Moscow, 144 in Krasnodar turned out not only beautiful, spectacular, but also comfortable.
