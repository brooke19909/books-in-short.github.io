What is inside the black hole?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For scientists of past centuries, and for researchers of our time, the biggest mystery of space is the black hole.  What is inside this completely unfamiliar system for physics?  What laws are there?  How does time go in a black hole, and why even quanta of light cannot escape from there?  Now we will try, of course, from the point of view of theory, and not practice, to understand what is inside the black hole, why it, in principle, was formed and exists, how it attracts the objects that surround it. </p><h2>  First, let's describe this object. </h2><p>  So, a black hole refers to a specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãspace in the universe.  It is impossible to distinguish it as a separate star or planet, since it is not a solid and not a gas body.  Without a basic understanding of what space-time is and how these measurements can be modified, it is impossible to comprehend what is inside a black hole.  The fact is that this area is not just a spatial unit.  <span>This is an object</span> that distorts both the three dimensions known to us (length, width and height), and the timeline.  Scientists are confident that in the horizon (the name of the area surrounding the hole), time takes on spatial significance and can move both forward and backward. </p>

    <h2>  Learn the secrets of gravity </h2><p>  If we want to understand what is inside a black hole, we will examine in detail what gravity is.  It is this phenomenon that is key in understanding the nature of the so-called ‚Äúmoleholes,‚Äù from which even light cannot be selected.  Gravity is the interaction between all bodies that have a material basis.  The force of such gravity depends on the molecular composition of bodies, on the concentration of atoms, as well as on their composition.  The more particles collapsed in a certain area of ‚Äã‚Äãspace, the greater the gravitational force.  This is inextricably linked to the Big Bang Theory, when our universe was the size of a pea.  This was a state of maximum singularity, and as a result of a flash of light quanta, space began to expand due to the fact that the particles repelled from each other.  The exact opposite is described by scientists as a black hole.  What is inside such a thing in accordance with the TBZ?  The singularity, which is equal to the indicators inherent in our universe at the time of its inception. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How does matter get into the ‚Äúwormhole‚Äù? </h2><p>  It is believed that a person can never understand what is happening inside a black hole.  Since, having got there, it will be literally crushed by gravity and gravity.  In fact this is not true.  Yes, indeed, a black hole is a region of singularity where everything is compressed to the maximum.  But this is not at all a ‚Äúspace vacuum cleaner‚Äù that can draw all the planets and stars into itself.  Any material object that appears on the horizon of events will observe a strong distortion of space and time (so far, these units stand separately).  The Euclidean system of geometry begins to fail, in other words, <span>parallel lines</span> intersect, the outlines of stereometric figures cease to be familiar.  As for time, it will gradually slow down.  The closer you get to the hole, the slower the clock will go relative to Earth time, but you will not notice it.  If it enters the ‚Äúwormhole‚Äù, the body will fall at zero speed, but at the same time this unit will equal infinity.  <span>This is a paradox of</span> curvature, which equates the infinite to zero, which finally stops time in the field of singularity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Light Response </h2><p>  The only object in space that attracts light is a black hole.  What is inside it and in what form it is there is unknown, but they believe that this is pitch darkness, which is impossible to imagine.  Light quanta, getting there, do not just disappear.  Their mass is multiplied by the mass of singularity, which makes it even larger and increases its <span>gravitational forces.</span>  Thus, if inside the "mole hole" you turn on the flashlight to look around, it will not light.  The emitted quanta will constantly multiply by the mass of the hole, and you, roughly speaking, will only aggravate your situation. </p>

    <h2>  Black holes at every turn </h2><p>  As we have already figured out, the basis for the formation of <span>points of no return</span> is gravity, the magnitude of which there is millions of times greater than the earth.  The exact idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat a black hole was presented to the world by Karl Schwarzschild, who, in fact, discovered the very horizon of events and the point of no return, and also established that zero in a state of singularity is equal to infinity.  In his opinion, a black hole can form anywhere in space.  In this case, a certain material object having a spherical shape must reach the gravitational radius.  For example, the mass of our planet must fit in the volume of one pea in order to become a black hole.  And the Sun should have a diameter of 5 kilometers with its mass - then its state will become singular. </p>

    <h2>  The horizon of the formation of a new world </h2><p>  The laws of physics and geometry work perfectly on the earth and in outer space, where space approaches vacuum.  But they completely lose their significance on the event horizon.  That is why, from a mathematical point of view, it is impossible to calculate what is inside a black hole.  Pictures that you can think of if you bend the space in accordance with our ideas about the world are probably far from the truth.  It has only been established that time here turns into a spatial unit and, most likely, some more are added to the existing measurements.  This makes it possible to believe that inside the black hole (the photo, as you know, will not show this, since the light eats itself there) completely different worlds are formed.  These universes may consist of antimatter, which is now unfamiliar to scientists.  There are also versions that the sphere of non-return is just a portal that leads either to another world or to other points of our universe. </p>

    <h2>  Birth and death </h2><p>  A much more <span>mysterious phenomenon</span> than the existence of a black hole is its nucleation or disappearance.  The sphere that distorts space-time, as we have already found out, is formed as a result of collapse.  It can be an explosion of a large star, a collision of two or more bodies in space, and so on.  But how did matter, which theoretically could be felt, turn into a region of time distortion?  The riddle is in the process of work.  But it is followed by a second question - why do such areas of non-return disappear?  And if black holes evaporate, then why doesn‚Äôt that light and all cosmic matter that they pulled in come out of them?  When a substance in a singularity zone begins to expand, gravity gradually decreases.  As a result, the black hole simply dissolves, and in its place the usual vacuum outer space remains.  Another mystery follows from this - where did everything that got into it go? </p><h2>  Is gravity our key to a happy future? </h2><p>  Researchers are confident that the energy future of mankind can form just a black hole.  It is still unknown what is inside this system, but it was possible to establish that on the event horizon any matter is transformed into energy, but, of course, partially.  For example, a person who is near the point of no return will give 10 percent of his matter to be converted into energy.  This figure is simply colossal, it became a sensation among astronomers.  The fact is that on Earth in <span>nuclear fusion,</span> matter is converted into energy by only 0.7 percent. </p>
