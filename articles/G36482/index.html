This town is located in the region of Umbria, which is literally surrounded by greenery.  Around the amazing beauty of nature, vineyards, harmony and silence.  Such impressions remain with most travelers who come here for the first time.  The town itself is relatively small, so most of the attractions can be explored in a few days.  Many of them keep mysterious secrets and secrets.  Sometimes it begins to seem that Orvieto himself has not changed at all since the Middle Ages. </p><h2>  History </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.villamonteporzano.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City of Orvieto in Italy" class="if uuid-2951393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2951393.jpg"></div><p>  Most of Orvieto's sights in Italy date back to ancient times.  At the site of this settlement in the VIII-III centuries BC there was an Etruscan city. </p><p>  Then he was captured by the Romans, and after the fall of this powerful empire, the episcopate from Bolsena was transferred here.  Before the formation of the commune in the X century, it was held by the Lombards and Goths.  Close was the connection with papal authority.  In 1016, the nephew of Pope Benedict VII Filippo Alberichi settled in the city and even became his consul. </p><p>  In 1201, self-government finally took shape here.  The main role was played by the Filipeschi, Monaldeschi and Alberichi families.  Currently, only the last genus has survived and still plays an important role in the life of Orvieto in Italy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city became a real cultural center of Western Italy after Thomas Aquinas began teaching at a local university.  Now there is a branch of the University of Perugia. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="42.7408884" data-lng="12.140403699999979" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/3/7/4/11374.png"></div><p>  The most convenient way to get to the city of Orvieto in Italy is to take the train.  Between Rome and Florence runs the so-called regional train, which just stops in this village. </p><p>  This is the best option to get from Rome to Orvieto in Italy.  A one-way ticket from the Italian capital will cost a little more than seven euros.  When you are in place, it is recommended to use the funicular for one euro to immediately get into the historical part of the city, where most of Orvieto's attractions in Italy are concentrated. </p><p>  During the walk you can move along the main street, turning by signs to the most interesting places.  Constantly move away from the funicular, moving deeper into the historical part of the city. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  If you wish, you can stay in this city for several days, so as to slowly enjoy all the sights.  If you came from Rome to Orvieto (Italy), then you could already see a large number of fascinating ancient buildings and structures, but here you will be surprised. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In Orvieto itself, there are several dozen hotels, inns and hostels.  For example, you can stay at the Oasi dei Discepoli, which is just two kilometers from Orvieto itself.  Several rooms offer views of the cliffs.  The hotel itself is located right in the middle of a huge park, and the road leading to it impresses with amazingly beautiful cypress trees.  The wooden reception has sofas and a bar.  All rooms are elegantly furnished, tastefully decorated and each has a private bathroom. </p><p>  An alternative is to stay at La Casa Di Tufo, located in a 5th-century building, literally 200 meters from the main square of Piazza della Repubblica.  It offers spacious studios with all the amenities that blend perfectly with the original architectural details.  All rooms offer beautiful views of the city or the courtyard.  A buffet breakfast is served here in the mornings.  The menu regularly includes fruits, cappuccino, cold cuts and cheese, and if desired, guests can prepare egg dishes. </p><p>  From here it is only 200 meters to the nearest bus stop, about ten minutes walk to the main attraction of Orvieto - the Gothic cathedral. </p><h2>  Restaurants </h2><p>  At the end of a busy day, you can relax in one of the city's restaurants.  It offers facilities with local and gourmet cuisine. </p><p>  Many tourists are advised to visit Ristorante La Badia.  Some are sure that they serve the most delicious wine in Orvieto (Italy).  Be prepared that it is quite expensive, but tasty and comfortable, in addition there is the opportunity to try unique medieval food. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  All visitors to the restaurants are strongly advised to try the local white wine ORVIETO CLASSICO.  It is made from grape varieties Grechetto, Trebbiano and Procaniko.  Traditions have been around for centuries, all of them are still carefully observed.  If you believe the legends, the wine in these places was originally produced by the Etruscans.  In the Middle Ages, locals learned how to make an amazing dessert wine, which goes well with local dishes. </p><h2>  Well of St. Patrick </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.edilcoscale.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Well of St. Patrick" class="if uuid-2951390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2951390.jpg"></div><p>  One of the first sights of Orvieto in Italy, which most travelers get to know, is the well of St. Patrick.  To inspect it you have to go down the circular stairs. </p><p>  Its construction began at the beginning of the XVI century, when Pope Clement VII settled in this city (Rome was captured at that time).  According to his plan, the well was to supply Albornoz fortress with water.  Donkeys and mules descended down one of the stairs, the vessels were filled with water, after which the animals were sent along a wooden bridge and another staircase upstairs. </p><p>  The depth of this well is 62 meters, the width is about thirteen.  To go down, you will need to overcome 248 steps.  From the wooden bridge you can clearly see how many coins are at the very bottom of the well. </p><h2>  Albornoz Fortress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.orvietoviva.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Albornoz Fortress" class="if uuid-2951391" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2951391.jpg"></div><p>  Albornoz fortress, for which water was extracted from the well of St. Patrick, is also located in the city of Orvieto in Italy.  It was built by order of the Spanish cardinal. </p><p>  Already in the XIX century it was in extremely poor condition, was partially destroyed and completely abandoned.  Currently, only one stone wall and a round tower remain from it. </p><p>  Not far from the fortress there is a city park in which local residents can spend their free time and relax with pleasure. </p><h2>  Cathedral </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.orvietoviva.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral" class="if uuid-2951389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2951389.jpg"></div><p>  According to tourists, in Orvieto (Italy) there is a cathedral, which, undoubtedly, is one of the main attractions of the city.  And of course, he deserves your attention. </p><p>  This object was built in the Roman Gothic style, it is considered one of the most beautiful in all of Italy.  Moreover, it is one of the smallest cathedrals in terms of area.  From a distance of five to six meters, you get the feeling that this magnificent building is ready to absorb you. </p><p>  The central facade is a real ensemble of all types of art.  The frescoes create a rich and sophisticated look, the side parts are made in black and white. </p><p>  In the XII century, the local cathedral was in very poor condition, so the construction of a new one began in 1290.  It was built in memory of an amazing miracle that happened in Bolsen.  In 1263, right during the Mass, real blood sprinkled from the guest, which appeared on the cover of the throne. </p><p>  The main works were completed in 1310.  One of the main features of this cathedral is that the central part of the facade is much higher and wider than the sides on which the tabernacle towers are located. </p><p>  The main pearl of the interior of the cathedral in Orvieto in Italy is the painting of the chapel of St. Bricius.  In the chapel you can see the painting "Resurrection in the Flesh" by Luca Signorelli, which was finished in 1502, as well as the frescoes of Fra Angelico. </p><p>  It is interesting that in the middle of the XIX century it was restored by Russian architects - Benoit, Rezanov, Krakau.  Today, in almost all photos from Orvieto in Italy, you can see this magnificent religious building. </p><p>  This city remained a papal residence for quite some time.  From here came Pope Boniface VII, who donated his statue to be installed on the main city gate.  This led to a scandal, criticism from his opponents. </p><h2>  Underground city </h2><p>  All tourists who find themselves in this ancient city are strongly advised to go on a tour of the underground Orvieto.  Be prepared that most often international groups gather, excursions are held in Italian or English. </p><p>  Here you will be told about underground caves, which still conceal many secrets and secrets, hidden from prying eyes.  For example, you can see the famous grotto of Hadrian. </p><p>  Most of these caves were originally intended to collect and store rainwater, as well as the production of the famous local wine.  That is why in some rooms you can see rectangular openings imitating a modern roof.  Once upon a time, pigeons laid eggs in them.  Some caves are still privately owned, so access to them is limited.  The bizarre patterns that can be seen on the walls amaze the imagination, an intriguing atmosphere is complemented by subdued light. </p><p>  Until now, many grottoes seem to be hidden in the surrounding lush vegetation. </p><p>  Etruscan ruins and the remains of the wall that existed in these places about two thousand years ago deserve attention. </p><h2>  Crucifix Necropolis </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.discoveryorvieto.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crucifix Necropolis from Tufa Read more: http://italia-ru.com/page/dostoprimechatelnosti-orvieto" class="if uuid-2951385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2951385.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by reviews of Orvieto (Italy), this is one of the most amazing sights of these places.  A necropolis made of tufa is located about seven hundred meters from the cathedral.  According to researchers, it was built in the third century AD. </p><p>  Some at the same time claim that the necropolis could initially resemble the plan of the most ancient Orvieto, so that its entire structure is by no means accidental.  Currently, about seventy tombs are open to the public. </p><p>  The first excavations in this necropolis began in the 19th century.  Many unique finds have been made here, some of which can be seen today in the British Museum and the Louvre.  A necropolis appeared in the time of the Etruscans, who sincerely believed in life after death.  Therefore, in the tombs with the deceased, they put things that they believed could be useful to them in the afterlife.  These are mirrors, jewelry, other household items.  They have been preserved quite well, so in our time it is possible to draw comprehensive conclusions about how life was arranged in these places in ancient times. </p><p>  Another religious building located about three kilometers from the city is the Abbey of Saints Martyrius and the North.  According to legend, it was founded by monks in the VI century. </p><p>  Since the beginning of the XII century, Benedictine monks began to settle here in large numbers, it was during this period that a church and a tower were erected.  Nowadays, on the walls of the cloister, travelers can see ancient murals depicting a crucifix and saints. </p><p>  Now there is a hotel and a restaurant on the territory of the abbey, so if you wish, you can stay overnight in this ancient and mysterious place. </p><h2>  Palace of the captain of the people </h2><div class="photo" data-original="agcult.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palace of the captain of the people" class="if uuid-2951388" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2951388.jpg"></div><p>  What else do tourists share in their reviews of Orvieto (Italy)?  In the photo above you can see the Palace of the captain of the people.  This building always attracts lovers of architectural monuments.  It was created approximately in the XIII century, later the structure itself was enlarged due to the tower attached to it.  In different eras, this residence housed a school, a pawnshop and a theater, now it is a tourist attraction that attracts tourists from all over the world. </p><p>  You should definitely see the church of St. Dominic.  It is located at a distance of about four hundred meters from the cathedral.  It is believed that this is the very first church that was erected by the Order of the Dominicans.  On its central facade you can see the marble Gothic portal of the XIII century, over which fragments of medieval frescoes have been preserved.  Artists many centuries ago depicted on them mainly the Madonna and Child.  Here you will also find the funeral chapel of Girolamo Petrucci, designed by the famous architect Michele Sanmichele. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Well cava" class="if uuid-2951387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2951387.jpg"></div><p>  In the Kava area, you can find the well of the same name if you continue to advance along the central street.  The area itself is a large gate to the city and the climb to a fairly steep rock.  Walking along this well, which is not very deep, especially in comparison with St. Patrick‚Äôs well, you will find yourself in an underground grotto that looks more like a mysterious cave.  There is also a cozy restaurant with local dishes and wine.  It is worth noting that for many centuries Kava has been a craft district, which has always been famous not only for the works of art of its masters, but also for taverns. </p><p>  Fans of medieval art should definitely look into the museum of works of the Duomo.  Most European cathedrals are characterized by the presence of a collection of outstanding works of art.  This museum consists of several rooms.  On the ground floor of the Soliano Palace you can get acquainted with the works of the Italian sculptor Emilio Greco, who lived in the 20th century, on the second tier there are mostly medieval exhibits.  These are utensils, household items, murals, jewelry made several centuries ago. </p>
