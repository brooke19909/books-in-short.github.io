    <p>  On the Red Sea coast, beach vacations are unforgettable - numerous reviews speak of this.  August in Egypt is famous for the fact that the water warms up to + 32 ¬∞ C off the coast. Warm water beckons to itself, and the sea breeze gives you a slight coolness.  The August heat is most easily carried by the sea, from which the wind constantly blows. </p><p>  To prevent high temperatures from spoiling your vacation, avoid the sun at noon, use special umbrellas to protect from the sun, protective creams and hats, and often dip in water.  Beach umbrellas are located along the entire coast of the Red Sea, while they reliably protect vacationers from the rays of the sun, which Egypt is generous at this time of year. </p><p>  Rest in August here is also a complete lack of stuffiness, familiar to our regions.  Desert areas have a small air humidity, therefore, breathing here is much more pleasant and easier even at high temperatures, sometimes reaching +45 ¬∞ C. But the heat is not completely felt, which often misleads tourists: they linger a little longer on the beach, they often get sunstroke and burns.  You need to remember this and be vigilant, so carefully read the numerous reviews. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  August in Egypt should be carried out leisurely, refraining from excursions in the afternoon, since air conditioners are not always able to withstand the heat in cars or buses, and scorching rays can negatively affect health.  During the day, it is better to stay in a hotel in your rooms. </p><p>  The sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãEgypt is best visited early in the morning or evening.  Of course, the country's beaches are perfect for relaxation.  On the coast, especially for lovers of sea holidays, there are all kinds of stations where you can easily rent sports equipment for active diving, snorkeling and surfing.  Refreshing trips on a yacht, aquabike, boat or catamaran on the Egyptian sea will give a huge amount of experience.  Water slides and rides will also help cool off during the August hot season. </p><h2>  Egypt.  August: weather during the day </h2><p>  The weather is almost never cloudy during the day, there is not a cloud in the sky all month, the temperature reaches +45 ¬∞ C at noon. Of course, during the day it is best to hide from the heat by the pool, and in the morning and in the evening devote oneself entirely to shopping, sightseeing, swimming have a relaxing holiday by the sea. </p><p>  We can conclude by reading reviews from experienced tourists that August in Egypt, subject to basic safety rules, will not cause vacationers any inconvenience.  Walking along the open sea or the shore will give a lot of positive, and for diving enthusiasts an excellent means of relaxation will be immersion in the purest sea waters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Evening and night </h2><p>  In August, there are more vacationers on the beaches in the evenings than in the daytime.  The effect of direct sunlight and heat affects, but the evening light and warm breeze attracts tourists who decide that it is suitable for a trip to Egypt in August.

    <p>  Of course, in different regions the temperature of sea water and air varies.  The hottest region of the country at this time is Luxor, where the thermometer in the shade reaches +40 ¬∞ C, and in the Valley of the Kings up to +60 ¬∞ C. At night it is relatively cool, about +23 ¬∞ C. Therefore, it is advisable not to take trips to the valley of the Sphinx and the pyramids. </p><p>  We can conclude by reading the reviews - August in Egypt is not good at all resorts.  The hottest will be Dahab, Nuweiba, El Quseyer, Taba, Sharm El Sheikh.  Here the air warms up to +36 <sup></sup>  during the day and about +28 <sup></sup>  at night.  In the Red Sea, the water temperature near the coast reaches an average of +29 <sup>about</sup> C. Sharm el-Sheikh is located near mountain ranges, which makes the climate of the area milder. </p><p>  In other resort areas, the climate is slightly milder.  For example, in Safaga, Makadi Bay, Hurghada, Marsa Alam, El-Gouna, in August the air warms up on average in the daytime to +33 ¬∞ C, and at night to +25 ¬∞ C. The following must be taken into account when arriving at this time of year to Egypt: a seaside vacation is suitable for lovers of warm water, since its temperature during the day is around +28 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  Alexandria boasts the mildest climate at this time.  Here in August, fairly mild weather persists, which attracts the majority of tourists.  Here during the day +32 ¬∞ C, at night up to +27 ¬∞ C, and the water temperature reaches +25 ¬∞ C. There is no rain.  Due to this, in August, tourists prefer to relax in the Mediterranean. </p>

    <h2>  Sea of ‚Äã‚Äãegypt </h2><p>  This summer month it is clean and gentle, there are no high waves, no storm.  Cute harmless fish swim in the water off the coast. </p><p>  Of course, August is not the best time for excursions.  In the desert, the exhausting heat, hot sandstorms and the constant sun-scorching joy from the excursion will not bring, rather, they will cause troubles and discomfort. </p><p>  August is a month intended exclusively for water recreation.  A trip across the Nile will seem wonderful.  A full-flowing river and evergreen trees compensate for the sweltering heat.  The cabins have air conditioning that cools the hot air of the tropics. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that swimming in the sea waters of Egypt can be very enjoyable if you do not neglect basic safety rules, for example, swim in a shirt with sleeves or a T-shirt.  This will help protect your shoulders and arms from burning.  You should take air and sun baths in August only in the morning and in the evening, when the sun is soft and does not burn.  In the afternoon it is better to stay in the apartments or by the pool.  In the hotel room, daytime sleep will be able to compensate for the lack of strength that was spent at night on walks, parties, when visiting nightclubs. </p><h2>  El Gouna in August </h2>

    <h2>  Sharm El Sheikh </h2><p>  This resort is a true paradise for fans of coral reefs.  They are not in vain compared with the <span>gardens of Eden.</span>  Fishing is prohibited here, boats do not moor here, so the unique coral flora is fully preserved. </p><h2>  Fragrant fruits in Egypt in August. </h2><p>  Going here in August, you can expect that you can taste all the charm of <span>Egyptian fruits:</span> tender, fresh, juicy.

    <h2>  Possible dangers for tourists </h2><p>  First of all, these are ‚Äúnatural enemies‚Äù: tap water (intended exclusively for outdoor consumption, you need to drink bottled water), the burning sun (the climate in Egypt in August is quite dangerous in the afternoon, but a sunscreen with a fairly high degree of protection will help), the sea.  In order not to spoil your <span>vacation in Egypt,</span> either to yourself or your relatives, do not grab underwater animals by your hands, try to go carefully in the water, preferably in special slippers.  When doing snorkeling or swimming, wear a long-sleeved T-shirt so you can protect yourself from possible burns. </p><p>  In Egypt, <span>social dangers are</span> as real as in another tourist country.  Follow the precautionary rules and you will not run into trouble: do not leave valuables in your room, do not carry large amounts of money with you, do not wander around the city alone at night, do not wander into little-known alleys and remote areas of the city. </p><p>  In addition, do not forget that this is a Muslim country.  On excursions and walks in the city, try to dress modestly (especially if you are a pretty woman) - this will help you to walk freely, avoiding onlookers too much attention. </p><p>  August is a great time to relax in Egypt.  A lot of free hotels, warm sea, azure pools, low prices and availability of rooms in hotels - all this contributes to a quality rest.  We can say with confidence that after such a trip, every tourist will have only positive emotions.  Have a nice rest! </p>
