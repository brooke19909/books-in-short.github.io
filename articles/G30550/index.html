Using a mobile phone: a description of the advantages and disadvantages</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At present, it is difficult to find a person who would not use mobile services.  Even the smallest representatives of our society already have a functional gadget connected to the world wide web called the Internet.  Let's try to understand the pros and cons of mobile phones. </p><h2>  What is a mobile phone? </h2><p>  A cell or mobile phone is a device designed to transmit voice information over a distance.  This process is being implemented through the provision of communication services by mobile operators.  Their towers synchronize devices with each other. </p><p>  The transmission of voice information is only one of the functions that can be on a mobile phone.  The device itself is small, involves the installation of a SIM card, thanks to which the ability to use communication appears. </p><h2>  Using a mobile phone in everyday life </h2><p>  The phone in our life is not only used for voice messaging.  This unit can send short messages, go online and synchronize with GPS stations to determine the coordinates. </p><p>  It‚Äôs hard to imagine life without a cell phone.  Numerous applications that are installed on the device thanks to operating systems make our life much easier.  A modern mobile phone combines several devices at once, which we use constantly. </p><p>  The phone can act as an alarm clock, computer, personal nutritionist or fitness trainer.  Thanks to applications, we can control our motor activity, it becomes possible to monitor nutrition and enter all data into a special program. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of a push-button telephone </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gigazine.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Push-button phones" class="if uuid-2497715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77293/2497715.jpg"></div><p>  Some conservative people still use the most primitive communication devices.  This is convenient if the phone is needed only for communication.  We list the main pros and cons of <span>push-button phones.</span> </p><p>  Pros: </p><ul><li>  simple and accessible interface; </li><li>  mechanical buttons for dialing or message; </li><li>  the battery holds a charge for a long time; </li><li>  apparatuses are strong and hardy; </li><li>  older models had strong antennas for communication. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  limited functionality; </li><li>  there is no way to take a photo or video of good quality; </li><li>  using the Internet is very inconvenient; </li><li>  small and dim display; </li><li>  there is no way to expand functionality with additional applications; </li><li>  some models are not designed for new three-pin SIM cards; </li><li>  There is no possibility of synchronization with some modern accessories. </li></ul><p>  Only the most basic disadvantages of push-button phones are listed.  From the above, we can draw the following conclusion: if you are an active and modern user of devices, then a push-button telephone as the main device for use will not work for you.  And for older people, a phone with buttons is a great option to always stay in touch. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of a smartphone </h2><div class="photo" data-original="9to5mac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phones with operating system" class="if uuid-2497718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77293/2497718.jpg"></div><p>  The most common phones at the moment.  A smartphone is a telephone that has an operating system, which allows you to install various software on it.  Here are 5 pluses and 5 minuses of phones with an operating system. </p><p>  Pros: </p><ol><li>  It is possible to install applications from any area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest. </li><li>  A built-in camera, as a rule, is of good enough quality.

The most important thing is to skillfully use this functionality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of a shockproof phone </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.smartech.ee" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shockproof Phones" class="if uuid-2497713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77293/2497713.jpg"></div><p>  There is a whole line of super-resistant models of devices that are designed for active people.

Consider the pros and cons of cellular communications. </p><p>  Pros: </p><ol><li>  You can always call your loved ones and ask questions that concern you. </li><li>  Communication is possible even at very large distances. </li><li>  The Internet, which is available 24 hours a day, gives us the necessary amount of necessary information. </li></ol><p>  Minuses: </p><ol><li>  Radio emission, which acts on the body constantly, causes damage to all life systems. </li><li>  Communication is only in the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe mobile operator.  In territories far from settlements, you will not be able to use communication services. </li><li>  Some people become dependent on a cell phone. </li></ol><p>  Experts recommend using cellular communication no more than 5-10 min / day.  During this time, the dose of exposure to electromagnetic waves on the body is not critical.  Now let's try to calculate how much time we spend per day on communication.  The phone is always near us, even during sleep.  All this time, the body is exposed to radio emission. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of Samsung Phones </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestproducts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phones Samsung" class="if uuid-2497730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77293/2497730.jpg"></div><p>  Samsung's smartphone lineup is constantly popping up new, modern models.

Even the smallest kids already know how to turn on their favorite game on a smartphone.  Consider the positive and negative aspects of the effect of phones on children. </p><p>  Pros: </p><ol><li>  The child is always in touch. </li><li>  You can track the exact coordinates of a child‚Äôs location using a GPS receiver. </li><li>  A telephone with Internet access can become an assistant in the educational process. </li></ol><p>  Minuses </p><ol><li>  Electromagnetic radiation causes damage to a child‚Äôs developing organism. </li><li>  Entertainment applications and games distract from learning. </li><li>  A game addiction is formed, the child is closed. </li><li>  Interest in mobile and intelligent live games is lost. </li><li>  There is stress and hysteria in the absence of the ability to use the phone or the Internet. </li></ol><p>  Modern children have become so dependent on electronic devices and phones in particular, that in some cases they project the digital world of games on real life conditions.  The cruelty and imbalance of some children in most cases is connected precisely with gambling addiction. </p><h2>  Modern devices </h2><p>  Modern phones manufactured using innovative technologies have wide functionality.  It is very convenient and practical to use one device, which includes the functions of a dozen other devices.  The compact size of a modern phone allows you to carry it with you without any discomfort. </p><p>  Some advanced users change several devices per year.  This is due to the fact that new models are constantly being released that have slight differences from their predecessors.  The most interesting functional innovations in recent years are presented in the list: </p><ul><li>  fingerprint detector; </li><li>  face recognition; </li><li>  voice control; </li><li>  remote control of other devices from the phone; </li></ul><p>  These are just some of the features that are present in the functionality of a modern phone.  With the further development of digital technology, devices will be even more powerful and smart. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Considering the pros and cons of cell phones, we can conclude that these devices give us many advantages in terms of communications, and also allow you to use advanced functionality in various fields of application. </p>
