Most senior citizens say that this is really a big plus card.  The pluses include the possibility of contactless payment. </p><h2>  FAQ </h2><p>  Most owners of the MIR retirement debit card wonder why they received the national payment system card when replacing the Maestro card.  On the territory of Russia, the law ‚ÄúOn the National Payment System‚Äù is in force, according to which all banks in our country are required to credit pensions, scholarships and allowances only to cards of the MIR payment system.  Therefore, upon re-issuance by validity period, instead of a Maestro pension card, individuals are issued a MIR card. </p><p>  It is also very often possible to find the question of whether it is necessary to issue a card only in the region where the person is registered.  Sberbank notes that a standard debit card of Sberbank can be ordered in any region of the country, however, a social or pension card can be obtained only in the region where an individual has a residence permit. </p><p>  After analyzing how to get a debit card from Sberbank, we also examined the advantages and disadvantages of the cards of the MIR payment system.  In addition, the Sberbank bonus system, which has the name "THANKS", was considered. </p>
