Fans of elite relaxation are attracted by the glamorous Yalta, tourists who prefer a noisy city with developed infrastructure - Alushta, Sevastopol, but those who love a quiet family and inexpensive vacation should pay attention to a small village called Malorechenskoye. </p><h2>  Crimea, Malorechenskoye - a cozy village near the Black Sea </h2><p>  The small cozy village of Malorechenskoye is located on the very shore of the sea, between two well-known resort towns - Alushta and Sudak.  This village belongs to the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBig Alushta (Crimea). </p>

    <p>  A central alley leads from the center to the sea, on both sides of which are sellers of souvenir products and several tents with sellers of excursions. </p><p>  What about the sights that Crimea is so rich in?  Malorechenskoye is no exception.  In the village there is a beautiful church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, which is located on a rock.  It was built not very long ago, and they call it the lighthouse church, as it also serves as a lighthouse.  This monastery was erected in honor of the dead sailors.  In the basement of the temple there is a museum, the theme of which is marine disasters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Housing in Malorechenskoye </h2><p>  The choice of housing in Malorechensk is quite diverse.  In the village there are several large pensions and resorts with their own beaches.  They have been working since Soviet times, but in recent years they have been quite actively landscaping and undergoing reconstruction.  Visitors can rent comfortable deluxe or tasndart rooms in mini-hotels and numerous hotels.  However, the private sector is most in demand in the village of Malorechenskoye (Crimea). </p>

    <p>  The hospitable local people are actively offering a wide selection of housing.  Cozy apartments and comfortable rooms are rented at relatively low prices.  In the private sector, you can choose housing even for a very modest amount, the owners offer discounts and good living conditions.  Almost every local resident in his yard has a real mini-boarding house that can offer tourists a comfortable and decent vacation in Crimea. </p><p>  Malorechenskoye is a small village, but the choice of housing is very wide.  There is even a tent camp for lovers of wild relaxation. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  What positive and negative points can be noted about the rest in the village of Malorechenskoye (Crimea)?  The reviews of vacationers will help to understand this and assess the general situation. </p><p>  Reviews about holidays in Malorechka are very contradictory and depend on the intentions with which every tourist travels to Crimea.  Malorechenskoye is idolized by those vacationers who prefer a modest vacation away from the bustle of the city, who value silence, unity with nature, the purity of the sea and pacification.  Tourists with such a mood appreciated this quiet corner and leave only positive reviews. </p>

    <p>  Negative reviews are connected with the same detachment of the village.  Some tourists call the rest in Malorechensky boring and dull, they say that there is nowhere to go, that there are no nightclubs and noisy parties on the beach. </p><p>  About the beach and the sea mostly leave positive reviews.  However, here some find a negative.  Either they don‚Äôt like the pier, then the boulders on the beach. </p><p>  In short, there is no companion for the taste and color.  Each vacationer must decide in advance what he expects from the rest, so that later there will be no disappointments and irritations. </p>
