    <h2>  About booking </h2><p>  Going to Tenerife, to the Canary Islands, you should familiarize yourself with the conditions of the hotel in advance.  So, the check-in starts at 14:00, so the flight needs to be selected closest to this time.  Departure, in turn, lasts until noon. </p><p>  The hotel allows children with any age.  Moreover, if guests come with a baby who is not two years old, he will be provided with a free cot.  And if guests know in advance that they will leave with a small child, they need to contact the administration in advance so that they can prepare everything.  Or you can indicate your wishes about the crib when booking, in the window provided for this purpose. </p><p>  By the way, you will need to provide your credit card details.  Ole Tenerife Tropical accepts Visa, Maestro and Master Card.  You only need to use your card, because it will need to be presented upon check-in, and the data on it must match the name of F. I. O. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  People who have visited Tenerife in the Canary Islands and stayed at this hotel are happy to talk about their pastime in it.  They pay special attention to the location - away from the bustle of the city and close to the beach. </p><p>  The hotel itself is quite quiet (when compared with Turkey and Egypt), which many consider a plus.  However, even amateurs who like to have fun in it will enjoy show programs in the evenings, and alcohol is pouring in the bar in the bar.  But only until 23:00. </p><p>  There are many attractions and simply interesting places nearby, so the complex will appeal to those who cannot live without walking.  But in general, people recommend renting a car (for this you can contact the reception manager directly).  You can‚Äôt be at this resort and not travel around the whole island.  And to the local water parks, by the way, you can get on a free bus, the stop of which is opposite the hotel, on a small hill. </p>

    <h2>  Nuances to Know </h2><p>  Going on vacation to this hotel, it is recommended to bring a bath towel with you.  They are provided at the hotel, but according to some reviews, they do not differ in whiteness and novelty. </p><p>  There are no bathrobes and slippers, but cosmetic accessories are provided - shampoos, shower gels and soap.  Maids replenish daily supplies by cleaning, so you can not take care products with you.  But here that will help to cope with insects and mosquitoes should be taken.  Sometimes there are too many of them, so at least one fumigator in the bag does not hurt. </p><p>  As regards check-in and check-out, you can agree to extend the time frame.  You must notify the administration in advance.  Extra charge will be required, but it will not exceed half the daily room rate.  If additional expenses are not satisfied, you can use the guest waiting room to pass the time before checking in or before leaving, so as not to arrive at the airport too early. </p><h2>  What else do guests say? </h2><p>  Guests who have visited this property also describe the Ole Tenerife Tropical service.  They say that it corresponds to the declared level.  Linen is changed 3-4 times a week, and cleaning is carried out daily. </p><p>  The complex also has very attentive and responsible administrators who can be contacted for any reason.  True, only in Spanish or English, since they do not speak Russian. </p><p>  By the way, guests staying in this complex recommend checking into rooms located above the fifth floor of the Ole Tenerife Tropical.

    <h2>  Other reviews </h2><p>  In general, as you can see, this hotel leaves mostly positive impressions of the guests.  Many, leaving reviews, describe in detail the power system, which was already mentioned earlier.  It is said that there are even dishes for vegetarians and dieters.  And for connoisseurs of alcoholic beverages, this is a real paradise - everything is of high quality and undiluted.  Especially good wine.  Be sure to grab at least one bottle home - it costs a lot in stores. </p><p>  What about the beach?  It is clean and spacious with sun loungers and umbrellas.  But they are paid, so many just take towels with them.  There is always free space in the sand.  Moreover, the beach is constantly cleaned, so there is no dirt and debris on it. </p><p>  Ocean water is definitely a must for lovers of coolness.  Connoisseurs of "fresh milk" will be dissatisfied.  But such is the specificity of the ocean.  However, 20-22 degrees is the normal temperature for swimming.  But there is no sweltering heat, even in high season.  Because in Tenerife, refreshing breezes reign almost constantly.  And many attribute this to significant advantages, since you can leave the hotel for a walk at any time of the day and not be afraid to catch a heat stroke.  While at other popular resorts at a budget level it is better not to leave the hotel from noon until three to four in the afternoon. </p><p>  Well, summarizing, we can say that Ole Tenerife Tropical is a good hotel complex, which will appeal to lovers of a decent level of service, comfort and a delicious varied food. </p>
