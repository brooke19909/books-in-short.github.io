With the advent of the ancient Romans, the construction of a small policy began, which, after several centuries, turned into Alcal√° de Henares. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Alcal√° de Henares" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1275923.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the VIII century, the city, which received its current name, was under Arab rule, but several centuries later it was recaptured by Spanish troops, who settled here densely.  Due to its very advantageous geographical position, it led a lively trade and developed economically. </p><p>  For many years, representatives of various religious faiths peacefully coexisted in the city: Jews, Muslims and Christians. </p><h2>  Prosperity and decline </h2><p>  After the signing of the decree of the King of Castile on the opening of an educational institution that received the blessing of the Pope of Rome and turned into one of the most famous universities in the 15th century, the city acquired the status of the country's cultural center. </p><p>  Later, Alcala de Henares fell into decay, and the university was transferred to the capital of Spain.  Now it has actually become a suburb of Madrid, turning into a sleeping area. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cervantes House Museum </h2><p>  A small town has a lot of attractions that tourists from all over the world come to see. </p><p>  Locals are extraordinarily proud of the house-museum of the famous writer Cervantes, who became famous for his work about Don Quixote.  The author of an immortal novel was born in 1547 and did not live long in his native city.  Miguel de Cervantes studied at the university with other figures of Spanish literature. </p><h2>  Memory of a past era </h2><p>  The museum has a huge collection of books about the ingenious hidalgo, published in all languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world.  In front of a plain-looking building, sculptures of Don himself and his faithful servant Sancho Panza froze.  All visitors to the museum take pictures with them as a keepsake, but you can‚Äôt shoot indoors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="archbishop's palace" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1275928.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Living rooms reproduce the interiors of the time when the great Miguel de Cervantes created, and visitors seem to be transported to the era of beautiful ladies, in whose honor feats were accomplished. </p><h2>  Main square </h2><p>  The city reverently preserves the memory of his beloved writer and is proud of him, therefore the popular main square, which cannot be ignored, is named after him.  Unrecognized during his lifetime, a genius died in poverty in Madrid, but after his death, Alcal√° de Henares remembered the talent and began to glorify his name. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Earlier on the territory of the city market, and now the square, executions and bullfights were carried out.  Nowadays, two ancient chapels from the medieval church and the restored font in which Cervantes was baptized are attracting special attention. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alcal√° de Henares" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1275920.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the center of Plaza Cervantes, a bronze statue of the famous Renaissance humanist flaunts.  Quiet and cozy square, surrounded by cute houses in the traditional Spanish style, pleases the views of foreigners. </p><p>  The city hall of Alcal√° de Henares, once a former monastic monastery, is also located there. </p><h2>  The longest street </h2><p>  And from the square is the longest Spanish street with porticoes.  Many centuries ago it was Jewish, and in its covered part stood the shops of merchants.  The main street is still of interest to guests of the city, it is filled with beautiful terraces where you can drink sparkling wine and try the local cuisine. </p><h2>  Food festivals </h2><p>  The townspeople have a special attitude to food, and they often hold gastronomic festivals that last a week.  All Alcal√° de Henares restaurants, serving traditional dishes, take part in them.  Hearty caldosa broths, garlic soups, <span>roasted chestnuts,</span> donuts and puff pastry pies are noted. </p><h2>  Palacio arzobispal </h2><p>  Not far from the central square is the Archbishop's Palace, built in the Gothic and Moorish styles.  The building that is being reconstructed many times today is a magnificent ensemble recognized as a historical treasure of the city. </p><p>  Luxurious royal receptions were seen on the walls of the palace, where the archives of the Inquisition are kept, and there was a meeting between the unknown Columbus and Isabella I of Castile when the details of his future journey were discussed. </p><h2>  University of San Ildefonso </h2><p>  You can not ignore the old university, which resumed its work 39 years ago, talking about local attractions.  Alcala de Henares is proud that the huge book collection of the institution can only compete with the wealth of libraries of the Vatican city-state. </p>
