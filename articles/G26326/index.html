Koh Samui or Koh Samui is the third largest and second most famous island, after Phuket, located in the waters of the Gulf of Thailand.  It is separated from the capital by 500 kilometers, but there are no direct flights to the resort. </p><h2>  How to get to the resort island </h2><p>  Fortunately, there are proven ways to get to the island and get to the Fair House Beach Resort Hotel.  They differ in speed and cost, so everyone can find a convenient option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expedia.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coast on the island" class="if uuid-3261006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51366/3261006.jpg"></div><p>  The fastest option is Bangkok Airways flights, which deliver tourists to the island in bus mode.  These flights are frequent, up to 12 times a day, and last only an hour and ten minutes.  From the plane to the hotel, tourists are transported by fun trams or combi jeeps.  Taxi services are also available.  The downside is that the method is very expensive. </p><p>  It will be less costly to reach the island with AirAsia.  Airplanes fly from the small Don Muang Airport, where you can get by taxi, and fly to the cities adjacent to the island, from there you need to take a ferry to Samui.  This method is half the price, and the situation can be further eased by ordering combined tickets for flights and ferries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can also get to the Fair House Beach Resort Hotel and by train, thus lowering costs, especially since trains also differ in terms of comfort.  The first class is a coupe with air conditioning for two, the second without air conditioning, but, according to tourists, the most convenient and pleasant for the price.  In the third grade there are only soft chairs.  The trip takes 8 hours, it is better to take night flights in order to arrive at the ferry in the morning. </p><p>  The most inconvenient but economical way to transfer from Bangkok to the island is by bus, which takes you to the first ferry in 11 hours.  The ship will sail to the Cote d'Azur in an hour and a half. </p><h2>  Climate on Koh Samui </h2><p>  A tourist who came to the Fair House Beach Resort Hotel, on the island is waiting for a real paradise.  These are endless beaches with white sand, sprawling palm trees and fragrant flowers.  This corner of the planet was created in order to relax, enjoy clean air, free from urban smog.  The island is surrounded by numerous beaches, and even at the height of the season, you can find a secluded beach for unity with nature. </p><p>  The clear waters of the Gulf of Thailand and the favorable climate attract tourists from all over the world. </p><p>  A tropical humid climate suggests the rainy season.  It falls mainly between September and January, but even at this time it makes sense to visit the resort.  The ‚Äúwet‚Äù season is a period of low prices at Fair House Beach Resort Hotel 4 and a place free of tourists on the island.  Rains also turn small waterfalls, which are many on the island, into turbulent, grandiose streams of water.  Watching them is a pleasure! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The peak of the resort‚Äôs attendance falls on the ‚Äúdry‚Äù season, from February to April.  The rest of the months there are rains, but they are short and refreshing.  Despite the change of seasons, the island is always warm, and even during the monsoon it is not cold here and the water has a temperature of +27, +28 degrees, and the air +30, +32. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In addition to the pristine nature in the heart of Koh Samui, contrasting with the developed infrastructure on the coast, the chic Fair House Beach Resort Hotel 3 will make a comfortable stay. </p><p>  It is located isolated from the bustle of civilization.  Surrounded by strange plants and pleasant sounds of nature, the Fair House Beach Resort Hotel immediately captures the love of its guests.
