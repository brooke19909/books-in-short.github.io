  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What are amino acids</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Perhaps, practically everyone knows what amino acids are.  These are inherently the constituent proteins that make up any living organism, starting with the largest animal and ending with a tiny microbe.  In all processes that occur in the body, various forms of proteins are involved. </p><p>  It is from them that ligaments, muscles, tendons, all glands and organs, nails and hair are formed in the human body.  Proteins are found in bones and fluids.  They are hormones and enzymes that regulate and catalyze all processes in the body. </p><p>  With their deficiency in the body, a violation of the water balance occurs, and this in turn causes edema.  Proteins are not interchangeable.  Each of them is unique.  And each of them in the body has a special purpose. </p><p>  They are synthesized from amino acids, the formation of which occurs as a result of the breakdown of proteins directly found in various food products.  Therefore, we can conclude that such amino acids. </p><p>  These are precisely the most valuable <span>nutrients</span> that the body needs so much.  Although previously it was believed <span>that such substances</span> were proteins.  As it turned out, such an opinion is erroneous, since any protein that comes with food is broken down into amino acids in the body. </p><p>  It is they, these individual composite particles, that are subsequently used to create the body's own proteins.  It is important to know what amino acids are directly for the body, and what role they play. </p><p>  First of all, they are needed in order to maintain the functionality of various <span>vital</span> and necessary processes in the body.  In turn, amino acids are usually divided into two categories: essential and non-replaceable. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The former deserved such a name due to the fact that the body is not able to synthesize them on their own.  This is a confirmation that they can only be obtained in the only way - from the food products in which they are contained.  In addition, such amino acids, the use of which can be prescribed in the form of specialized additives and complexes, are very important for the body. </p><p>  The second category of amino acids is interchangeable, which the body is able to synthesize on its own.  Therefore, getting them from food daily is optional.  But in certain cases, some of them may well become indispensable. </p><p>  This is mainly due to the fact that the body has an increased need for these amino acids.  Under certain circumstances, the body's need for such elements increases significantly, and this leads to the fact that it becomes unable to produce a sufficient number of them. </p><p>  After ascertaining what amino acids are, it should be noted that some of them in some cases play the role of neurotransmitters or neurotransmitters.  And sometimes they are their predecessors.  Neurotransmitters are chemicals that transmit a nerve impulse from one nerve cell to another. </p><p>  So, some amino acids are extremely important for the normal functioning of the brain.  The transmission speed of one or another impulse sometimes depends on them, which means that the reaction is timely. </p><p>  In addition, amino acids contribute to the proper and adequate fulfillment by vitamins and minerals of their functions.  Some of them are a source of energy supply to muscle tissue.  Therefore, today many athletes replenish their amino acid reserves in the body with various specialized supplements. </p><p>  In total, about 28 amino acids are known, most of which are synthesized in the liver.  The most important for the normal coordinated work of the body are the chemical properties of amino acids, that is, their direct ability to enter into any reactions. </p><p>  These properties are determined by the properties of the side radical.  Conventionally, all amino acids are divided into several groups.  The greatest chemical stability is in those that contain an aliphatic radical as a side residue.  These include valine, isoleucine, alanine, and leucine.  They are practically not subject to chemical modification. </p>
