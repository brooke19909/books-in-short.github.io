For starters, I would like to look around in a warm and comfortable room and begin to adapt to the cracking frosts.  But what if you have to wait for baggage in the open air, wander from the ramp to the terminal building through the snowdrifts?  This article is for those who fly to the city of Novy Urengoy. </p><p>  The airport was previously called Yagelnoe.  What awaits a traveler arriving at this air harbor?  How to get from it to the city?  This will be discussed below. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novy Urengoy Airport" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1773497.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Airport History </h2><p>  Neither schools, nor hospitals, and the population is only 520 people - such was the city of Novy Urengoy in the early seventies of the last century.  The airport was opened here in 1975 solely for the delivery of goods associated with the use of a gas condensate field.  However, the air harbor had a great future.  Indeed, the presence of a paved runway made it possible to accept passenger ships.  Novy Urengoy began to communicate with other cities of Russia, which gave impetus to its development. </p><p>  In 1980, the first passenger terminal was built - a wooden wretched hut.  Then the first passenger flight on the Tu-134 was completed.  In 2012-2014  OJSC "Novy Urengoy United Squadron" began to equip the air harbor.  A single insulated terminal complex was erected.  The plans included the construction of a new terminal.  However, the financing of the airport was transferred to the district level, and due to lack of funds, plans had to be postponed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Novy Urengoy: airport today </h2><p>  When this air harbor was supported by federal funding, it was one of the most developed in the Yamal-Nenets Okrug.  Now the airport is assigned the second class.  But still, before 2014, they managed to build a long and wide runway, so Novy Urengoy can accept ships of any type of gravity.  The airport connects the city with twenty-three settlements of Russia.  Boeing (including heavy 737 and 757), Bombardier, Sukhoi Superjet 100, Tu, Il, An, Yak and lighter ships can land here.  There are also <span>helipads.</span>  The capacity of the air harbor is two hundred thousand people per year.  High-tech ground base and professional staff provide impeccable service to travelers and flight safety of liners. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Airport r new urengoy" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1773498.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Airport Services </h2><p>  Airborne belongs to the second class.  Unfortunately, it does not work around the clock.  All flights are made at night or in the morning.  Therefore, the airport‚Äôs opening hours are from 01:30 to 12:30. </p><p>  What about the services?  The terminal is two-story.  At the first level are the reception, ticket office, other services.  The second floor is fully reserved for the waiting room.  There is a left-luggage office, a newsstand.  More detailed information about the services will give you the airport website.  Novy Urengoy is connected with its air harbor by bus route.  Near the airport there is a cafe "Parallel".  The terminal building is well heated.  Tip: it‚Äôs better to use the toilet while still on the plane. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Airport site Novy Urengoy" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1773500.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to overcome the route airport - Novy Urengoy </h2><p>  Air Harbor Address: ul.  Trunk, 1, the Aviator microdistrict.  This is the southwestern outskirts of the city.  The airport and the city center of Novy Urengoy are about 5 km away.  This distance can easily be overcome by taxi.  The car stop is located near the exit of the terminal.  Traveling to the desired place in the city will take about 10-15 minutes and will cost 300 rubles.  There is a more economical way to get to the city.  This is bus number 3. It runs between the airport and the city's train station.  A bus ticket costs only 20 rubles.  But this option is not suitable for those who fly to Novy Urengoy at night.  After all, the first bus leaves at 6:17 in the morning.  The interval between machines depends on the time of day and days of the week.  The bus will have to wait on average about 20 minutes. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What do travelers say about this airport?  G. Novy Urengoy is a frequently visited settlement.  We can say that it is one of the important centers of the gas industry in Russia, so it is surprising to see that the air harbor of Novy Urengoy meets the arriving passengers with Spartan conditions.  A warm room and several services are all that the airport can provide travelers with.  Reviews say that even the seats in the waiting room are few.  But airport workers are doing everything possible to make passengers comfortable.  There are no queues during check-in.  All pre- and post-flight procedures pass very quickly. </p>
