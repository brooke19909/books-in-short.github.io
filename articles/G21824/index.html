    <h2>  How to get to the village of Arkhipo-Osipovka </h2><p>  The Sea Star Hotel is located at 10. Orekhovaya Street, 10. Arkhipo-Osipovka was in the past an Adyghe village, but after the Caucasian War it was renamed to erase all references to whose lands it is.  Aul was called Vulanskaya - after the name of the river that flows here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1889, the king ordered to give the village a Slavic sound at all.  The village was named after the soldier Arkhip Osipov, who died defending the fortress from the local population.  Now the village is administratively owned by the Big Gelendzhik.  Although the city from Arkhipo-Osipovka - as much as 56 kilometers.  But do not worry about how to get to the "Starfish".  Minibuses run to Arkhipo-Osipovka from Gelendzhik.  For a reasonable fee, the inn owners will arrange a personal transfer for you.  The hotel is very well located in relation to the infrastructure of the village: the central market is nearby, there are shops very close by.  To the sea from the hotel - 700 meters, that is, five to seven minutes walk.
