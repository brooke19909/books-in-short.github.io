With the exception of one, which we mention below, they did not receive much fame in Russia.  Christopher himself claims that he got into the cinema by accident - he was just looking for work for the summer. </p><p>  Photos, interesting excerpts from the interview, detailed filmography and other interesting points in today's brief review. </p><h2>  Chris Klein  Biography </h2><p>  According to American traditions, a person can have two names.  Christopher, shortened to stage Chris, is the middle name of Frederick Klein. </p><p>  Klein became the second child in the family.  Has a sister a year older than him and a younger brother (a difference of three years).  He was born in March 1979, when the family lived in Illinois, in the small town of Hinsdale.  Zodiac sign - Pisces.  When he turns 13, his family moves to Omaha, Nebraska.  Like all the boys, Chris played football.  He was a midfielder in the school team.  The first film debut took place in 20 years.  Chris Klein calls 1999 the most difficult year of his life. For this year he manages to star in two films that receive positive reviews.  After the first picture, Klein becomes a fairly well-known figure in the film business, and the abbreviation from the second name becomes known to everyone.  In most cases, the same name is used in everyday life. </p>

    <p>  However, already in the second part of the film, four friends conclude a certain agreement, under which the captain of the La Crosse team is recorded in the school choir.  There he meets the charming Heather <span>(Mina Suvari),</span> together with whom he acts as soloists in the competition of school choirs.  Although many people call the film a little vulgar, the picture has some success with the audience.  Inspired by the popularity of scriptwriters create "American Pie 2".  Two years later, in 2001, he goes on the screens. </p><p>  This time, four inseparable friends, having studied for one year in college, are going to spend a summer vacation together.  It would be nice to combine business with pleasure, and one of the four finds an ad.  The guys are arranged as house painters.  We will not retell all the adventures of both films, otherwise it will be uninteresting to watch them later. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In the 3rd film, Chris Klein did not participate.  According to him, their characters in the film were not planned.  If there were roles, both he and Mina would certainly accept the invitation. </p><h2>  Other films </h2><p>  Klein himself considers Pie one of his best films.  However, in his interview, he says: ‚ÄúI was not only shooting comedies.  Dramas.  Melodramas.  You can call the film ‚ÄúWe were soldiers‚Äù the opposite, where I starred with Mel Gibson. ‚Äù </p>

    <p>  In addition to the already mentioned, we will name a few more films in which Chris Klein took part.  Filmography, according to various sources, has from 20 to 30 tapes.  We will present them in the form of a list by year: </p><ul><li>  1999 - Upstart and American Pie. </li><li>  2000 - ‚ÄúHere on Earth.‚Äù </li><li>  2001 - "American Pie-2" and "Say that this is not so." </li><li>  2002 - Rollerball and We Were Soldiers. </li><li>  2003 - "The United States of Leland." </li></ul><p>  For a couple of years, Klein has been involved in various talk shows.  Returns to the screens in 2005. </p><ul><li>  2005 - ‚ÄúLong Weekend‚Äù and ‚ÄúJust Friends‚Äù. </li><li>  2006 - ‚Äú1 mile to Lennex‚Äù. </li><li>  The next year is extremely successful - roles in 4 films at once.  2007 - ‚ÄúValley of the World‚Äù, ‚ÄúDay of Zero‚Äù, ‚ÄúGood Life‚Äù and ‚ÄúNew York Serenade‚Äù. </li><li>  2008 - "Hank and Mike." </li><li>  2009 - Streetfighter and The Six Wives of Henry Lefay. </li><li>  2010 - "Good guys." </li></ul><p>  In 2010, Klein begins acting in TV shows.  This continues until 2014. The only exception is the 4th film from the American Pie franchise, which was released in 2012. </p><ul><li>  The year 2014 is marked by two films - ‚ÄúUnknown authors‚Äù and ‚ÄúBroken‚Äù. </li><li>  2015 - Last minute blue. </li></ul><p>  We counted 23 separate films.  Serials are useless to take into account, because, for example, the series "Wilfred" was shot for 4 years.  The total number of episodes is 49, although, although Klein was listed in a secondary composition, he participated in almost every episode. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Toward the close, we note that Chris Klein was not just a movie actor, but a man who managed to realize the dream of many boys and girls without realizing any particular effort.  In his own words, he did not think about such a career, but simply looked for work for the summer. </p>
