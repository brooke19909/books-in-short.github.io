It cannot be said that without this technique the processes of economic activity will stop, but thanks to it a lot of time is saved, not to mention the elementary disposal of routine troubles.  The market is full of offers of this kind, but truly high-quality models should be looked for in the lines of large manufacturers of household appliances.  The assortment of premium manufacturers includes a dishwasher, the principle of which is based on the processes of wetting and rinsing.  But all the differences between the models come down to the technological implementation of this principle. </p>

    <h2>  Dishwasher Overview </h2><p>  For people who are planning to use this machine for the first time, it may seem that this is a real miracle of technology, eliminating the unpleasant washing of dishes.  However, this is not quite true.  The unit is quite simple and understandable from the point of view of operation.  Almost any dishwasher, the principle of which is based on the action of special rinses, provides a fairly high washing efficiency.  Another thing is that the user is required to perform certain actions.  This is not only the configuration and management of work programs and modes, but also the maintenance of equipment in good condition. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, do not forget that such equipment is powered by electricity.  For example, a functional dishwasher "Electrolux" performed by ESF 9420 has an A-class energy consumption, which is quite economical.  And for those who seek maximum savings, it is also advisable to adjust the operation of the machine to the optimal time in terms of the most favorable energy metering mode for the meter. </p><h2>  Design and device </h2>

    <p>  Externally, the unit resembles the same washing machine.  Even in size, these representatives of the household appliance segment converge.  But, of course, their functions are completely different.  The basis of the machine is a power plant, which provides the function of the upper and lower atomizer.  Almost every dishwasher has these components.  The device and the principle of operation are interrelated, that is, the engine drives the nodes and mechanisms that distribute rinse aid and other detergents through the <span>float valve</span> .  The result is clean dishes.  Separate infrastructure includes devices responsible for supplying water, without which a work process cannot be performed.  The intake valve, complete with a filter and a pump, implements this task.  Different hoses are designed for hot and cold water, but if necessary, the machine can perform heating on its own. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Principle of operation </h2>

    <p>  Before starting the workflow, the user must perform several actions, including loading dirty dishes into a special unit and filling detergents into an appropriate container.  The first stage of the unit‚Äôs operation will be the filling of a special container with water and its subsequent distribution to form a solution with a detergent.  Ready-made cleaning mixtures are served to the dishes against the background of plentiful watering with clean water.  The jet is fed continuously by a dishwasher.  The principle of operation, however, depends on different program modes and may imply a particular frequency and speed of action.  At the next stage, the rinsing procedure begins.  Dishes get rid of not only dirt, but also detergent.  The final step is drying.  Different machines have different principles for performing this operation, but its result is always the same - providing the user with clean and dry dishes. </p><h2>  Types of cars </h2>

    <p>  Basically, such equipment is distinguished by the type of installation and form factor.  So, in the market you can find embedded and freestanding models.  The first option is integrated into the working kitchen cabinet and practically does not take up too much space.  This type of machine is compact in size, but installation problems may occur.  In addition, the infrastructure with water supply is more likely to be hidden, which is not the best option in terms of operational safety.  However, modern programs of the dishwasher when detecting irregularities in the water supply processes can give the appropriate signals through indicators.  As for stand-alone machines, they are large, although not always.  This unit practically does not require dirty work during installation and allows serving large volumes of dishes in one go. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  User's manual </h2><p>  In order for the machine to last as long as possible, it is necessary to carefully approach the observance of operational requirements.  First of all, it is important to load into the machine only those volumes that correspond to the capabilities of a particular model.  The method of installing the dishes also matters.  For example, it is desirable to place the plate with the dirty side to the sprayers, which are most often located in the central part above the engine.  Separate rules are devoted to the choice of materials, since not every dish can be served in such a machine.  The modern instruction manual for the dishwasher recommends not using silver and steel products in one session, since as a result you can get corrosive damage to materials.  Particular attention should be paid to porcelain, glass, crystal and plastic.  Utensils made from these materials are generally sensitive to high temperatures and some chemical components in detergents.  Products with wood parts cannot be subjected to such contact with water at all. </p><h2>  Rinse aid for dishwasher </h2>

    <p>  If you carry out washing cycles only with the addition of detergent, then after a certain time, spots of peculiar chemical burns will become noticeable on the dishes.  This phenomenon is due to the fact that after the procedure, chemicals are not completely washed off.  To eliminate this problem, <span>rinse aid for the dishwasher,</span> which is added to a special compartment in parallel with the base detergent composition, will help.  The main objective of this additive is that its components contribute to the effective washing of the surfaces of the dishes not from dirt, but from the used washing solution.  In choosing a rinse aid, it is important to consider its conformity with the type of machine itself, and, of course, the dishes.  Also, manufacturers produce different compositions for working with soft and hard water. </p><h2>  Repair and spare parts </h2><p>  You can find out about the internal state of the machine by various signs, including the quality of the washing function.  Common failures include abnormalities in the intake valve, damage to the filters, clogging of the drain valve and spray unit.  These problems can be solved independently by replacing the element - most importantly, stock up on spare parts for a particular model.  For example, spare parts for <span>Bosch dishwashers</span> can be purchased at a dealership.  Typically, users of machines of this brand order filters and heating elements.  By the way, consumables and spare parts of this German manufacturer in some models coincide with counterparts from Siemens. </p><h2>  Manufacturers </h2>

    <p>  Almost every manufacturer of kitchen appliances is involved in the production of dishwashing equipment.  For example, the Electrolux dishwasher belongs to the budget segment, although some of its modifications cost 15-17 thousand rubles.  can not be called representatives of the lower class.  The basis of the family of this company are low-cost models designed to perform basic operations.  Usually these are machines with a low level of manufacturability and quality of the element base. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the same German companies can rightfully be attributed to premium products.  Another thing is that spare parts for Bosch or Siemens dishwashers in the form of valves, gaskets and filters may also be required if the equipment is used in harsh conditions.  That is, the premium brand does not guarantee an absolute level of reliability. </p><h2>  How to choose the best model? </h2><p>  Before buying, you should calculate such parameters as the load volume, operating modes, support for certain programs, controls, etc. If there are no special requirements for functionality, then you can limit yourself to an inexpensive model from the line of the same Electrolux brand of 7- 8 thousand. However, the truly high quality of dishwashers starts at the level of 13-15 thousand. In the same segment you can find technologically attractive options.  For example, in the latest series, manufacturers already provide the ability to wirelessly control machines. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  The cleaning and washing equipment in recent years has made a huge breakthrough, offering consumers new levels of performance.  But nevertheless, common problems of such equipment remain.  This is a high level of energy consumption, and noise with vibrations, as well as a considerable size.  All these problems are contained in the dishwasher, the principle of which involves the use of chemicals for the effectiveness of operations.  Manufacturers seek to minimize these shortcomings, but so far they have not been eliminated.  More promising areas of the company are considered to be increase in structural reliability, increase in speed of work, as well as the development of new principles of cleaning and drying. </p>
