    <h2>  Hotel address and location </h2><p>  The Borodino Hotel (address: Moscow, Rusakovskaya Street, 13) can be found in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe wonderful Sokolniki Park.

In addition, very remarkable places and <span>monuments of Moscow architecture</span> are located near the hotel <span>.</span>  These include St. Basil's Cathedral, also known as the Intercession Cathedral, the <span>Catherine Palace, the</span> Tretyakov Gallery and Vasnetsov House Museum. </p><h2>  How to get from the metro to the Borodino Hotel </h2>
