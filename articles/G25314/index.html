Otherwise, their activity would be unprofitable.  Of course, no one wants to send vacationers to resorts from pure altruism.  The so-called package tourists (buying permits) overpay in comparison with those who decide to organize their holidays on their own.  But in the latter case, there are disadvantages. </p><p>  The tourist should not only think over such items as accommodation at the resort and food, but also take care of the visa and transfer.  In this article we will consider the benefits of a holiday in Bulgaria.  This country is famous for its winter ski resorts.  And in the summer, the entire Black Sea coast of Bulgaria turns into a continuous zone of beach relaxation.  Between the package from a Russian travel agency and a completely independent trip, there is a middle ground.  This is to go on holiday to Bulgaria from Chisinau. </p>

    <h2>  Closer to destination </h2><p>  Of course, you can get to the resort from Russia.  And on the plane it will be even faster than from Moldova.  For example, you can fly from Moscow to Burgas without any changes, and the flight will last only two hours and forty minutes.  Getting to Sunny Varna by plane is also not a problem.  Only three and a half hours in the air - and you are already at the destination airport.  The only negative of this travel method is the price.  A flight from Russia to Bulgaria will cost at least twenty thousand rubles.  And if you are lucky enough to buy a ticket for a charter on the "Last Minute" system, then even it will cost 5,000 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the same time, you can go on a bus trip to Bulgaria from Chisinau, thereby significantly reducing the cost of the trip.  But how to get from Russia to Moldova?  And here you can find reasonable prices.  Still, the republics of the former Soviet Union are closer, and you can get to Chisinau by branded train No. 047 and other trains.  A ticket will cost from 2600 rubles.  On the fastest Sodruzhestvo express train, a trip to the capital of Moldova will last a day and two hours. </p>

    <h2>  Why package holidays can be cheaper than self-rest </h2><p>  It would seem that a person who does not contact the intermediary (travel agency), but book a hotel and buy a ticket for the trip himself, must pay less than a package spa.  But often the opposite is true.  And all because in hotels and transport there is the concept of group ticket and check-in.  If you arrive as part of numerous clients of a travel agency, then you are entitled to discounts.  Of course, even more advantageous offers from hotels and carriers can be found with early booking.  What travel agencies do, buying up hotel rooms and chartering charters. </p><p>  Bulgaria is a pretty cheap country to relax.  But the bulk of the pricing of trips from Russia is flight.  Tourists often go by bus to rest in Bulgaria from Chisinau, and even if you take a hot tour, your vacation will cost several times less.  And the distance between the countries is not very large. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Bus from Chisinau to Bulgaria </h2><p>  Moldovan citizens are free to choose whether to buy a ticket or pay only for the transfer to the Black Sea resorts of this country.  Comfortable buses depart from different cities of the republic to Bulgaria.  There are companies that specialize in delivering passengers to ski or sea resorts.  And this is not necessarily a travel agency.  If you intend to go on vacation to Bulgaria from Chisinau, you can recommend the carrier My Way.  At the disposal of this company are only brand new tall buses that rolled off the assembly line in 2008.  The entire lower floor is reserved for luggage.  On board there is a toilet, coffee machine, sockets, Wi-Fi, a large selection of multimedia.  At stops, refreshments with hot and cold drinks are provided.  On its Neoplanes Starliner, May Wei delivers passengers to Sunny Beach for only thirty euros.  And the travel time is only twelve or fourteen hours (depending on the situation at the borders). </p>

    <h2>  Tours to Bulgaria from Chisinau </h2><p>  But bus seats are also being bought up by travel agencies.  Independent passengers can also buy the remaining tickets.  But they won‚Äôt get the best places.  In addition, they still have to decide on how to get from the bus station to the hotel.  Therefore, many Moldovans prefer to buy permits to Bulgaria from Chisinau.  The package of services includes bus travel, transfer to the hotel gate on a microvein, accommodation at the selected hotel and meals in it. </p><p>  Separately paid visa and insurance.  And, of course, travel agency services.  But these last expenses are not as predatory as the Russian ones.  For example, a two-week rest in Sunny Beach in a four-star hotel on the All Inclusive system will cost two people 510 euros.  In September, travel agencies can find you an apartment for thirty euros a day with the same set of services. </p><h2>  Is it possible for a Russian citizen to buy a ticket in Moldova </h2><p>  Naturally, yes!  And some tour operators work so closely with the Russian clientele that they even offer a comprehensive ticket.  They undertake to pay for a train ride (from Moscow or St. Petersburg) to Chisinau and a bus transfer to Bulgaria.  Moldovan companies offer the Russians the same discounts and promotions as the citizens of the republic.  Tours to Bulgaria from Chisinau are also in great demand because the traveler is free to choose the duration of his vacation.  There are so many buses in the summer season that it is possible to leave back any day (with advance booking). </p>
