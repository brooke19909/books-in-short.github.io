But nevertheless, history knows the creators who sought to move away from the standards and create something unique.  For example, a residential <span>round house</span> in Moscow, built by Konstantin Melnikov, became famous throughout the world immediately after its creation.  This architectural monument stands in Krivoarbatsky Lane today. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2>

The master approached this task with particular responsibility.  According to his plan, the finished construction was to be as economical as possible in the construction and subsequent maintenance, as well as different in functionality.  Of course, the artistic and aesthetic qualities of the building were not in the last place.  With all this, the house of the architect Melnikov in Moscow, according to the author himself, symbolizes a rise from <span>physiological needs</span> to pure creativity. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Round house in Moscow address" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/337377.jpg" width="480"></div>  So, the workshop is located on the top floor, and under it there are utility rooms: from the kitchen and bathrooms, to the living room and bedroom (ascending, respectively).  Above the building is two connected cylinders, a large <span>panoramic window</span> is located above the entrance <span>,</span> and the entire facade is dotted with smaller rhomboid windows, the total number of which is 180 pieces.

This room was created as ideal for a deep and productive night's sleep.  According to the architect, all family members should sleep together.  The round house in Moscow previously had floor-mounted beds in this room.  They have not survived to our days.  For convenience, there were partitions in the large sleeping room, for example, the bed of the architect and his wife was partially fenced with a mirror screen.  Functionality was also thought out at the highest level - each family member, including children, had his own office for creativity and work.  Another unique place is the terrace for tea parties, you can also sunbathe on it.  The round house in Moscow is a symbol of the infinite possibilities of man.  The architect himself said that the most important thing is not to push yourself into the framework and strive to fulfill your dreams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="House of architect Melnikov in Moscow" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/337378.jpg?1392586431964" width="324"></div>

    <h2>  A unique monument today </h2><p>  Even outside, not everyone can see <span>this building</span> .  The house is surrounded by a fence, on which there is a curved sign, notifying that in front of you is a <span>monument of architecture.</span>  The round house in Moscow is going through hard times.  It was built in 1929, today the building needs major repairs.  Despite the will expressed in the will of the creator to equip the museum in the building, today the building remains residential.  The descendants of the <span>famous architect</span> dwell in it <span>,</span> but to deal with the legal side of the issue is not at all simple.  It is not the first year that a <span>lawsuit</span> has been conducted <span>, the</span> main task of which is to determine the ownership of this building.  It remains only to believe that the restoration will be carried out in a timely manner and the museum will be created.  Today, you can only "one eye" look outside at the round house in Moscow.  Monument address: Krivoarbatsky Lane, building 10. You can try to enter the courtyard of the neighboring building, from which a better view. </p>
