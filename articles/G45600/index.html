    <p>  What are they, the best hotels of Kemer, 5 stars on the first line, reviews of tourists about them and recommendations of professionals - all the answers in the following sections of the article. </p><h2>  Economy Kemer Hotels </h2><p>  Basically, resorts in Turkey, in particular Kemer, offer hotels at the level of 3-5 stars.  What is the difference?  She is very significant.  3 star hotels are very cheap, but the price will most likely be accommodation, breakfast and pool access.  Most of the rooms of such hotels have long been in need of repair, and the food is pretty monotonous.  They are located a kilometer or more from the sea coast.  An ideal option for those who want to save on accommodation and plan only to spend the night in a booked hotel, spending the rest of the time and money to get acquainted with the culture of the country. </p><h2>  5 Star and Luxury Kemer Hotels </h2><p>  4 star hotels offer more comfortable rooms, they are usually closer to the sea, their infrastructure is richer, and food is more diverse.  Among these hotels you can find very good ones at an affordable price. </p><p>  Those who are going to relax in comfort and do not want to take care of anything during their vacation should choose only 5 star hotels.  5-star Kemer hotels - on the first line, with a huge territory and a lot of entertainment, a pool complex and its own beach and, of course, with an all-inclusive system.  More details about them are below. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  "Euphoria Tekirova Hotel" 5 * attracts with its magnificent nature and a variety of entertainment, but a large number of hotel guests do not allow to enjoy privacy. </p><p>  "Acca Alinda Hotel" 5 * attracts with both design and level of service.  A great choice for families and for those traveling alone. </p><p>  "Amara Dolce Vita Luxheri" 5 * - conquers with superb rooms with sea views and excellent cuisine.  Neat pebble beach and clear sea leave no one indifferent. </p><p>  Crystal Deluxe Resort &amp; Spa (Kemer, Turkey) - 5 star hotels on the 1st line cannot be imagined without this chain.  The concept of the hotel is a personal approach to each guest, the fulfillment of all wishes so that the rest becomes ideal and unforgettable. </p><h2>  We continue rating </h2><p>  "Limak Limra Hotel" 5 * is a beautiful territory with pools, a beach and places of relaxation, interesting animation and delicious dishes.  According to reviews, having been in this hotel, I want to come back here again. </p><p>  <span>"Max Royal Kemer</span> Resort" 5 * - one of the best hotels in the resort is distinguished by impeccable service, especially in relation to guests with children.  The variety of cuisine is also pleasantly surprising. </p><p>  "Karmir Resort and Spa" 5 * continues to be rated by tourists.  The favorable location and well-developed infrastructure make this vacation destination sought after and popular. </p><p>  "Mirage Park Resort" 5 * has a lot of advantages, such as territory, entertainment, proximity to the sea and a good beach.  But guests also note drawbacks: noise due to the large number of tourists, lack of sun loungers on the beach and other minor mistakes. </p><p>  "Nirvana Lagoon" 5 * is just suitable for those who want to relax from the hustle and bustle in silence.  Detached villas, each with its own infrastructure, are combined into a huge territory, you can say, a town on the seashore, where each guest will find an activity according to their preferences, without causing inconvenience to other guests.  But the high cost of living, alas, is not accessible to everyone. </p><p>  The named hotels (Kemer, 5 stars, 1 line) - this is not all the variety of tourist infrastructure of the resort, but only the most popular among tourists. </p><h2>  Best for family vacations </h2><p>  What is important for families who go on vacation with children?  The presence of a children's menu, leisure activities, playgrounds and special water attractions for the smallest.  So that little children are not bored, they also need a large area where you can walk and play, so that the shade of the trees protects from the bright Antalya sun.  Equally important is the attitude of the staff, who is ready to take into account all the nuances of placing young guests at the hotel and who knows how to find an approach to even the most choosy kids. </p>

    <h2>  Holidays for every taste </h2><p>  So, we described the most popular hotels (Kemer, 5 stars, 1 line), presented a rating based on reviews from tourists.  Of course, each of the reviews is subjective, the opinion of one person may not coincide with the opinion of another.  But still, we hope that the information provided will help those who are going on vacation in Kemer, not to be mistaken with the choice of hotel. </p><p>  We remind you that in connection with the current political situation, popular tour operators recommend for the time being to refrain from traveling to Turkey.
