About 109,000 people live there.  The city used to have a well-developed textile industry, and at the moment there are electrotechnical, mechanical, instrument-making and perlite plants.  In addition, there are dairies, meat processing plants and food processing plants. </p><p>  The city has a museum of local lore, the Borisoglebskaya and Trinity Church.  Ramenskoye is famous for its beautiful houses, decorated very unusual for our country.  In the heart of the city there are sculptures and fountains created based on the characters of various Soviet cartoons.  The city has several hotels where you can spend the night.  Reservation is best done in advance to be sure of the available accommodation. </p><p>  Joint-Stock Company RPKB, research institutes of the All-Russian Research Institute of Geophysics, Central Research Institute "Projectstalkonstruktsiya" in the life of Ramensky play an important role and move forward all its production. </p><p>  It is worth noting that cultural institutions here are represented by Saturn Culture Center, Yubileiny, Orbit cinemas. </p><p>  Among the various sports facilities, the most famous is the Ramensky racecourse - this is a famous venue for competitions, exhibitions, auctions.  It is worth noting that the equestrian club pupils have become many times the winners of various competitions.  Just 50 years ago, the city was much smaller and was actively expanding.  At the same time, the construction of neighborhoods took place in such a way that in the vicinity of Ramensky not a single village was built up with multi-storey buildings.  In addition, the amazing Moscow region nature - meadows, forests, river valleys - has been preserved here, which even today attracts visitors and residents of the city throughout the year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Calypso </h2><p>  Hotel Calypso (Ramenskoye) is located 38 km from the Moscow Ring Road.
