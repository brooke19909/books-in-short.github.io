How to make a rocket out of paper, many parents thought.  Such a toy can be created for joint games from improvised materials.  They can be presented at an exhibition at the school dedicated to Cosmonautics Day on April 12.  There are options for crafts in which rockets can be launched at a range.  Children love dynamic toys much more than immovable ones.

You will need additional colored paper for gluing the hull, twisting the conical top, triangular flight guides and foil for decorative elements - portholes and stripes on the hull. </p><div class="photo" data-original="malhasfakini.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sleeve rocket" class="if uuid-2629858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2629858.jpg"></div><p>  Work begins with wrapping the sleeve with orange paper.  When the entire surface is hidden under a layer of paper, the edge is evenly cut off with scissors and smeared with PVA glue for attaching to cardboard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to make a cone, a circle is cut first, the diameter of which is 1.5-2 times larger than the diameter of the sleeve.  Then, an incision is made along the radius and the edges slightly overlap one on the other and adhere to the PVA. </p><p>  Triangular guides are cut from two identical triangles, which are glued together for strength.  The lower part is left without glue and the paper is curled in different directions.  These edges are coated with glue and guiding missiles are attached to them. </p><p>  It remains for the template to cut the same circles of portholes and shiny strips and attach them to the rocket body.  Now you know how to make a paper rocket for fun kid games. </p><h2>  Reusable rocket </h2><p>  The American Shuttle is easy to make out of paper from several parts.  This is the aircraft body with turbine cylinders on the sides, a large cylinder attached in the middle, and fire escaping from the nozzle.  The contours of the aircraft are drawn on a white sheet of thick paper and cut out with scissors around the perimeter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="american paper shuttle" class="if uuid-2629865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2629865.jpg"></div><p>  Markers are painted with stripes on his nose and wings.  From small rectangular pieces of paper, small tubes are folded and glued together.  These are aircraft turbines that are installed on both sides of the center. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Further work continues on the rocket itself.  First, a rectangle of white paper is painted and a hole for the pilot is cut out.  There you can during the game to plant a small toy or a man from the designer of "Lego".  While we will not glue the edges, we will be engaged in the manufacture of fire.  For such work, glossy colored paper of yellow, orange and red colors is prepared.  One side of the rectangular piece remains flat, and on the other along the contours they first draw tongues of flame, and then cut out with small scissors. </p><p>  Cut parts are assembled together with a slight shift so that all the colors of the fire are visible.  They are glued alternately to the lower part of the back of the rocket body.  Now it’s clear how to make a paper rocket with your own hands. </p><h2>  Light missiles for flights </h2><p>  Such simple crafts can be folded from plain paper for a printer, newspaper or magazine sheets, notebook pages.  They are assembled from just a few details.  This is the rocket body, in shape resembling a narrow tube, and guides that contribute to the flight range. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diy-is-fun.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="light rockets" class="if uuid-2629855" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2629855.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, any parent can make a rocket out of paper for a child.  It is only necessary to roll up a sheet of paper with a tube, and smear the edge from the inside with PVA and flatten it with your fingers to harden.  The sharp edge of the rocket is ready!  Two opposite cuts are made on the bottom of the rocket and a sheet of thick paper of a different color is inserted, cut in the shape of a trapezoid, half an oval, or any other.  Now let's look at how to launch a craft in flight. </p><h2>  Light rocket launch </h2><p>  Launch a rocket in flight will help the air from the lungs.  You need to take a cocktail tube, insert its long edge into the body from the lower end and blow it with all its strength. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pbs.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper rocket launch" class="if uuid-2629854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2629854.jpg"></div><p>  A light paper rocket will quickly fly forward.  The stronger the child blows, the further the device will fly. </p><h2>  Long flight </h2><p>  How to make a rocket out of paper that flies?  We have already described one method.  The child will be able to play with a light rocket and a straw in the apartment’s room.  The next option presented involves a stronger jerk of the rocket into the sky, so it is recommended to launch the craft only in the yard.  Before starting, be sure to ensure that people, animals and glass are not nearby, otherwise an unplanned collision may occur. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper rocket launch" class="if uuid-2629862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2629862.jpg"></div><p>  A rubber tube is put on the neck of a two-liter bottle, into which the rocket itself is inserted.
