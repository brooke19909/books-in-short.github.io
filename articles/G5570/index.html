Moreover, such a location, rather, is its plus rather than minus.  After all, tourists will not have to endure a long and exhausting transfer, and to the center of Antalya with its temptations and entertainment, as well as historical and cultural attractions - just a stone's throw away.  At the same time, the hotel surrounds its guests with the magical atmosphere of the Mediterranean and offers an exclusive vacation. </p><p>  The name of the hotel now sounds slightly different than a couple of years ago, it can be found on sites like ‚ÄúAcra Hotel‚Äù.  The hotel is new, modern, opened in June 2014.  There are not so many reviews about it, but they are, and on their basis we made a description of the hotel.  Next to this hotel there is another one belonging to the same network.  It is called Acra Park.  So that tourists do not confuse these two hotels, we will say a few words about it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akra Barut Hotel" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1809032.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are many ways to do this, both by direct flights and via Istanbul.  Antalya has its own international hub.  But flights through Istanbul or Ankara are often cheaper from Russia.  Since the airport is on the outskirts, in order to get to the city center, you need to catch a six hundred bus.  He walks well, even at night.  In the center you need to make a transplant and drive a few stops.  There are a lot of buses and dolmushes there. </p><p>  Akra Barut Hotel is actually located in the central area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAntalya.  It is fifteen kilometers from the international airport.  Not far from the hotel are the most beautiful parks in Antalya - Marina and Karaali-oglu.  Two minutes walk - a large light and music fountain.  A supermarket and burger-king eateries are also within walking distance.  The old town is a seven to ten minute drive away, and the bus stop is directly opposite the exit.  On both sides of the hotel you can make an excellent promenade along the promenade. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akra Barut Hotel Antalya" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1808787.jpg" width="600"></div>

The beds are large, many different pillows.  The linen is snow-white, and the plumbing is beyond praise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akra Park Barut Hotel" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1808910.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are also two √† la carte establishments - Fine Deining and Brasserie.  It operates on the territory of the hotel and three bars - in the lobby, a snack bar with snacks and a pool.  However, unlike most five-star Turkish hotels, all inclusive is not practiced here, only <span>full board.</span>  This means that drinks and snacks in bars and between meals are paid.

    <h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  The hotel beach is equipped on the basis of a concrete platform.  There are sun loungers and umbrellas, and you need to go down the stairs.  Sunbathing towels are provided free of charge.  The sea is turquoise, clear, and the nature around is very picturesque.  There are not too many tourists on the beach, there are always places.  And next year, the administration even promised to include light music on the shore. </p><p>  True, the reviews claim that the beach on the platform is not very convenient for people who can‚Äôt swim, because the depth goes right away.  Such vacationers have to be content with pools.  But they do not complain.  Akra Barut Hotel (Antalya) has both indoor and outdoor pools.  There is also a children's "paddling pool".  Pools are multilevel.  One of them is panoramic, and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãits deck chairs is right in the water.  The closed reservoir has huge windows and a small space in the air (to get there, you need to dive).  The water is heated there, so you can go here at any time of the year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akra Barut Hotel Antalya reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1808790.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are many old quarters with interesting buildings, towers and mosques.  The most popular and symbol of Antalya, the Jiali minaret is visible from any place, and it serves as a wonderful landmark in the city.  Lovers of antiquity can visit the Aksu area.  The complex of the ancient city of Perge has been preserved here - you will see an amphitheater, and baths, and a stadium, and ancient walls.  And the Archaeological Museum of the city is simply "stuffed" with amazing artifacts, one more valuable than the other.

    <h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  When tourists describe their vacation at Akra Barut Hotel, their reviews often mention what cheap prices in Antalya were before, and how things went up.  But despite these circumstances, some travelers claim that you can still make great purchases here.  Moreover, in Lara there are many large shopping centers such as "Migros", "Ozdilek", "Dipo" and others where things of world brands and excellent quality are sold.  In the same area there is a clothing market.  Here you can make budget purchases of Turkish textiles, knitwear, shoes - and also of very good quality.  But it is better to look for souvenirs in the Old Town.  There you can buy handmade rugs, and painted ceramics, leather and wood products, jewelry, as well as ethnic oriental clothes. </p><h2>  Akra Barut Hotel (Antalya): reviews </h2><p>  Tourists find this hotel suitable for a relaxing romantic getaway.  There are few Russians here.  The hotel is very comfortable, the rooms are stylish and comfortable, the views from the windows are amazing.  Pools are not crowded, you can always swim in plenty.  The staff is polite, pleasant, always will explain to you any trifle - from where it is better to park the car to where it is located on the city map.  Hotel Akra Barut Hotel (Turkey) is not too similar to typical Antalya "fives": it is not so luxurious and pathos.  But everything that is on the hotel‚Äôs website, from the description to the photos, is completely true.  Good bars and restaurants with original interiors.  The hotel is suitable for lovers of beach holidays, and lovers of urban entertainment, because it is very close to the center of Antalya. </p><h2>  Acra Park </h2><p>  Akra Park Barut Hotel was built later.  It is located a little further from the sea, and all its guests can use the services of the Acra Barut Hotel.  The food system in the hotel is basically half board.  Breakfast and dinner are served at the Panorama Restaurant.  There is also the Acre Bistro.  Both establishments have a sea view.  The bistro operates on an a la carte system.  Another Asmani restaurant has been opened on the roof of the main hotel building and four bars.  Two of them are located in the lobby, one by the pool and Hemera on the beach. </p><p>  Restaurants in the hotel specialize in cuisines of certain peoples, but the most popular are the haute couture restaurant and the brasserie.  In restaurants, guests are required to wear a dress code.  In slippers, shorts and bathing suits are not allowed there.  The hotel has four outdoor pools.  Tennis courts are available.  There are two parking lots - on the territory of the hotel and behind it.  The hotel has virtually the same range of services as in Acre.  But in his class he belongs to the "fours."  Guests at this hotel go to Acre Beach. </p>
