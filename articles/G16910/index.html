Usually it is either a battery or a battery.  The energy in these components ends over time, which leads to the need for recharging.  Otherwise, the device will stop working.  How to charge Apple Watch?  These smart watches work for a certain time, after which they need to recharge the battery.  Fortunately, there is nothing difficult in the mentioned operation.  And everyone will be able to cope with the task without much hassle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.easyacc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to charge apple watch 3" class="if uuid-3192395" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3192395.jpg"></div><h2>  Check battery </h2><p>  How to charge Apple Watch 4?  First of all, you need to make sure that the battery needs replenishment of energy.  Otherwise, the battery may be damaged.  Then it will be quickly discharged, which will cause a lot of inconvenience. </p><p>  To check <span>the battery level of the</span> smart watch from Apple, you will need to make a bottom-up movement on the device‚Äôs main screen.  The display will show the device control panel.  The upper part of the display will show the energy level of the battery. </p><p>  Important: when the battery is low, a lightning bolt icon will appear on the device‚Äôs screen. </p><h2>  What are the chargers </h2><p>  How to charge Apple Watch?  It should be noted that to implement the task, the user can use a variety of devices.  But which ones? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the moment, recharging smart watches from Apple can be done through: </p><ul><li>  docking station; </li><li>  special case; </li><li>  cable with round mount. </li></ul><p>  As a rule, everyone decides by what method to solve the initially posed problem.  Therefore, further attention will be given to all existing options for the development of events. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.payetteforward.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to charge apple watch series 4" class="if uuid-3192392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3192392.jpg"></div><h2>  Through the wires </h2><p>  I wonder how to charge the Apple Watch 3 and not only?  Then it is worth paying attention to all kinds of methods for solving the problem.  The simplest and most convenient is the use of a special cable with a round mount. </p><p>  To achieve the desired result, a person will need: </p><ol><li>  Take the watch off your hands.  Some do not do this, but the manufacturer recommends not wearing a smart device while recharging. </li><li>  Attach the round mount to the back of the device. </li><li>  Plug the cable into a power outlet or USB port. </li><li>  Wait a bit. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  This, as already mentioned, is the easiest method to power Apple's smartwatch batteries.  True, this approach is far from the only one. </p><h2>  Station to the rescue </h2><p>  How to charge Apple Watch Series 4?  Some quite successfully use special docking stations to achieve the desired goal.  The main thing is to know how they work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.macobserver.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to charge Apple Watch" class="if uuid-3192390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3192390.jpg"></div><p>  Suppose that the owner of the "apple" device decided to use the docking station.  To charge a smart watch, he will need: </p><ol><li>  Make sure that the battery really needs recharging.  As soon as 10% of the power remains, a red lightning appears on the display. </li><li>  Turn on the dock. </li><li>  Remove the watch and put it on the special holder. </li></ol><p>  Now it remains only to wait.  During charging, using the appropriate device is not recommended. </p><h2>  Case and recharge </h2><p>  Do Apple Watch Wireless Charges Recharge?  First, pay attention to special charging cases.  These wireless devices help keep your smartwatch working all the time.  But how to use them? </p><p>  Usually for this method of charging you need: </p><ol><li>  Charge the case in any way possible.  For example, using a special cable. </li><li>  Open the case and put an Apple watch on it. </li><li>  Close accessory. </li></ol><p>  At this stage, active action can be completed.  The user will be able to maintain the watch in working condition, as well as provide them with reliable protection against damage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.howtoisolve.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple Watch Charging Case" class="if uuid-3192389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3192389.jpg"></div><p>  Important: the charger case is not included with the Apple Watch.  It will have to be bought on its own. </p><h2>  Power Supplies or Wireless Charges </h2><p>  How to charge Apple Watch without charging?  At the moment, this can be done using special devices.  For example, covers with batteries.  Moreover, a special strap for smart watches is under development, which will allow recharging the battery of the device without removing it.  So far this is only a project. </p><p>  Some people are interested in whether it is possible to use wireless chargers and special power supplies to accomplish this task.  Now such devices are used quite often.  For example, to recharge the energy of a phone or tablet.  Very comfortably! </p><p>  In the case of the Apple Watch, this technique will also work.  The mentioned device is quite successfully charged from wireless chargers.  True, it is better to use a charging case for this task.  It‚Äôs just more convenient to use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.macrumors.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portable charger" class="if uuid-3192394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3192394.jpg"></div><h2>  How much to wait </h2><p>  How to charge Apple Watch?  Now this task will not cause any problems.  True, it is worth paying attention to some of the nuances of the operation. </p><p>  For example, how much to charge a smart watch.  To date, this process takes an average of 2-3 hours and no more.  Accordingly, the mentioned device will work for a long time after a short wait. </p><p>  Important: it is not recommended to leave the watch all night on a charge.  This does not have the best effect on the battery. </p><h2>  IPad Charger </h2><p>  But this is far from everything that every owner of an Apple smartwatch should know.  Often a similar device appears among avid fans of the manufacturer.  And such people have questions regarding the use of non-native wires for charging watches. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the iPad charger is not suitable for replenishing the energy of the smartwatch battery from Apple.  And from the iPhone too.  You don‚Äôt even have to try to connect them to the watch - it‚Äôs useless. </p><h2>  Power mode </h2><p>  It also happens that the Apple Watch battery runs out at the most inopportune moment, especially when it becomes necessary to know what time it is.  How to get out of the situation if there is neither a charging case, nor a portable charging station at hand? </p><p>  In this case, it is recommended to activate the energy mode (eco mode).  It turns on automatically after the battery charge drops to 10 percent.  Manually, it can be activated through the control panel (opens by moving from bottom to top on the device‚Äôs display). </p><div class="photo" data-original="support.apple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Charging via cable" class="if uuid-3192391" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/3192391.jpg"></div><p>  What happens with activated energy mode?  The dial with the current time will be displayed successfully within 24 hours.  Only at the same time all the options for synchronizing watches with "apple" devices are disabled, and the restriction of some accessory options is also activated. </p><h2>  Summary and Conclusions </h2><p>  The article found out how to properly charge the Apple Watch.  All possible options for charging the smartwatch battery were presented to the attention.  Now everyone will be able to use them when necessary. </p><p>  For safety reasons, it is recommended to use only branded chargers.  Fake Chinese counterparts quickly break down and also malfunction.  Sometimes they can disable smart watches.  Such cases are actively recorded, but so far they are not very common in practice.  But it's better not to risk your gadget. </p>
