The unification of Kiev and Novgorod, two then-large shopping centers of the <span>Eastern Slavic tribes,</span> marked the beginning of the emergence of a large distinctive civilization with a unique culture.  The main source of events in ancient Russian history is the "Tale of Bygone Years" (hereinafter referred to as the PVL).  This is the earliest annalistic vault.  It is also called the ‚ÄúOriginal Chronicle‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Nestor Chronicle‚Äù, from which we can conclude that many scholars consider the monk of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Nestor (about 1056‚Äì1114), a major hagiographer (theologian studying the lives of saints) and the chronicler to be the author of this source. .

    <h2>  How it all began </h2><p>  This annalistic vault describes the period of the history of Russian lands from biblical times until 1117.  According to the PVL, the unification of Kiev and Novgorod took place in 882 under the leadership of the legendary Prince Oleg.  We must immediately make a reservation that modern historians dispute everything related to ancient Russia.  But there is more or less generally accepted information.  It is known that Oleg was a relative of Rurik, or rather the brother of his wife - Efanida.  After the death of Rurik, Oleg became the guardian of the young Igor, and until his maturity - the ruler of the Novgorod lands.  Many scholars point to the fact that in those times in question, Novgorod, as such, did not exist.  There was a large fortified shopping center of Ladoga on the Volkhov River, known throughout the eastern Baltic.  It was Rurikovo settlement located under the current Novgorod. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The first unifier of Russian lands </h2>

But in the PVL, 862 is indicated as the date of the first mention of Novgorod, and Russia celebrated its foundation in 1150 in 2009. The most popular version says that the city was there, the townspeople asked for the reign of the Scandinavians, came here, ruled here and gave birth son of Rurik, who died in 879.  Oleg, the governor who came to power, immediately set about transforming the squad and strengthening the existing borders.  Then, after three years, he began to unite the Russian lands by conquest.  A very clever and far-sighted politician, under whose leadership the unification of the lands of Novgorod and Kiev took place, did not always act only by force - bloodless, by cunning, he subjugated Kiev and, later, Constantinople, levying an exorbitant bribe from merchants of the East Slavic north.

    <h2>  Urgent need </h2><p>  To take control of most of the land along the route of goods was a necessary and reasonable decision.  Having received power, the prince immediately decided to conquer the lands lying along the trade route "from the Vikings to the Greeks."  Obviously, the union of Oleg Novgorod and Kiev was conceived for a long time, maybe Rurik hatched these plans.  Or maybe Oleg was so far-sighted, because trade was one of the main sources of money entering the state treasury.  And goods along the entire route were subject to heavy taxes.  Following the south with a 2,000-strong army, Oleg subjugated the Slavic tribes living on the banks of the Dnieper, Pripyat, Bug, Dniester and <span>the Sozh River.</span>  These were drevlyane, northerners, radimichi.  Previously, Rurik united Finno-Ugric peoples under his rule (these included Chud, Meri, and Libra), Ilmen Slovens, Krivichi, that is, the East Slavic north, which in foreign sources is called Slavia.  Thus, Oleg's first merit was the expansion of the borders of Russian land.  And strengthening.  Everywhere along the line he built cities and fortresses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Retribution </h2>

Having set off to conquer Constantinople, these warriors settled in Kiev and refused to recognize the power of Rurik.  They were not princes, and this gave Oleg the right to demand their renunciation of power.  Approaching the city, the strategist and cautious politician Oleg did not want to shed the blood of his soldiers, forcing them to take a well-fortified center located on a high mountain, which made the fortress impregnable.  Oleg pretended to be a Varangian merchant.  The soldiers lay at the bottom of the rooks, covered with bags of goods on top of them.  The then owners of the city, <span>Askold and Deer,</span> went to the marina to pick up the best they had brought, and collect tribute for permission to follow further along the Dnieper to the sea.  They were captured and killed, buried in various places.

    <h2>  Smart diplomat </h2><p>  And so the unification of Kiev and Novgorod under the leadership of one man - Prince Oleg, who immediately proceeded to strengthen the conquered city.  It was he who, entering the city, according to legend, called Kiev "the mother of Russian cities."  Oleg wanted to make this settlement a capital and establish his residence here.  Of course, the matter was not limited to Kiev.  But further Oleg acted very wisely.  Some tribes (the above drevlyans, northerners, radimichi) he annexed to Russia, freeing them from paying exorbitant tribute to the Khazar Kaganate.  Territories subject to Oleg became a powerful power, the foundation for the formation of which was the unification of Kiev and Novgorod.  The year 882 is traditionally considered the beginning of Russian statehood. </p><h2>  "Revenge the unreasonable Khazars" </h2><p>  The second greatest thing Oleg was that he was the first to deliver a powerful blow to the aggressor - the Khazar Khaganate, who terrorized everything around.  When the <span>prophetic Oleg was</span> going to "take revenge on the unreasonable Khazars", the Pechenegs stood on his side, and the Magyars stood on the side of the enemies, who, having suffered enormous losses, were forced to flee for the Carpathians.  The Russian army was becoming invincible. </p>

It turned out to be beneficial also because in Kiev the level of civilization was slightly higher - crafts, crafts, the same trade and culture developed intensively there.  The united state was pulling up to the level of the future capital.  The new big power will later be called Rus.  Oleg and the growing Igor believed in the power of his army.

Merchants did not pay more exorbitant fees.  Perhaps this became only because the prophetic Oleg united under his command two Russian state centers - Kiev and Novgorod.

    <p>  In addition, Kiev was the gateway to Byzantium, which at that time was the center of science and culture and significantly surpassed all European countries in terms of civilization.  The signing of peace treaties with this country was, of course, in the hands of Russia.  Sung A.S.  Pushkin, Grand Duke Oleg nailed a shield to the gates of Tsaregrad (Constantinople), that is, conquered the city.  He would never have achieved such success if he had not committed the unification of Kiev and Novgorod.  The year of this great event will forever remain in the annals of Russian history.  The era of the formation of the Old Russian state is associated with the names of Oleg, Igor, Olga and Svyatoslav.  Kievan Rus at its peak occupied territories limited from the west by the Dniester and the upper reaches of the Vistula, tributaries of the Volga from the east, the Taman Peninsula from the south, and the upper reaches of the Northern Dvina from the north.  The unification of Novgorod and Kiev under Oleg laid the foundation for such a large state in Eastern Europe. </p><h2>  Comprehensive Problem Solving </h2>

The new state was an <span>early feudal monarchy,</span> where the sole ruler was at the head, concentrating all power in his hands.  The treasury was filled mainly due to tribute levied on conquered peoples.  Subjugation of neighboring tribes ensured the solution of several problems - raids decreased, revenues to the treasury increased, merchants transported goods duty-free, which ultimately also increased the country's power.  The solution to these problems could only be achieved by a strong state, the birth of which was the beginning of the unification of Novgorod and Kiev.  The date, the importance of which is difficult to overestimate, played a major role in the formation of our country.  Then there were internecine wars, and the collapse of the powers into small principalities, but the state that already existed was revived, united in the face of the enemy and defeated him in all wars.  This is the essence of Russia, this is its mentality, which is a combination of intellectual, emotional and cultural characteristics.  He went to the descendants from the Varangian squad Oleg, who came from the north to Constantinople and conquered it.

    <h2>  Short description </h2><p>  The unification of Kiev and Novgorod can be briefly described as follows.  After Rurik died in 879, power passed into the hands of his brother-in-law and guardian of his young son Igor.  Voevoda Oleg, having received the reins of government, strengthened and equiped the lands remaining after the deceased for three years.  Then, with a well-trained squad, the striking force of which was the Varangian warriors, he moved south to conquer the lands, preferably all along the trade route ‚Äúfrom the Varangians to the Greeks‚Äù, and thus save the merchants and the country from paying exorbitant tributes to transported goods.  Kiev, lying on this path, like Constantinople, were the most important tributaries of tribute. </p>
