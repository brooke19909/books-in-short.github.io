    <h2>  Luxury Vacation </h2><p>  Naturally, the country has hotels for vacationers with different levels of budget.  The most luxurious hotels are marked with five stars and guarantee a high quality of services and an excellent holiday experience.  It is worth considering the detailed rating of hotels in Turkey (5 stars). <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rating of hotels in Turkey" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/439026.jpg" width="600"></div>  In sunny Antalya, Mardan Palace 5 * is located - one of the most expensive and beautiful hotels in Turkey, striking the imagination of tourists with royal luxury and original design.  Fans of a relaxing beach holiday reckon this hotel for the largest pools in Europe with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 24,000 square meters, as well as sea water pools, which have become home to 1,500 species of fish.  Near the hotel there is a well-kept beach with sand brought from Egypt.  Such sand does not heat up in the summer heat and does not stick to the body.  Azure water, clean sun loungers and highly qualified hotel staff are necessary components for a luxury vacation.

    <h2>  The choice of our compatriots </h2><p>  Continues the rating of Kemer hotels in Turkey with the luxury hotel Rixos Hotel Tekirova 5 *, which is the most popular among Russian tourists.  It is an ideal choice for family vacations, travel company and even alone.  Gourmets will appreciate the high-quality and original menu and the high level of service, and the mountain landscapes and luxuriously decorated territory will not leave indifferent tourists interested in spending time actively.  Animators are polite and attentive, and the evening cultural program is designed for representatives of all age groups. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rating of hotels Turkey 5" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/440516.jpg" width="600"></div>  The rating of hotels in Turkey (5 stars) deservedly included two more Kemer hotels.  This is the network of Amara Dolce Vita 5 * and Vogue Hotel Avantgarde 5 *.  The Amara network is successfully developing in three areas: Luxury, Comfort and Nature.  The hotel itself is located in a pine forest in a vast green area with high-quality food and luxury service.  The rooms are not very large in size and there is no bar on the beach.  But the natural conditions are ideal for a good rest due to the abundance of oxygen and greenery, as well as the proximity of natural reservoirs.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Vogue Hotel Avantgarde 5 * is located along the sea coast.  Tourists can choose villas that are located just 20 meters from the coast.  Not surprisingly, the hotel staff maintains excellent condition of the beach and sand embankments.  This distinguishes the territory from the pebble coasts of Kemer. </p><h2>  Top rated Turkey hotels </h2><p>  The opinion of tourists and their positive reviews become the main selection criterion for a potential vacationer.  Therefore, the rating of hotels in Turkey (5 stars) is so important.  Almost ideal luxury conditions were noted by tourists at the <span>Fantasia Hotel de Luxe</span> 5 *.  The spacious, well-soundproofed rooms are attractive.  In the restaurants at the hotel there is a Russian chef who has introduced some of the main national dishes on the menu. </p><p>  The rating of hotels in Turkey (5 stars) did not ignore Belek, where in 2011 the Maxx Royal Belek Golf &amp; Spa was opened, which stands out due to the impeccable level of service, trained staff and a regularly updated menu.  The exotic atmosphere of the rainforest appears before the eyes of tourists in Side, where the Club Golden Beach HV-1 5 * hotel is located, consisting of small bungalows and occupying more than 200 thousand square meters.  The hotel has a luxurious water park with six water slides and an amusement park for children.  Each room is a cozy apartment with a kitchen, fridge and stove. </p><h2>  Design leaders </h2><p>  Appearance creates a first impression, and this applies not only to people, but also to hotels.  The rating of the best hotels in Turkey will be incomplete, if not to mention Royal Adam &amp; Eve 5 *, made in the style of high-tech.  White prevails here, complemented by bright flashes of red and green.  Vast territories encourage active walks, and the clarity of lines, the abundance of mirrors and huge beds in the rooms finally position the hotel as a haven for couples in love.  Almost all tourists admire the immense hundred-meter pool. </p><h2>  Best vacation with kids </h2><p>  Accommodation in the hotel, which tops the rating of hotels in Turkey, for children is not as important as for adults.  The main thing is to find a cozy and quiet haven.  For example, Belek invites you to Rixos Premium Belek 5 * with high rates of quality of service and food.  Geographically, the hotel is located on the outskirts of a large pine forest.  And this fact provides an abundance of fresh air.  In just a few meters, a sandy beach with a length of almost 1000 meters opens, which is very surprising even for five-star hotels. </p><p>  On the territory of the nature reserve lurked the Cornelia De Luxe 5 * hotel.  Excellent conditions attract many Russian tourists, so all the staff speaks excellent Russian.  Both children's and adult animators receive extremely positive reviews from tourists.  Renovated and updated furniture annually. </p><h2>  Other factors for getting into the TOP </h2>

    <p>  Not only the green area and proximity to the beach attract tourists in the holiday season, but also a variety of food.  The Susesi Luxury Resort offers the gastronomic abundance of a premium hotel.  Tender meat, fresh fish, seasonal fruits and vegetables cooked in accordance with local recipes will certainly conquer holidaymakers.  Positive impressions are left by the show program for adults which hotels of Turkey offer.  Rating, customer reviews and a high level of service determine the leadership position of Susesi Luxury Resort and involve more significant costs. </p><p>  Choosing a hotel, you can combine business with pleasure, as is the case with Delphin Botanik World of Paradise 5 * in Alanya, which is a real botanical garden.  On its territory - more than 1,500 varieties of tropical plants.  The hotel is filled with greenery and flowers, so the first floors are quite dark, and mosquitoes may dominate.  Thus, an authentic tropical climate is offered.  Despite the inconvenience, customer reviews are positive, and the hotel tops the rating of hotels in Turkey for families. </p><h2>  Conquerors of the mountain peaks </h2><p>  Vacation is not only idle lying on the beach and going to the disco, but also the active development of previously unexplored places.  The rating of hotels in Turkey rightfully complements the Utopia World Hotel 5 *, which is distinguished by its mountainous location.  An elevator descends to the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãtourists, and you have to take a bus to it, which runs every five minutes.  This inconvenience is offset by the extraordinary beauty of Turkish nature and the variety of walks.  Mountain air has a healing effect on the body, so the hotel is chosen not only for summer vacation, but also for rehabilitation after an illness. </p><p>  Without the Starlight Convention Center Thalasso &amp; Spa 5 *, the rating of hotels in Turkey would be incomplete.  It should be noted the riding club and the botanical garden at the hotel.  Impeccable service and speed of settlement attract tourists.  There are separate areas for the entertainment of children and youth. </p><h2>  The importance of a beach holiday </h2><p>  Family and children's vacations are unthinkable without a good beach.  The closer it is to the hotel, the better.  Thanks to such indicators, Silence Beach Resort 5 *, which has an excellent beach, is regularly cleaned and involves relaxing without shoes with a convenient entrance to the water, entered the rating of Turkey hotels.  There are many multinational dishes in the hotel restaurants, but a rich assortment of oriental sweets will especially please. </p><h2>  What are the final ranking results? </h2><p>  Competition does not let Turkish businessmen relax, as new hotels are opened every year in different price categories, which determines the development and improvement of hotel services. </p><p>  Turkey provides tourists with a huge selection of vacation spots.  There is also a peculiar rating of 4 * hotels in Turkey operating on the All Inclusive system and offering three meals a day, free drinks and other bonuses.  It is worth noting the Magic Dream Resort 4 * and Magic Sun 4 * hotels, where there are always many Russian tourists, and, accordingly, the staff is well explained in Russian, and the menu has variations on the theme of familiar dishes. </p><p>  Almost all hotels are equipped with water attractions, water parks, heated pools and animations.  If you are embarrassed by the risk of gaining excess weight during the rest, then it is worth giving preference to hotels with a gym and gymnastic programs.  Fans of club entertainment, no doubt, will find attractive the suburbs of Marmaris, where nightlife is in full swing. <strong><br></strong> </p><h2>  Criterias of choice </h2>

    <p>  To focus on one of the hotels in Turkey, you need to highlight the main criteria.  This service, food system, the location of the beach and its cleanliness, the presence of animation, entertainment.  Service is a very conditional concept, and 4-star hotels in Turkey boldly compete with 5-star hotels.  Beach holidays in this country can be quite diverse, as there are both pebble and sandy coasts.  The resorts of Alanya, Antalya, Side, Belek attract tourists with pure golden sand, and Kemer has a pebble coating.  Many factors make it possible to tilt one's choice towards Turkey: the proximity to four seas, a mild climate with a minimum of annual precipitation, and historical delights of the East.  In addition, Turkey is a very affordable holiday option with a high level of security. </p><p>  The resorts of this country attract with its versatility and harmonious combination of Western service and oriental chic.  Every year, more than 10 million tourists with different levels of budget relax here.  In this country, lovers of family vacations, tired of lone society and noisy youth companies will find a certain charm.  In Turkey, the most loyal attitude to tourists from Russia, there are animations and signs in our language, and the staff of hotels and shopping centers can be explained in Russian. <strong><br></strong> </p><h2>  Tips of experienced travelers </h2><p>  Each person is individual and chooses a resort to his liking.  But there are several general recommendations that help simplify the selection process as much as possible. <br>  Firstly, it is worth deciding on the type of rest.  For a family vacation with children, Side or the most budgetary Alanya will be a reasonable choice.  A relaxing holiday with planned relaxation on the beach is offered in the cities of Didima and Kusadasi.  It will be especially comfortable when you speak some European language.  Fans of noisy parties will be delighted with the nightclubs of Bodrum and Marmaris. </p><p>  Secondly, a potential vacationer needs to determine the desired hotel status and the number of stars.  Five-star will be the most comfortable, but also the most expensive.  Costs are offset by well-kept beaches, increased attention to customer needs and excellent service. </p><p>  More economical hotel options - four- and three-star - do not have their own beach, so perhaps sun loungers and umbrellas will be paid. <br>  When choosing a place for a family holiday, you should clarify the distance to the airport, beach.  The entertainment program and the presence of children's animators are also important.  Summing up, we note that the hotels of Kemer, Belek, Side and Alanya are considered the most comfortable and reliable for families. </p>
