The year the city was founded continues to be a moot point.  According to the conviction of the well-known East Ukrainian historian V. A. Pirko, the date of the construction of the St. Nicholas Church should be considered Mariupol's birthday.  European traditions of the time claimed that the beginning of the city is considered the time of the erection of a stone building in the village. </p><p>  The official date of its foundation is considered to be 1778, when the district town of Pavlovsk was named Mariupol. </p><h2>  Mariupol welcomes guests </h2><p>  The industrial center near the sea is growing due to the powerful metallurgical and engineering industries.  The development of tourism stimulates the growth of the hotel business.  The constant influx of guests requires a solution to the problem of their resettlement. </p>
