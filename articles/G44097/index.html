Installation instructions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Our ancestors have been decorating the walls with wood inside and out since ancient times.  Ecological materials and ecodesign are now back in fashion.  ‚ÄúBack to nature, but with all the benefits of civilization‚Äù - that‚Äôs how the slogan sounds.  A decorative wooden board just helps to cope with the task. </p><h2>  Advantages of wood finishes </h2><ol><li>  Wood is an environmentally friendly and natural product.  Polished parquet floors, furniture, claddings look beautiful.  But unedged wood looks more natural. </li><li>  Strength wood does not replace concrete or stone.  Nevertheless, it has sufficient strength and wear resistance.  In addition, the wood is quite flexible, and nothing will happen to it where, for example, aerated concrete breaks down or cracked plaster. </li><li>  A house revetted with wood is not only beautiful, but also functional.  Wood has a low level of thermal conductivity.  And your home will always be warm. </li><li>  The facade board, which is cladding the house from the outside, is a fairly flexible and porous material, and it is a good sound insulator. </li><li>  Decorative <span>boards on the wall</span> are characterized by a wide range of colors, they can be matched to any design and decorated to your liking. </li><li>  Almost any person who has hands and brains can assemble such a wooden cladding.  There are only three types of decorative board mounting: spike groove, overlap and butt. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.christoffandsons.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorative board on the wall" class="if uuid-2643735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12545/2643735.jpg"></div><h2>  The disadvantages of wood finishes </h2><ol><li>  High price.  This is especially true for woods such as oak.  So, if you decide to put an oak parquet floor, it will cost you a pretty penny. </li><li>  Wood is highly flammable.  It is, of course, impregnated with various flame retardants, but they only reduce flammability, and do not completely exclude it.  It should be borne in mind that this is all chemistry. </li><li>  Periodic prophylaxis.  This is especially true for finishing unedged boards outside the house or cladding rooms with high humidity.  In these cases, the protective coating of wood will need to be updated every few years. </li></ol><h2>  Types of processing </h2><p>  By type of processing boards are edged, unedged, croaker.  It is worth determining that it is customary to call a wooden board in construction wood products whose width of the plank exceeds its thickness by 2 or more times.  Edged board is processed from all sides. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sebringdesignbuild.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorative board" class="if uuid-2643739" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12545/2643739.jpg"></div><p>  Processing is carried out in a technical way - planing, grinding, sawing.  Unedged board is processed only on two sides.  A croaker or peeling is a cut of the log along the edges.  They have only one surface, others are not processed. </p><h2>  The purpose of the boards </h2><p>  By purpose, the boards are divided into frontal, terrace and ship.  The windshield can trim the transition zone from the wall of the house to the roof.  Sometimes this is called the material that is used to make platbands. </p><p>  The shipboard is intended, as the name implies, to decorate the sides and decks of ships.  This thick, strong, well-planed board made of expensive wood has a luxurious appearance, texture, is considered an expensive material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.armstrongflooring.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself decorative board" class="if uuid-2643729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12545/2643729.jpg"></div><p>  The terrace board is the same as the shipboard.  But for its manufacture is used not so expensive wood.  Therefore, it will be cheaper to finish a balcony or facade with a terrace board than a ship. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Types of finishing boards </h2><p>  The most popular material is lining.  This name appeared at the beginning of the twentieth century, when train cars from the inside began to be lined with material.  Typically, the cladding is mounted on a frame of wooden beams.  There are many varieties of lining, and the most common are block house and <span>imitation of timber.</span>  With the appearance of the beam, everything is clear, but by a block house we mean slats similar in appearance to a round log.  Now marketers are trying to separate the block house into a separate view, but this is a lining. </p><div class="photo" data-original="guigaoliveira.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wood decorative board" class="if uuid-2643737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12545/2643737.jpg"></div><p>  Planken is a decorating material.  Plancken appeared before modern wall paneling.  Initially, the cars were lined with a flat board, and only a little later on the heels did the spike-groove connection appear.  The interior planken is lapped or butt.  And outside always mount an overlap.  Moreover, the boards are packed horizontally so that rain flows down on them.  If you are planning to mount the plank of the boards end-to-end, note that you need to leave a match-wide gap between the boards to compensate for the expansion of the wood with fluctuations in humidity and temperature. </p><p>  Now the laminate covers not only the floor, but also the walls.  Laminate is an affordable alternative to parquet. </p><h2>  Species of trees for a cutting board </h2><p>  The finishing board is most often made from linden, alder, oak, ash, aspen, larch, cedar, pine and spruce.  Oak is an elite breed, it is characterized by excellent strength.  The price per square meter starts at $ 100.  The budget option would be linden or alder, prices for which range from 20-30 dollars per square meter.  Aspen and ash will be slightly more expensive, the price per square meter is from 40-50 dollars.  Larch is the same high-quality and durable shipboard.  Cedar is valued almost as much as larch, although it is less durable and resistant to decay. </p><h2>  What to focus on when decorating with a decorative board.  A photo </h2><p>  How to decorate a bedroom?  Decorating with a decorative board will be appropriate at the head of the bed.  It can be a small fragment or the entire wall. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.harveynorman.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorative board photo" class="if uuid-2643728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12545/2643728.jpg"></div><p>  A large plasma TV looks great on a wooden background.

Or the whole wall. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ewindandsolar.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.ewindandsolar.com/splendid-shiplap-for-contemporary-home-design-ideas/vivacious-shiplap-with-white-pendant-light-and-kitchen-island-also-white-kitchen-cabinets-for-modern-kitchen-design/"><img itemprop="image" alt="wooden decorative board" class="if uuid-2643958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12545/2643958.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a decorative board with your own hands.  Useful Tips </h2><p>  For the manufacture of decorative cutting boards use cedar, pine, aspen, oak, beech, birch.  Usually they are decorated with a pattern that is applied with acrylics or burned out.  For cutting, such boards are not used.  Most often they are used as a decor element or as a tray.  Stacked cutting boards, which are assembled from bars of different colors, also look very good.  Cutting boards used as an element of decor can be different.  For example, in the form of a pear, apple, leaf, heart, etc. How can I make a decorative board myself? </p><p>  To make a board you will need: </p><ul><li>  a wooden blank of the shape you need; </li><li>  a card with a picture for decoupage; </li><li>  PVA or special decoupage glue; </li><li>  acrylic paints, including gold, silver, bronze; </li><li>  sponge; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  acrylic varnish; </li><li>  tassels; </li><li>  beads; </li><li>  tapes. </li></ul><p>  Sand the wooden blank on both sides and cover with 1-2 layers of a white primer.  It can be white acrylic paint diluted with water in a ratio of 2 to 1. Or it can be the acrylic primer itself.  Cut the desired pattern from the card and soak in water for 20 seconds.  Remove from water, blot excess moisture.  Glue the picture to the blank.  Put glue on top and evenly distribute it with a brush.  Dry for 30-60 minutes.  Take paints and paint free places on the picture as you like.  You will create an interesting effect if you take a sponge, mix gold and bronze paints, dip a sponge into the mixture and apply paint along the edges and ends of the workpiece.  Dry for 30-60 minutes.  Then take the varnish, apply to the workpiece in an even layer.  Dry it.  Cut 20 cm of ribbon, fold in half and tie a knot.  Pass the ribbon into the workpiece opening so that the knot is at the front side.  It is necessary to thread one loop into another, tighten and hide the knot in the back.  It remains to put on a few beads and hang a decorative board on a wall or door. </p>
