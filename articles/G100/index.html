    <p>  Hotel Cartago Nova 3 (Spain) is a large nine-story building located near the road and railways.  The hotel has a small enclosed area where guests can relax and have fun.  For example, there is a rather large swimming pool with water slides that delight both adult tourists and children. </p><p>  By the way, the hotel was built in 1972.  But do not worry about the age of the building, since only a few years ago (in 2009) a complete reconstruction was carried out here, and today the hotel's atmosphere fully meets modern requirements and standards. </p><h2>  Description of rooms </h2>

    <p>  It's no secret that traveling on the coast of Spain primarily means a beach holiday.  So does Cartago Nova 3 have its own beach?  Costa del Maresme is a fairly long coastal zone.  And right next to the hotel is the beach of Platja de LAstillero.  This place is not the property of the hotel, so not only residents, but also tourists from other places have a rest here.  Nevertheless, there are always enough sun loungers, mattresses and umbrellas here, however, you have to pay extra for them separately.  Like on any other beach, here for a small fee you will have the opportunity to ride catamarans, water skiing or do some other water sports. </p><h2>  Are there any conditions for children? </h2><p>  Of course, parents who are going on a trip with their children are primarily interested in the question of whether there are conditions on the hotel for the whole family.  And the Cartago Nova 3 offers some amenities.  For example, a cot will be delivered to the room for a small child.  And the restaurant's menu has dishes that will appeal to children. </p><p>  In addition, the pool has a safe area for bathing children - toddlers and older children can have a great time.  There is also a mini club, which is designed for children aged 4 to 12 years.  Here, experienced teachers and animators will be engaged with your child, who will make the child's vacation unforgettable.  In the evenings, children are dancing, where you can also have fun. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure and services offered </h2>

    <p>  Of course, the beach hotel offers its residents a lot of opportunities to have a good time.  As already mentioned, the hotel has its own rather large pool, which is perfect for people who do not want to go to a crowded beach.  There are also small <span>water slides.</span>  There are sun loungers and parasols around the pool, which guests can use for free. </p><p>  By the way, fun competitions in water polo are regularly held in the pool.  In addition, hotel residents have the opportunity to do <span>water aerobics</span> together with experienced and talented trainers. </p><p>  The hotel also has a billiards room, where fans of this game can have fun.  There is also a TV lounge.  The hotel has a group of talented animators who provide performances both in the daytime and in the evening.  In the evenings, live music is played, and at night the Tropicana disco opens its doors, where everyone can have fun, dance and make new friends. </p><p>  Do not forget that the hotel is located very close to the city center.  In just a few minutes you can reach bustling markets, boutiques and some interesting historical sights.  And just a few steps from the hotel building is a huge shopping center where you can buy almost everything, from food and basic necessities to clothes, furniture and appliances. </p><p>  The hotel also has a tour desk.  The staff is always ready to help guests choose the right tour.  Here you will be given special brochures, talk about interesting places in the vicinity of the city and even help organize a short trip to Barcelona. </p><h2>  For which category of vacationers is this hotel suitable? </h2><p>  Cartago Nova 3 Hotel (Spain) is recommended primarily for youth companies who want to have fun while having fun at concerts and parties.  In addition, the hotel is perfect for families with children, as even the smallest travelers will have something to do here.  Travel agents also recommend this place to people with disabilities.  And, of course, the hotel is perfect for a quality budget vacation. </p><h2>  Cartago Nova 3 Hotel: traveler reviews </h2><p>  Of course, when searching for a suitable ‚Äúrefuge‚Äù, travelers are primarily interested in the feedback from tourists who have already managed to visit this place.  Hotel 3 Cartago Nova (Malgrat) has both obvious advantages and some disadvantages.  Hotel guests respond well to food, as the dishes here are always varied and tasty.  On the other hand, with full occupancy of the hotel, sometimes you have to wait for a table in a restaurant.  Young people enjoy fun evening parties by the pool, but can interfere with families with small children.  Therefore, experienced travelers are advised to settle in the northern part of the building - here the sounds of music will not disturb.  Tourists also warmly respond to the staff.  All employees of the hotel perfectly cope with their duties, always ready to help solve a particular problem.  The rooms are comfortable and clean, which is also commendable.  And, of course, the undoubted advantage of the hotel is its relatively low cost. </p><p>  To summarize, we can say that you should not count on unprecedented luxury or ultramodern service - this is still a three-star hotel.  Nevertheless, it is quite possible to have fun and have a good rest. </p>
