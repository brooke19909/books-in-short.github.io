Each of the 13 rulers tried to leave a good memory of themselves, and therefore, in their city, architectural structures were erected by their order, striking amazing beauty.  The most valuable national treasure, which stores about 300 objects protected by UNESCO, allows all tourists to touch the history. </p><h2>  Long-suffering city </h2><p>  Colorful Hue (Vietnam) is one of the most interesting cities in the country.  The administrative center of the province of Tua Thien, built on the bend of the Huong River, whose name translates as "fragrant", until the beginning of the XIV century belonged to the kingdom of Champa.  And two centuries later, it was owned by the Nguyen dynasty, which turned the city into the main cultural, commercial and religious center of the state.  Emperor Zia Long moved the capital here at the beginning of the 19th century to unite the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hue vietnam" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1718959.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Hu·∫ø is an amazing city whose inhabitants fiercely resisted the French colonialists and fought against the pro-American regime.  More than 70 years ago, the Communists overthrew the last emperor, and in 1968 the long-suffering Hue was captured by the troops of North Vietnam, and the occupation lasted almost a month.  During that time, 10 thousand people from among civilians were killed.  The city was seriously damaged as a result of the bombing and lost its former significance, and many historical sites will never be able to be restored.  The communist government, unhappy that the main attractions of Hue belonged to the ousted monarchs, did not care about the cultural heritage, and only in 1990, the monuments were declared a national treasure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resort Climate </h2><p>  In recent decades, the resort is gaining popularity among European tourists, but the Russians, unfortunately, know almost nothing about it.  For those who are going to visit Hue (Vietnam), you need to remember that the tropical climate here is significantly different from other regions.  The mountains surrounding the resort contribute to frequent rainfall, and the rainy season falls from September to November.  During this time, even floods are possible.  The temperature often drops to eight degrees, and therefore tourists need to take care of warm clothes and an umbrella. </p><p>  If in the summer rains appear suddenly, then in the fall they go for weeks.  From March to August, dry weather is maintained with an average temperature of about 30 degrees. </p><h2>  Emperor's Citadel </h2><p>  Tourists who arrived in the hot city of Hue (Vietnam) will never be bored: in the excursion plan, he has no equal.  Inspection begins with historical attractions within the city, and then vacationers take buses to the Hu·∫ø neighborhood, where the famous tombs of the rulers of Vietnam are located.  Those who wish can get to them, moving by boats along the river, the waters of which exude a pleasant aroma. </p><p>  The main residence of emperors is a historical monument, and it is with it that the acquaintance with the many-faced Hue (Vietnam) begins.  Photos of the citadel, damaged during the wars, are decorated with all city guides.  And to this day, restoration work is ongoing on the complex, which began 20 years ago. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hue vietnam attractions" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1718961.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The citadel that appeared in the 19th century, built by order of Zy Long, consists of three complexes: external, imperial and "forbidden".  Inside a powerful fortress of irregular quadrangular shape is a whole city of rulers with palaces and temples, gardens and museums.  Behind the gates of the citadel with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 10,000 square meters.  m mounted guns that never fired. </p><h2>  Ngo Mon Gate </h2><p>  The main entrance to the fortress is the two-level Ngo Mon gate built in 1833, from whose balustrades decrees were read to the residents of Hue (Vietnam).  The sights led to the fortress and served as an observation post for the imperial family, watching the military parades.  This is a whole architectural ensemble, which consists of a base and an upper pavilion.  The gates were opened only during ceremonies held in the palace. </p><h2>  Hue (Vietnam): what to see in the imperial citadel? </h2><p>  The most complex object in architectural terms is the royal "Palace of Higher Harmony", where the ruler gathered important persons.  80 iron columns of the building are decorated with images of golden dragons - symbols of imperial power.  In addition, the residence of the ruler served as a library: poetic lines in Chinese were carved on the walls. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the emperor, seated on his throne, could hear all the conversations that took place in other halls, and modern scientists do not understand how the ancient masters working in Hue (Vietnam) could achieve such an acoustic effect.  Sights, photos of which convey the atmosphere of past centuries, become the subject of admiration for all tourists vacationing at the resort.  Here is the palace of Zien Tho - the king‚Äôs mother.  A feature of the structure is a system of corridors that connected it with the residence of the emperor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hue resort vietnam" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1718988.jpg" width="600"></div>

The architectural ensemble included 130 buildings, and now there is little left of them. </p><h2>  Royal tombs </h2><p>  Of course, the rich history of Hue (Vietnam) cannot be imagined without the imperial mausoleums.  On the bank of the Fragrant River there are ancient tombs, which were erected during the life of the rulers, prudently concerned about the construction of beautiful tombs for themselves.  Unique structures deserve to be seen and spent all day here.  Luxurious complexes do not resemble burial places at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hue city vietnam" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1718971.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The architectural ensemble of each tomb is a whole city, which is dedicated to a separate king.  There were 13 monarchs in the Nguyen dynasty, but only seven of them built mausoleums.  The graves are surrounded by sculptures of spirits guarding kings in the underworld.  Having embodied the features of the Vietnamese and Buddhist cultures, the mausoleums are decorated with bizarre drawings and patterns. </p><h2>  Tomb of Khai Ding </h2><p>  The tomb of Khai Ding, who ruled the country for nine years, is best preserved.  The king, who visited France, was delighted with her amazing masterpieces of architecture and ordered the construction of a tomb with elements of Western architecture.  Amazing with grace and special beauty, it is built of concrete, slate and iron.  The interior decoration surprises guests: the interior is decorated with pieces of colored glass and ceramics, and resembles an exquisite oriental mosaic.  High ceilings are painted with images of dragons and clouds. </p><h2>  Mausoleum of Tu Duc </h2><p>  Emperor Tu Duk, who reigned on the throne for 35 years, built a real city consisting of 50 buildings.  It is known that he was a great romantic, and at the site of his tomb was immersed in dreams.  The huge complex with temples and numerous graves was once admired, and now the guests of Hue (Vietnam), whose sights reflect his rich past, observe the ruined walls covered with grass.  The side where the king‚Äôs numerous wives and concubines rest is completely wiped off the face of the earth, and the modest tomb of the ruler is well preserved to our time.  The famous poet writes in the mausoleum, next to which are the reading and theater pavilions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vietnam hue reviews" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1718974.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  City bridge </h2><p>  The Truong Thien bridge, which is connected to the historical part and the modern resort, is not a historical object, but it is of interest because it was built according to the project of the famous engineer Eiffel.  The Frenchman designed a structure more than 400 meters long using the most modern technologies of that time.  The bridge, opened in 1899, was damaged by storms and was destroyed by American troops, and only 22 years ago it was restored. </p><p>  The central part is given for the passage of cyclists, and pedestrians walk along the side.  Truong Thien is especially beautiful in the evenings, when color lights begin to work, emphasizing his graceful silhouette.  This is a delightful sight to enjoy until the morning. </p><h2>  Pagoda Thien Mu </h2><p>  The visiting card of Hue (Vietnam) is the Thien Mu Pagoda, whose seven tiers symbolize the reincarnation of the Buddha, and the ringing of a huge bell weighing more than two tons is heard even in the farthest corners of the resort.  At the foot of the monument, towering above the river, a sculpture of a turtle is installed - a symbol of longevity and wisdom. </p><p>  In the 60s of the last century, authorities tried to ban Buddhism, which caused discontent among the population.  In protest, the monk Thih Quang Duk self-immolated in Saigon, and a car was exhibited in the pagoda on which he went to <span>South Vietnam.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hue vietnam what to see" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1718978.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hue: traveler reviews </h2><p>  Guests of the resort admit that this is one of the most mysterious cities in the country.  For those who are interested in history and appreciate Asian architecture, the former capital will be a real discovery.  They don‚Äôt come here to bask on the white beaches.  A city where everything breathes history, stores unique sights, which are simply impossible not to get to know.  And to spend here only a few days is very little. </p><p>  Tourists admire the local cuisine, considered the best in the country, and even assure that it has something in common with French.  Skillfully prepared and beautifully served dishes will delight even the most sophisticated gourmets. </p><p>  Torment of the resort guests is caused by heavy rains, which can ruin the plans.  And even if during the day the sweltering heat reigns, in the evening the sky is inhaled by gloomy clouds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hue Vietnam Attractions Photos" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1718989.jpg" width="600"></div>
