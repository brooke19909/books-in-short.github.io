To date, scientists have not yet established all the consequences of acid rain.  It is only clear that washing with rain water to improve the condition of the skin of the face, as it was 20 years ago, can not be categorically.  This is because acid rains can have a negative and unpredictable effect on both the face and overall health.  Their harm to the whole living world, economy and agriculture is irreplaceable. </p><p>  <strong>Acid Rains: Causes and Consequences</strong> </p><p>  Any precipitation that has fallen to the ground, despite its external purity, in reality includes the smallest particles of dust, all kinds of <span>pathogenic microorganisms,</span> pollen from all over the world, spores of fungi, as well as heavy metals that enter the atmosphere along with emissions from plants and factories.  All of these inclusions in rainy weather spills over the heads of the inhabitants of the Earth, and it is difficult to imagine what this threatens. </p><p>  Everyone knows the fact of the negative impact of acid rain on the state of our entire environment.  Over time, the concentration of heavy metal salts, which are highly toxic, such as lead and cadmium, increases in water bodies.  Ecologists and doctors, for this reason, strongly recommend not to swim at all or to do it rarely in order to protect themselves from the effects of acid rain, as the body's reaction can be unpredictable. </p><p>  Acid rains seriously affect the human body if they contain manganese, the content of which can be huge.  Manganese clogs the channels of nerve cells, which causes severe fatigue, reduces performance, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, and nausea.  No less dangerous is aluminum, which, gradually accumulating over several years, can affect the development of all kinds of neurological diseases. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Acid rain can occur due to the burning of fossil fuels, with <span>nitrogen</span> and sulfur <span>oxides</span> entering the atmosphere.  <span>Sulfur oxides,</span> combining in the atmosphere with water droplets, form sulfuric acid, which, when precipitated, damages the economy and nature (fishing, forestry and agriculture, etc.).  European forests are damaged in almost 38% of the area, it is highly likely that irreparable damage has already been done in acidifying the soil in vast areas.  Acid rain had a negative effect on the soils of North America, Europe and Asia, and recently there has been information about damage to the living world of marine areas. </p><p>  The most disturbing aspect of the consequences of sulfur emissions is the inability to influence the problem that has arisen, even controlling emissions in enterprises. </p><p>  The amount of damage to the environment is difficult to assess, since it depends on the <span>composition of the soil</span> and bedrock.  Nevertheless, there is a version that underlying siliceous soils, a thin layer of soils and soft water of those territories where precipitation falls are more vulnerable.  This is due to the insufficient solubility of stony rocks and the lack of <span>alkaline</span> substances in <span>water</span> , which can soften the change in acidity.  As a result, there is a significant decrease in the number of fish in water bodies. </p><p>  In the modern world, the impact on the troposphere has become global, and therefore it is important to establish international cooperation to study this problem, and if necessary, take concrete measures. </p><p>  Solving the problem <span>of atmospheric pollution</span> with sulfur dioxide involves reducing energy consumption, improving emissions control, or finding and creating alternative methods for generating electricity. </p>
