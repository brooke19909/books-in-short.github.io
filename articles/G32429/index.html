    <p>  Management as the art of management arose in ancient times.  His description as a type of human activity is found in the writings of Socrates.  <span>The ancient Greek philosopher,</span> who lived in the first millennium BC, describes the process of managing people as an attempt to put a certain person in a certain place and achieve the desired result of activity from him.  Judging by many sources that have survived to this day, the history of management originated several millennia ago, and the science of <span>managing people</span> went through several specific stages in its formation. </p><p>  Prehistoric people who lived scattered, did not need to control their activities from the outside.  The main purpose of their existence was to survive in the harsh conditions of nature.  Our ancient ancestors, united to live together in tribes, already needed a wise person next to them, making optimal decisions for the whole tribe, resolving conflicts within the tribe, and pronouncing sentences on punishment of those guilty.  The leader became such a person.  As the social groups of people grew, the need arose for the division of labor, however, all this work also had to be controlled by someone from the outside.  So the first rudiments of managing certain groups of people appear, separated by their professional characteristics. </p><p>  The history of management in the modern sense of the word begins with the <span>industrial revolution that</span> took place in the 17-19 centuries.  It was during this period in Europe that the first manufacturing enterprises emerged that needed truly talented managers.  Management science is taking shape by the end of the 19th century.  In this period of time, the first works of scientists devoted to this type of human activity appear. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em><strong>Stages and schools in the history of management</strong></em> </p><p>  Management as a professional activity is first considered by the American G. Town in his report, prepared for speaking at a meeting of the Society of Mechanical Engineers.  At this meeting, for the first time, he expresses his opinion that society needs the training of specialist managers. </p><p>  In total, over the history of economic studies of the 20th century, five management schools were formed: </p><p>  - <span>School of Scientific Management</span> (founder <span>F. Taylor,</span> author of many books on this topic); </p><p>  - administrative school (founder - French engineer A. Fayol); </p><p>  - quantitative school (representatives - D. Thompson, G. Ackoff, D. March); </p><p>  - Behavioral school (its formation is associated with the development of sociology and psychology, C. Bernard, F. Herzberg, K. Ardzhiris are considered famous representatives); </p><p>  - <span>School of human relations</span> (founder - American E. Mayo). </p><p>  The history of management includes five main stages in the development of management, the first of which begins at the dawn of the 20th century and coincides with the birth of the school of scientific management.  The emergence of the administrative school of Fayol in the first decade of the 20th century marked the onset of the second stage of development of managerial activity. </p><p>  At the same time, the history of financial management begins in the United States.  The Second World War has a significant impact on the formation of managerial thought, the first twenty years after its end coincide with the third stage of management optimization. </p><p>  The next stage in the development of managerial activity is associated with science - psychology, which is only gaining momentum.  The fifth stage in the development of management (the 80s) is characterized by the opening of such a powerful mechanism as the organizational structure.  Modern management is associated with the development of computer technology and automation of production.  Today, the history of management does not end; the science of management continues to actively develop and improve. </p>
