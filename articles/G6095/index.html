    <h2>  Tip # 1: Compare the Serial Number </h2><p>  Let's say your purchased iPhone was delivered in the original box of the American company Apple.  In this case, you should compare the <span>serial numbers that</span> are written on the device itself and on the box.  If these numbers do not match, it means that you were not provided with the original packaging from the smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tip # 2: study the terms of purchase </h2><p>  Now the Internet is starting to go deeper and deeper on <span>workdays</span> and weekends of our lives.  And if several years ago, in order to buy a new device, everyone went to a mobile phone salon, now buying gadgets through an international network is gaining more and more popularity.  This may not be so fast, but in some cases it can be beneficial in the form of saved money.  However, each buyer in this case must understand that he can conclude a deal with an unscrupulous seller.  To avoid problems in the near future, initially study the conditions of the transaction itself.  Read what the website says about sales and refunds, or contact the seller and clarify these points with his help. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to distinguish a restored iphone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34483/1186254.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Tip # 3: check the warranty </h2><p>  Even if you bought a restored iPhone (what this means, we already said at the beginning of the article), a guarantee should apply to it.  It is valid only for one year, but there is the possibility of extension to two years.  We advise the reader who decided to purchase the restored iPhone to contact the Russian representatives of the company in advance and know for sure whether the warranty applies to your device.  This procedure is especially important when you are buying the device not in a mobile phone salon, but from third parties. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Brief facts about reconditioned devices </h2><p>  To the question "Restored iPhone - what does it mean?"  we have already answered.  Devices of this type are smartphones that have been repackaged in a new way for re-sale after the completion of recovery procedures.  This we already found out at the beginning of the article.  Now we briefly list the main points valid for such devices: </p><ol><li>  Any restored iPhone (reviews can be read at the end of the article) is repaired at Apple service centers. </li><li>  Technical services reserve the right to integrate spare parts in smartphones if the device was previously defective. </li><li>  Any restored iPhone, the price of which is automatically reduced by about a third, is certified by Apple. </li><li>  After the repair of the device is completed, it will be recognized as fully operational and functioning. </li><li>  In order to find out if the device has been restored, you should check the serial codes on the packaging and on the iPhone itself. </li></ol><p>  And now let's talk in more detail about how to do this. </p><h2>  We check the box, smartphone and look at the serial number </h2><ul><li>  <em>Step one.</em>  So, for starters, take the packaging from the iPhone and look for a seal there.  It should be written Apple Certified.  Printing will give additional confirmation that the device has previously passed the restoration procedure at a service center, after which it was tested by competent specialists. </li><li>  <em>Step Two</em>  Check the packaging with the box.  If your device has been restored, then most likely you will find it in a completely white package.  The restored device can be sold by third parties in non-branded packaging. </li><li>  <em>Step Three</em>  We are looking for the serial number of our device.  He will help us find out information about recovery.  If the device is turned on, go to the desktop and go to settings.  There, select "General", then - "About the device."  In it you need to find the column ‚ÄúSerial number‚Äù.  In the event that the smartphone is in the off state, you should get to the slot where you usually insert the SIM card.  There you can find the coveted sequence of characters. </li><li>  <em>Step Four</em>  Now we find out information about the device using the serial number.  Look at the first digit.  If it says ‚Äú5‚Äù, then it has been restored and certified by the company.  The third figure can tell us about the year of manufacture of the smartphone.  For example, the number ‚Äú0‚Äù will indicate that the device was manufactured in 2010.  Thus, now you know the answer to the question of how to distinguish a restored iPhone.  And it is time for us to proceed to the conclusion of the article. </li></ul><h2>  Refurbished iPhone: reviews on devices and whether to buy </h2><p>  An interesting fact gives a very good answer to the last question.  In 2015, the sales data of the restored iPhone 5S surprised even the representatives of the American company.  The price was almost halved, which caused an unprecedented rise.  Many analysts are inclined to think that there is nothing shameful in buying restored iPhones.  In fact, you are buying a device with a replaced ‚Äústuffing‚Äù at a lower price. </p><p>  Prices of reconditioned devices: </p><ul><li>  iPhone 5S - 28 thousand rubles. </li><li>  iPhone 6 - 40 thousand rubles. </li></ul>
