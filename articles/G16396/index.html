  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pension Fund Insurance Certificate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every citizen must have a <span>pension</span> fund <span>insurance certificate</span> .  This is what the legislative acts of our country say.  In particular, this applies to those who are registered in the OPS, that is, in the <span>mandatory pension insurance system.</span>  In this system, the Pension Fund registers all residents of Russia.  Children as well as adolescents are no exception </p><p>  The territorial authority of the PFRF during registration for each insured opens a <span>personal account,</span> which is individual, has a permanent insurance number.  In addition, a special insurance certificate is issued on hand.  It contains important information that will be necessary when applying for a new job and not only. </p><p>  <strong>Insurance certificate</strong> </p><p>  By itself, it is a green plastic card.  This document confirms that the person is insured under the mandatory pension insurance system.  The insurance certificate itself must contain the following data: </p><p>  - SNILS (number); </p><p>  - place of birth, as well as date; </p><p>  - Name of the insured person; </p><p>  - date of registration in the system; </p><p>  - gender. </p><p>  SNILS is unique.  It belongs to only one person.  The <span>individual account number of a</span> citizen of our country records information on seniority, accruals, insurance premiums that were paid by a person.  This refers to <span>insurance contributions</span> to the PF paid by a citizen throughout his entire career.  All of them will be further taken into account when assigning a pension, its recalculation.  Assigning an insurance number is purely technical in nature.  It is carried out in order to simplify the procedure for assigning a pension (labor) to insured persons. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Citizens present an insurance certificate when applying for a new job, when concluding various kinds of contracts (for example, a contract for the provision of specific services or a <span>contract of a civil law nature).</span>  It is necessary to present this document so that the employer or the customer can provide the FIU with all the necessary information.  No one needs to give out an insurance certificate.  In some cases, just providing his number is enough.  The document is kept by its owner. </p><p>  If the employee does not have an insurance certificate, he will need to fill out a special form.  Within two weeks from the moment the labor contract was signed, the employer will transfer it to the FIU.  This will be followed by registration of the employee in the OPS system.  For three weeks the Pension Fund will have to open a personal account, as well as prepare and issue the insurance certificate itself. </p><p>  Further, the insurance certificate will be transferred to the employer, who will surely hand it to its owner.  The individual who pays the insurance premiums himself must independently apply to the FIU located in the place where he is registered as the insured. </p><p>  It often happens that an employee changes any personal data (for example, last name after marriage).  In this case, the policyholder will be required to submit all necessary information to the FIU.  There is a special application form for this.  The deadline for submitting new data is two weeks.  The FIU will reflect all changes and issue an insurance certificate.  The required data will be changed, however the individual number will remain the same. </p><p>  A statement of loss must be submitted to the policyholder within a month.  Based on it, a duplicate will be issued.  Persons who are unemployed should report the loss of the original to the PFR authority, which is located at their place of residence.  A duplicate will be issued within a month. </p><p>  As a rule, <span>registration of a pension</span> insurance certificate does not cause any difficulties. </p>
