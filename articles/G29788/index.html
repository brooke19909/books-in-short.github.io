  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Patterns of children's clothes for girls</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, many different children's clothes are produced, and you can even get confused by such a choice.  Indeed, parents will often save on themselves better, and the child will buy all the best, expensive, high-quality and beautiful.  But when you consider how fast the children grow, it becomes clear that no matter how good the thing is, the child will soon become small.  How to create baby clothes?  Do-it-yourself pattern will help with this.  Everyone can do it if they try.  Therefore, for those who want to save money and not sacrifice quality and beauty, self-tailoring is an excellent solution. </p><h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  There are programs in which you can simulate a pattern of clothes.  And even though they are all paid, many have demos and trial lessons on modeling.  Patterns of children's clothing for beginners in large numbers can be found in specialized magazines.  Examples are presented below in the photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avtoclass83.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of baby gown" class="if uuid-2478740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43230/2478740.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, you can‚Äôt do without important tools, such as a sewing machine, scissors, a centimeter tape, a ruler, a Whatman paper or a sheet of other paper of a suitable size, and most importantly - fabric and threads. </p><p>  Patterns of children's clothes for girls will especially help.  Thanks to them, it is possible to sew a thing that fits in size, the desired length and with the required details (ruffles, bows, belt, etc.).  After all, girls often need more clothes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another important action is to take measurements from the child.  But here certain difficulties arise - not all children are ready to stand still and wait until mom takes measurements.  And if it is not possible to persuade the child, then it is worth taking measurements from clothes suitable for him by age, preferably from a slightly stretching fabric.  That is, we are building a pattern of children's clothes from existing ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="postila.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="child dress" class="if uuid-2478751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43230/2478751.jpg"></div><p>  Necessary measurements: height, chest, waist, hips, neck, length of the back and front to the waist, shoulder length, total shoulder width, sleeve length (best measured to the bent arm) and back width. </p><h2>  Important Rules </h2><p>  It is necessary to wash the fabric before cutting, otherwise if it shrinks, you will get the product much narrower and shorter than required.  Especially when you consider that cotton is one of the main fabrics for children's clothing. </p><p>  The child should be comfortable wearing clothes and moving in them.  To do this, you should choose natural fabrics, a loose style, sew in a zipper or elastic tape (elastic band).  Also, the size of the neck and sleeves should be sufficiently free for the child.  Therefore, it is worth building patterns of children's clothing for girls with these features in mind. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is also important to consider seam allowances.  Be sure to do this before cutting the fabric, otherwise the product parameters will be less than necessary. </p><p>  Building patterns for children's clothing.  How to make? </p><p>  On a piece of paper or paper, mark the measurements, connect the received lines, cut out the pattern.  On the seamy side of the fabric we attach the pattern with pins, circle it with chalk or a pencil (we place the fabric and the circuit on a flat surface).  We take into account seam allowances.  Cut out the fabric base.  We sew, process the neck, sleeves, bottom of the product. </p><h2>  Frill dress </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Frill dress" class="if uuid-2476143" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87255/2476143.jpg"></div><p>  For work it is necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãcotton fabric, threads, scissors. </p><p>  We pin the pattern of children's clothing to the fabric from the wrong side, mark with a pencil (or circle a dress that fits the size).  We measure the allowances for seams from all sides, cut out the base.  Separately, we cut out a frill with a width of 5 cm and a length one and a half times the length of the dress.  We sew it with a straight line, make a frill, attach it to the front of the dress.  We sew the base, process the neck, the armholes of the sleeves, the bottom of the product.  Try on. </p><h2>  Dress on the straps </h2><div class="photo" data-original="weallsew.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Summer dress with straps" class="if uuid-2476153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87255/2476153.jpg"></div><p>  For work you will need: a cotton fabric, 2 ribbons (you can also have one), scissors, threads. </p><p>  We measure the main part of the dress according to the pattern, separately cut the bottom out of a fabric of a different color, but suitable for the main one.  We sew two parts of the base, we process the inlay of the armpit of the axillary part.  We also sew the bottom of the base of the dress and fabric of a different color.  We process the bottom of the product.  We sew holes for tapes.  For beauty, you can choose ribbons of contrasting colors.  We pass them. </p><h2>  Dress with a belt at the waist </h2><div class="photo" data-original="cnpettiskirt.en.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dress with a belt" class="if uuid-2476158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87255/2476158.jpg"></div><p>  For work, you need scissors, threads, the fabric can be cotton or dense, but then you should sew a dress with a lining, a zipper, a ribbon if necessary. </p><p>  We cut out the details of the future dress - the basis of the upper part (just circle a shirt with a pencil to the waist), a belt (or buy a ribbon 3-5 cm wide, twice as long as the waist circumference).  Separately, we cut the lower part - the skirt.  To do this, take a rectangular piece of fabric.  The length and width are chosen arbitrarily, depending on the height of the child, the desired length of the dress, the splendor of the product.  We sew the details of the base, on top we sew the belt.  We process the edges.  If you want the dress to have a tight-fitting silhouette (which is implied for this dress), then you need to sew a zipper into the upper part.  If this is difficult, it is recommended that the elastic tape be inserted into the waist from the back (the presence of elastic will be hidden by a belt). </p><h2>  Dress with owls </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.piepiedesigns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dress with owls" class="if uuid-2476150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87255/2476150.jpg"></div><p>  For work, as in previous cases, 2 types of fabric of various colors, scissors, matching threads, buttons are required. </p><p>  We cut the basis of the dress on both types of fabric according to the pattern of children's clothing.  We sew both basics, sew the backs to each other, process the edges of the product, attach buttons (or sew buttons).  Done! </p>
