  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Liverpool City (United Kingdom): Tourist Attractions and Tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The city of Liverpool is one of the largest cities in the UK, located in the county of Merseyside.  This place is known around the world primarily for its connection with the famous Beatles band and its football team.  Music and sports fans dream of visiting here.  But Liverpool is not only interesting for this. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Liverpool is a vibrant English port city with a rich cultural heritage.  In 2008, he was even awarded the title of Cultural Capital of Europe. </p><p>  The city is located in the picturesque bay of the Mersey River, but the ocean is also close.  This affects the local climate.  The coldest month of the year is January (temperature up to + 3 ¬∞ ), and the warmest is July (with temperature about + 17 ¬∞ ).  In autumn, the city often rains and foggy weather.  Most tourists come to the city from April to October. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Liverpool city" class="if uuid-2279469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2279469.jpg"></div><p>  Liverpool has a lot of tourists during the season, so accommodation should be taken care of in advance.  It‚Äôs hard to find cheap hotels here, so if you don‚Äôt have the money, it‚Äôs easier to rent an apartment from a private trader. </p><h2>  How to get to your destination </h2><p>  Where is the city of Liverpool, we found out, but how to get to it?  There are several ways.  The fastest and most convenient option is to get from Moscow to London by plane and transfer to another plane to your destination.  Transplantation can also occur in many European cities (Milan, Riga, Frankfurt).  Such flights can be cheaper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From London to the city of Liverpool can be reached by train.  The trip takes approximately 3 hours.  A bus ride from the capital will take about 5 hours. </p><h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  Liverpool's main attractions are architecture.  The symbol of the city is the skyscraper of 1911, which is located on the waterfront.  The building is also the home of the legendary Liverpool birds that "sit" on the towers.  One of them looks towards the city, the other - at the river.  Noteworthy are the clocks on the skyscraper. </p><p>  A tourist must visit Albert Dock - the first dry dock of the city.  The warehouse complex, located on a vast territory, is now transformed into shops, cafes and hotels and is protected by UNESCO. </p><p>  St. George Hall, located near the train station - a monument of Greco-Roman architecture.  Inside you can see the best organ in Europe, while outside you can admire the frescoes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.caledoniantravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Liverpool" class="if uuid-2279471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2279471.jpg"></div><p>  The city hall of Liverpool, built in 1754, now serves as the residence of the Lord Mer.  The elegant stone building is decorated with columns, bas-reliefs and sculptures. </p><p>  Speck Hall is a Tudor-era country estate.  This place attracts a huge number of tourists.  One of the houses began to be built in 1530!  Ancient secret passages were preserved here, helping priests to hide during the reign of Elizabeth. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Worthy of inspection are the churches and temples of the city: the Church of St. Nicholas and Our Lady, the Cathedral, the Metropolitan Cathedral.  <span>The Catholic Cathedral is</span> built in the modernist style and can compete in size with the Roman Cathedral of St. Peter.  A huge bell and a tall bell tower are symbols of this place. </p><h2>  Museums and parks in Liverpool </h2><p>  The Liverpool World Museum contains an interesting collection of rocket science and Egyptology.  The Maritime Museum will familiarize the tourist with the maritime history of the city and show some real antique ships.  Visiting these places is free. </p><p>  The Beatles Four Liverpool Museum is the only museum in the world whose exposition tells only about this group.  Here you can see the personal belongings of the musicians, their instruments, costumes and much more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.beatlesstory.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beatles Museum" class="if uuid-2279478" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2279478.jpg"></div><p>  Ticket price 12.5 dollars.  This includes a fascinating guide story and a movie. </p><p>  Croxtet Hall and Country Park city parks are green corners in Liverpool.  The park is located in the center of a large estate and includes attractions such as the Victorian Garden, a home farm and a historic hall. </p><h2>  What to try in Liverpool </h2><p>  Liverpool is a city in England, so the cuisine here is quite simple, but at the same time refined and tasty. </p><p>  What establishments should a tourist visit in the first place to experience the local atmosphere?  The Pan American Club is loved by both locals and visitors alike for its cozy interior and excellent international cuisine.  Simple <span>British cuisine</span> is available in a place called The Living Room.  The best steaks and fish dishes are served at Fusion. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="restaurant in Liverpool" class="if uuid-2279479" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2279479.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to not just have dinner, but to taste the national drinks of Great Britain, visit any local pub.  Liverpool's pubs are considered the best in all of England. </p><h2>  City safety and travel tips </h2><p>  Liverpool (the photo of the city you see in the article) is a fairly safe place, but even here there are pitfalls.  The crime rate in the city is low, but this does not mean that you can leave valuables on the car panel or not monitor money and mobile phones.  Parking the vehicle at night (if you rented it) is in secure parking lots. </p><p>  If you stay late at a pub or bar, do not walk to the hotel.  It is better to use taxi services.  You should stay away from some areas of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Speck Hall Liverpool" class="if uuid-2279482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2279482.jpg"></div><p>  You should not wear clothes with the Manchester United logo, because football fans in England are aggressive. </p><p>  Currency is best exchanged in hotels, as banks often overcharge commissions.  While in the country, do not forget about the tip.  In the restaurant they will make up 10% of the order amount.  It is customary to encourage maids and taxi drivers. </p><p>  Do not forget about warm clothes and an umbrella, as the weather of Liverpool is unpredictable. </p><p>  Be polite and courteous with passers-by if you turn to them for help or with a question.  Liverpool men really appreciate good manners. </p>
