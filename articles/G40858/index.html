Penthouse Design</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Successful people value comfort and convenience, especially when it comes to home.  The price per square meter of such "comfort" depends not only on the material of the building, but also on the place where <span>this building</span> is located.  A penthouse can be safely called such a building, and even in the very center of the city. </p><h2>  What is a penthouse? </h2><p>  Penthouses are buildings of the De Luxe category, consisting of two or three floors, which are located on the roof of skyscrapers.  The peculiarity of such a structure is not even that it is not on the ground, but that any neighborhood is excluded.  The owner of the penthouse can feel the beauty of privacy. </p><p>  Russian elite penthouses are a bit away from the usual classical framework.  You can see them only in the most prestigious areas of Moscow.  Demand is several times greater than what Russian developers can offer.  Penthouses are <span>a wealth of</span> style, a palette of bright colors, modern infrastructure and unique projects created by modern designers and architects. </p><p>  Do not confuse home-made apartments on the roof of the building, which could be mistaken for a penthouse.  Very often people combine several apartments in one house together with an attic.  Such a room, of course, can be called a penthouse, but with a huge stretch. </p><h2>  Who claims to buy a penthouse </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since penthouses are business-class premises, high-ranking persons and officials are candidates for the right to own.  It would seem that everything is very simple - I bought it and live in good health, but not everyone succeeds.  Despite the fact that a square meter of such housing costs a lot of money, they are still popular, and demand is growing every day, and supply is becoming less and less. </p><p>  Many realtors offer a multi-level apartment, which can be remotely called business-class housing.  The proposed apartment should have not only several rooms on two or three floors combined with each other, but also a beautiful panorama of the forest park area from the window.  Often offers come with a view of the highway loaded with cars, which is filled with the smell of gasoline and gas.  Such a landscape not only does not add coziness, but rather pushes away from itself the realities of Moscow roads. </p><h2>  Penthouse Design </h2><p>  Penthouses are the personification of wealth, space and sophistication, which are not many.  If you have enough money to buy such an apartment, but you are not ready to invest in a designer and interior decoration with exclusive decorative elements, then such a purchase is clearly not for you.  Luxury has its advantages, but the usual abundance does not create comfort even in the largest apartment.  The main thing is not to turn the premises into 300 squares into a landfill. </p>

    <p>  Penthouse Design <strong> </strong>  will depend only on your preference.  The room can be decorated in several styles: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  classic; </li><li>  high tech; </li><li>  eclecticism; </li><li>  minimalism; </li><li>  modern. </li></ul><p>  There are many more options for interior design.  The project of a room can be developed by one professional or an entire studio, but if you feel an inexorable craving for creativity, which is torn out, you can try yourself in the role of decorator of your own home. </p><h2>  Layout </h2><p>  A penthouse is a room that is always located at a height; freedom and spaciousness should be felt in it.  The room should not be cluttered, so it is worth dividing it into several zones.  One will be responsible for the rest, the second will receive guests, and the third may well become a cozy office.  Most of the windows have amazing views from the upper floors.  <span>The panoramic window</span> not only makes it possible to admire nature, the sea or the busy central streets of the city, it is able to combine the space of the living room and bedroom. </p>

    <p>  Many designers design two light sources.  The central bright is located on the ceiling, and the muted side is on the walls.  Side light always emphasizes the sophistication of the layout, creates a romantic atmosphere and comfort, which is necessary to create a quiet and relaxing evening.  The larger the living room, the richer it looks.  Add to this the ceilings are not 3 meters, but 5-8 - and you will get an effect that will be admired by all guests and friends. </p><p>  The penthouse in Moscow is more like a country house than a recognized classic, which all Western designers and architects try to adhere to.  Very often, Russians can see a room that is divided into several zones.  In one huge room there can be a small sitting area, a TV area, and a tea party area. </p><p>  When designing a living room, a huge amount of detail is taken into account.  Here, not only the owners of the house rest, but also the guests.  Master bedrooms are usually located on the second floor, there is also a separate toilet, shower and study.  If the house has a third floor, then they design lounges (billiards, cinema, sauna) or allocate rooms for staff. </p><h2>  What style to make a penthouse </h2>

    <p>  A penthouse house should always have some zest.  High-tech is a favorite area for decoration, but not all owners of expensive housing prefer ultra-modern furniture. </p><p>  The ‚Äúwithout borders" style - open and bright, dividing the interior space with the help of furniture - is minimalism.  The main thing here is not to overdo it.  A cluttered room will not only look ridiculous, but will not let you move freely around it. </p><p>  Choose furniture in light shades.  The penthouse should resemble a room that rests on a cloud.  The ceiling should not obscure the sky.  Furniture and surroundings should completely play along with him. </p><h2>  Penthouse Cost </h2>

    <p>  A special place in the residential real estate market is occupied by the purchase and sale of penthouses.  The penthouse, the prices of which are not going off scale, is not easy to find, as they are in great demand.  For comparison: a small one-room apartment on the outskirts of the city with an average repair will cost as much as 2 m <sup>2 of a</sup> penthouse.  In Moscow, for example, the cost of the most democratic penthouse starts at $ 3 million.  The upper limit is unlimited. </p><p>  Most of the premises that are for sale are located in new buildings.  The price necessarily depends on the area: it should not be a suburb with a lack of infrastructure.  Houses are built only in the most prestigious areas of the city. </p><p>  The most amazing thing is the fact that the price of penthouses will never be lower.  If you compare it with economy-class housing, you can see price stability in the expensive housing market and a sharp decline in the elite business-class housing market. </p>

    <h2>  What about the neighbors? </h2><p>  After analyzing the cost of premises in Russia and Belarus, we can conclude that a beautiful penthouse in Belarus can be bought several times cheaper than in Russia.  The difference in cost per square meter can be 5-10 times higher.  Why?  It is unclear, because the materials used are the same everywhere.  Most likely, the type of housing "penthouse", the prices of which depend not only on materials, is in demand in large cities, because there consumers have practically no restrictions on buying business-class housing for a lot of money.  Of great importance is the appearance of the window, the significance of the area and many other factors. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Penthouses are being built around the world.  In million-plus cities, there are a huge number of them.  One of the conditions - the room must be on the top floor of a multi-story building.  The exception will be the city of Nice, where building laws prohibit the construction of houses above 4 floors.  Naturally, the lower the building, the lower the price. </p>
