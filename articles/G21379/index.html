    <p>  Consider all the poker combinations that exist: </p><ul><li>  the rarest and at the same time the most successful combination is called a royal flush.  This is a combination of five suited high cards; </li><li>  the lower combination in terms of play is a straight flush.  She plays when the player has five suited cards in a row; </li><li>  square.  Such a combination occurs much more often than the two previous ones.  It represents four cards, necessarily peer-to-peer; </li><li>  full house.  In this case, the player must have two cards of the same rank and three other cards in his hands.  For example, three kings and two sevens; </li><li>  flash.  A flash is any sequence of cards necessarily suited; </li><li>  straight.  This combination is played when the player has five consecutive cards of any suit; </li><li>  troika.  In this case, the player must have three peer cards in his hands; </li><li>  two pairs.  This combination combines two cards of the same rank and two more completely different ones.  The suit is not taken into account; </li><li>  couple.  This combination is very simple.  It consists of only two peer cards; </li><li>  "senior" card.  This is not even a combination, but simply the outcome of the game.  If no player has played any of the above combinations, then the player is determined by the seniority of the cards. </li></ul>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Poker combinations are simple and fast to remember.  But it is important to remember that poker has several varieties.  These are horse, draw poker, stud, Texas Hold'em, Omaha, double discarding, draw poker, lowball from two to seven, and badugi.  All combinations in poker are the same for any kind.  Only strategies and rules differ. </p><p>  One of the most popular variations of club poker is Texas Hold'em.  This is due to the fact that the game optimally correlates the general and hidden information.  Texas Hold'em combinations are standard. </p>

    <p>  As for the <span>history of poker,</span> there is currently a huge amount of debate about the origin of the game and the origin of the name.  For the first time, a game similar to poker was mentioned in the 16th century.  Many experts believe that the name comes from the German word pochen, which means "knock." </p><p>  Poker has been around for over 500 years and was born in Europe.  His rules were constantly changing and improving.  The very first mentions of modern poker were discovered in the memoirs of one famous artist Joe Cowell.  It was the year 1829.  After 5 years, in 1834, in poker began to play a deck of 52 cards.  But, no matter what changes the rules of the game underwent, the winner was still determined and determined by poker combinations. </p><p>  Currently, many experts are furiously debating over what poker should be considered a gamble or commercial game.  For the aspect of excitement, facts such as: victory in the championships are always won by different players, the level of skill never guarantees a one hundred percent victory, but only adds some chances to win.  For the aspect of a commercial game, the following facts can be stated: the presence of professional players who earn poker, a science such as probability theory is appropriate in the game, with which you can calculate at which move a higher combination will fall. </p><p>  In Russia, poker, as a sport, is very variable.  In 2007, he became an official sport in Russia, and already in 2009 he was deprived of this status. </p>
