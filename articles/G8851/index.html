The only exceptions here are Superzoom cameras.  One of the most successful in this regard was the model Canon Powershot SX500 IS.  As evidenced by the numerous reviews of the owners of the device, it was the perfect solution in many aspects.  This is especially true for long trips.  In this regard, it is not surprising that the next camera (SX510 HS) is an improved version of this model.  More about it in more detail and will be discussed later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon sx510 hs" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1003994.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The design of the <span>Canon Powershot SX510 HS,</span> in comparison with its predecessor, has not changed.  The main feature of its appearance, as before, is its very compact size.  The camera is so small that finding it in a handbag is often very problematic.  On the front side near the lens, you can see the backlight auto focus, a large grip handle and a slightly protruding part of the flash.  Almost the entire back side is occupied by a three-inch display with a classic set of controls.  These include a joystick for five positions, as well as keys for shooting video, viewing captured material, menus, exposure adjustment and information.  On the side faces of the device, Japanese engineers placed mini-USB and mini-HDMI connectors under the covers.  Above are the power and shutter buttons, flash and mode selector.  On the bottom panel you can see the battery cover, the slot for the drive and the tripod socket. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon sx510 hs price" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1003996.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  As evidenced by the numerous reviews left on the Canon SX510 HS model, the developers clearly did not guess with the shape of the selector.  The fact is that due to its rather large size, it is very inconvenient for the user to switch modes.  Along with this, in terms of ergonomics, this flaw should be called the only one.  Despite its tiny dimensions, the device is very comfortable in the hands and does not slip out.  All <span>control buttons</span> are on the right, so creating pictures with one hand is not difficult. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The heart of the Canon SX510 HS is a 12.1 megapixel CMOS sensor.  Its size, in comparison with the previous modification, has decreased.  Despite this, the quality of the photographs did not suffer, but, on the contrary, improved.  In this case, do not forget about the presence of the high sensitivity system HS, which allows you to get cool pictures even in poor light without the use of a tripod and an additional flash. </p><p>  Information processing is assigned to the DIGIC-4 processor.  As for optics, the model uses an f / 3.4-5.8 lens, equipped with a 30x optical zoom.  Its <span>focal length</span> ranges from 4.3 to 129 millimeters.  It should be noted that the nuance that the device allows you to increase photographed objects an additional 70 times due to digital zoom.  All this in a complex provides the creation of high-quality photographs, regardless of environmental conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon Powershot" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1003995.jpg" width="600"></div>

The screen cannot boast of having a swivel mechanism.  Along with this, it has a wide viewing angle, so you can crop the pictures quite easily.  According to the feedback from the owners of the model, even beginners will not have problems navigating through the menu, as well as playing and viewing the resulting material. </p><h2>  Control </h2><p>  The Canon SX510 HS boasts a choice between intelligent, semi-automatic and manual control.  Their switch is located on the top panel.  After clicking on the central button, a menu opens in which the most used settings are displayed.  In automatic mode, there are 32 options for various types of scenes.  In fairness, it is necessary to focus on the fact that the model is not able to shoot in the so-called raw format. </p><p>  Zoom is controlled by a standard compact switch located around the shutter button.  Expert reviews indicate that the increase along with the decrease here are quite sharp and fast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon sx510 hs camera" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1003998.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Interesting modes and features </h2><p>  In the Canon SX510 HS model, developers have implemented the Smart Auto function, which greatly facilitates the work of the device for novice photographers.  Its essence lies in the fact that the camera itself is able to choose the optimal settings depending on the surrounding conditions.  32 options are provided for the photo mode, and 21 for the video mode. All the user needs to do is just point where the lens needs to be. </p><p>  Intelligent optical image stabilizer is designed to automatically compensate for the slightest camera shake.  This allows you to prevent blur and get fairly clear videos and pictures.  This even includes cases where the Canon SX510 HS is shot without a tripod and at maximum zoom. </p><p>  An interesting feature of the camera is the availability of GPS and Wi-Fi.  Thanks to this, the user has the opportunity, if necessary, to connect to the Internet or a stationary computer and save a copy of the footage or put it on social networks.  In addition, the camera is similarly connected to a printer for direct printing of images. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon sx510 hs reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1003997.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Canon SX510 HS is capable of creating Full HD movies.  In this case, the recording is accompanied by stereo sound.  For direct shooting start, a special button is provided. </p><p>  Due to the presence of the framing function when shooting close-ups, the photographer can track the movement of objects located at a distant distance.  To zoom, just call a special key.  In this case, persons in motion are tracked by the device automatically. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the Canon SX510 HS, which costs about $ 455, is a great solution for travel enthusiasts.  This compact device has good technical characteristics and is able to create good quality pictures and videos even at long distances. </p>
