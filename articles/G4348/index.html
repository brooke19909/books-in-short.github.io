    <h2>  Holidays in Anapa with the whole family </h2><p>  Every year, according to statistics, from three to five million people come here to rest.  And this is not surprising.  The resort has a fairly developed tourist infrastructure.  There are hotels and pensions for every wealth and taste.  Many of them are on the first line.  Russians come here with families and young children.  After all, it is proved that even a walk along the seashore is extremely useful for kids: they breathe clean sea air, which has many healing elements. <br>  Pensions Anapa offer an excellent holiday for the whole family.  Here, not only clean beaches and delicious fruits, but also a huge range of various entertainments, such as windsurfing, diving, yachting, etc. Young people can take a trip on a yacht, immerse themselves in the resort‚Äôs diverse nightlife, visit night clubs and dance floors.  Children are sure to enjoy the dolphinarium.  The main thing is to choose a pension that fits all parameters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are many reasons why Russians choose this particular resort in order to spend their holidays with the whole family - with young children and the elderly.  The fact is that this part of the Black Sea coast is sandy wide beaches stretching for tens of kilometers, with clear water, a gentle and safe bottom for kids and adults.  The local climate also plays an important role.  In Anapa, there is a maximum number of sunny days compared to all other Russian resorts.  In addition, the local moderately dry climate is very close to the Mediterranean in its characteristics.  That is why entire armies of tourists come here, booking in winter or spring places in local hotels and pensions.  In high season, it is very difficult to find a place to stay at the resort.  Therefore, travel agencies recommend taking care of this in advance.  Starting from the first days of the swimming season, the three-star boarding house ‚ÄúSelena‚Äù begins to fill up, whose address is Pionersky Prospekt, building 249a. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pension Selena room fund" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1904113.jpg" width="600"></div>
