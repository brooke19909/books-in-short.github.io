If in the 90s the cost of one minute of a call was calculated in dollars, today even in a country thousands of kilometers away you can call for a penny. </p><p>  And as the Internet develops, we can even make calls regardless of borders!  About how to make free calls to any destination, we will tell in this article. </p><h2>  A little bit about calls </h2><p>  For starters, you should distinguish between two methods of making calls - the Internet and mobile communications.  You need to understand that when it comes to communicating with people using the <span>Global Network,</span> in this case there are only conditions.  This is, first of all, the lack of a board and the ability to communicate almost endlessly.  Take, for example, the same Skype.  Therefore, this should not arise. </p><p>  As for cellular communications, everything is much more complicated here.  In order to communicate with people for free, without the participation of an Internet connection, even within our country - most often you need to pay.  Therefore, we will try to find ways and learn how to do it for free.  But, most likely, the best advice would be to simply switch to Internet connection and online calls. </p>

    <h2>  Free calls in Russia </h2><p>  Again, talking about how you can communicate for free within Russia, we share cellular and landline communications.  In the first case, there is a chance to purchase some kind of promotional package and, say, get wide opportunities for a small fee.  For example, a large data package for free use on the same network.  If we are talking about fixed-line communications, then there are no options: conversations cannot be free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, if you are looking for how you can call for free, this must be taken into account - today, most often, this is done very cheaply.  But there can be no complete refusal of payment (even if for a package of services in general, in addition to calls). </p>

    <h2>  MTS </h2><p>  For clarity, we demonstrate the capabilities of calls within the network of the most popular mobile operators.  Let's start with MTS.  There are several general tariffs at which the subscriber is provided with Internet traffic packages, SMS, minutes for making calls.  For example, if you are looking for how to call MTS for free, here is the solution for you - connect the Super MTS tariff plan and get the opportunity to use the free minutes package.  There, according to the conditions, the user is provided with 100 free minutes for calls to network subscribers for a daily fee of 3.5 rubles.  It turns out very cheap but, as you see, not for free.  In addition, you will still be required to pay a monthly fee at the Super MTS tariff. </p><p>  Another example of how to call MTS for free.  Connect the SmartMini tariff (costing 200 rubles per month) and get half a gigabyte for using the Internet, as well as 1000 minutes for free calls within the network.  In addition, you are given an unlimited number of minutes to talk with subscribers of the same operator within your region. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  "Megaphone" </h2><p>  An alternative solution is the Megafon operator.  There, the tariffs for calls on the network are more loyal, so we have good news for those who want to know how to make free calls from Megafon.  The operator has a special ‚Äúzero‚Äù tariff, according to which you can call without a monthly fee for using services.  The cost of calls to Megafon numbers is also zero. </p><p>  The only limitation is the region.  If the number you are calling is within your area, then a call charge is not charged.  In the same case, if you want to call to another region, you will have to pay 3 rubles per minute.  At the same time, a call to the numbers of other operators will cost a lot - 12.5 rubles per minute. </p><p>  As you can see, with this operator, conversations within the network are also free only conditionally. </p><p>  An alternative is the ‚ÄúAll Inclusive S‚Äù tariff, according to which the subscriber is provided with 400 free minutes for calls to network numbers regardless of their location for 199 rubles per month. </p>

    <h2>  "Tele 2" </h2><p>  During a cursory inspection of the tariffs proposed by this operator, we can say that he does not offer anything new.  There is a tariff of "Very Black", which costs 190 rubles per month.  According to him, the subscriber is given 250 minutes of free calls on the network, regardless of which region the number of the interlocutor is assigned to.  It seems that there is an answer to the question: ‚ÄúHow to call Tele2 for free,‚Äù but also for this opportunity you need to pay a regular monthly fee. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  An alternative is a fee of 90 rubles per month for the ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù tariff, according to which an unlimited number of minutes is provided for free calls within the subscriber‚Äôs region. </p><p>  All tariffs are given for St. Petersburg, but for other areas they are not much different - except perhaps the size of the monthly fee.  As a result, we can say that this operator cannot please us with free calls. </p><h2>  Beeline </h2><p>  Beeline has the following situation: for free calls within the network there is a tariff of ‚ÄúZero doubts‚Äù.  <span>There is</span> no <span>subscription fee</span> , but a fee for the first minute of conversation in the amount of 1.3 rubles.  Further, the conversation is free, but, again, there is a restriction on the region.  If you are interested in how to make free calls to Beeline numbers in other regions, you are forced to grieve: it will cost 2.5 rubles per minute. </p><h2>  Yota </h2><p>  For a more objective picture of the market, we take into account another interesting operator - Yota.  Here, if we talk about how to make free calls, there is no difference in the regions of the Russian Federation - calls within the network are charged the same - at 0 rubles per minute.  True, there is a rather high monthly fee (490 rubles per month), for which you also get 100 minutes for calls to subscribers of other operators, as well as unlimited Internet.  This is probably the most profitable tariff of all voiced above.  But it is quite expensive. </p><h2>  Skype </h2><p>  As you can see, it‚Äôs very difficult to find how to call Russia for free using exclusively cellular communications.  At least, the most famous operators in our country do not provide such services.  Most companies require an additional fee when it comes to calls between regions, or simply installs monthly fees every month. </p>

    <p>  An alternative is the Internet.  Using it, you can call for free even from mobile devices on which you can install client programs.  The most common option is Skype. </p><p>  The program has millions of active users, it is free and easy to use.  If you want to call the person who also uses Skype, it will not cost you anything.  The company has its own tariffs for calls to mobile operators, and they are quite affordable.  The cost depends on which region you are in and where you plan to call.  You can find out the exact price of a call using the convenient Skype page on the Internet.  On it you choose the direction, after which you will immediately receive an answer in the form of prices for calls. </p><h2>  Instant messengers </h2><p>  An alternative to ‚ÄúSkype‚Äù can be called various instant messengers.  They also work via the Internet and can provide free calls and messages within the network.  The most popular are Viber and WhatsApp, but there are also many of their analogues on the market, some of which use an encrypted connection, which will leave your correspondence a secret. </p>

    <p>  If you are looking for how to make free mobile calls through an online connection, instant messengers can be a great solution.  It is enough to install them from the official application directories (depends on which OS you use).  You do not need to register with them - the program will synchronize your contacts and sort them in a convenient manner. </p><p>  In general, messaging and calling services are a great way to communicate for free. </p><h2>  Services for free calls </h2><p>  Finally, the third way to talk to a person ‚Äúon the other end of the wire‚Äù is through specialized services.  They give an answer to the question: "How to make free calls from a computer?"  Today there are many such services - just go to the site, enter the phone number and wait until the call goes.  All that is required for such communication is a microphone and a computer connected to the network. </p><p>  The advantage of the service is anonymity - due to the data transfer protocols used, no one will establish where you called from.  True, one should take into account the fact that some sites use roaming.  In this regard, the money will be withdrawn from the person you are calling. </p><p>  An alternative is VoIP telephony.  So, by installing the program on your phone, you get the opportunity to contact any subscriber for free (but not in all countries).  This is another option on how to make to call for free. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2>

    <p>  As you can see, the situation with calls is as follows: you can make calls without a charge for minutes of a call and for a connection.  But in cases with mobile network operators, you will have to pay a monthly fee for this.  That is, "free" is purely conditional.  If you are looking for how to make free calls using the Internet, then there are plenty of options: Skype and various instant messengers are at your service.  Using them is very easy, thanks to a simple interface.  Given that there is an Internet connection all over the world, with their help you can communicate even with a person thousands of kilometers away.  Plus, in such applications there are additional functions, such as emoticons and the ability to send files, send photos and videos.  They can also become a solution to the question of how to make free calls from a mobile to a phone or even a computer.  The main thing is that all participants in the conversation have access to the Web. </p>
