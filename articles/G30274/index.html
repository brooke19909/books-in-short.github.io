    <h2>  Exotic relaxation in a cozy place </h2><p>  First of all, it should be noted that this is not a pathos hotel complex consisting of many buildings and individual bungalows.  No, Atlantica Stavrolia Gardens 3 is the perfect hotel for <span>couples</span> or those looking for privacy. </p><p>  The location of the hotel is excellent - it is located in the heart of the resort city of Ayia Napa (by the way, the most popular on the island).  Moreover, this guest house is not so far from the airport - about 45 kilometers.  It is located in the city of Larnaca.  This is a very good location, because such a distance is enough so that flying planes do not interfere with the quiet rest of visitors, but not so much that it is convenient to get to it. </p>
