Embroidery of pictures is also creativity and beauty.  Firstly, even when creating a reproduction, the needlewoman creates her own embroidery technique (perfect wrong side, economical embroidery, parking).  Secondly, when using different programs, schemes are created for your photos.  Thirdly, when using the scheme, the embroiderer can use her colors or create her own plots from several schemes. </p>

    <h2>  Beauty and creativity: beadwork and diamonds </h2><p>  Beadwork also refers to creativity.  In this area, needlewomen create <br>  jewelry of the author's work, embroider clothes, belts, hair accessories.  Especially interesting is the technique of <span>embroidering icons with beads.</span> </p><ul><li>  the image of the saint is completely cut out with a halo; </li><li>  material is selected: beads of different sizes, bugles, beads, stones; </li><li>  a carved pattern is outlined on the fabric and the saint‚Äôs outfit and halo are completely embroidered; </li><li>  then hands and a face with a neck are glued and trimmed neatly with two rows of beads to hide the joints. </li></ul><p>  Such works are not only beautiful, but also new in execution technique. </p><p>  Another new direction in needlework is <span>diamond embroidery.</span>  Its essence consists in gluing a <span>diamond mosaic</span> according to the pattern.  There is no doubt in the beauty of such paintings.  But you can talk about creating a creative new masterpiece when you order a scheme from a manufacturer using your own photo, which you will not find on the Internet or in stores. </p><h2>  Brief conclusions </h2><p>  So how </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="world of art of creativity and beauty" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/389755.jpg?1399303728980" width="473"></div>  does beauty and creativity in embroidery correlate?  Needlework accurately relates to beauty, as it causes aesthetic pleasure when contemplating beautiful works of authorship.  Here, it is fascinating and pleasantly shocking that a man with his own hands, and not with the help of electronics and machines, was able to create paintings, toys, jewelry, etc. As a result, there is a desire to create something similar or new ideas arise.

    <p>  Thus, the contemplation of beautiful needlework goes hand in hand with creativity.  Authors' works undoubtedly relate to creative activity, since its result is unique and original.  But what about works created according to patterns reproduced by thousands of needlewomen?  <span>Is it a reproduction</span> or creativity ?! </p><p>  Still, we believe that embroidery refers to creativity, since each picture is created by the embroiderer manually.  In her arsenal, this is the first work.  In addition, paintings according to the same pattern for different needlewomen will look different.  What do you think? </p>
