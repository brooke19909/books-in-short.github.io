  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cancellation of transport tax</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, the "tax" our population pays a lot.  Among others, there is a <span>transport tax, the</span> abolition of which is planned in the highest circles of government.  It was decided to compensate for the losses by raising fuel prices.  Such attempts were already in 2010, but did not give a positive result: both the tax remained in place and the excise taxes on gasoline increased.  Although the basic payment rate was halved by law, no changes were made.  Since the amount of the <span>transport tax is</span> set by the subjects of the federation, they have the right to increase it.  This led to the fact that in some regions the price not only remained the same, but increased by two to three times, and the abolition of the transport tax did not produce any results. </p><p>  And now it‚Äôs worth turning to the history and see the statistics.  For the first time, this type of payment was discussed in Russia in 1994.  Then the transport tax was paid only by the organization.  The funds received by the state went to the development of passenger transport of any kind.  This continued until November 1997.  Then the law was adjusted, and car owners began to pay.  In determining payouts, horsepower was taken into account.  This interpretation is similar to the modern one. </p><p>  In 1999, a new mandatory tax on certain types of transport appeared.  It turned out that for one <span>car with an engine capacity of</span> 2500 cc.  the owner had to pay twice: as the owner of the car and as having a separate <span>mode of transport.</span>  Naturally, the population expressed dissatisfaction, and the result was the abolition of the transport tax, which obliged to pay for the presence of a car with the above engine size. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The current transport tax has been in force since 2003.  Its difference is that it has become regional instead of federal.  Its amount is calculated based on the engine power of the car. </p><p>  And now back to the question of what prevented the complete abolition of this type of duty, and is there any hope that the abolition of the transport tax of 2012 is not just talk.  Although, most likely, everything will remain the same - after all, in 2011, the authorities decide to resume the activity of the institution of road funds in the country.  The budget of these organizations consists of gas prices and <span>taxes on transport.</span>  The funds go to the construction of new roads and the reconstruction of old ones.  It is also planned to build <span>toll roads</span> in Russia.  But in the West, roads contain attracting private investment.  Russia uses its car owners in the old fashioned way. </p><p>  It is not yet clear how, what, and where it works, and due to the fact that they again started talking about the fact that the abolition of the transport tax is not fiction, it is not at all clear what will happen to gas prices.  So far nothing has happened.  But the Moscow Mayor‚Äôs Office, led by <span>S. Sobyanin, has</span> come up with an initiative to increase the tax rate for transport from 2013.  The Liberal Democratic Party put forward a counter initiative - to return to the discussion of the issue of canceling the transport tax.  The president supported this idea, but pointed out that this step should be taken gradually, without rushing, without shocks for the people and sudden movements. </p><p>  In addition, many public and political figures and movements have repeatedly called on the authorities in the country to meet the common people in resolving this issue.  The abolition of the transport tax will benefit the state only, since the current scheme is unreasonable and only causes discontent.  Here you can recall the large-scale campaign conducted by the Federation of Russian Car Owners (FAR) to collect signatures in favor of the abolition of the current tax.  A compiled appeal to the President of the Russian Federation was signed by 100 thousand people.  Experts note that the failures of previous attempts to abolish the transport tax in the Russian Federation are due to biased information about increasing prices for gasoline and other fuels. </p>
