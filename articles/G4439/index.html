Yes, and a metal case?  A thick layer of rubber and plastic, tightly bonded as if in one piece, is real protection, according to the Taiwanese company Ginzzu, founded in 2009.  She has several similar phones, but, by the way, one of them is the Ginzzu R6 Dual mobile phone.  I wonder what this ‚Äúbattleship" is capable of?

In addition to the phone, there is a battery, a charger, a USB cable, an additional antenna and documentation in Russian.  They even put a metal token and forgot about the memory card only. </p>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  This phone is just a monster.  Its case is similar to a bank vault with a small window under the display.  It can be seen that the inside of the device is reliably protected.  It is created from rubber and plastic, fully embossed with yellow accents.  But this was certainly done not for beauty, but for practical purposes, because thanks to these notches and indentations, the phone, when grasped, is as if fused with a hand. </p><p>  A voice speaker is located above the display, and below it is a keyboard, at the top of which is a four-way button, ready to provide quick launch of any four applications.  On the left side is the input for micro-USB, reliably covered by a plug.  At the top is a flashlight and an antenna connector, which is screwed in as needed.  In the meantime, the connector is also securely hidden. </p>

The back cover is fixed with screws, and under it is the battery.  We take it out and see two slots for 2 SIM cards and a memory card.  Under the panel there is a yellow insert to which you can tie the lace.

    <h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  But the mobile phone <span>Ginzzu R6 Dual is</span> convenient not only because it is unlikely to fall out of hand.  The assembly of the device itself is excellent.  All parts are fitted very tightly, as if it were a single piece of rubber and plastic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The flashlight, camera and walkie-talkie power buttons react instantly and are marked with the corresponding images.  Moreover, two of them (flashlight and walkie-talkie) are not even blocked.  In short, access to them is second. </p><h2>  Screen and camera </h2><p>  You can‚Äôt say anything special about the TFT-display with a resolution of 240 √ó 320: it is the most ordinary, moderately clear, bright, with small viewing angles, but the image is clearly visible in the sun. </p>

No flash, no focus, no hint at all about the urgent need for this function in this device.  In the settings, you can select the shutter sound, change the exposure, contrast, lighting frequency and delay time.  The quality of photos and videos leaves much to be desired, but this was not the main goal of the developers.  Although some expect more from the camera, as indicated by the people left using the Ginzzu phone, reviews.

    <h2>  Sound characteristics </h2><p>  Caution!  The phone is noisy if you give maximum volume to the volume indicator.  It doesn‚Äôt matter where the owner of the device is located - in the subway, in a cafe or on a busy street, the Ginzzu R6 Dual is sure to "shout". </p><p>  The voice speaker is also quite powerful, the conversation is clearly audible almost anywhere.  In extreme cases, you can use a headset - in-ear headphones.  They are probably rather weak for listening to music, but just right for communication.  Although some reviews characterizing the Ginzzu mobile phone claim that the headset produces high-quality sound.  By the way, there are also no complaints about feedback, because there are 2 microphones that provide the interlocutor with excellent audibility. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  Ginzzu phone for its characteristics has a capacious battery - 1700 mAh, which is not easy to discharge.  With the active use of all the features of the device, it will last without recharging for more than two weeks.  True, the operation in the walkie-talkie mode eats up the charge faster.  But even in this situation, the week of battery life is still provided for him. </p><h2>  Calls, Messages and Organizer </h2><p>  Regarding the implementation of the work of two SIM cards in the device, nothing new was noticed.  It is possible to disable one of the slots, as well as change some parameters. </p><p>  As for the call service, this includes the call log and the phone book.  The directory allows you to place contacts either on SIM cards or on the device.  When saving a new contact, you can enter only the name of the subscriber, his number and set the ringtone. </p><p>  The Ginzzu Dual R6 mobile phone is capable of sending SMS and MMS messages, but you will have to do without email.  The phone memory can store 300 text and 100 multimedia messages, respectively. </p><p>  The organizer is a set of functions consisting of a calculator, calendar and alarm clock.  True, there is also the SOS Settings item, where you can save numbers to which a pre-dialed message will be sent in case of emergency.  To do this, it is enough to type a certain combination with the keys. </p><h2>  Communication opportunities </h2><p>  The device works in GSM networks of various frequencies, supports GPRS connection, Bluetooth 2.0 and Walkie-Talkie walkie-talkie, operating at a frequency of 400-470 MHz. </p>

In addition, it has the function of noise reduction and separation into different groups of users in the same range.

    <h2>  Multimedia part </h2><p>  This includes an audio and video player whose settings are minimal.  There is an FM tuner and photo album for viewing captured photos.  The radio only works with a connected headset, and the recorder writes files to a memory card. </p><p>  From entertainment there are two games - "Fifteen" and "Magic Sushi", having the most minimal settings.  There is also the ‚ÄúBookshelf‚Äù application - for reading enthusiasts.  True, it only recognizes the txt format, but its necessity here is already in question, given the miniature display. </p><h2>  Protective qualities </h2><p>  And now about the main feature of the Ginzzu R6 Dual mobile phone - its security.  According to the characteristics of the device, it has an IP67 protection standard, and this, for a second, is almost the maximum degree.  In this situation, it must withstand the ingress of a direct stream of water, for some time be at a depth of 1 m (figure 6) under water and completely protected from contact with dust (figure 7).  A little more and the device could be submerged under water for a longer time. </p>

Therefore, when dropped, the phone will not fly apart.  And the thickness of the walls of the case can be estimated by removing the battery.

    <p>  What do the reviews of the owners say about the protection that the Ginzzu phone has?  It turns out that everything is honest here.  Many users, intentionally or not, but found themselves in a situation where the protective qualities of the device were checked, and he adequately withstood these checks. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The cost of the phone is about 6000 rubles.  In principle, for this price you can purchase a more functional smartphone on OS Android with a large screen and multi-pixel camera.  But he has his own, rather large, target audience, for which the quality of communication, reliability, security and a long battery life are more important.  The creation of such devices is the company Ginzzu.  And it is not surprising that her products are very popular, because no manufacturer has produced analogues yet. </p>
