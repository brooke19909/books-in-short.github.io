The assortment of the Dubai bazaar surpasses all the <span>markets of the east.</span>  All prices on the market are inflated based on the bidding process, with which you can significantly reduce the price. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.buckettripper.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="it's a gold market" class="if uuid-2286101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2286101.jpg"></div><h2>  Dubai Desert Reserve </h2><p>  This is a conservation area that occupies a small part of the UAE.

In addition, there are special areas for sleigh rides and snowball games on the territory of the Mall of the Emirates, where Ski Dubai is located. </p><div class="photo" data-original="supremetourism.ae" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski complex in the UAE" class="if uuid-2286104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2286104.jpg"></div><p>  The sights of this city, which can rightfully be ranked as one of the wonders of the world, do not end there, there are a lot of them, and to see everything with your own eyes, you will need more than one day.  But tourists in the UAE are attracted not only by high-rise buildings, luxurious shopping and magnificent views in Dubai, but also by fascinating excursions.  Let's move away from the question of what to see first in Dubai, and take a closer look at some of them. </p><h2>  Six emirates in one day </h2><p>  The tour starts from the most important city in the UAE - Dubai.  A mini-group of several people is typed and sent by car through the northern part of the Emirates.  The next stop is the cultural capital of the Arab world - Sharjah with a thorough study of all local attractions.  After Sharjah, the group travels through the desert to the mountains of Fujairah.  Interesting views and the predominance of local color will delight the eyes of travelers.  Here you can go to the local market to admire the Persian rugs and taste the abundance of various fruits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sbm.edu.pk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mosque in Sharjah" class="if uuid-2286114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2286114.jpg"></div><p>  Further according to the plan - an overnight stop in one of the hotels on the Indian Ocean.  The next day, the organizers gather people and go along the red sands of Ras Al Khaimah to <span>Umm Al Quwain,</span> and return to Dubai in the evening.  To the question of how much the excursions in Dubai cost, we will try to answer at the end of each paragraph. </p><p>  The cost of the tour for adults is $ 80 (about 5,000 rubles) and $ 64 (3,500 rubles) for children 3-11 years old. </p><h2>  Desert Safari with dinner </h2><p>  Ready to taste all the Arabian exotic in one evening?  Then grab the Desert Safari!  You will enjoy a fascinating ride through impassable desert places and the conquest of dunes.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter that you will not drive the vehicle, your sensations will remain for life.

On the way back you can enjoy a picturesque view of the evening Dubai. </p><p>  The cost of the excursion ranges from 3500 to 4000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.headout.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai Sand Diving" class="if uuid-2286110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2286110.jpg"></div><h2>  Conquering a skyscraper </h2><p>  This is one of the most interesting places in Dubai.  We have already mentioned the opportunity to climb the highest tower in the world and take a breathtaking picture of the city straight from the observation deck.  By and large, this option can be attributed to individual tours in Dubai, because to enter the building you only need to purchase a ticket.  Exploring Burj Khalifa may take a full day.  The cost of admission includes the use of telescopes to track the history of the city, free internet.  The visitor assumes the rental of the audio guide and other personal expenses.  Also inside the skyscraper is a restaurant with wonderful views from the window. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tiqets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What to see in Dubai first" class="if uuid-2286137" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2286137.jpg"></div><h2>  Dubai sightseeing tour </h2><p>  Almost anywhere in the world, it is possible to arrange a city tour, both individually and in small groups.  A sightseeing tour of Dubai is a walk through one of the fashionable areas of Dubai Marina, a man-made island with a stop at the famous Atlantis Hotel for a photostop.  Then the group sets off to inspect the Dubai Mall's main shopping venue and dancing fountains.  A similar walk around the city for many tour operators is called the "modern Dubai tour." </p><p>  An adult ticket will cost $ 35, a child will cost $ 25, which in terms of 2000 and 1500 rubles. </p><h2>  Arab sheikh </h2><p>  Feel all the charm of luxurious life during an dinner on an Arab boat off the coast of the most pathos of Dubai Marina!  The duration of the tour is about 2 hours.  You will enjoy the beauty of an evening walk on a wooden Arab ship, taste the unique local goodies and go ashore of one of the richest areas of the planet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sunseaboats.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yachts in Dubai Marina" class="if uuid-2286124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2286124.jpg"></div><p>  Such a luxury would cost about 3,500 rubles per person, but it is definitely worth it! </p><h2>  Sightseeing tour in Abu Dhabi </h2><p>  Abu Dhabi for many becomes the personification of modern approaches to the arrangement of the urban environment.  It is in this city that you can feel the whole atmosphere of past years, in contact with modern trends in architecture.  The tour includes a trip to the city and return to Dubai in a comfortable minibus.  The whole day will be devoted to walks through the streets of Abu Dhabi, completely saturated with history, the study of architectural monuments and free time, and in the evening you can catch a tour of ‚ÄúDubai at Night‚Äù - emotions will remain for life from such a busy day. </p><p>  The cost of such a walk in Abu Dhabi is about 3,500 rubles per person. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holidayguru.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Abu Dhabi in the UAE" class="if uuid-2286118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2286118.jpg"></div><h2>  Night fishing </h2><p>  As the name implies, the tour involves night hunting for crabs.  People who book a trip are given an exclusive opportunity to feel the role of a hunter and enjoy the beauty of the night bay under the light of lanterns.  Next you will find dinner with booty, a jacuzzi and a pool with alcoholic drinks.  Great opportunity to have a great evening! </p><p>  Estimated price - in the range from 4000 to 5000 rubles. </p><h2>  Private Dubai Night Tour </h2><p>  This city has at least two faces - daytime and evening.  The city that you managed to see during the day turns into a completely different night tale.  When the sun sets over the horizon and the heat begins to dissolve in the evening air, your adventures will begin. </p><p>  The duration of the walk is about two hours.  During this time, you will admire the 828-meter Burj Khalif tower at dusk, walk through the ancient Souk Al Bahar shopping market and visit the artificial island. </p><p>  The final note of the night city tour will be a visit to the Atlantis Hotel, where on the 44th floor there are many popular bars and from where a stunning view of the city shrouded in millions of brightly shimmering lights. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="25.2048493" data-lng="55.270782800000006" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/3/4/1034.png"></div><h2>  Moroccan baths </h2><p>  This option of excursion is quite expensive, as it takes place in an individual form and implies a whole package of spa services.  This is a deep cleaning and rejuvenation of the skin of the whole body with dry and wet steam using special compounds prepared according to ancient Moroccan recipes. </p><p>  The program includes visits to the bathhouse, pool, hair mask, pedicures and manicures.  In addition, there is the opportunity to visit the gymnasium and the magnificent Beauty Palace in the Emirates.  At the end of all procedures, you will feel like a real Arab sheikh. </p><p>  The cost of the service is about $ 380 (21,000 rubles). </p><p>  According to the numerous reviews of tourists about excursions in Dubai, the most positive reviews are gained by Dubai Night and Desert Safari.  But in any case, it is a matter of taste.  We hope you can find a suitable option. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The United Arab Emirates is a complete fairy tale of the East.
