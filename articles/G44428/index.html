It owes its popularity to hippies, for which Goa has become a kind of ‚ÄúMecca‚Äù.  Today, this exotic island is offered by many tour operators.  This gave rise not only to the development of infrastructure in Goa, but also to the ‚Äúboom‚Äù of hotels that they began to build along its beautiful beaches.  One of them is Palm Resort 2 *, located in the northern part of the resort. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The hotel is located in Calangute - a town that has become a tourist center of the northern coast of Goa.  Palm Resort 2 * is built on the second line from the sea.  It is primarily suitable for those tourists who prefer to relax quietly away from the noisy parties that are held on the beach.  However, the distance from the coastline of a thousand meters is not an obstacle for young people, so the affordable prices of this hotel are great for travelers of any age. </p><p>  Palm Resort 2 * is attractive to tourists not only for its low cost of living, but also for its convenient location.  The road to the airport takes only forty minutes.  Nearby are many shops, a market and some attractions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel has a small ‚Äústar rating‚Äù, the list of services that are offered in it is very extensive.  It has a conference room, parking, an office for medical assistance, a currency exchange, a laundry room and a cozy small garden. </p>

    <p>  Reception works without interruption.  Here you can rent a car or bicycle, call a taxi.  At the registration desk they also issue food stamps. </p><h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  Palm Resort 2 * (North Goa) is considered small in the number of rooms.  There are only forty-one in it.  They are located in one four-story building.  The rooms of the standard, family and duplex categories have comfortable furniture, TV, paid safe and minibar, split-system or ceiling fan, tea / coffee maker.  For those who wish, the hotel will rent a refrigerator for one hundred and fifty rupees. Daily residents receive fresh newspapers.  The rooms have balconies or terraces.  Bathrooms in this hotel are combined.  Residents are offered a hair dryer.  The staff clean the rooms only upon delivery of keys at the reception. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  When booking rooms, it is better to choose the system immediately.  Typically, Indian hotels of this category do not offer a very diverse cuisine, so the situation should be assessed realistically.  In the Palm Resort 2 * (Goa), you can choose two types of food: either half-board service or only a continental breakfast. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Martins Seafood Corner, a restaurant specializing in local cuisine and seafood specialties, is also located on site.  It works on the menu.  A small bar serving drinks and light snacks is available by the pool. </p><p>  Those who wish can walk to the nearby market.  It sells not only fruits and vegetables, but also fresh fish, which is prepared here by the seller for just a few rupees. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Palm Resort (Goa, 2 *) is located far enough from the sea - at a distance of one kilometer.  The beach is municipal.  Anyone who does not want to take a walk to the swimming area can rent a motorbike cheaply and ride it right at the hotel reception desk.  The property arranges a daily shuttle service for a fee. </p><p>  Beach "Calangute" - the closest to the hotel - municipal.  Here, everything you need for swimming and tanning is issued for a fee.  Judging by the reviews, many Russians preferred to go to the more "European" beaches "Arambol" and "Ashvem", which, however, are quite far away. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The <span>Palm Resort</span> 2 * <span>hotel</span> offers its guests a not very large list of entertainment.  On the territory there is a small pool, which provides a section for children.  Judging by the reviews of the Russians, he often saves those who are reluctant to go to the beach.  The pool is always clean, there are many comfortable sunbeds around. </p>

    <p>  Tourists can get a lot of water activities on the beach.  All are paid locally.  Those who want to go parasailing or go skiing and bananas can do this relatively cheaply. </p><p>  On the territory of Palm Resort 2 * there is the ability to connect to the Internet.  Active guests can play badminton or table tennis.  There is also a good sauna and spa.  The hotel offers bicycle, motorbike and car rental services, while those arriving by car can use the free car park. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Palm Resort 2 * is located two and a half kilometers from Panaji Kala Academy Shanta Durga Temple, Gallery Gitanjali and Club Cubana.  Immediately beyond its territory there is a temple from which a bell ringing is heard from time to time.  Judging by the reviews, many Russians did not stay at the hotel during the day, but tried, having shown more activity, to explore as much as possible all the surroundings of the hotel by renting a bike or scooter.  Not far from Calangute is a very picturesque small village of Marbella and the beach of the same name.  Here, there is almost everything a tourist who is tired of the hustle and bustle needs: the lack of people, tiring merchants, voting about the sale of various souvenirs and trinkets.  The coastline here is wide, gentle, there are no cliffs or pitfalls in the sea, so if you rent a boat you can dive without sailing far from the coast. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  A sufficient number of Russians have already managed to visit the Palm Resort 2 * hotel.  Reviews of our compatriots about living in it vary.  Some people call the hotel a good one, others believe that they spent money in vain.  Some even hint at the presence in the rooms of not only mosquitoes, but also lizards. </p>

    <p>  However, in one, the tourists are united - in the friendliness and very friendly attitude of the staff and, especially, the owners.  Many people recommend contacting this married couple in case of problems first of all, as maids do not understand English. </p><p>  Some dissatisfaction caused the lack of hangers in the closet.  There are no complaints about the situation in the rooms and the plumbing.  There are several negative reviews about nutrition, which note a small variety of dishes and not very clean conditions in the dining room. </p><p>  The opinions of Russians about this hotel were divided: half of the tourists think that Palm Resort is fully consistent with the money that was paid for the rest, the rest believe that the next time they will not come here. </p>
