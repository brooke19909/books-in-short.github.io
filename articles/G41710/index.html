  <section class="page js-page"><h1>iOS 11 on 5s: reviews. Is it worth updating?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  iPhone 5s is Apple's smartphone introduced on September 10, 2013.  The start of sales began in 10 days - September 20, 2013.  It runs on the iOS 7 operating system and contains the Apple A7 64-bit processor.  iOS 11 was introduced almost 4 years after the presentation of the iPhone 5s - on June 5, 2017 at the World wide Developers Conference.  On iOS 7, the iPhone 5s felt really good, but on iOS 11, is it still the same? </p><h2>  Reviews on iOS 11 on iPhone 5s </h2><p>  It installs pretty quickly.  Users do not find ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù in the system itself, except for one thing - when switching between third-party applications (messenger) to system notifications, significant friezes appeared on iPhone 5s, although there was no such trouble on iPhone 7.  Perhaps this is due to the processor, or the games are not yet optimized as they should. </p><p data-hc-id="d51e62ceadc07378ecdf1ea9bb88">  And so in general, according to reviews of iOS 11 on 5s, the overall impression is positive.  Switching between system applications is very pleasant and nimble, the animations are very smooth, but it's on iPhone 7, on 5s notice small friezes even in menu swipe. </p><p data-hc-id="d51e62ceadc07378ecdf1ea9bb88">  According to other reviews of iOS 11 on 5s, for some users the battery began to work a little worse than in iOS 10, this is due to a large number of innovations and unusual animations.  Operating time was reduced slightly, but still less. </p><p data-hc-id="d51e62ceadc07378ecdf1ea9bb88">  The reviews on iOS 11 on 5s also indicate that if you turn off wi-fi through this new control panel, it will not turn off completely, but will go into sleep mode.  The phone will not even connect to known networks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p data-hc-id="d51e62ceadc07378ecdf1ea9bb88">  Take a closer look at the Wi-Fi icon on the screenshots.  The user will have to transfer the phone to airplane mode or in the settings each time to turn off Wi-Fi manually. </p><p data-hc-id="f7d326c26ac64259c482fdb89fa8">  This is how the included Wi-Fi looks like. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Wi-Fi on" class="if uuid-2993082" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113975/2993082.jpg"></div><p data-hc-id="f7d326c26ac64259c482fdb89fa8">  It looks like a "sleeping" Wi-Fi, that is, disabled through the control panel, and not through the settings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Wifi sleeps" class="if uuid-2993085" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113975/2993085.jpg"></div><p>  And this is how Wi-Fi turned off completely, that is, through the settings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Wifi off" class="if uuid-2993087" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113975/2993087.jpg"></div><p>  Another review of iOS 11 on 5s reports that after installing it, the Weather widget stopped working for some users.  What is the matter is unclear.  Of course, this is not such a big problem, but you can solve it only by making a rollback. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Do I need iOS 11? </h2><p>  Reviews of iOS 11, reviews on 5s show that it has both global flaws and shortcomings that appear only on the iPhone 5s.  Of the minuses of 5s, poor performance and a slightly reduced operating time can be noted, other errors can appear on any iPhone. </p><p>  Despite these shortcomings, updating iOS 11 to 5s will bring more than 27 new features to your iPhone, such as an updated control center with individual settings, the ability to download the application cache in iCloud, the option to scan documents in notes, updated built-in maps from Apple, a completely redesigned AppStore , a quick screenshot editor.  And this is just a small part of all the new features.  All of them are very useful and work great. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  As we can see, there are a lot of new things in iOS 11, but are these iPhone performance features worthwhile and do I need to install?  Now let's figure it out. </p><p>  This is a table of application launch speeds on different versions of iOS. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  application </td><td>  iOS 10.3.2 </td><td>  iOS 11.0 </td><td>  Change </td></tr><tr><td>  Safari </td><td>  1.2 sec </td><td>  1.5 sec </td><td>  +0.3 s </td></tr><tr><td>  Camera </td><td>  0.9 sec </td><td>  0.9 sec </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Settings </td><td>  0.9 sec </td><td>  1.3 sec </td><td>  +0.4 s </td></tr><tr><td>  post office </td><td>  1.4 sec </td><td>  1.8 sec </td><td>  +0.4 s </td></tr><tr><td>  Messages </td><td>  0.8 sec </td><td>  1.1 sec </td><td>  +0.3 s </td></tr><tr><td>  The calendar </td><td>  0.8 sec </td><td>  1.2 sec </td><td>  +0.4 s </td></tr><tr><td>  Cards </td><td>  2.2 sec </td><td>  3.2 sec </td><td>  +1.0 s </td></tr><tr><td>  Notes </td><td>  1.5 sec </td><td>  2.0 s </td><td>  +0.5 s </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  The results are not encouraging.  These delays are minimal, but it takes 38.6 seconds to fully boot the device after shutting down with iOS 11, instead of 26.5 on iOS 10. </p><p>  And how often do we completely turn off the device and why?  Moreover, the iPhone is so arranged that it does not require a reboot in case of system errors, but this item will still be a minus of installing iOS 11. Total, we have 1: 0 in favor of iOS 10 and previous versions. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Yes, here Apple was able to surpass themselves.  The control center, the new calculator, other icons in the dock without names, the new top panel and many other minor updates in the design have been changed.  And the system itself began to look more modern.  Yes, Apple knows a lot about design.  Total 1: 1. </p><h2>  New opportunities </h2><p>  Apple introduced a lot of additional features in this version, even editing a screenshot as soon as you made it is a very convenient and useful feature.  For example, I took a screenshot of the site with the text, immediately highlighted the desired fragment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Screenshot Processing" class="if uuid-2993187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113975/2993187.jpg"></div><p>  This is very convenient, because you don‚Äôt have to go into the film and edit everything in it. </p><p>  The application store received a fresh design similar to Apple Music.  The tabs ‚ÄúToday‚Äù appeared (displays the game / application of the day, reviews, editorial choices, etc.), ‚ÄúGames‚Äù (new releases, tops by categories, the most interesting games, etc.), ‚ÄúPrograms‚Äù (new releases , thematic collections, tops by categories, etc.). </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="New AppStore" class="if uuid-2993198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113975/2993198.jpg"></div><p>  And these are just some of the new features.  Do not forget about Apple's huge contribution to AR technology, presented in the form of ARkit. </p><h2>  Update or wait? </h2><p>  Total, 2: 1 in favor of iOS 11. Should I install iOS 11 on 5s?  Sacrificing a small fraction of the performance, we get a huge set of new features that simplify the use of the iPhone.  Apple just had to remove minor flaws in speed, and this iOS would be perfect. </p>
