But there are people who are not afraid of this.  In the spring, Sharjah is more comfortable, but you already need to take sunscreen with you and be sure to wear a hat, otherwise there is a danger of severe burns.  In addition, at this time of the year hurricanes and sandstorms are frequent, which reach such a force that traffic may stop for a day or two.  The tourist season begins in September because the temperature drops.  And the weather in Sharjah in December and January can even be somewhat cooler.  It happens that in the winter it rains a few times a month.  It’s comfortable to swim in the bay, the water temperature is 24-25 degrees Celsius.  But in the evenings the wind can blow, so you need to take a sweater or a light jacket with you.  There are big waves on the beach in winter, and lifeguards do not allow anyone to swim.  So you have to be prepared for this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Al Maha Regency Suites 3 * food" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2133545.jpg"></div>

True, about thirty minutes can be reached on foot, but this is if you arrive not in the hottest time.  Hotel mini buses to the beach often travel, but only in the morning.  There is no timetable, just the driver needs to explain when to arrive for you and take you back.  And there are two routes to different beaches at once.  Two of them are equipped, have paid umbrellas and sunbeds.  And one - Al Khan - ordinary, without a shadow.

All three beaches are not too far from each other. </p><p>  The Persian Gulf itself is very beautiful, the views are luxurious, no matter which coast you choose to relax.  But you can’t swim far, the bathing area is limited by ropes.  If you want to buy food at the fish and vegetable markets, you will have to return to the hotel from the beach on foot.  Another beautiful free Al Cornish beach has been chosen by surfers.  It does not suit family people with children, there are strong currents.  But if you like to ride on a board, this is the place for you. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  If you arrive at the Al Maha Regency Suites Hotel in December, the weather in Sharjah is an excellent way to travel.

And jeeping or riding a quad bike in <span>the Rub El Khali desert is</span> accompanied by the obligatory contemplation of a stunning sunset in the sand. </p><h2>  Al Maha Regency Suites 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  This hotel is positioned by tourism companies as a budget, but its service is better than the usual "three stars" services, even on average in the Emirates.  Her location is very good.  Many other hotels of this class are located almost in the outback, you can’t get anywhere on foot, you constantly have to take a taxi.  Everything is within walking distance.  Women should dress more or less strictly if they do not want to be looked askance at them.  Hotel Al Maha Regency Suites 3 * (Sharjah) is suitable for young people and independent travelers. </p><p>  The atmosphere in the hotel is very comfortable.  Many appreciated the free “Wi-Fi” - not all “fives” and “fours” have such services.  Internet speed is very good.  The presence of a kitchenette even in the cheapest rooms allows many tourists to enjoy good food for minimal money.  The staff is friendly, responds to any request instantly. </p><p>  The beds are clean, the rooms are comfortable, although some tourists complained that the furniture is not new.  The kitchen is in good condition, all appliances work without problems.  Many recommend this hotel for an economical and active vacation.  The main thing is not to expect special luxury from a budget hotel and have high expectations, and then the vacation will be great. </p>
