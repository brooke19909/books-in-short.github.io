    <h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  Of course, a young child will not be able to do something very realistic with his own hands.  Therefore, you need to start small.  Any child loves to play with a <span>paper airplane,</span> but not everyone knows that this is a real craft on a military theme.  With your own hands, your baby can turn her into a combat aircraft carrier.  Give him a piece of paper and gouache.  Let him color the paper in the color of camouflage (familiarize your child with military equipment in advance).  Also here you can depict stars or some other symbolism.  Let the leaf dry.  Then collect the airplane out of it and hand it to the baby.  His first military artwork is ready! </p><h2>  Dish washing sponge tank </h2><p>  The most commonly used material for crafts is paper, fabric, cardboard or plasticine.  But you can show imagination and make a tank, for example, from the most common foam sponge.  She must have a hard layer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We start by rounding the sponge.  Draw a felt-tip pen on the sponge lying on its side and semicircular corners and cut them off.  After that, cut the foam over the entire surface.  The sponge should become semicircular (hard layer on top).  Then cut a small piece of foam on top to make a ledge.  The hard part of the sponge should protrude over the soft.  Now draw two lines with a black marker along the bottom of the tank, simulating the tracks.  Notch a hard ledge along these lines.  Crafting on a military theme comes out realistic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="children's crafts on a military theme" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1392235.jpg" width="440"></div>  After incision, the middle part easily bends, it needs to be glued to the sponge.  Mark the side of the marker with round tracked tracks.

    <h2>  How to make a tower for a tank? </h2><p>  When the tank from the foam sponge is ready, you just have to make a tower for it.  Take a small jar or bottle (for example, from a cream), preferably a green tint.  You can take a jar of any color, pre-paint it with green acrylic paint, stick it on with self-adhesive or coat with plasticine.  Then take green paper, roll a tube out of it and stick it to the jar using plasticine.  Glue the jar to the tank from the sponge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="make a craft on a military theme" class="if" height="205" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1392231.jpg" width="236"></div>  From plasticine with paper, build a hatch for your military equipment.  A wonderful tank came out to the tower, the barrel and the hatch.  This craft is great for conducting a master class in kindergarten, children of older groups will do the job with pleasure.

Try to make a tank using quilling technique with a younger student.  From green corrugated cardboard, it is necessary to cut several stripes.  Make two strips 2 cm wide, ten strips 1 cm wide. Each part must be twisted into a thin wheel and fixed with glue.  You will get several wheels of different diameters.  Glue three larger diameter wheels together, attach small parts on the sides.  Glue the fastened elements along the edge of a strip of plain colored green paper.  These are tank tracks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY do-it-yourself craft" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1392243.jpg" width="600"></div>  Another big wheel is the hatch.  To it you need to stick a muzzle of curled paper.  Then arrange the tank’s tracks to the required width and glue a sheet of cardboard on top.  Connect the barrel and the hatch, attach to the tank.  Craft on a military theme is almost ready, it remains to decorate it.  You can stick a red star to the tank tower.  You can also make a flag from toothpicks and red paper.

    <h2>  Greeting card on a military theme. </h2><p>  Crafts on a military theme, the photos of which you see in the article, can be different.  Children can make a beautiful card in the shape of a uniform from colored paper.  From white paper you need to cut a rectangle, make cuts from the upper corners and collapse everything in the shape of a collar.  From black paper we cut out a suitable tie.  Glue the shirt and tie.  Then proceed to making the uniform.  Fold the rectangle of green paper and fold the edges. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts on a military theme photo" class="if" height="463" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1392241.jpg" width="600"></div>  Cut epaulets from yellow paper, glue or draw a star on them.  Also glue buttons on the jacket.  It remains to glue the shirt and uniform to each other and write inside the congratulation on the holiday.

    <h2>  What else can you make a craft on a military theme? </h2><ul><li>  A star from a spoiled music disc looks great.  First you need to cut a big star out of red cardboard.  Then we glue the disk on top and decorate it as desired </li><li>  From nuts, bolts and screws you can make an original postcard.  For example, glue the inscription from the bolts onto cardboard, paint with acrylic paint.  This craft looks beautiful and very original. </li><li>  From cardboard and foil, you can make an order that a child will reward his dad or grandfather </li><li>  Many people at home are full of containers for kinder surprises.  Take one of them.  Roll the ball from plasticine and glue it to the egg.  This is a tank and a tower.  Roll plasticine into a tube or take a stick from Chupa Chupsa.  It blew the tank.  Now blind ten small balls and flatten them a little - these are the wheels of our tank.  Glue five wheels on each side of the body.  Now roll up the caterpillar sausages and glue along the contour of the wheel.  This craft is very easy to create, but it will delight the baby for real.  DIY on a military theme is a great pastime! </li></ul>
