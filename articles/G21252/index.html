Begishevo Airport and Kazan Airport</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Naberezhnye Chelny is a large city in the Republic of Tatarstan of Russia.  Located in the northeast.  Since the population of this city is over half a million, and also around it there are several other large cities, including Nizhnekamsk, it was decided in this part to build an airport called Begishevo.  It is about him that will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Airport "Begishevo".  History </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vpk.name" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Begishevo Airport" class="if uuid-2417501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2417501.jpg"></div><p>  <span>Begishevo Airport</span> in Naberezhnye Chelny was built in the second half of the twentieth century, to be more precise - in 1970.  It was built by order of the Nizhnekamsk Petrochemical Plant. </p><p>  The very first flight made from here occurred on December 25, 1971, by the crew of the AN-24.  For more than twenty years, he performed only domestic flights, and in 1998 received international status. </p><p>  In 2011, the first reconstruction of the airport in Naberezhnye Chelny took place, work began on it in order to change its category to C. In June 2016, the apron was repaired, asphalt was laid in front of the airport entrance, taxiways were repaired.  Light-signaling equipment was also installed, roadsides and power supply systems were strengthened. </p><p>  Tourists say that they really like this small and cozy airport in Naberezhnye Chelny.  There are no frills in it, but there is everything that is necessary.  Passengers are screened fairly quickly here, as there is no such heavy workload.  This is what visitors really like. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.564546" data-lng="52.101324999999974" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/5/8/8/2588.png"></div><h2>  Airport Description </h2><p>  This airport is equipped with one two-story terminal, this is quite enough for this locality, since there are few visitors compared to large airports. </p><p>  Passenger service takes place only on the ground floor.  The domestic flights area is located to the right of the entrance, and the international - to the left of the central part. </p><p>  Air ticket offices are also located on the ground floor of the airport terminal and conduct their work seven days a week and around the clock.  Reception of international flights are located in the customs zone, that is, opposite the main entrance to the airport. </p><p>  Domestic are located to the right of the ticket office.  Do not forget that check-in ends forty minutes before the flight.  Near the airport building there are two paid guarded parking lots.  Also nearby is free and unguarded parking. </p><h2>  How to get to the airport? </h2><p>  It all depends on where you live.  For example, Naberezhnye Chelny.  Bus communication from here was done, then canceled.  According to the most recent data, the fare is about a hundred rubles.  Due to the fact that it is unstable, it is better to use a taxi or private car. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Airport in Kazan.  History </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan Airport" class="if uuid-2417489" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2417489.jpg"></div><p>  Not everyone knows that Kazan Airport is quite close to Naberezhnye Chelny.  This terminal is much more popular than Begishevo, as it serves larger cities. </p><p>  It was opened in 1979.  For this year, the airport accepted almost all Soviet aircraft models of those years.  Later he was equipped with additional equipment, and he was able to take the largest airliner, the Il-86. </p><p>  A federal airport is located 26 km southeast of the city near the village of Stolbishche.  Serves domestic as well as international flights.  Including from here there are directions to Spain, Thailand, the UAE, Turkey and not only.  In 2017, it was recognized for the fourth time as the best regional airport in Russia. </p><h2>  How to get to the airport from Naberezhnye Chelny? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nesiditsa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Naberezhnye Chelny" class="if uuid-2417511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73201/2417511.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, in the first place you can do this on your own car.  The airport is about 240 km away. </p><p>  It is also possible to take a bus from Naberezhnye Chelny to Kazan Airport.  It runs No. 8 and No. 48. Travel time will be about five hours. </p><p>  Another train runs from Naberezhnye Chelny to the airport.  But she is on the road for about seven hours and does not reach the airport.  You must also take the bus number 197. </p>
