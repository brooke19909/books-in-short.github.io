  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Types, characteristics and application of internal cameras</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, more and more you can see cameras of internal video surveillance.  Together with outdoor video surveillance cameras, they make up a complete security complex that allows you to remotely monitor what is happening.  The equipment can be used both privately and publicly - to ensure the protection of public institutions and businesses. </p><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dome Dome Camera" class="if uuid-3185975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3185975.jpg"></div><p>  The functioning of the video surveillance system is based on reading the image in front of the matrix and its subsequent transmission to the DVR via cable or wireless connection.  The information received from the camera is processed by the DVR, followed by output to a monitor and recording to removable media or internal memory. </p><p>  When choosing a video surveillance system, they rely on several components, such as a DVR, camera, cables and monitor.  Component specifications vary.  The camera is selected based on the specific installation location - on the street or indoors.  Depending on the latter, two types of cameras are distinguished: internal and external. </p><h2>  Application area </h2><p>  The main tasks of the internal cameras, in addition to monitoring, monitoring, protection and warning, are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Surveillance online.  Cameras of this type are often found in state and public institutions, banking organizations, shops and other facilities that require constant visual monitoring of visitors. </li><li>  Continuous shooting with the ability to view recorded files, store and archive them. </li><li>  Monitoring and control of processes occurring in rooms with limited access. </li><li>  Concealed video recording with the recording of specific facts, for example, violations of the work process, unwanted behavior or default. </li></ul><h2>  Classification </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.standard.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="surveillance camera" class="if uuid-3185976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3185976.jpg"></div><p>  Internal video surveillance cameras are divided into several types according to the method of data transfer, the shape of the case and the presence of additional sensors: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Dome cameras.  Protected by a special dome, installed under the ceiling. </li><li>  PTZ cameras.  Models equipped with motion sensors. </li><li>  Hidden cameras.  Compact dimensions allow you to hide them from prying eyes. </li><li>  Wireless cameras.  They do not need cabling, which simplifies installation, but limits the range. </li></ul><h2>  By form factor </h2><p>  Indoor dome cameras are best suited for recording indoor situations.  Models are made in the form of a hemisphere, some are protected by a special "glass". </p><p>  The original chassis models do not include brackets or mounts.  Such cameras are purchased for specific tasks.  High-strength housing protection allows you to place them on the street without much harm.  Despite all the advantages, case cameras are rarely used for internal video surveillance due to their large dimensions. </p><p>  Hidden video recording is carried out by means of miniature video cameras.  Their square or oblong body is invisible and is attached using the supplied brackets.  Installed only indoors.  The compact dimensions of the internal cameras make them popular and allow you to hide the fact of their presence from the eyes of strangers. </p><h2>  By type of data transfer </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ip camera dome internal" class="if uuid-3185977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3185977.jpg"></div><p>  They are classified into two categories - wired and wireless. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The performance of the first type of internal cameras depends on the availability of the necessary wiring.  Most models are powered by twisted pair, although relatively recently used coaxial cable.  Optical fiber is becoming increasingly popular due to the high reliability of data transmission and modernity. </p><p>  Difficulties with pulling the cable are considered a disadvantage of wired internal cameras.  When installing them, wall chipping is often required.  The second drawback is the difficulty of masking the wired wiring.  However, wired transmission has its advantages - availability and signal transmission range. </p><p>  Wireless data transfer protocols use modern IP, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth cameras.  Unlike wired, they do not need cables, but their work requires power.  The signal range is significantly reduced due to the binding of the camera to the repeater and router.  Broadcast termination occurs upon any failure. </p><p>  Unlike wired counterparts, wireless models require ongoing user intervention. </p><h2>  Functional </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="types of internal cameras" class="if uuid-3185978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3185978.jpg"></div><p>  Save on cabling allows the function of recording to a memory card, bypassing the transfer of data to the hard drive located in the receiving unit.  Slots for memory cards are located on the case of internal cameras.  Models with the ability to write files directly to micro SD are the best option for fulfilling specific goals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A motion sensor is an important component of home surveillance cameras.  They resort to it in rooms that for a long time remain empty.  The number of responses depends on the number of movements in the frame.  It is convenient when creating security systems at rarely used objects. </p><p>  The capabilities of some cameras allow you to view broadcasts online through P2P or IP technology.  In this way, the operability of motion sensors can be checked. </p><p>  For cameras with color rendering, HD support is relevant.  In places where quick recognition of a person is required or small details play a role, technology is in demand.  The quality of the transmitted image depends on the resolution of the lens.  Due to the high popularity of the HD format, many camcorder manufacturers are introducing QHD and UHD support into their products.  The quality of the material being shot depends on the availability of these options. </p><h2>  Rating of the best cameras </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.safety.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="internal camera with backlight" class="if uuid-3185979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3185979.jpg"></div><p>  Video cameras for internal monitoring are in demand and are available in a wide range.  Functional and reliable models are not necessarily expensive.  To select a specific video camera, you must be guided by your goals.  The best internal cameras for home and office are several models presented below. </p><h2>  Zodiak 770 Thermo </h2><p>  Zodiak is known to many consumers for the high quality and reliability of its products.  The Thermo 770 PTZ camera supports FHD;  the casing rotates 120 degrees vertically and 355 degrees horizontally.  There is a built-in sensor for humidity and temperature, which increases efficiency.  The sound recording range is 5 meters.  Supported memory cards up to 128 GB, which is equivalent to 10 days of continuous recording.  If necessary, a power cable may be laid. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  Two types of data transfer. </li><li>  Wide functionality. </li><li>  Built-in microphone. </li><li>  Body rotation. </li><li>  The original design. </li><li>  Support for high quality and recording resolution. </li><li>  Additional sensors. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Sound recognition issues. </li><li>  Lack of equipment. </li><li>  There is no support for high-end memory cards. </li></ul><h2>  Hikvision HiWatch DS-T103 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="imgur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="internal camera with backlight" class="if uuid-3185988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3185988.jpg"></div><p>  A budget model of an internal camera with backlight and wide functionality sufficient for video surveillance.  The technique is equipped with a motion sensor and infrared light.  Compact dimensions and low weight allow you to hide cameras from prying eyes.  The visibility of the image is increased to 20 meters due to IR illumination.  The moisture protection level of the case is IP66.  The maximum image resolution is 1296 x 732 pixels. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  High quality and reliability. </li><li>  IR LED </li><li>  Affordable price. </li><li>  Motion Sensor. </li><li>  Compact and light weight. </li><li>  Quality matrix. </li><li>  Tripod mount M12. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Lack of HD. </li><li>  Scanty equipment. </li><li>  The lack of a swivel mechanism. </li></ul><h2>  ORIENT AHD-956-ON10B </h2><div class="photo" data-original="imgur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="swivel inner chamber" class="if uuid-3185991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3185991.jpg"></div><p>  The internal dome IP camera with two operating modes - CVBS 960H and AHD720p.  Standard video surveillance and good image quality are achieved through a resolution of 1 megapixel.  Maximum visibility - 10 meters, filtering noise and interference in automatic mode. </p><p>  The advantage of the model is the high strength of the case and soft-touch coating, which makes it resistant to damage.  Unfortunately, there is no anti-vandal protection. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  High strength housing. </li><li>  Auto noise reduction. </li><li>  Affordable price. </li><li>  Ease of installation. </li><li>  IR LED </li><li>  Two operating modes. </li><li>  Long term of operation. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Lack of HD. </li><li>  The clarity of the image suffers. </li></ul><h2>  The required number of cameras </h2><p>  The number of cameras installed varies depending on the objectives pursued.  The choice of installation location and quantity of equipment is based at least on common sense.  When equipping a private house with cameras, you should not place them in each room: as a rule, it is enough to install them in front of the entrance doors and windows. </p><p>  To monitor the nanny, cameras are placed in rooms where children and hired personnel are located - this will avoid unnecessary expenses. </p><p>  In the case of providing a business with a video surveillance system, the number of cameras is determined by the dimensions of the room and the objectives pursued.  Production control requires a large number of cameras with high quality and clarity of shooting, and one or two cameras in the common areas and at the entrance are enough for the office. </p>
