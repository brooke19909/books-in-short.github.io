Are these guests of the country or emigrants who were not welcome?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The ancient Greek social structure is one of the most complex and complicated topics in history.  Thoroughly no historian knows what society looked like at that time in this country, to which rights and duties were awarded.  But today it is reliably known what status the foreign migrants had in Greece, what they were allowed to do.  Let’s now and we will understand what “metecs” are, or rather, who they are, and thereby slightly expand our own knowledge about the ancient period. </p><h2>  Etymology and Definition </h2><p>  Meteki is an ancient Greek term that sounds in the native language as <span>Μέτοικοι.</span>  <span>Literally translated as "living in the midst", and if you simplify the translation, you get just a "settler".</span>  <span>Even the approximate date of origin of this term is impossible to find.</span>  <span>For a long time, Greece was the center of European civilization, and from all the districts, numerous "luck catchers" came here.</span>  <span>Since they settled among the native Greeks, they began to be called accordingly.</span>  <span>So, it turns out that the metecs <span>are emigrants</span> who arrived in a foreign state.</span>  <span>They live on Greek territory, work together with the Greeks, take part in the development of local trade and crafts.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Rights </h2><p>  <span>Freedom is a right that in those days was worth its weight in gold.</span>  <span>Meteki - these were completely free people, which, perhaps, was considered their main asset.</span>  <span>Foreigners who decided to try their luck in one of the most prosperous countries in the ancient period, also had the right to trade on its territory, but for this it was necessary to pay an annual tax.</span>  <span>Similarly, meteks were allowed to engage in any crafts, to open their workshop shops.</span>  <span>In fact, their labor activity was no different from that of the native Greeks, and sometimes their income was even more.</span>  <span>It is worth noting that many visitors to Greece became very rich people, since a small tax was introduced for them, and the demand for goods and services was constantly growing.</span>  <span>However, it was not possible for them to invest their earnings in something meaningful, namely real estate, why - we read further.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Responsibilities </h2><p>  <span>The ancient Greek government was extremely strict on emigrants.</span>  <span>All visitors had their hands tied, but they were obliged to perform military service on a par with the indigenous population of the country.</span>  <span>In the army, their duties were no different from those of the Greeks, and the term was also the same.</span>  <span>A plus can be considered that, leaving the ranks of the military, metecs were exempted from annual taxes, were free to trade and engage in any business activity on the territory of the state.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Prospects </h2><p>  <span>To a greater extent, metecs are a definition that characterized those who were not born in Ancient Greece.</span>  <span>This is a certain lower layer of the population.</span>  <span>Indeed, slaves were often equated with them, whom the owners freed from their shackles and released them on free bread.</span>  <span>But there were times when emigrants could still obtain the coveted citizenship, or at least become respected persons in this country.</span>  <span>For example, under Dimitri Falerisky the demographic situation was extremely sad, therefore, for special services to the state, the metecs received the status of a citizen.</span>  <span>Also, attention was paid to talented people.</span>  <span>Philosophers, artists, musicians and scientists received the right to own real estate and many privileges from the ruler.</span> </p>
