    <p>  Among the most interesting places, one can note the many architectural structures that Burgas is famous for.  Sights include in your list such a unique building as the Cathedral Church of <span>Saints Cyril</span> and Methodius.  It rises near the market, in the central part of the city.  This is one of the oldest temples here.  All tourists are impressed by the majestic architecture of the facade and dome.  Its interior with beautiful paintings is very beautiful.  The value of the temple is a carved wooden altar.  Not far from the hotel "Bulgaria" is another unique architectural structure - the Armenian Church, which deserves attention.  We cannot but mention such a monument as the fortress of Poros, which is located near Burgas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, not only architectural structures are attractive in the city, there are many interesting natural places that Bulgaria is proud of.  Burgas, the sights of which we see, is famous for its lakes, among which are Burgas, Atanasov and Madren.

    <p>  However, this is not all that you can see when you arrive in Burgas (Bulgaria).  Photos, with the help of which I want to show all the beauty of this city, cannot fully convey all the colors and impressions.  In order to appreciate how beautiful it is, you need to see the city with your own eyes. </p>
