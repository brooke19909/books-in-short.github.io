And this is not surprising, because the jumpsuit is very comfortable to wear, and the abundance of various models allows not only to look fashionable, but also not to restrict movements.  You can sew it yourself using a pattern of children's overalls.  And how to do it right, you will learn from this article. </p><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  The choice of material for sewing such an important attribute of a children's wardrobe is a very important matter.  It depends on how long the overalls will serve its owner and whether he will be comfortable in it.  Therefore, when choosing fabric for sewing such a product, rely on the season of socks. </p><ol><li>  Summer: cotton, linen and knitted fabrics. </li><li>  Autumn-winter: <span>flannel, flannel,</span> fleece, velor, wool and knit fabrics. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A variety of overalls" class="if uuid-2925432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2925432.jpg"></div><p>  Accessories for overalls should also be appropriate, Velcro or buttons are best. </p><h2>  Overalls for the newborn </h2><p>  In the modern world, few people use diapers, so frequent changing of the baby is not necessary.  Because of this, many parents began to prefer jumpsuits to rompers and vests.  And not in vain, because such clothing allows you to cover the back and does not leave unpleasant marks due to incorrectly dressed clothes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To sew a jumpsuit, you will need: </p><ul><li>  cotton fabric - 1.5 m; </li><li>  threads in tone; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  pins </li><li>  tape measure; </li><li>  chalk or remnant; </li><li>  Velcro fastener - 10-15 cm. </li></ul><p>  So, the material, components and tools are prepared.  You can proceed to the <span>pattern of overalls for the newborn.</span>  It is not necessary to sew jumpsuits exactly in size.  It should be freer so that the baby is comfortable in it.  First, take the following measurements from the child: </p><ol><li>  The length of the arms and legs. </li><li>  Body length. </li><li>  Total length. </li><li>  Neck circumference. </li><li>  Chest and waist. </li></ol><p>  After that, you should draw a pattern of overalls on special paper, plastic film or an old newspaper.  Since this is a jumpsuit for a baby, it should be cut with closed socks and handles to keep the baby warm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gepur-shop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="overalls pattern" class="if uuid-2925415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2925415.jpg"></div><p>  Do not forget to draw 1-2 cm for each seam from each edge when drawing up the pattern.  After the overalls pattern is ready, put it on the prepared fabric and secure with pins.  Carefully circle the pattern with chalk or remnant.  Then carefully cut the jumpsuit.  After that, sew it with a sewing machine, and then attach the Velcro to the finished product.  Sewing a jumpsuit for a newborn is better on the front side, so the seam will not injure the delicate skin of the child. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Warm jumpsuit for walking </h2><p>  Warm jumpsuit for walking outdoors in the autumn and winter is just a lifesaver for parents.  Every child should have such a necessary and useful thing, and it is not necessary to run for clothes to the store.  Overalls can be sewn independently even by the forces of a beginning dressmaker. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gepur-shop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Warm jumpsuit" class="if uuid-2925418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2925418.jpg"></div><p>  In order to sew a warm accessory for walking, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Overalls pattern (which can be downloaded on the Internet or constructed independently). </li><li>  Fleece fabric - 1.5 m. </li><li>  Lining fabric - 1.5 m. </li><li>  Batting or synthetic winterizer. </li><li>  Zipper). </li><li>  Threads. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  A piece of chalk. </li><li>  Centimeter. </li><li>  Sewing machine. </li><li>  Pins </li></ol><p>  So, at the first stage, make a pattern.  The jumpsuit will be one-piece with a hood, therefore, it is necessary to prepare three parts: the front part, the back and the hood.  Before you make a pattern, you should take measurements.  The results of the measurement must be transferred to special paper.  The overalls pattern with pins should be attached to the fleece fabric, circle around the contour with chalk, and then cut.  This should be done with all the details. </p><p>  Since a warm jumpsuit is sewn for a walk, it should be 1-2 sizes larger.  This will allow you to put on warm pants and a blouse, thereby protecting the child from hypothermia. </p><p>  The assembly of the overalls is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Sew the back: 1 layer - fleece, 2 layer - synthetic winterizer (batting), 3 layer - fabric for lining. </li><li>  Hide the front part in a similar way and sew a zipper to it. </li><li>  The rectangular hood should also be sewn in three layers. </li><li>  In conclusion, you should connect all the parts together. </li></ol><p>  Do not forget to sew a drawstring to the hood.  This will allow you to adjust the size of the hood and protect the child from cold and wind. </p><p>  Thus, you can design a pattern of overalls and sew it yourself at home.  And you can decorate it at your own discretion: embroidery or applique. </p>
