    <h2>  Peterhof History </h2><p>  The decision on the development of the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland and the construction of the summer ceremonial residence of the emperor was made by Peter the Great.  In 1712, the first work began on the creation of a residential complex.  The emperor wanted to build a residence that could compare with the French Versailles.  He certainly wanted a magnificent complex of fountains in front of the palace.  That is why the previous project of the residence in Strelna was rejected.  Under Peter the Great, a rather modest palace was erected according to the design of J. Leblanc in the style of Peter the Great <span>Baroque.</span>  But under Elizaveta Petrovna, the palace was completely rebuilt and the building appeared, which today is the glory of Peterhof. </p><p>  During the Second World War, the palace and park complex was almost completely destroyed by the invaders.  After the Victory a tremendous restoration work was carried out, and today tourists can see Peterhof in all its glory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Palace and park complex </h2><p>  The center of composition of the residence complex is the Grand Palace in Peterhof, Upper and Lower Parks.  The most famous, of course, is the Lower Park with its magnificent fountains.  Versailles was the prototype for the complex, but Peterhof is more compact and much more harmoniously integrated into the natural landscape.  The water supply system in the fountains is a unique engineering structure.  And architects and engineers from several European countries worked on the construction of Peterhof buildings.  The upper park with a round fountain ‚ÄúMezheumny‚Äù is an example of a classic regular garden in the spirit of the traditions of England and France.  But the Lower Park with its famous cascade of fountains is considered to be the real pearl of Peterhof.  The center of the composition is the Samson fountain, but besides it, there are 64 more fountains, more than 250 sculptures.  In the <span>park of Peterhof there are</span> several palaces, many cozy corners with fountains, pavilions, places of rest. </p>

    <h2>  Petrodvorets </h2><p>  The modern-looking Grand Palace in Peterhof was designed by the great Russian architect of Italian origin Bartolomeo Rastrelli.  The building is made in the late Baroque style, fashionable during the time of Elizabeth.  The architect built a floor and two wings over the existing building under Peter the Great, and decorated the roof with luxurious gilded domes.  On the main dome is a three-headed eagle with a power and a scepter - a symbol of imperial power.  Two side buildings are connected to the central building by one-story galleries.  The building stands on a small ledge above the Lower Park, and this gives it additional grandeur.  But the main wealth of the palace is its interior decoration. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Interiors of the Petrodvorets </h2><p>  Every year, many tourists come to see the unique palaces of the Russian emperors, and the most popular of them is Peterhof.

    <h2>  Monplaisir </h2><p>  Looking at the palaces of Peterhof, you can not pass by Monplaisir.  It was built during the reign of Peter the Great; he himself chose a place on the coast of the Gulf of Finland, from where passing ships are perfectly visible.  The building is mounted on a high granite "pillow", which emphasizes its lightness and airiness.  This <span>summer palace</span> in Peterhof is made of red brick and in its style resembles the Dutch houses so beloved by the emperor.  The central square part of the structure is covered with a tent; two galleries with pavilions adjoin it.  The palace is an example of conciseness and rationality.  They appear not only in the layout and appearance, but also in the interior.  The halls of the palace are decorated with tiles, marble, Chinese panels, decorative carvings and stucco moldings.  The center of the palace is the Main Hall, which adjoins a bedroom, study, secretary, kitchen, pantry. </p>

    <h2>  Marley Palace </h2><p>  Like many <span>palaces of Peterhof, Marley</span> was conceived by Peter the Great, who wanted to combine convenience with benefit and beauty.  The prototype of the palace was the French experience of the emperor.  But only the composition remained from the complex of Louis the Fourteenth: the location of the palace on the shore of the pond, in which fish are bred for the court table.  A small cubic building (a summer palace in Peterhof for relaxation) was built by architect I. Braunstein.  The appearance of the palace is very concise, and inside everything is subordinated to the functions of the premises.  Two rooms were located in the palace: Oak and Chinarovy, as well as the lobby, or the Front Hall, where it was customary to drink tea while walking in the park. </p>

    <h2>  Hermitage </h2><p>  Describing the palaces of Peterhof, it is customary to talk about the Hermitage pavilion.  This building also appeared as a result of the impressions of Peter the Great from a trip to Prussia.  There he saw such a house for solitude and ordered I. Braunstein to build something similar in Peterhof.  An elegant, airy cubic pavilion was intended for the audience of the emperor and foreign dignitaries.  The first floor of the building is occupied by various office rooms, and on the second floor is the Main Hall, in which Elizaveta Petrovna loved to receive guests.  A unique table with a mechanism for Russia rises from the first floor to the second, which made it possible to remove the servants from the audience hall. </p><h2>  Cottage </h2><p>  The Peterhof Residence complex continued to be completed until the beginning of the 20th century.  In 1825, Emperor Nicholas I ordered the construction of a rural house to provide the residence with the necessary products.  So there was a palace Cottage.  This is not a farm, but a small building for the imperial family, in which its members could engage in daily household affairs.  The construction is made in the style of medieval English Gothic.  The 19th century is a time when the family of monarchs not only began to strive to live in parades and balls, but also wanted to be able to live an ordinary life.  It was difficult to do in St. Petersburg, and Peterhof was perfect for this.  The palace, the tour of which is very interesting, shows Empress Alexandra Feodorovna as a very practical and smart hostess.  Here you can see her office, library, the Big and Small living rooms, also designed in the Gothic (so rare for Russia) style. </p><h2>  What to see in Peterhof: reviews of tourists </h2><p>  The imperial residence covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 100 hectares.  Therefore, tourists recommend that before starting to explore the vast territory, visit the "Summer Palace", a restaurant in Peterhof, which sets visitors to the necessary wave.  In addition to the Upper, Lower Park and the listed palaces, the tourist, according to the vacationers here, should pay attention to the following structures: </p><p>  - Gothic chapel of Alexander Nevsky; </p><p>  - Tsaritsyn Pavilion in the Italian style; </p><p>  - Peter and Paul Cathedral in New Peterhof; </p><p>  - imperial stables; </p><p>  - Belvedere Palace. </p><h2>  Things to do in Peterhof: reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Peterhof is worthy to spend at least a few days here, you can come here several times and there is always something new and interesting.  What can you do here?  Experienced tourists recommend to arrange a quest and find all the fountains of the parks.  Take a walk along the alleys and lawns of the parks, examining sculptures, bridges and pavilions.  Tasty meal.  For this, the Summer Palace is perfect, the restaurant in Peterhof is a place where you can taste excellent cuisine in real palace interiors.  A visit to this place will be a worthy end to a great trip to Peterhof. </p>
