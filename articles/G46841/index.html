Most people strive to prepare for their loved ones the most original and memorable gift.  Recently it has become fashionable to write invitations and congratulations on old scrolls.  Of course, the old original copy will cost a lot.  But it is not difficult to prepare it at home yourself.  And in the article we will tell you how to make <span>scrolls with your own hands.</span> </p><h2>  Necessary materials and tools </h2><p>  To age paper at home, do not have to use expensive or inaccessible means.  Almost certainly, all that is required is available in every home.  Therefore, before proceeding to the study of step-by-step master classes, you need to prepare: </p><ul><li>  plain white paper; </li><li>  brewing black leaf tea; </li><li>  a small bowl; </li><li>  shallow dishes in which a sheet of paper will fit; </li><li>  milk of any fat content; </li><li>  instant coffee or cocoa powder; </li><li>  Matchbox; </li><li>  boiling water (water heated to one hundred degrees); </li><li>  iron. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="y96364tb.beget.tech" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old paper" class="if uuid-3007675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3007675.jpg"></div><h2>  The easiest, but also the longest way </h2><p>  If the reader has enough time, he can use the following advice on how to make the scrolls with his own hands. </p><p>  According to the technique, it is necessary to take several sheets of white paper and spread out under the direct rays of the scorching sun.  Leave for several days, waiting for the result.  After some time, the paper sheets turn yellow as if from time to time.  From them it will be quite possible to make a pseudo-rarity document or scroll. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Paper aging with tea leaves </h2><p>  You will be able to achieve faster results if you use the next master class on how to make scrolls at home.  This process is very interesting and not at all complicated. </p><p>  It requires the preparation of a cool tea brew: </p><ol><li>  Put five tablespoons of tea leaves in a bowl. </li><li>  Add two hundred milliliters of boiling water, and then leave for insisting. </li><li>  Pour the finished tea leaves into the prepared dishes.  We put the first sheet of paper there (or rub it with a tea bag). </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="vripmaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to age paper" class="if uuid-3007671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3007671.jpg"></div><p>  If desired, you can pre-crumple it a little.  This will provide a more realistic effect.  We notice five minutes.  And after the specified time, we take out the colored paper.  It can be dried in natural conditions or with an iron.  If the reader chooses the second method, experts advise putting the sheet on a cloth so as not to paint the ironing board or other surface. </p><h2>  The effect of old paper with coffee </h2><p>  Talking about how to make scrolls at home, experienced needlewomen note that instant coffee is ideal for these purposes.  It is necessary to work with it in the same way as we described in the previous paragraph.  However, the correct solution should first be prepared. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Make it at home is not difficult.  You just need to pour boiling water into a small bowl.  Then add ten teaspoons of instant coffee.  If this drink is not found at home, you can use cocoa powder.  It should be taken in the same proportion as coffee.  After this, mix thoroughly until the dry component is completely dissolved and then use it to age the paper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old scroll at home" class="if uuid-3007681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3007681.jpg"></div><h2>  Old paper milk </h2><p>  If you want to create not just a yellow-red gift scroll, but as close as possible to the real one, you should use the method described below. </p><p>  It requires preparing milk and a cotton pad or regular cotton wool.  After that we take a sheet of paper and put it in front of us.  We wet the disk in milk and begin to slap it on a snow-white surface.  Moreover, it is important to do this, if possible, unevenly.  After completing the described manipulations, leave the paper to dry. </p><p>  However, the work does not end there.  When the future scroll dries out well, cover it with a thin cotton cloth and iron it.  Also, if desired, you can hold a leaf over the flame.  But at the same time, it is important to prevent fire.  Our task is to lightly burn and smoke the paper. </p><h2>  How to give greater historical authenticity? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="cookiesforengland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself scroll" class="if uuid-3007679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3007679.jpg"></div><p>  So, we figured out how to make the effect of old paper.  However, if desired, it can be slightly strengthened.  And then we will tell you how. </p><p>  Regardless of the way the reader used it earlier, we prepare boxes of matches and some instant coffee.  First of all, we burn the edges of the leaf.  The main thing is also to prevent ignition, otherwise all the work will go down the drain.  Having achieved the desired result, we grind the coffee granules in several places, in this way making the color uneven. </p><p>  When you are completely satisfied with the result, you need to carefully roll the prepared paper into a roll.  Next, prepare a red candle, twine or twine, coin or ring with a signet, if any.  We need to fix the roll so that it does not unfold ahead of time.  Therefore, first we bind it with twine.  Then light a candle and drip wax onto a scroll.  We wait a few seconds for the mass to grasp, and make an imprint on it.  The main thing is not to forget to write a congratulation or invitation on your scroll.  It is advisable to do this in calligraphic handwriting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="artificial aging paper" class="if uuid-3007687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3007687.jpg"></div><p>  We hope our master class on how to make a scroll of paper with your own hands will help to create the most realistic parchment, which will become an original and, undoubtedly, a memorable gift for any occasion.  It should also be noted that recently artificially aged paper began to be used to create unusual wedding invitations.  Perhaps this information is also useful to the reader. </p>
