It is located in the foothills of the eastern part of the Ural Range.  It is one of the 9 famous Uchalinsky lakes. </p><p>  The entire group of reservoirs is of tectonic origin; they formed in the Trans-Ural trough.  The shape is oblong, stretching from south to north for 4 km.  The maximum width is almost 3 km.  The total area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLake Urgun is 12 km¬≤, the catchment area is 27.6 km¬≤.  Depth varies in the north and south.  The average in the northern part of the reservoir is 5-7 m, in the southern - 3-4 m. The maximum depth is 8 m. The lake feeds on the waters of the Urals, which enter it through the Miass swamp. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Urgun Lake" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1346741.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Name and bottom coating </h2><p>  The etymology of the word is of Mongolian origin, translated means "wide."  The lake has a second local name Muldashevo. </p><p>  Urgun Lake is quite interesting.  Its bottom is composed of ancient bottom freshwater sediments - sapropels.  They were formed from dead vegetation, the remains of microorganisms, plankton and humus.  All together deposits form healing mud, which is recommended for the treatment of joint diseases.  The mud layer at the bottom of the lake reaches 2.5 m. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Coast </h2><p>  The shores of the lake are gentle, flat, overgrown with grassy vegetation.  Infrequently found areas of deciduous and coniferous forests, birch groves.  The northern shore is swampy and overgrown with reeds.  Also from this part the bottom of the lake is abundantly covered with algae.  In the middle of Urgun is a small rocky island, the banks of which <span>are overgrown with reeds.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Urgun Bashkiria" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1346750.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  The climate of the region is temperate continental.  In the west, the region is covered by the Ural Mountains, which impede the passage of cold air masses from the Atlantic.  At the same time, in the north and east, the steppe terrain passes cold winds from the Arctic.  The region belongs to the West Siberian climatic region. </p><h2>  Vegetation and wildlife </h2><p>  The flora and fauna of the area is very rich and diverse.  In order to preserve rare plant species, as well as increase the population of certain animal species, in 1965 it was decided to create an Urgun natural monument in the territory of the lake and the surrounding area.  In addition to the reservoir, the eponymous boron is also part of the reserve. </p><p>  The main object of protection of the region is Lake Urgun itself, which has important economic, scientific and environmental significance for the region.  Also protected is the typical and rare vegetation of the reserve, especially the gene pool of forests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Rare species of animals are found on the territory of the reserve and unique plants are listed in the Red Book (from animals - turpan, <span>black-throated loon,</span> from plants - Minmaria Helm, Neottianta, <span>spring</span> adonis <span>).</span>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Urgun natural monument is 3300 ha. </p><p>  Lake Urgun is freshwater, rich in fish of industrial importance (bream, pike perch, perch, ruff, rudd, burbot and roach), and crayfish are also found.  Ducks and gulls settle on the lake.  Fishing is popular all year round.  Fish are caught both from the shore and sailing by boat to the middle of the lake. </p><p>  The water in Lake Urgun also has healing properties, it belongs to the calcium-carbonate type. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Urgun Lake Bashkiria photo" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1346747.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  On the eastern shores of the lake is a large tourist complex "Urgun".  It includes several recreation centers and a children's health camp.  The recreation center operates throughout the year: </p><ul><li>  in the summer, bicycle and walking excursions, recreation on the beaches of the lake, horseback riding, quad biking, hiking in the mountains; </li><li>  in winter there is the opportunity to ride snowmobiles, skates and sleighs. </li></ul><p>  In addition, on the basis of the tourist complex they specialize in healing mud treatment and climatotherapy, which is why Lake Urgun is so popular.  Reviews about him are only positive.  In the stories, visitors note the wonderful climate, water temperature and amazing landscapes. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  In the western part of the lake is the village of Muldashevo, and in the southern part - Uchaly - the regional center of the region. </p><p>  Urgun Lake (Bashkiria) is a place that is quite easy to get to: accessible routes run from three sides.  The most popular road goes through the territory of the Chelyabinsk region, through the city of Ufa.  From the latter you need to get to Beloretsk, and from there to Uchaly.  The distance from Ufa to the lake is 370 km, from Chelyabinsk to the reservoir - 200 km.  Passing this stretch of road, along the way you can visit several more interesting natural sites: Basuzhskaya and Kulmasovskaya caves, Arsky stone rock, Beloretsky cedar forest and other lakes of the Uchal group. </p><p>  Also, the railway in the direction of Miass-Uchaly-Mezhozerny passes through the territory of the Uchalinsky district. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="urgun lake reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1346745.jpg" width="537"></div>
