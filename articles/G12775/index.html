This question is especially acute in the cool season.  That is why near the washing machine some owners put special <span>clothes dryers.</span>  These devices are characterized by a number of advantages.  However, not every unit can simultaneously accommodate two units at once. </p><p>  <span>A washing machine with dryer will</span> solve this problem <span>.</span>  User reviews indicate the practicality of the purchased device.  However, one must be prepared for the fact that the performance of such a machine will be slightly lower than that of both units separately.  First of all, it concerns the loading of linen.  In a combined machine, this figure is usually two times lower than in a conventional dryer. </p><h2>  Need to purchase </h2><p>  The machine, capable of washing and then drying the laundry laid in it, is an electronic-mechanical unit.  According to the creators, such a device should greatly simplify the work of the hostess, as it will relieve her of the need to hang and remove clothes. </p>

This is TEN.  It heats the air, which is then transferred through the air duct to the unit tank using a fan.  How is the drying process?  Hot air penetrates the wet laundry and as if absorbs the moisture in it, which then enters the drainage system in the form of condensate.  All things are dried evenly.  This is possible due to the fact that the process does not depend on the speed of rotation of the container with the laundry, but on the flow of hot air.  The uniformity of drying is achieved by periodically changing the direction of movement of the drum during operation of the machine. </p>

The same applies to drying.  This moment is considered by manufacturers in the models released by them.  For example, an Electrolux washing machine with dryer is equipped immediately with two heating elements that heat the air.  If there is cotton underwear in the drum, then both are turned on.  For processing synthetic fabrics, only one TEN functions.

    <p>  What is convenient for owners of a washing machine with dryer?  User reviews talk about significant space savings.  Owners of unique equipment receive, at the end of the process, lingerie that is already wearable.  There is no need to hang things on the balcony or in the apartment, where humidity will not be increased.  A washing machine with a drying function spreads the laundry.  The mistress will not even have to pet him. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Types of Drying </h2><p>  In the bulk of the combined units, the main function is still washing.  She focuses on the manufacturer.  Drying is considered an additional option.  That is why in many models it is still set using a timer. </p><p>  However, there are more advanced units.  In them, the drying process lasts up to a certain indicator of residual moisture.  In such models, a sensor-thermometer is installed.  With its help, the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù Fuzzy Logic system determines the humidity of the laundry.  When the indicator matches the specified drying stops.  User reviews indicate the convenience of such a system.  It allows you to bring the laundry to the desired state without leaving it wet and not overdrying. </p><h2>  Weight of things </h2><p>  Drying in washing machines has one drawback.  It is able to process only half of the device‚Äôs capacity.  For example, the Electrolux EWW 16781 W model is capable of washing seven kilograms of laundry at once.  For drying, it should be no more than 3.5 kg.  That is why this process will stretch in two stages.  In this regard, many users talk about the inconvenience of combined units, since all the manipulations take extra time and increase energy consumption.  In addition, it should be borne in mind that machines with combined washing and drying functions are less economical than conventional ones.  The energy class of combined models is not higher than B. There are units and more expensive.  They belong to classes C and D. </p><p>  Manufacturers seek to rectify the situation.  A good example of this is the Hotpoint-Ariston ARMXX D 129. It can wash 7 kg of clothes and dry up to 5 kg depending on the type of fabric. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Reliability </h2><p>  On forums on the Internet, users have different opinions about combination washing machines.  Some people think these devices are less reliable than conventional devices.  A similar statement is based on the argument that they are more complicated in their technical equipment.  At first glance, this idea is quite logical.  However, it would be very strange if manufacturers offered their customers deliberately unreliable devices. </p>

Non-observance of the operating rules and neglect of the recommendations that are set out in the manual, as a rule, lead to negative consequences.  For example, owners of combined machines most often ignore the warning that the entire amount of washed laundry cannot be dried at a time.  The device simply ‚Äúburns out‚Äù due to overload.

    <h2>  Types of devices </h2><p>  Models of units equipped with built-in dryer are developed in two versions.  The first of them provides a frontal way of laying clothes.  The second version of the models is with vertical loading. </p><p>  The front-view device is best suited for those rooms where there is enough free space.  A vertical washer / dryer is recommended for small rooms.  Such models are the best suited for installation in small apartments.  Machines with vertical placement of linen have a depth of fifteen centimeters less than that of units with a front tab.  In addition, such devices are more comfortable in operation.  The hostess does not have to bend over to load the laundry and choose the right program.  It is also convenient that the control panel of a vertical machine is out of the reach of curious kids. </p><h2>  Size selection </h2><p>  Depending on the size of the bathroom, a standard, compact or <span>narrow washing machine</span> with dryer can be purchased.  Take into account when buying and type of load.  For those owners who have every centimeter of space on their account, it is best to purchase a narrow model of a washing machine.  You can put it anywhere, even in a small room. </p>

    <p>  When choosing an aggregate, it is worth considering that its size affects capacity.  Typically, such machines are designed for washing from 3.5 to 7 kg of laundry.  It is believed that a family of four is quite happy with the model, which houses five kilograms of things. </p><p>  A narrow car will save not only space, but also time.  The traditional set of programs of such an assembly includes three modes: ‚Äúunder the iron‚Äù, ‚Äúdry‚Äù and ‚Äúon the cabinet‚Äù.  The functionality of recent developments has been significantly expanded.  The most modern machines have up to eleven programs for drying clothes. </p><h2>  Embedded device </h2><p>  Each manufacturer of combined washing machines has special models in stock.  These are built-in units.  Their main task is to save space and solve design problems.  Despite the fact that the built-in washing machine with dryer is more expensive than conventional models, customer reviews suggest that many prefer this unit. </p><p>  These are narrow front loading devices.  Their depth is only 55 cm. The height is 82 centimeters.  These are the dimensions that a typical built-in washer / dryer has.  These dimensions allow you to easily place it under the countertop. </p><p>  The equipment is designed with a base.  It is mounted on metal hinges, the depth of which is adjustable.  To align the upper edge of the washer-dryer built-in machine with a worktop, the legs of the unit are moved in the right direction. </p><h2>  To buy or not? </h2><p>  Is a washing machine with dryer so necessary?  User reviews on this issue are mixed.  If there is free housing, buyers still recommend purchasing a separate appliance for drying clothes.  Its dimensions are almost the same as that of the washing machine.  You can choose both narrow models and full-size ones.  At one time, such a device is able to dry the same amount of laundry as the washing machine does.  In addition, the number of programs for such units is certainly greater than for combined devices.  The disadvantage of such a solution lies only in spatial and financial factors.  Two devices will take up 2 times more space, and you will have to pay almost as much for a good tumble dryer as for a washing machine. </p>

    <h2>  Model selection </h2><p>  What brand of device is better to buy: Ariston or Samsung, Kandy or Electrolux?  Such a question is facing almost every buyer. </p><p>  There are a large number of ways to make a choice.  The final solution to a certain extent is affected by the functionality of the device, its size, degree of protection against leaks, creasing, etc.  However, starting to think about buying is best based on the amount of money you can spend. </p><p>  In the modern consumer market, all washing and drying units can be divided into three price categories.  At the bottom are brands such as Samsung and Indesit, Ardo and Candy, Ariston and LG, Siltal and Beko.  The cost of devices in this segment is below the mark of 350 and even 300 dollars.  Such combined machines have a minimum number of programs and are assembled from parts of poor quality.  The average life of these units is limited to four to five years. </p><p>  Some large financial investments will require devices of such brands as Electrolux and Bosch, Kaiser and Whirlpool, Siemens and Gorenje, as well as Zanussi.  On average, the cost of devices of these brands ranges from four hundred to six hundred dollars.  The device is easily operated for six to seven years.  The buyers of these brands are pleased not only with the large number of available programs, but also with high washing parameters, as well as additional conveniences in the form of protection against creasing, etc. </p>

Naturally, the combined washing machines of expensive models are very convenient in operation and have great functionality.  For this you have to pay from eight hundred to two thousand dollars.  The high cost can be justified by the long service life.  For such machines, it ranges from ten to fifteen years.  In particular, on the forums you can find user reviews about units of the brand Alexzz.  Some argue that the combined machine of this model serves them like a watch for thirty years.  You can believe it.  The brand is in the highest price segment.

Of course, they are designed to perform the same functions and have similar operating instructions. </p><p>  Does LG - a washer / dryer - have any fundamental differences?  Yes they are.  These are considered to be the ‚ÄúTake care of what is dear to you‚Äù technology, which was developed by the company's specialists.  It is concluded in the automatic selection of the sequence in which various rotations of the drum occur.  These movements are carried out taking into account the percentage of laundry.  This function allows you to not only wash clothes efficiently, but also to eliminate tissue damage. </p><p>  Six original care programs were presented by LG experts.

Reverse movement.</em>  It provides a vortex direction of the water flow when filling the machine, which contributes to the systematic distribution of detergent and to improve the quality of washing. <br>  <em>2. Saturation</em> .  This algorithm makes it possible to wash laundry remarkably even when the machine is not fully loaded, as it will be uniformly saturated with detergent. <br>  <em>3. Wiggle.</em>  This movement also contributes to efficient washing.  This algorithm provides a state of laundry in the drum, which is close to zero gravity.  Careful handling of things contributes to the lack of contact with the walls. <br>  <em>4. Torsion.</em>  This algorithm immediately creates 2 positive effects.  First of all, this is the absence of excess noise from rolling laundry.  In addition, during torsion, microbubbles of air are formed that effectively remove dirt. <br>  <em>5. Smoothing.</em>  This algorithm saves the car owners from unnecessary trouble.  It is very easy to iron the linen spread in the drum. <br>  <em>6. Standard rotation.</em>  This is a function of traditionally high-quality washing. </p><h2>  Samsung brand </h2><p>  The modern market for household appliances offers customers a wide variety of appliances.  One of the leading positions belongs to Samsung products. <br>  A washing machine with dryer of this brand has long been loved by many housewives.  This is also indicated by statistical data that allows you to include products of this brand in the top three most popular household devices. </p><p>  Samsung combo machines allow you to wash and dry even the most delicate linen, sewn from the most delicate materials.  The brand‚Äôs specialists have developed the unique Eco Bubble technology.  It allows you to wash easily deteriorating products with foam.  This eliminates the harmful effects of detergents dissolved in water. </p><p>  A positive effect is also created with the help of a special design of the Diamond branded drum.  The relief of such a capacity can be compared to faceting a gem.  This form allows the machine to give an excellent result of washing and drying.  When the machine is running, water is trapped in the cells of the drum.  An additional layer is created between the walls and the laundry, which reduces the mechanical effect on things.  The Samsung combo machine will give its owner a well-washed and slightly damp clothing that will be very easy to iron. </p><h2>  Brand Ariston </h2><p>  The list of the most popular brands in the consumer market includes Ariston.  Ariston washing machine with dryer, which the manufacturer endowed with a large number of functions, is in great demand.  The cheapest models have a minimum set of programs that allows you to wash synthetic and cotton underwear. </p><p>  The company's specialists have developed unique algorithms that contribute to the gentle and efficient processing of things.  Among them, the function of accelerated washing.  Linen with this algorithm rotates at a speed of one hundred revolutions per minute.  This allows you to spend a minimum amount of water.  Customer reviews indicate the effective washing of woolen products in this mode - accelerated rotation prevents the formation of spools on them. </p><p>  The Ariston combined units are capable of thoroughly rinsing and bleaching things.  This is possible due to certain rotations of the drum, which contribute to the strengthening of the action of special tools. </p><p>  Such a machine allows washing even at night, without disturbing households.  The company's specialists have developed Super Silent technology, which provides almost silent operation of the device. </p><h2>  Brand Candy </h2><p>  The Italian company ‚ÄúKandy‚Äù, known as a manufacturer of a variety of household appliances, at one time began the way with washing machines. </p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since the nineties of the last century, the company has embarked on a policy of reducing the cost of production. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She began to equip devices with wide functionality, requiring a small price for them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such is the </font></font><span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Candy washing machine</font></font></span><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> with dryer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the production of such equipment a Russian brand was bought. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today, goods on the CIS market are produced on the basis of the production of Vyatka washing machines. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, such units do not have the highest quality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometimes after three or four years of operation they have to be repaired. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most often, problems arise in the tank area and concern electronics. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the price-performance ratio of such machines is quite decent.</font></font></p>
