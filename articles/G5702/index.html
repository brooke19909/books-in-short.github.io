What is it manifested in?  How is the estate different from class?  We will analyze in more detail later in the article. </p><h2>  Class difference </h2><p>  The estate system is the <span>social structure of</span> society, which provides for certain rights and privileges for some people.  As a rule, they receive them from birth. </p><p>  A class is a social group that has a socio-economic orientation.  The concept refers to property in social production and the method of appropriation of surplus product.  However, the position of the class is not fixed in the inheritance.  For example, take the representative of the bourgeoisie.  Man owns huge factories, many people work for him, he enjoys a privileged position in society based on wealth.  However, in the event of ruin, he becomes an ordinary proletarian if he goes to work for hire.  His children do not enjoy benefits in the state. </p>

    <p>  The estate system is another concept.  People receive a set of privileges from birth.  With such a system, nothing depends on talents, personality successes.  If a person was born a serf, then breaking out of bondage was almost impossible.  Of course, there are many cases in history when privileges of noblemen were received by some people who showed themselves in battles or in the service.  They were distinguished by a special talent, therefore they achieved the right to break out of their estate.  However, such cases were only an exception.  The main difference from the class is that certain rights were enshrined from birth in the law.  And nothing could be done about it, since deviation from the general rules undermined the power of the ruling elites. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Consequences of the transition from one estate to another </h2><p>  The estates are very conservative in nature, more resilient.  If, with the class division of society, people have vertical mobility, can move from one class to another, then with the class system this is impossible.  Sometimes, by the will of a "distraught tyrant," as the subjects of a ruler violating general principles called, some "lower" people received indulgences and passed from a lower to a higher class.  However, society, as a rule, reacted extremely negatively to such changes.  This was perceived as a threat to order.  The remaining representatives of the estate were removed from such a "lucky".  The former comrades-in-arms, who zealously watched this, also denied themselves to such individuals.  Therefore, often people who are lucky to go, for example, from grooms to counts, sooner or later lose everything. </p><p>  A vivid example is the friend and ally of Peter I Menshikov.  At one time, this was the second person in the state with enormous wealth and titles.  However, society nevertheless indicated the former shepherd in his place at birth, despite all the merits.  Menshikov died in exile and poverty, and his children were never able to return to the elite, despite the huge connections and influence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The main estates in Russia </h2><p>  Until the XVII century, the estates were not yet finally fixed for the following reasons: </p><ul><li>  feudal fragmentation; </li><li>  Mongol-Tatar invasion; </li><li>  long process of formation of a single state. </li></ul><p>  All of the above historical periods cannot serve as the basis for the formation of closed groups of people with fixed rights. </p><h2>  Establishment of estates </h2><p>  The estate system is a compulsory development of law that reinforces the existing situation.  Without stability, a single state, a single apparatus of coercion and suppression, it is impossible to form it.  Of course, before that, there were also certain social groups with their rights and obligations.  However, in the absence of legal consolidation by a strong state and stability, such groups were unstable. </p>

    <p>  Conventionally, we can distinguish the main groups until the XVII century: </p><ul><li>  Boyars.  Owned land on the rights of "patrimony", ie, inheritance law.  Perhaps the most striking representative of the estate in its classic form.  The status of the boyar was inherited.  However, he gave the right to land, and not to privilege in society.  The land allotment of the boyars was crushed with each generation all the time, and their role in politics faded away. </li><li>  Nobles.  Initially, military personnel who were given land for service.  They will subsequently become the backbone of the autocracy, and their privileges in society will be legally secured. </li><li>  Cossacks.  Their task is to guard the borders.  For this they received land and liberties.  But the estate was not officially secured.  As worthless, the government constantly tried to abolish their status.  A strong state needs a permanent centralized army, with tight control.  Cossacks did not meet these requirements and often turned into enemies of power. </li><li>  Clergy. </li><li>  Peasantry.  Restrictions on rights are first mentioned in Ivan III.  <span>The Council Code of</span> 1649 finally enslaves the peasants without the right to choose. </li></ul><h2>  The final formation of the estate monarchy </h2><p>  The estates of Russia in the 17th century finally formed.  Now all social groups receive legal status, which is inherited.  The main estates of the XVII century: </p><ul><li>  Boyars. </li><li>  Nobles. </li><li>  Clergy. </li><li>  Peasantry. </li><li>  Posad people. </li><li>  Merchants. </li></ul>

    <p>  Gradually, the estate system became more and more complicated, took on a complete look.  Some gradually left the political scene (boyars), while others, on the contrary, acquired privileges.  Each ruler adjusted the estate system a little, but its final collapse was observed only towards the end of the 19th century, when society finally began to divide into classes. </p>
