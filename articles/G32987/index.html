  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Streets of London: names, descriptions, attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To list all the names of the streets of London with a brief description, you will need a separate volume of the encyclopedia.  There are more than 1300 of them in the official borders of the city, and there is also the so-called Greater London with numerous suburbs that form a single agglomeration. </p><h2>  Mount street </h2><p>  But even among this diversity there are streets of London, the names of which are well known to everyone.  For example, Mount Street, located in the old Mayfair shopping district.  And today Mount Street is a mecca for shoppers from all over the world. </p><p>  On both sides of the road are 3-5-story houses and Victorian-style mansions.  As a rule, on the ground floor there are shops and boutiques, the upper ones are intended for housing.  Here you can purchase the best branded items created by British designers.  On Mount Street, there are shopping facilities of such brands as: </p><ul><li>  Pringle of Scotland (branded Scottish-style knitwear and cashmere); </li><li>  Simone Rocha (haute couture brand specializing in women's fashion); </li><li>  Roksanda (exclusive cocktail dresses); </li><li>  Linda Farrow (expensive optics, including sunglasses); </li><li>  C√©line (elegant clothes and accessories in the style of modern minimalism); </li><li>  Christopher Kane (one of the most respected haute couture designers whose name is associated with the name of London's Mount Street); </li><li>  Loewe (a wide collection of clothing and leather goods); </li><li>  James Purdey &amp; Sons (a weapons brand with a 200-year history, an official supplier of hunting rifles, leather clothes, shoes and accessories for the royal family); </li><li>  Roland Mouret (exclusive dresses of the Titan, Moon, Galaxy series; among the customers of the store are such stars as Jennifer Aniston and Victoria Beckham); </li><li>  Nicholas Kirkwood (designer shoes). </li></ul><p>  In addition to the shops, the street is famous for the historic Mount Street Gardens, which is set in front of the tomb of St. George. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.globalblue.com" data-author=": M√≥nica R Goya, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount street" class="if uuid-2528139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2528139.jpg"></div><h2>  Piccadilly </h2><p>  Thanks to the famous Laima Vaikule song, many people know the name of a London Piccadilly street.  Perhaps this is the most popular and lively area in Westminster - the historic city center.  The convenient location and proximity to the royal authorities contributed to the development of the area with fashionable mansions of the richest and most influential inhabitants of England. </p><p>  The main architectural and cultural dominant is the <span>Royal Academy of</span> Arts.  An elegant 3-storey building dating back to 1664 was successfully integrated into the architectural concept of the entire block.  Annually held at the academy, exhibitions are visited by over 1.2 million art lovers. </p><p>  Piccadilly (London) runs from the square of the same name to the famous Hyde Park - the center of the political and social life of the capital.  Interestingly, for many centuries the street was called Portuguese.  It got its current name thanks to Robert Baker, who made a fortune by selling incredibly fashionable collars at that time, called Piccadilly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dezeen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Piccadilly london" class="if uuid-2528150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2528150.jpg"></div><h2>  Oxford street </h2><p>  If Mount Street is the center of British fashion, then Oxford Street is rightly called the "trading capital" of Europe.  On an area of ‚Äã‚Äã2.5 km, there are about 550 outlets.  And these are not only small shops, but also boutiques of world famous brands, and large retail chains.  Among them, the Fraser House is the first department store in Britain, equipped with escalators on each floor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Fashionable shops attract up to half a million people daily for shopping.  According to experts, the annual revenue of retail facilities exceeds one billion pounds. </p><p>  Oxford Street is called the most beautiful street in London.  It looks especially magnificent in the decoration of thousands of lights and garlands for Christmas.  By the way, Oxford Street was once part of the Via Trinobantina Roman road, built 2,000 years ago.  During the Second World War, the area was subjected to large-scale bombing, many historic buildings turned into piles of rubble, but were restored with scrupulous accuracy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.architecture.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oxford Street" class="if uuid-2528160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2528160.jpg"></div><h2>  Abbey road </h2><p>  Abby Road is a cult street for all music lovers of the planet.  It was here, in the eponymous recording studio, the Beatles created their imperishable compositions.  It is no coincidence that the name of the last Beatles studio album is called ‚ÄúAbbey Road‚Äù. </p><p>  By the way, the pedestrian crossing, which graced the cover of the plate (along which the band members cross), has become an object of mass tourism.  This sometimes creates problems for traffic.  An unpleasant tradition was the theft of a street sign.  As a result, local authorities hung it higher, beyond the reach of fans and ‚Äúcollectors.‚Äù </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.fitzrovia.org.uk" data-author=": Christina Latham, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baker Street London" class="if uuid-2528188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30534/2528188.jpg"></div><h2>  Baker street </h2><p>  Baker Street in London is best known for the home of Sherlock Holmes.  Although the character of the charismatic detective was invented by the novelist Conan Doyle, the house at the address Baker Street 221b indicated in the works actually exists.  Today there is a thematic museum. </p><p>  The street got its name by the name of William Baker, who supervised its construction in the 18th century.  The area was once inhabited by wealthy aristocrats and entrepreneurs.  Today, a motley audience lives here.  In the vicinity there are many branded shops of designer clothes and shoes, souvenir shops.  For low-income segments of the population second-hand. </p><p>  Of course, this is just a short list of historically significant city streets. </p>
