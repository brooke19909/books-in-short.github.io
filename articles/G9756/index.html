    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  As our compatriots note, the rooms in this hotel will appeal to even the most demanding travelers.  So, all apartments here have an original stylish design and are spacious and bright.  A huge plus tourists considered the fact that the windows of each room overlook the sea.  So you have a luxurious look.  The rooms have everything you need - quality furniture, modern appliances, a set of dishes, a hairdryer, bathrobes, slippers and much more.  The apartments also have spacious balconies with chairs and tables where you can have a good time.  Another indisputable advantage <span>of the Pattaya</span> Centara Grand Mirage Beach Resort is the presence of free Wi-Fi throughout its territory (including the rooms).

    <h2>  Cleaning service </h2><p>  Perhaps one of the few moments that caused complaints from some guests of this hotel was caused by the work of the maids.  So, some of our compatriots claim that, despite the high level of the hotel, room cleaning sometimes leaves much to be desired.  So sometimes vacationers had to complain to the reception manager.  By the way, in the event that you notice that the maids do not particularly look into your room, then you should pay attention to whether you accidentally pressed the "do not disturb" button.  Indeed, in this case, cleaning in your apartment will not be carried out. </p><p>  As for the rest of the hotel staff, then vacationers have no complaints about it.  On the contrary, according to our compatriots, real professionals work here, foreseeing the wishes of the guests and always ready to help them in any situation.  Another advantage, according to tourists, is that a large percentage of hotel workers understand Russian. </p>

    <h2>  Food </h2><p>  The price of accommodation in the Centara Grand Mirage Beach Resort Pattaya 5 * (photo of the hotel can be viewed in this article) includes breakfast only.  According to the guests, the choice of dishes is very diverse.  So in the morning you can both eat your favorite and familiar foods, and try something new. </p><p>  You can also have lunch, dinner and refreshments during the day at one of the hotel's restaurants and bars.  However, according to many tourists, the prices here are quite high.  They cook in excellent restaurants, but the cost of many dishes stopped visitors from visiting such places.  So many travelers chose to eat either in cafes and mashinas (mobile food stalls) in the neighborhood of the Centara Grand Mirage, or go to the center of Pattaya.  By the way, several times a day a free shuttle is organized from the hotel to one of the shopping and entertainment complexes.  Here you can eat cheaply. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  According to experienced tourists, Pattaya Centara Grand Mirage Beach Resort belongs to a small group of hotels in Pattaya, located right on the seashore and having their own beach.  Moreover, the beach here is quite large, fine sand, equipped with sun loungers and parasols.  The places here, according to vacationers, are enough for everyone.  Entering shallow water.
