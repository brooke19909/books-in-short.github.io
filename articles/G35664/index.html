Weather reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What is the weather like in Hainan in September?  Are travel reviews good or not?  Now let's figure it out.  In our article we will find answers to these, and other exciting questions. </p><p>  Note that September is the calmest month in Hainan.  At this time of the year there are few vacationers.  Although many of our compatriots go on vacation in September, it is difficult to predict the weather in Hainan during this period.  They do this because the prices of autumn vouchers are quite low.  How justified is the risk?  We will talk about this later. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  In the reviews, tourists who have already visited this place write that before going to Hainan (China), you need to be 100% sure of your health.  Since the weather is not always good.  The local climate can only add to human health problems.  Good weather and <span>rest in Hainan</span> in September are often incompatible concepts.  It will be good to relax here for those who tolerate the humid stuffy heat.  It is best not to take children to rest: for a fragile organism, this will be a very big load. </p>

    <p>  So what is the weather like in Hainan in September?  In reviews, people write that it rains for more than half a month.  But it's not always the case.  It is extremely difficult to predict the weather in Hainan in September.  In the reviews, tourists note that year after year is not necessary.  Sometimes it rains only at night, and during the day you can easily walk, swim and sunbathe.  The good news is that the rains are often warm, so it does not cause any discomfort to anyone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sometimes the opposite picture occurs when heavy rains occur from morning to night.  In this case, rest will not bring anything good.  The air temperature averages +30 (during the day).  Water in the sea is warm +28 degrees.  Despite the variability of weather conditions, this Chinese province is very beautiful. </p><h2>  What to do in Hainan in September? </h2><p>  In weather reviews, people write that it is not always as good as we would like.  As they say, September is not the best time to relax in the Chinese province.  Reason: troubled sea, storm, downpours, cloudy sky. </p>

    <p>  Despite all of the above, the island is not empty at the beginning of autumn.  People come here who prefer a quiet leisure on the beach.  Some come to the island for treatment.  There are those who are only attracted to Chinese cuisine. </p><h2>  Beach holiday </h2><p>  It is not always possible to fully swim due to high waves and muddy water.  The most peaceful place is located in Yalongwan Bay.  This area is considered to be elite.  The sea there is really very clean, but the prices are also rather high.  Will it be possible to <span>rest in Hainan</span> in September?  Weather and reviews are criteria that are important to consider when setting out on a trip. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On Hainan, it is good to relax for those who love extreme sports.  Here the conditions for such entertainment are most suitable.  The winds are steady, the waves are high, all these factors will appeal to surfers.  Most lovers of this water sport are located on <span>Dadonghai Bay.</span> </p><h2>  Entertainment and excursions </h2><p>  The island has many attractions.  True, tourists do not always succeed in visiting all the settlements of Hainan.  If you want to add exotic to your beach holiday, visit the thermal springs.  They are famous for the Chinese island. </p><p>  There are also many extinct volcanoes.  Many tourist routes have now been laid to their craters.  Also in Hainan there are hot mineral waters that have healing properties. </p>

    <p>  Excursions to the Guantan spring are less in demand.  Here the water in the summer reaches +90 degrees.  In such a source is real boiling water. </p><p>  There are centers of traditional Chinese medicine on the island.  They offer their customers a variety of methods that are based on old recipes.  A popular center is the Garden of Longevity.  It is located in the Dadonghai area. </p><p>  The specialists of these centers are treated not only with any specific diseases, but also with the aim of raising immunity, returning wasted forces. </p>
