  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Magnetic holder for the phone in the car - features, types and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A GPS navigator, a radar detector, speakerphone and voice command recognition are just a few of the phone features that modern drivers use.  At the same time, you need to conveniently place the smartphone in the passenger compartment of the car so that on the one hand it is visible and on the other hand it does not fall during bends and on bumps.  This task is successfully solved by magnetic holders for the phone in the car. </p><h2>  Features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="shop.mobilenations.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Magnetic holder device" class="if uuid-2380648" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80692/2380648.jpg"></div><p>  There are many ways to place a smartphone in the cabin within sight.  For these purposes, universal holders with clamping fasteners, adhesive mats, pockets, steering wheel locks and other devices are used.  The smartphone can also be placed by the cigarette lighter or audio outputs. </p><p>  However, magnetic phone holders are becoming increasingly popular. With their help, you can place the device almost anywhere in the cabin and be sure that it will not fall on the road.  The design provides for only 2 main elements: </p><ol><li>  Holder.  It can be mounted on a dashboard, in the air duct grille or on glass. </li><li>  Magnetic pad.  It has a polymer gasket, which eliminates mechanical damage to the mobile device.  As a rule, neodymium magnets are under the protective layer - the main secret of the smartphone‚Äôs fastening. </li></ol><p>  The kit also always comes with a plate that can be placed under the cover or glued directly under or on the case.  Metal phones do not need this add-on, but devices with plastic back covers need it.  The design of the magnet holder also provides a tight hinge that allows you to change the angle of inclination of the mobile device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Benefits </h2><ul><li>  Compactness.  It has the smallest dimensions among <span>car phone holders</span> and organically complements the interior of the car. </li><li>  Universality.  Suitable for mounting all smartphones, regardless of brand, screen size or housing material.  It can also be used to fix navigators, tablets, ordinary phones. </li><li>  Convenience.  The only type of holders that can be installed anywhere in the cabin: in the grille, on the windshield, dashboard or rearview mirror. </li><li>  Reliability.  Small and daring: with compact dimensions it holds large and heavy phablets.  In this case, the gadget is removed with a flick of the wrist and just as easy to install. </li></ul><h2>  disadvantages </h2><ul><li>  If the smartphone has a plastic case, then for reliable mounting on the back cover of the phone you need to stick a special plate.  However, it can also be simply placed under the glass, and it will be invisible. </li><li>  Poor fixation during heavy braking or shaking.  How well the holder for the phone will work depends on its quality.  As a rule, the cheapest models are not able to provide a secure fit.  The solution to the problem is to purchase branded holders of medium and high price categories. </li></ul><h2>  On the suction cup </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.groupon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Magnetic Car Suction Cup Mount" class="if uuid-2380653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80692/2380653.jpg"></div><p>  Smartphones are conveniently installed on the windshield.  A suction cup phone holder can be used for these purposes.  In this case, the mount can be removed and installed again in different places on the windshield.  However, this versatility has its drawbacks.  Suction cups are not reliable fixation, often fall at high or low temperatures. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Adhesive based </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.zapals.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scotch tape holder" class="if uuid-2380649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80692/2380649.jpg"></div><p>  There is another way to mount the smartphone on the windshield.  We are talking about magnetic phone holders on double-sided tape.  Unlike suction cup mounts, they are designed for one-time installation without removal.  At the same time, holders on a high-quality adhesive base  are considered the safest: they are firmly fixed on the surface and do not fall even with strong shaking or temperature changes.  Some models come with a special base, which is pre-glued to the glass and provides an even more reliable fastening. </p><h2>  Into the air duct grille </h2><div class="photo" data-original="hurtel.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deflector holder" class="if uuid-2380655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80692/2380655.jpg"></div><p>  The most compact phone holders are installed in the deflector.  They do not reduce vision, but interfere with ventilation in the cabin.  Drivers note that in the summer when the air conditioner is on, the smartphone case is unpleasantly cooled, and in the winter when heated, it heats up dangerously.  You can solve the problem if you block the deflector, which is not possible in all cars.  It is also worth checking the strength of the "blinds", making sure that they can withstand the load without breaking. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ball mounts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gadgets4geeks.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ball magnetic holder" class="if uuid-2380650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80692/2380650.jpg"></div><p>  Magnetic holders can also be rounded.  In this case, often the role of the hinge is played by the rounded mount itself with a magnet, which is fixed into the plate with a recess of the corresponding shape.  These phone holders are usually the most compact.  However, if the round mount itself is small, then the plate is more analogous to other models, which can cause discomfort in using the smartphone outside the car. </p><h2>  Ring holder </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dd4.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ring holder" class="if uuid-2380654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80692/2380654.jpg"></div><p>  Not all <span>magnetic</span> phone <span>mounts</span> are designed only to hold devices in the vehicle interior.  Holder rings make it easy to use smartphones in everyday life.  They are also fixed to the device case with magnets, but have a special mount.  It is made in the shape of a ring and performs many functions: </p><ul><li>  It prevents the smartphone from slipping out of hand, especially in interactive mobile games that require heavy movements. </li><li>  It can be used as a stand for placement in horizontal or vertical position on a table or other straight surfaces. </li><li>  Allows you to quickly release your hand, simply by folding the smartphone back. </li></ul><p>  The ring holder for the phone can rotate 180 or 360 degrees, providing convenient use.  However, it should be borne in mind that the overall mount on the back cover of the device imposes certain restrictions.  For example, a smartphone will be more difficult to put in a pocket of jeans or outerwear, which is not always convenient. </p><h2>  How to choose </h2><p>  Before choosing a holder for a phone in a car, you need to decide on the place of its placement.  Do not rush, because it is important to think about the future location of the smartphone for its convenient use.  It is especially important to provide a placement when purchasing a magnetic holder on double-sided tape.  To remove it, you need to cut off the adhesive layer with a thin thread so as not to damage the mount itself.  Accordingly, adhesive tape is not subject to reuse.  In addition, it leaves traces on the glass, which can only be removed with a solvent. </p><p>  When choosing a magnetic holder for a phone in a car, preference should be given to well-known brands: Drobak, Defender, Gembird, Pioneer, iOttie, Scosche, ExtraDigital, Samsung.  High-quality and inexpensive magnetic holders are produced by Xiaomi and its MiJia division.  However, as practice shows, many manufacturers have unsuccessful models.  Before choosing a specific holder, you should definitely familiarize yourself with the reviews of real owners, watch a video of use.  Fortunately, there is a lot of relevant information today, especially when it comes to well-known holders. </p><h2>  How to install </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Correct mounting of the magnetic holder" class="if uuid-2380651" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80692/2380651.jpg"></div><p>  Even the best-quality phone holder in the car may not be able to cope with its tasks if it is not installed correctly.  It is recommended to place the platform on hard and smooth surfaces (glass, vertical or horizontal plastic sections, metal or wooden elements).  Do not glue the mount on fabric or leather, because even with good fixation, constant use of the holder can lead to stretching or tearing of the upholstery. </p><p>  It is important to clean and degrease the surface first.  Often, manufacturers accompany the fasteners with instructions in which they recommend preparing the surface before fixing the holder.  It is necessary to clean the installation site with detergents, wipe it dry and degrease with alcohol-containing wipes, which are often supplied.  After waiting for quick drying, you need to remove the protective film from the suction cup or tape and tightly press the mount for 10-15 seconds. </p><p>  The main tip that is often overlooked in the instructions is to fix the holder only on a warm surface.  If the mount is installed in winter, the interior must first be warmed up.  Otherwise, the phone holder in the car will not lock securely and may fall off. </p><p>  It is also necessary to consider in what position the smartphone will be used.  If the phone is convenient to install horizontally, then the steel plate can be fixed in the center of the back cover.  If the device will be used vertically, it is better to place the plate with an offset to the top. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The magnetic holder for the phone in the car is a compact, versatile and easy to use mount.  With it, you can securely fix the smartphone on a dashboard, windshield, in the grille of the deflector, without fear for the safety of your gadget with strong shaking, braking and cornering.  Choosing quality holders of well-known manufacturers, as well as necessarily taking into account the feedback from real owners about the use of specific models, you can get rid of a lot of trouble and not regret your purchase. </p>
