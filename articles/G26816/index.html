Some people call them electromechanical converters.  A side effect of these devices is considered excessive heat.  There are models of constant and variable type. </p><p>  Also, devices are distinguished by the type of rotor.  In particular, there are short-circuited and phase modifications.  The scope of electromagnetic motors is very wide.  You can meet them in household appliances, as well as industrial units.  They are also actively used in aircraft construction. </p><h2>  Engine layout </h2><p>  The circuit of the electromagnetic motor includes a stator, as well as a rotor.  Collectors are usually used brush type.  The rotor consists of a shaft, as well as a tip.  Fans are often installed to cool the system.  For free rotation of the shaft there are roller bearings.  There are also modifications with magnetic circuits, which are an integral part of the stator.  A contact ring is located above the rotor.  In powerful versions, a solenoid relay is used.  Direct current is supplied through the cable. </p>

    <h2>  Engine operating principle </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the principle of operation is built on <span>electromagnetic induction.</span>  When the model is connected, a magnetic field is generated.  Then the voltage increases on the winding.  Under the force of the magnetic field, the rotor is driven.  The speed of the device primarily depends on the number of magnetic poles.  The collector in this case plays the role of a stabilizer.  The current is supplied to the circuit through the stator.  It is also important to note that shrouds and gaskets are used to protect the engine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to do it yourself? </h2><p>  Making a regular electromagnetic motor with your own hands is quite simple.  First of all, you should do the rotor.  To do this, you will have to find a metal rod that will play the role of a shaft.  Two powerful magnets will also be required.  There must be a winding on the stator.  Then it remains only to install the brush collector.  Self-made electromagnetic motors are connected to the network through a conductor. </p><h2>  Modifications for cars </h2><p>  Electromagnetic <span>motors for cars</span> are made only collector type.  Their average power is 40 kW.  In turn, the rated current parameter is 30 A. The stators in this case are bipolar.  Some versions have a <span>terminal box.</span>  Fans are used to cool the system. </p><p>  The devices also have special openings for air circulation.  Rotors in engines are installed with metal cores.  Seals are used to protect the shaft.  The stator in this case is in the casing.  Electromagnetic motors for machines with solenoid relays are rare.  On average, the shaft diameter does not exceed 3.5 cm. </p>

    <h2>  Aircraft Devices </h2><p>  The operation of engines of this type is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction.  For this, the stators are of the three-pole type.  Also, electromagnetic motors of aircraft include brushless collectors.  The terminal boxes in the devices are located above the slip rings.  An integral part of the stator is the anchor.  The shaft rotates thanks to roller bearings.  Some modifications use brush holders.  It is also important to mention the various types of terminal boxes.  In this case, a lot depends on the power of the modification.  Electromagnetic engines for aircraft for the purpose of cooling are equipped with fans. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Motor generators </h2><p>  Electromagnetic motor generators are available with special bendixes.  Also, the device circuit includes a solenoid relay.  Cores are used to start the rotor.  Stators in devices are of the bipolar type.  Directly their shaft is mounted on roller bearings.  Most engines have a rubber plug.  Thus, the rotor wears out slowly.  There are also modifications with brush holders. </p><h2>  Squirrel cage models </h2><p>  A squirrel-cage electromagnetic motor is often installed in household appliances.  Power models average 4 kW.  Directly stators are used bipolar type.  The rotors are mounted at the rear of the engine.  The shaft of the models is used with a small diameter.  Today, asynchronous modifications are most often produced. </p><p>  There are no terminal boxes in the devices.  To supply current, special pole pieces are used.  Also, the engine circuit includes magnetic cores.  They are mounted near the stators.  It is also important to note that devices with and without brush holders are available.  If we consider the first option, then in this case special <span>gears</span> are installed <span>.</span>  Thus, the stator is protected from the magnetic field.  Devices without a brush holder have a seal.  Bendixes in the motors are installed behind the stator.  To fix them, dowels are used.  The disadvantage of these devices is considered to be rapid wear of the core.  It occurs due to the increased temperature in the engine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Phase Rotor Modifications </h2><p>  An electromagnetic rotary-rotor motor is mounted on machine tools and is often used in heavy industry.  Magnetic cores in this case are available with anchors.  A distinctive feature of the devices is considered to be large shafts.  Direct voltage to the winding is supplied through the stator.  A brush holder is used to rotate the shaft.  Some have slip rings.  It is also important to note that the average power of the models is 45 kW.  Directly powered motors can only be carried out from an alternating current network. </p>

    <h2>  Collector electromagnetic motor: principle of operation </h2><p>  Collector modifications are actively used for electric drives.  The principle of operation is quite simple.  After applying voltage to the circuit, the rotor is activated.  <span>An electromagnetic field</span> starts the induction process.  Excitation of the winding causes the rotor shaft to rotate.  The drive of the device is thereby activated.  Bearings are used to reduce friction.  It is also important to note that brush holders are installed in the models.  The back of devices often has a fan.  To prevent the shaft from rubbing against the seal, a protective ring is used. </p><h2>  Brushless Modifications </h2><p>  Brushless modifications are not common these days.  They are used for ventilation systems.  Their distinctive feature is noiselessness.  However, it should be borne in mind that the models are produced of low power.  On average, this parameter does not exceed 12 kW.  The stators in them are often installed bipolar type.  Shafts are used short.  Special rotary seals are used to protect the rotor.  Sometimes engines are enclosed in a casing that has ventilation ducts. </p>

    <h2>  Independent Excitation Models </h2><p>  Modifications of this type are distinguished by terminal magnetic cores.  In this case, the devices operate in the network only with alternating current.  Direct voltage is primarily supplied to the stator.  The rotors of the models are made with manifolds.  In some versions, the power reaches 55 kW. </p><p>  By the type of anchors, the devices are different.  Brush holders are often mounted on the snap ring.  It is also important to note that the collectors in the devices are used with seals.  Disks in this case are located behind the stators.  Many engines lack bendixes. </p><h2>  Self-excited motor circuit </h2><p>  This type of electromagnetic motors boasts high power.  In this case, the windings are of a high voltage type.  Voltage is applied via terminal contacts.  The rotor is mounted directly behind the brush holder.  The operating current level in the devices is 30 A. In some versions, anchors with brush holders are used. </p><p>  There are also devices with single pole stators.  The shaft itself is located in the center of the engine.  If we consider devices of high power, then they use a fan to cool the system.  Also on the casing are small holes. </p><h2>  Parallel Excitation Models </h2><p>  Electromagnetic motors of this type are made on the basis of brush collectors.  Anchors in this case are absent.  The shaft in the devices is mounted on roller bearings.  Also, special paws are used to reduce friction.  Some configurations have magnetic cores.  Models can only be connected to a DC network. </p><p>  It is also important to note that three-stroke modifications are mainly represented on the market.  The brush holders in the devices are made in the form of cylinders.  Power models differ.  On average, the parameter of the operating current at idle does not exceed 50 A. To strengthen the electromagnetic field, rotors with a high-voltage winding are used.  Some configurations use lugs on the magnetic cores. </p><h2>  Serial Excitation Devices </h2><p>  The principle of operation of engines of this type is quite simple.  Direct voltage is applied to the stator.  Further, the current passes through the winding of the rotor.  At this stage, the primary winding is excited.  As a result, the rotor is driven.  However, it should be borne in mind that motors can operate only in AC networks.  Tips in this case are used with a magnetic circuit. </p><p>  Some devices are equipped with brush holders.  Power models range from 20 to 60 kW.  Locking rings are used to fix the shaft.  Bendixes in this case are located at the bottom of the structure.  There are no terminal blocks.  It is also important to note that the shaft is installed in various diameters. </p>

    <h2>  Synchronous devices </h2><p>  The <span>synchronous motor</span> circuit includes a bipolar stator, as well as a brush collector.  Some devices use a magnetic circuit.  If we consider household modifications, then they use brush holders.  On average, the power parameter is 30 kW.  Devices with fans are rare.  Some models use gears. </p><p>  For cooling the engine on the casing there are ventilation holes.  In this case, the snap ring is mounted at the base of the shaft.  The winding is used low voltage type.  The principle of synchronous modification is based on the induction of an electromagnetic field.  For this, magnets of different powers are installed in the stator.  When the winding is excited, the shaft begins to rotate.  However, his frequency is low.  Powerful models have collectors with relays. </p><h2>  Induction motor circuit </h2><p>  Asynchronous models are compact and are often used in household appliances.  However, in heavy industry they are also in demand.  First of all, their security should be noted.  The rotors in the devices are used only single-pole type.
