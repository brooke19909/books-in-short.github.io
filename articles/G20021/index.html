Features of HYIP projects</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  High Yield Investment Program (HYIP) is a high-yield investment option.  It is most successful for those who want to make a profit, investing available money and not wasting time in vain.  One of the basic rules for working on such a system is package diversification.  Observing the key aspects of a profitable investment, through HYIP you can earn more than decent amounts.  But neglect of the rules leads to the loss of everything invested. </p><h2>  Basic rules </h2><p>  As world practice and HYIP Monitoring show, the best results are achievable if a person simultaneously chooses ten, or even twenty projects, between which he distributes his finances.  By combining and sharing funds, you can guarantee the stability of financial income.  Some of the selected projects will probably be sources of loss.  Pros due to others will help offset these disadvantages. </p><p>  In order for the earnings on HYIP projects to be reliable and high, you need to be able to notice such a system in time and become a member of it.  Only early entry is the only opportunity that allows you to achieve a good result.  The sooner you managed to become a member, the more likely it is to successfully profit. </p><h2>  Types and money </h2><p>  Several varieties of hypes are known.  The division into categories is determined by the level of profit.  The classification according to the degree of return on high, medium, low is accepted.  The higher the level of potential profit, the greater the risk inherent in such a project.  It is much easier to make money if you select a project with a profitability of small or medium degree.  However, do not underestimate the risks.  Even with a very small level of promised profits, you can be in the red.  The higher the likelihood of such an outcome, the later the investor enters the work.  Every project like HYIP has several stages of development.  The first is an investment that provides a payback.  Then the project reaches the stage of growth, after which it passes to the stage of satiation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First, the creators of hype offer those interested a new, yet promising, but completely unclear project, for which excellent opportunities may open up in the future - or may not appear.  If a potential investor invests money at this stage, he thereby provides himself with the maximum level of support.  First deposits, first investors - that is fundamentally important for any undertaking such as HYIP.  After investing the first funds, the project "gets on its feet", acquires stability, becomes popular and in demand.  Constantly adding new and new members who bring their money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.hyip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="high translation" class="if uuid-3187605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3187605.jpg"></div><h2>  Growth and regression </h2><p>  HYIP development and the first two stages of the development of such a project can last months, sometimes even years.  Do not count on the continued existence and successful operation of the system.  Sooner or later, a period of decline begins, always fatal for HYIP.  This is the time when new infusions become rarer.  The program, which previously had huge cash reserves, is getting poorer.  The administration, analyzing the situation, decides: it is time to close the enterprise. </p><p>  An investor who appreciated a new hype and entered it at the very dawn of the project has a maximum of opportunities to get good money.  It is necessary to become a participant when the system is just beginning to develop, when stability looms ahead, although achievable, but in the future.  In this case, you can earn a decent amount and quickly exit the system, as soon as the decline becomes critically close. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Strategies and Mistakes </h2><p>  Some not very successful investors cannot find new hypes on time.  They prefer to enter such projects late, constantly delay the moment of depositing money, and then the moment of withdrawal.  This is a classic mistake that leads to the loss of everything invested.  Almost all newcomers to the HYIP theme do it.  Having made a mistake once, twice, third, without realizing what the mistake was, such people begin to spread the belief that HYIP is nothing more than a hoax.  Many, taught by their own bitter experience, convince: it is impossible to find a HYIP, from which it is really possible to make a profit. </p><p>  As you can conclude from the description of the experience of those to whom the promotion of hype gave only financial losses, basically such people initially look for a very long time, choosing the optimal direction for investing.  Such persons seek maximum information about the program they are interested in, literally break through the virtual web, trying to find the feedback of those who have already taken part in the system.  Only after discovering such opinions and stories, they decide to invest.  At this point, the system is already reaching a stable level - and this is only the best option.  It is more likely that it will already be in a decline phase.  As can be seen from the above, the first prospects of work are most promising, that is, the time when no stories about a specific HYIP still exist.  According to experienced investors, if you are interested in HYIP, you need to understand: just an hour of delay can already change the situation.  Every hour of the existence of the project makes it closer to the time of death. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="themerkle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hype development" class="if uuid-3187611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3187611.jpg"></div><h2>  And what to do? </h2><p>  To find out on your own what the possible profitability of the project is, how much you can get by working with HYIP, how to implement it, you need to be up to date with the latest news from the investment market.  There are specialized news publications in which informational bulletins are published about all new projects and opportunities that have appeared on the market.  Tracking them 24/7, you can find the new HYIP in time and become a member at the moment when it is as promising as possible. </p><p>  For high, the translation is ‚Äúheight‚Äù.  This describes the key feature of HYIP - such a project can be a source of high income.  This is only possible in a situation where a potential investor makes no mistakes.  This means that it is necessary to collect the maximum of useful information about all possible and promising, beginning and developing projects, in order to determine in time which one is worth the investment.  If you can identify projects at the start, you can count on a better investment outcome.  Sometimes you can make good profits by investing a few months after the start of the existence of HYIP, but this is the exception rather than the rule.  This option of making money is recommended only for experienced people who have already worked with HYIP for a long time and are able to immediately determine how stable the system is and how soon its destruction will begin. </p><h2>  Payback </h2><p>  Translation high (height, high) hints at the possibility of making good profits.  The moment when the investment is fully returned to the investor is called the payback day.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãparticipation in any program (HYIP and other types of investments) is to achieve a payback moment - only after it a person can make a profit.  First you need to beat off the initial investments, then withdraw them.  The profit that the participant received by becoming an investor can be left inside HYIP so that it continues to work and bring a financial plus.  Such a strategy minimizes the risks of significant losses.  If HYIP collapses after reaching a breakeven point, the investor avoids losses.  If it was not possible to withdraw the profit and all the earnings lost, this is estimated as the loss of someone else's money, so it is not taken into account. </p><p>  For the HYIP project, it‚Äôs not very difficult to calculate the moment when you can reach the payback point.  To do this, you should familiarize yourself with the percentage of the investment rate, then calculate after what time the amount invested in the system will double.  Today, most projects are equipped with their own calculator, through which such calculations can be done in just a few seconds.  When choosing a system for calculating the payback moment, you need to pay attention to whether the profit received is automatically added to the deposit or not. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pulsehyip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="high yield investment program" class="if uuid-3187606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3187606.jpg"></div><h2>  Counting </h2><p>  If there is no calculator at hand, you can quickly calculate on your own when the HYIP project will pay off.  Suppose a system promises a rate of return of 30% per month.  Accordingly, the hundredth day of participation will be a payback moment.  On this day, you need to withdraw from the system the entire amount that was invested at the beginning of the work. </p><h2>  Does this work? </h2><p>  As you can learn from the reviews, earning on hyps is not given to everyone.  It is difficult for many to find a project in its "infancy" state.  For a large number of investors, it is a problem to withdraw funds on time.  It seems to many that it is worth leaving the entire amount inside for another day or two, so that the profit is greater - and it is at this moment that the system collapses.  As a result, the feedback from such investors is negative. </p><p>  The experience of those who start working with projects at the very beginning is positive, on time and correctly calculating the key life points of the HYIP, making the right management decisions.  Such people admit: working responsibly, they earn good profits without much difficulty.  Collaborating simultaneously with several projects, they provide themselves with a stable profit with minimal risk.  Choosing how to work, it is worth focusing on the responses of just such experienced investors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.hyip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make money on highs" class="if uuid-3187612" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3187612.jpg"></div><h2>  On examples </h2><p>  Consider how and how much you can get, guided by the described rules of how to make money on HYIPs.  Imagine an investor has 200 dollars in stock.  He found a start-up project whose interest rate is one percent daily.  Suppose the system does not support automatic reinvestment.  In the first month, you can earn $ 60.  The same will be the profit in the second and third month.  After another 10 days, you can get $ 20.  In just one hundred days, the participant will become the owner of earnings of $ 200.  At this point, you need to withdraw the money invested in the system.  Having reached the payback point, having regained the body of the deposit, you can continue to work without much panic. </p><p>  The break-even point is reachable on the 167th day if HYIP offers the participant a profit of 0.6% daily.  For 0.7%, this time period reaches 142 days, for 0.8% 125 days.  For 0.9%, it is estimated at 111 days.  If profit is more than one-tenth of a percent daily, break-even is achievable by the 91st day.  For 1.2%, it is estimated at 83 days, and for 1.3%, the payback period is 77 days.  When learning how to make money on hypes, you need to remember: the best results are provided to those who entered the system when it was first created.  You do not need to invest anything else until you manage to return the initial funds.  Some systems support the refback service.  It allows you to reduce the payback period by 10 days, sometimes even more. </p><h2>  What do experienced people say? </h2><p>  Talking about how to make money on HYIPs, investors who have been cooperating with such projects for a long time, urge you to be attentive to details.  You need to understand that any profit is possible only against the background of a worthwhile investment.  If at first the investments are very modest, one should not expect to receive a good financial plus.  The more an entrepreneur invests in the system, the greater will be his profit on the outcome of cooperation. </p><p>  The second important aspect of how to make money on HYIPs is related to analytical abilities.  As experienced people say, when planning work in this area, you need to learn how to analyze the state of the project into which the investor has drawn himself.  If you managed to successfully reach the payback point, you need to analyze how healthy HYIP is on this day, and how promising it is, how actively it is moving towards the time of death.  Sometimes an experienced investor immediately sees that the decline is still a long way off.  This means that you can log in again.  If in doubt, assumptions, you need to abandon the second round. </p><div class="photo" data-original="coin5s.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hyip project" class="if uuid-3187607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3187607.jpg"></div><h2>  Features and Rules </h2><p>  Every HYIP project has its limitations.  Tariff conditions are such that in most cases an investor can go through only one circle.  According to experienced entrepreneurs, this format of cooperation is the most reliable and simple.  Accordingly, the investor's task is to find a new project, invest in it, reach the payback point, pick up initial investments and start new searches. </p><p>  One of the options for choosing the optimal program is to find the right one, focusing on an experienced acquaintance investor.  Some choose for themselves the person to follow.  If it is very difficult to independently analyze the capabilities of the HYIP market, but you really want to make money in this way, you can choose the person whose actions are successful in most cases and follow it.  You can vary the amount of investment, starting from your capabilities, but participate in the same projects and the same terms as the one who was chosen as a ‚Äúmentor‚Äù. </p><h2>  Money: yesterday, today, tomorrow </h2><p>  In order for HYIP to be the source of the maximum financial advantage for a person with a little risk, it is often necessary to derive profit.  This is the third key rule of anyone interested in working with HYIP.  Profit should be withdrawn as often as possible.  The project may seem promising, reliable and stable, from the point of view of the investor, but no one with absolute accuracy will predict what will happen in the next minute.  Even administrators, creators, cannot say exactly what awaits HYIP after a short time.  Even if the investor has very small reserves of free time, he should allocate several minutes daily to withdraw the funds received.  Some do this several times a day, others do it once a day.  According to experienced investors who have worked a lot with HYIP, withdrawing profits less than once a day is fraught with negative consequences. </p><p>  Usually withdrawing money from HYIP requires only a few minutes - no more than half an hour.  Most have a ten-minute time period for which you can estimate how much you managed to earn and withdraw this money.  You need to visit the investor‚Äôs personal account in the project and fill out an application for withdrawing money.  As soon as a convenient moment arises, you need to immediately do such an operation.  The larger the project, the more money invested in it, the greater the risks associated with procrastination.  Experienced investors can share stories of the loss of tens of thousands of dollars due to the lack of a timely application for withdrawal of money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.coinstaker.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hyip monitoring" class="if uuid-3187609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3187609.jpg"></div><h2>  Strategies </h2><p>  There are several options.  One of the most famous is Hit and Run.  The main idea is short-term investments of large sums in the project.  The investor withdraws all his profits, receives a deposit back, as soon as possible under the terms of tariffs.  When choosing options, they analyze HYIP, study different tariffs, determine which one is the shortest.  It is under such a program that funds are introduced from the system.  As soon as this period expires, a person pulls out everything that is possible from HYIP and sets off in search of a new promising option.  There is no re-investment opportunity for such a system.  Once again, nothing is invested in the same system.  No profit is left in the account.  The essence is in the introduction and the most rapid withdrawal of money.  This strategy is optimal if the attention was drawn to high-yield HYIP.  It is effective if you start cooperation, when the project has just started, is still untwisted. </p><p>  The second popular option is a profitable investment.  It is somewhat similar to the previously described.  As soon as the opportunity arises, the participant completely returns the main deposit.  Profit earned while working with the HYIP project is left inside.  It will be a source of further financial advantage.  Such a strategy is considered by many to be the most competent and associated with a minimum of risks.  It suits most potential investors.  The system allows you to minimize the risk of your own money, which is withdrawn as soon as possible.  True, there are disadvantages.  For example, profits are reduced as a person takes back a deposit, storing only the pluses received in HYIP. </p><h2>  Money and strategies </h2><p>  In many ways, the choice depends on where the investor begins.  Not everyone from the very beginning can invest large sums in the project.  Imagine an investor has a hundred dollars at his disposal.  You can invest them for a month, then pick them up, leaving a profit in the system.  Then only $ 30 will remain in the project, and income from such an amount will be scanty.  Accordingly, the described strategy for such conditions does not work well. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.reginaldchan.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="varieties of hypes" class="if uuid-3187613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/3187613.jpg"></div><p>  If the initial investment is a thousand dollars, after withdrawing the body of the deposit a month later, a lot of money is still left in the system - 300 dollars.  Income from this amount will be a decent financial plus for the investor‚Äôs personal budget. </p>
