Kind people often pay for their sincerity and credulity.  They can easily lend large sums to friends and relatives, and then puzzle over how to return the money.  If you often find yourself in a similar situation, then the tips from the article may be useful to you. </p><h2>  Reminder </h2><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to return money to the card" class="if uuid-2502178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2502178.jpg"></div><p>  What is the easiest way to get a refund?  How to ask friends about debt and not ruin a good relationship?  Try to remind your friends that they credited with you.  A person with a good income can forget about the small amount that you lent him, for example, to buy street food or some trinkets.  If your financial situation and moral principles do not allow you to give small amounts to all your friends, then do not hesitate to remind them.  How to do it?  You can not demand money back, but offer a friend to repay the debt in another way.  For example, say: "I paid for dinner last time, let's pay this time."  The proposal must be built in the affirmative, and not in the interrogative form.  Do not let people profit at your expense.  If you need money, and not pay for some kind of service, then tell the person directly about it: ‚ÄúI lent you 500 rubles last weekend, return them to me, please.‚Äù  If acquaintances simply forgot about their duty, they will quickly repay your debt without question. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Perseverance </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.freepik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="is it possible to return the money" class="if uuid-2500833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2500833.jpg"></div><p>  If your friends do not understand subtle hints and harmless reminders, you need to act decisively.  How to return money that they don‚Äôt want to give to you?  Be persistent.  Tell the person who credited you that it is time to repay your debts.  Now you need money, and you will not wait another month.  But what if a person ‚Äúforgot‚Äù about duty?  Refresh his memory.  Remember all the circumstances in which you have loaned money.  You need to remember everything, it is advisable not only to indicate the day and day of the week, but also the time.  What for?  It is human nature to distrust one‚Äôs memory.  So if you will in the affirmative form tell a person that on Thursday at 11 a.m. you gave him 200 rubles, he will be sure that this was indeed so.  People are used to ignoring mumble and kind-hearted people.  Therefore, if you want to achieve your goal, you will need to reconsider your approach to business. </p><h2>  A call to conscience </h2><p>  A person who does not know how to return the money is most likely too decent.  This is both good and bad at the same time.  What kindness can be bad?  The fact that others will enjoy the kindness of such persons.  And the only way such people return their money is to appeal to the conscience of the person who borrowed.  He does not need to be ashamed or scolded, as is done in kindergarten.  You need to approach a person and say that your financial situation is not as good as it seems to some.  Therefore, you do not have the opportunity to give money to all pretty people for no reason.  Say that you are hoping for a person‚Äôs conscience and would like to receive money back soon.  You can even slightly reproach a friend.  To say that he is a selfish boor and thinks only of himself, is not necessary.  It‚Äôs better to say that every day the credibility of an individual falls, and the next time he needs money, you won‚Äôt give it.  One needs to awaken conscience gently so as not to spoil relations with a person. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Argumentation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mttr.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="return money through" class="if uuid-2502173" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2502173.jpg"></div><p>  If you are an open person, then you can admit your poor financial situation.  But not all people can do this.  It seems to some that collecting money from friends is not nice.  But you will become bankrupt if you distribute to everyone and everyone even small amounts.  It is not at all selfish to return what is rightfully yours.  Is it possible to return the money that you lent to a friend?  Can.  Feel free to tell him that you want to collect the debt.  You can justify your actions by saying that you are going to buy an expensive thing.  Or you can say that you are starting to save money on vacation and want to replenish your current budget.  Your main argument should be that you need money not sometime in the future, but right today.  Such a position may astonish your friend, but nonetheless, he will repay your debt. </p><h2>  Receipt </h2><div class="photo" data-original="dnatesting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to return money for the game" class="if uuid-2500836" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2500836.jpg"></div><p>  If you do not trust the person whom you borrow money, take a receipt from him.  Better not give anything to those people who seem suspicious to you.  On an intuitive level, people feel those individuals with whom they will subsequently have problems.  But if, nevertheless, circumstances force you to do a rash act, be safe.  It‚Äôs okay to get a person to sign a paper saying that he takes money from you and agrees to return it to a certain number.  The ideal option is if, in addition to a paper agreement, you record a short video where a borrower confirms that he is borrowing from you and promises to return the money after a certain period.  But what if he chuckles at your desire to hedge?  Do not trust people who do not want to trust you.  If a person does not agree to give a receipt, then he understands that he will not be able to return the money on time. </p><h2>  Hire a lawyer </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.prime.md" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="return money steam" class="if uuid-2502186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2502186.jpg"></div><p>  Often friends swear because one person takes a large sum from another, and then does not agree to give it back.  He may not deny the fact that he took the money.  But he will argue that there is no way to repay the debt now.  Does it make sense to maintain relationships with such people?  Not.  Surround yourself with those you can trust.  Does the person whom you have loaned do not have any arguments or arguments?  Scare him to sue, you can even hire a lawyer.  Before filing papers and instituting criminal proceedings, take your acquaintance to a lawyer.  A conversation with an experienced and savvy person can reason your acquaintance.  Such an operation makes sense if you borrowed a large amount.  Otherwise, you will not have a chance to recapture litigation.  And to start an investigation only in order to teach a lesson to a person does not make sense.  Do not be vindictive and do not play the role of conducting. </p><h2>  Take money in parts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.istockphoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="return money" class="if uuid-2500840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2500840.jpg"></div><p>  Want to get your debt, but the person does not have the opportunity to pay you the full amount?  Offer him an option in which you withdraw your money in parts.  Your friend may say that he does not really like this method of repaying the debt, since he does not have the opportunity to meet with you every few weeks.  In this case, you can offer to return the money to the card.  How to do it?  You can put money on a bank card in any shopping center and even in a large supermarket.  Therefore, problems with translations should not arise.  If a person agrees to this option, you must stipulate with him how much money will be returned to you every month or week.  Do not stretch the ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù.  If you understand that a person‚Äôs financial situation is not bad, be persistent and arrange transfers every week. </p><h2>  How to return money for goods </h2><div class="photo" data-original="diez.md" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="return for goods" class="if uuid-2502187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2502187.jpg"></div><p>  It is one thing when you lend to friends, and they do not want to return money to you, and it is quite another when you cannot receive cash from the store.  It often happens that you purchase a product that you need, but it turns out to be defective or simply of poor quality.  The store does not always have the opportunity to consider a thing from all sides.  How to return a purchase if its quality does not suit you?  Take the goods, check and passport.  If you paid by credit card, you should also bring it with you.  Let's take an example.  How to return money for a game purchased in a specialty store?  There is nothing easier.  Contact the manager or a free cashier with a request to return the money.  Next, you will need to fill out an application and indicate the reason for the return.  If the payment was made in cash, you can immediately withdraw the money.  If you paid with a card, then you will have to wait a few days to transfer funds. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><ul><li>  Let us borrow small amounts.  If you do not want or are afraid to ask that they give back what they took, do not lend money at all.  Are you afraid that a person will be offended?  If someone needs money quickly and urgently, even for one day, he can get a loan from the bank in 5 minutes. </li><li>  Remember that the buyer is always right.  Even if you purchased something inexpensive or virtual on the Internet, for example, a game, you have the right to return the money.  Steam, for example, provides such an opportunity to all its users.  As a reason, you can indicate that the product did not live up to your expectations. </li><li>  Do not trust advertising.  If the product says that the company producing it will return the money for the order, this may not be true.  So if you are not sure about the quality of the product, it is better not to take it.  Remember: avaricious pays twice. </li></ul>
