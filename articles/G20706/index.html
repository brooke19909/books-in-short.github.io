  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How, when and why did crop plants appear?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It seems to me that the term "cultivated plants" you have already heard more than once in everyday life.  For the first time this concept was mentioned even at the lessons of natural science in the lower grades of a comprehensive school.  But in this article I propose to disclose this concept more broadly, dwelling in detail on the types of these representatives of the flora of our planet, to understand the history of their origin and the benefits that they can bring us. </p><p>  <strong>Section 1. Cultivated plants.</strong>  <strong>Definition of a concept</strong> </p><p>  This type of plant, unlike wild plants, is specially grown by humans.  What for?  Well, goals can be very different.  As a rule, in order to get certain foods or feed for farm animals.  Sometimes they are used even as medications. </p><p>  Scientists say that a cultivated plant does not have its own habitat, which means that with the artificial creation of certain climatic conditions, it can be grown everywhere, i.e.  regardless of place of original origin.  However, unfortunately, no species can spread naturally. </p><p>  <strong>Section 2. Cultivated plants and the history of their "domestication"</strong> </p><p>  If we delve into history, we can conclude that the cultivation of this plant species began quite a long time ago, back in the <span>Stone Age.</span>  It was then that, along with hunting and gathering, the natives thought of growing what he needed.  He began to collect seeds and throw them into previously loosened and moistened soil. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A little more time passed, and the <span>ancient man,</span> who had already begun to lead a more settled life by that time, had learned to take care of crops quite tolerably.  Of course, this required a lot of effort and patience, but planted plants were regularly watered and freed from the ubiquitous weeds.  Around especially valuable varieties, hedges were even erected in order to protect seedlings from trampling or eating by numerous animals. </p><p>  At first, <span>artificial selection</span> was carried out very unconsciously, and the best cultures were selected on the basis of only consumer qualities, for example, larger fruits or a pleasant taste.  But this is precisely what subsequently led to the creation of cultivated plants. </p><p>  The very first, still very primitive farming of the <span>Bronze Age</span> triggered the emergence of large centers for the cultivation of a particular species.  Subsequently, from these very outbreaks, as a result of travels, wars and mass trade, representatives of the flora began to spread everywhere throughout the planet. </p><p>  <strong>Section 3. Cultivated plants and their species</strong> </p><p>  Honestly, there are several ways to classify all cultivated plants on the planet.  In this article I will try to talk about the most basic. </p><p>  Quite often, these plants are classified, taking as their basis their economic purpose.  As a result, it turns out that the following groups exist: </p><ul><li>  feed; </li><li>  tinting; </li><li>  medicinal; </li><li>  honey plants; </li><li>  food; </li><li>  spinning; </li><li>  technical. </li></ul><p>  I managed to discover another classification, but due to its inconvenience, it is used much less often.  In accordance with it, cultivated plants are considered on the basis of the substances contained inside and there are: </p><ul><li>  alkaloids; </li><li>  protein-containing; </li><li>  fibrous; </li><li>  oily; </li><li>  starchy; </li><li>  sugar-bearing; </li><li>  essential oil. </li></ul><p>  But the most logical and most commonly used classification is considered, based on the industry principle.  In accordance with it, cultures are divided into: </p><ul><li>  vegetable (root, leaf, bulb, fruit, spice aromatic, stem); </li><li>  fruit (stone fruits, walnut, pome seeds, subtropical, citrus, berry); </li><li>  field (melon (according to some scientists), legumes, grains, tubers, fodder herbs, root crops, cereals, medicinal, oilseeds, spinners, tobacco, essential oil). </li></ul><p>  In addition, there are two independent groups: grapes and ornamental plants, which are engaged, respectively, in viticulture and floriculture. </p>
