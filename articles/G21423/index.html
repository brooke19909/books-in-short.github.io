All their ideas come down to shaving foam, socks, a sweater, or a cell phone.  But if your half is sweet tooth, then choose <span>gifts for men from sweets.</span>  You can order them if you want to get an unusual present in the form of an airplane, ship, car, weapon.  But it‚Äôs better to work out a little and create a <span>bouquet of sweets with your own hands.</span> </p><h2>  An easy way for beginners </h2><p>  This method does not require professional skills.  Sweets play a minor role here and are an addition to the main gift.  For example, you attach a candy gift for a boy to a typewriter.  Sweets can be tied with paper tapes and inserted into the car.  You can surprise the birthday boy by wrapping a wrapping paper around the body of the car, and glue candies (over the tail) on top. </p><p>  Another option for a simple gift, but no less pleasant is to purchase various sweets on a stick.  Decorate them with paper curls, figurines.  If you bought marmalade, then pierce it with a toothpick, wrap it in packaging material.  Insert into a vase, a jar, a sneaker and another kind of pot.  To make the bouquet stand, use a foam base (such dense bricks are sold in flower shops). </p><p>  Such a bouquet of sweets can be varied with balloons, paper flowers, if you give a gift to a young birthday boy.  Men should arrange gifts differently. </p><h2>  Gifts for men from sweets: "Pineapple" </h2><p>  This workshop will require the following materials: </p><ul><li>  candy; </li><li>  golden wrapping paper; </li><li>  twine; </li><li>  green double-sided paper; </li><li>  thermal gun; </li><li>  a bottle of champagne. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gifts for men from sweets" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/739739.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ul><p>  Choose convex candies that look like pineapple peels.  These are sold in sets.  If you got round sweets with ponytails, then gently press the ends with tape.  Then measure out a rectangular piece of golden paper to cover the candy tightly.  Drip with a thermogun, stick to a bottle of champagne. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So that gifts for men made of sweets were not only beautiful, but also retained their taste, masters advised not to work with hot-melt glue (since the chocolate melts under temperature), but with odorless glue, double-sided tape.  If you use a thermal gun, then glue the sweetness by the tail or onto cardboard attached to the candy. </p><p>  As soon as the thick part of the bottle is decorated with sweets, you cut out long leaves from green paper.  Glue them around the top of the champagne bottle, closing the cork.  The junction between greens and sweets is decorated with twine. </p><h2>  "Musical" bouquets </h2><p>  Music lovers can <span>give "musical" gifts</span> from sweets (see photo below).  To do this, you will need cardboard, sweets, sewing accessories, polystyrene foam, hot melt adhesive, <span>double-sided tape,</span> stationery cloves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="candy gifts photo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/739757.jpg" width="200"></div>

    <p>  The size of the gift is up to you.  It can be a small guitar or an analogue of a real one.  On a cardboard, draw a tool template (two body parts, two handle parts).  For cardboard blanks, cut a foam template.  Glue polystyrene between the two parts of the guitar body and the handle. </p><p>  Paste all the details of the guitar with corrugated paper.  Use either glue stick or double-sided tape.  Decorate all the irregularities of the case with a cord or a corrugated tube (wind the corrugated paper onto a pencil, then shift it to the middle on both sides, remove it, slightly straighten it). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can even glue the whole guitar with sweets of different varieties.  Spend less time making a souvenir, but get no less tasty, original gifts from sweets (photos of sweet bouquets confirm this). </p><p>  Stick the handle on the guitar.  On top of the tool and on the case, attach the cloves for the stationery (the strings will hold on to them).  Glue the cardboard on the back of the sweets with double-sided tape and only then use a heat gun to fasten them to the guitar on the sides and front. </p><p>  To avoid cutting a round hole in the case, glue a large medal.  Pull the strings of thread.  Attach a beautiful paper ribbon bow to the top of the pen.  Pack the guitar in a gift wrapper. </p><h2>  Candy ship </h2><p>  In February, many women have a question: "And what gifts for 23 of sweets can be made with your own hands?"  It can be a ship, a tank, a gun.  For the manufacture of the ship you will need the following material: </p><ul><li>  deck (basket, oblong vase or ashtray); </li><li>  skewers; </li><li>  polystyrene according to the size of the deck; </li><li>  wrapping paper in different colors; </li><li>  paper tapes; </li><li>  braid; </li><li>  truffles, sweets; </li><li>  grid; </li><li>  Toothpicks </li><li>  Scotch. </li></ul><p>  Install a piece of polystyrene into the basket.  From the wrapping paper, cut out the squares and twist the pads, fasten the ends with tape.  Put truffles on skewers and put on pads, tie the ends with a beautiful red ribbon.  Stick in two foam bags in front and one in the back. </p><p>  On the sides of the deck, attach sweets to toothpicks (glue sweets at the tips to the stick with tape).  Cut nine rectangles of different lengths from the grid (these will be sails).  From the red ribbon, cut out three flags, fasten them with a stapler to the skewer.  Set three sails on the mast in descending order. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Stick them in the middle of the deck.  Top decorate the ship with braid.  It turned out a gorgeous candy gift for a man (you can see the photo above).

    <p>  Choose sweets with one tail and a round shape.  These will be the middle of the flowers.  Wrap the tail around the skewer, attach it with tape.  From a corrugated (creped) paper cut a piece 8-10 centimeters wide. </p><p>  Wrap candy in this strip.  Tie the paper at the tail.  Cut the petals with scissors, spread them to the sides.  You can fold the strip evenly, cut into petals, and then wrap the candy.  Choose how you feel comfortable.  Next, wrap the stem with green paper or electrical tape, fasten the leaf. </p><p>  When the flowers are ready, proceed to the design of the gift.  Insert polystyrene into the basket (without decoration, or wrap with green paper).  Stick flowers into the base throughout the basket.  Pack in transparent wrapping paper. </p><h2>  Candy Gifts: Topiary Workshop </h2><p>  In general, candy topiary is very popular.  Choosing a color scheme, you can give such sweets to even men, even women, even children.  And making them is very simple.  Even a teenager can handle it.  The essence of making sweet topiary is the same as making an ordinary tree, only the crown and grass are made of sweets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sweet candy gifts" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/739740.jpg" width="571"></div>

    <p>  <span>Candy trees are</span> heavy in weight, so the trunk should be thick.  Poke a foam ball with a stick, drop glue into the hole and attach the barrel.  Decorate the pot by decorating it with beads, flowers, shells and other accessories in harmony with sweets. </p><p>  Next, wrap the barrel with paper, thread, electrical tape.  Spread the cast, pour into the pot and insert the trunk.  Until the gypsum has hardened, you can attach sisal or satin ribbon threads. </p><p>  Now decorate the crown with sweets, flowers, beads, ribbons.  Candy gift ideas can be very diverse.  The main thing is to remember that sweets need to be fastened with adhesive tape by the tail or glued cardboard, and then glued to the base with hot-melt adhesive, or put candies on toothpicks and stuck in polystyrene foam. </p><p>  Decorate the trunk with a bow; throw a couple of sweets into the grass.  Pack the gift and hand it to the birthday man. </p><h2>  Varieties of Sweet Gifts </h2><p>  Masters create brilliant gifts for men from sweets: cars, cakes, cameras, ships, planes, helicopters, guns, tanks, <span>soccer balls,</span> beer mugs, women's busts, musical instruments, guns, a car steering wheel, abacus, stationery, laptop. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="candy gift ideas" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/740742.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The human fantasy is limitless, as are the varieties of sweets.  If earlier masters had to create stencils from cardboard and polystyrene, wrapping them with sweets, now all you need is to pick up sweets of the desired shape and color.  For example, pros make a tank without boxes, and collect it completely from sweets. </p><p>  There are masters who immediately make chocolate of the desired shape, decorating it with decorative elements.  It can be either improvised means (satin ribbons, braid, wrapping paper, beads), or sweet elements from mastic. </p><p>  To order bouquets of sweets are expensive.  Try to make your spouse a sweet souvenir.  Take a beer mug with a smooth surface, glue it with rectangular chocolates.  Tie them with a decorative ribbon in a circle, forming peculiar grooves.  Fill the container with golden candies, lay the synthetic winterizer on top, creating the effect of foam. </p><h2>  Brief Summary </h2><p>  Sweet gifts from sweets will please any man and child.  The main thing is to choose the right theme and prepare the chocolate of the desired shape.  Do not make gifts from sweets that the birthday man does not eat.  And do not keep your souvenir in the heat.  It takes two days for one gift if you make it carefully and without rushing.  Try to make simple sweet bouquets first, and then move on to complex design forms. </p>
