His parents were convinced communists.  Therefore, they raised their son in the spirit of altruism and love for their people.  My father was very young when he enlisted as a volunteer and fought as part of the Red Army against interventionists and counter-revolutionaries in the Civil War.  After that, he participated in the Finnish war.  He had military awards.  Vilor‚Äôs mother worked in the city council.  She was responsible for eradicating illiteracy. </p><p>  Chekmak Vilor Petrovich studied at school number one in Sevastopol.  Since childhood, he has shown artistic talents.  By the age of fourteen he managed to master several musical instruments.  Showed success in school: he was an excellent student.

Willingly helped those who asked for help.  One of Vilor's adult friends went to the front as a volunteer and left his dog to him.  Fulfilling the request of a comrade, the young man took care of the animal to the end. </p><h2>  Start of war </h2><p>  Vilor Petrovich Chekmak barely reached the age of fifteen when the Great Patriotic War began.  Many partisan detachments were created in Crimea.  The command of the Red Army suggested the possibility of occupation of the peninsula, and therefore had prepared weapons caches in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vilor Petrovich Chekmak" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1471993.jpg" width="500"></div>  Thousands of officers were trained to form underground resistance units.

    <p>  Partisan detachments were immediately created in the occupied territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vilor Petrovich Chekmak biography" class="if" height="470" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1471994.jpg" width="600"></div>  However, the ruthlessness of the Nazis and mass betrayal by the Tatar community made the conditions of the struggle extremely difficult.  Chekmak Vilor Petrovich was ill from childhood.  He had heart problems.  However, despite this, he immediately wanted to join the resistance.  His father was an example, and Vilor looked up to him.

However, upbringing in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and love for the Fatherland turned out to be stronger.  Taking the dog left for his guardianship, he went into the woods.  There he joined the partisans.  Despite his young age, he steadfastly endured all the hardships of partisan life.  He was a scout in his unit.  Thanks to his dexterity, he could come close to the positions of the Nazis and at the same time go unnoticed. </p><p>  On November 10, the forty-first year, Vilor was in the forefront. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chekmak Vilor Petrovich Awards" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1471995.jpg" width="600"></div>  His detachment was in the vicinity of the village of Alsou.  The Nazis raided at night.  The boy was the first to see the approaching enemies.  Vilor fired a <span>flare</span> to warn his people.  However, he betrayed himself with this.  The Nazis surrounded his position, a battle ensued.  The boy fought heroically until the cartridges ran out.  After that, having waited until the vagi came close, he blew himself up and them with the remaining grenade.  So Chekmak Vilor Petrovich gave his life.  Awards to the hero were presented posthumously in the forty-fifth and sixty-fifth years.

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  After the Victory, the whole country found out about the feat of Chekmak Vilor.  Correspondents managed to find his comrades who were alive, and learn as much as possible about the pioneer hero.  Several songs and poems were written in honor of the young man. </p><p>  The image of Vilor became an example for all the pioneers of the Soviet Union.  In Crimea there was not a single student who did not know him.  Children resting in the pioneer camps often visited the grave of Chekmak.  There they took an oath of allegiance to their homeland and their readiness to be worthy descendants of all the pioneer partisans of the Great Patriotic War. </p>
