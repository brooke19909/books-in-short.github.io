  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Noyabrsk: attractions, their photos and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When traveling through the cities of Russia, it is important not only to visit them, but also to see local interesting places.  An interesting direction is the Tyumen region.  Those who also want to visit this part of the Russian Federation can read in this article about the sights and entertainments of Noyabrsk. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="63.18419590000001" data-lng="75.44776039999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/1/7/7/5177.png"></div><h2>  Monument to the mosquito </h2><p>  This architectural monument of the city, at first glance, is very frightening, no one is used to seeing a small insect enlarged a hundred times.  The height of the monument reaches two meters.  We established this attraction of Noyabrsk, a photo and a description of which can be found below, in 2006.  The author of the monument is sculptor V. Chaly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="laughingsquid.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://laughingsquid.com/giant-metal-mosquito-sculpture/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Komar" class="if uuid-2595113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2595113.jpg"></div><p>  The background to the creation of the sculpture is very interesting.  The residents of the city for quite some time tried to find a way to get rid of annoying insects, the invasion of which in the summer in this area reaches simply enormous proportions.  Many citizens believe that even severe Siberian winters are much easier to transfer than a warm, but mosquito-filled summer.  The only way to get rid of insects for <span>residents of Noyabrsk</span> was the use of an insecticide.  But he had to be abandoned in order to save nature, for which this remedy is very dangerous. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the townspeople, this attraction of Noyabrsk is a reminder that they were able to put up with this rather unpleasant neighborhood and continued to enjoy life in their beloved native land. </p><h2>  Church of the Archangel Michael </h2><p>  In 1990, city residents first applied to the authorities for the construction of a temple.  This idea was supported.  The main construction company in Noyabrsk began to implement it.  A plot of land for construction was chosen, a patron saint and a consecrated place.  But later it turned out that it was impossible to build a temple because of the activity of one enterprise in Noyabrsk.  So that the idea could still be implemented, it was necessary to establish a church fund and a board of trustees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.skyscrapercity.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=1582092&amp;page=7"><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Archangel Michael" class="if uuid-2595124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2595124.jpg"></div><p>  The first building of this landmark of Noyabrsk, whose photo can be found above, was able to be built only in 1997.  For the improvement of the temple, a community work day was organized, in which the majority of the residents took part.  A year later, the bells crowning the temple today were cast at the metallurgical plant.  Consecrated this landmark of Noyabrsk in honor of Archangel Michael in May 2005.  Since 2006, a Sunday school has been operating here. </p><h2>  Art Museum </h2><p>  In December 1985, a branch of the Tyumen Art Gallery was opened in the city.  After 7 years, a museum of fine arts was made of it.  In December 2001, it became a division of the museum resource center. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A huge advantage of this attraction of Noyabrsk is its cooperation with many creative people, such as artists, sculptors and masters of decorative art.  Various exhibitions are regularly held here, where a large number of citizens and visitors gather. </p><h2>  Museum of Military Glory </h2><p>  This landmark of Noyabrsk is the youngest museum in the city.  It was opened in April 2010 in honor of the celebration of the 65th anniversary of the Great Victory.  The museum exposition has been assembled since 2008.  Various enterprises, entrepreneurs, organizations and citizens were included in the work.  Now the museum houses more than a thousand exhibits of 1941-1945. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.esosedi.org" data-author=": " data-source="http://ru.esosedi.org/RU/YAN/3980219/ozero_svetloe/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Light Lake" class="if uuid-2595131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2595131.jpg"></div><h2>  Light Lake </h2><p>  This landmark of the city of Noyabrsk is in its vicinity.  They called the lake so because of the constant almost crystalline purity of its waters.  Quite often, both residents and visiting tourists come here on vacation for a vacation.  There are two more lakes nearby - Tetu Mamontotiai and Hanto, where you can also swim, play on the beach and go diving. </p><h2>  Monument to the Reading Couple </h2><p>  This architectural monument is the author‚Äôs project of the city Intellect Center.  In 2006, he took first place in a local competition called ‚ÄúThe Brand of the City,‚Äù thanks to which on May 30, 2008, this monument showed off near the very ‚ÄúIntellect Center‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotostrana.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://fotostrana.ru/public/post/241847/1102321447/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the Reading Couple" class="if uuid-2595126" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2595126.jpg"></div><h2>  Museum of Urban History </h2><p>  This landmark of Noyabrsk was also created as part of the museum resource center in January 2002.

On a small pedestal are three books: two closed and one open with a large pen.  For locals, this attraction is the personification of readiness for knowledge and a love of reading, the discovery of a new, unknown. </p><h2>  Monument to Baron Munchausen </h2><p>  This is another sculpture located near the Intellect Center and created with his participation.  Munchausen sits on the globe, holding a telescope in one hand and a long sword in the other.  It was cast in bronze and installed in 2012.  This is where children and adults alike come to take pictures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="khabibra.ucoz.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://khabibra.ucoz.ru/index/quot_chelovek_chitajushhij_quot/0-114"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baron Munchausen" class="if uuid-2595142" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45003/2595142.jpg"></div><h2>  Children's Museum </h2><p>  This attraction of Noyabrsk was opened in 1993 on the basis of the old museum of local lore.  The initiator of the foundation of the museum, and part-time and its director was L.M.  Savchenko.  In January 2002, he was made one of the structural divisions of the Museum Resource Center.  The main feature of this place is the absence of prohibitions.  All exhibits can and should even be touched, twisted and even tasted.  Only a few exhibits are located behind glass windows, the rest is interactive and accessible to every visitor. </p>
