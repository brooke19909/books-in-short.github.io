    <p>  Privacy, romance, amazing beauty of the ocean and the highest level of service - this is the secret of the popularity of the Maldives for vacationers from all over the planet. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Today's fashionable resort was originally established by the Prince expelled from India.  Then the islands were called Diva Maari.  Of course, the very first people on the archipelago appeared long before that.  Scientists agree only that this happened long before our era. </p><p>  Today in the Maldives, alcohol is banned completely.  This is due to the fact that the Muslim state and a person of a different faith simply cannot obtain Maldives citizenship.  By the way, an interesting fact is that the archipelago is the smallest Muslim state in the world. </p><p>  This paradise is located right in the equator, and its islands stretch in both hemispheres.  At the same time, there are practically no seasonal temperature differences in the Maldives.  The resort is always ready to meet new tourists in the hot summer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In total, the state has 1,190 islands, most of which are only small pieces of land.  Only 200 islands are inhabited by people, and only 90 of them are accessible for tourists. </p><p>  All <span>islands of the Maldives</span> are coral, so it is strictly forbidden to take out corals from the state or damage it in the coastal zone.  Violation may result in severe fines. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is alcohol allowed in the Maldives" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64890/2201699.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It will be interesting for tourists that there are absolutely no dogs on the islands.  These animals are prohibited in the country, but, fortunately, there are no poisonous snakes or insects on the archipelago, they simply are not found there.  Also, a large number of exotic fish live in coastal waters, including the largest - tiger sharks. </p><p>  Holidays in the Maldives are Friday and Saturday.  It is also interesting that the islands are recognized as the lowest state in the world.  The highest level above the sea is 2.3 meters. </p><p>  The literacy rate of the population in the country is 98%, and absolutely all children receive primary education.  Perhaps this is also somehow related to the fact that alcohol in the Maldives is not consumed by the indigenous population. </p><h2>  Exclusively for tourists </h2><p>  Many can not imagine a vacation without drinking alcohol, so all resorts in the Maldives have alcohol for their visitors.  Of course, they make it completely in other countries, and the cost of even a bottle of beer bites very much.  Only vacationers on the all-inclusive system can allow themselves to truly relax, which allows drinking alcohol at no additional charge on the hotel‚Äôs territory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to ship alcohol to the Maldives" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64890/2201700.jpg"></div>

Agree, the prices are palpable even for those tourists who are not used to counting the money spent on vacation, so many visitors, especially from Russia, try to bring alcohol to the archipelago with them in order to at least somehow save. </p><h2>  National drink </h2><p>  So, is it possible for tourists to drink alcohol in the Maldives, of course.  They are guests of the archipelago and profess a different faith, so they can freely satisfy their needs for strong drinks for a fee.  The inhabitants of the islands themselves do not touch alcohol because of the Muslim religion and most often use freshly squeezed juices and fresh juices.  It is they who are considered today the national drinks of the Maldives and are necessarily served for breakfast to all tourists.  The symbol of the paradise is considered coconut, the image of which can be found on the islands almost everywhere. </p><h2>  Serious problem </h2><p>  At the customs control upon arrival at the place of rest, tourists learn that the transport of alcohol to the Maldives is strictly prohibited.  This rule is strictly regulated by law, and even if alcohol was bought in Duty-free already on the territory of the state, in order to leave the airport, you will have to hand it in or drink it right there.  A very pleasant fact for many is that alcohol in the Maldives is confiscated from tourists only during their stay in the archipelago.  Immediately after the end of the holiday, all tourists return their drinks, which were previously stored in special free left-luggage offices.  Each intruder is issued a receipt with his cell number, from which he will then regain his alcohol. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alcohol banned in the Maldives" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64890/2201709.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Knowing how our tourists are trying to save money, customs control conducts a strict search of everyone, all alcohol found is seized.  Of course, the savvy of Russian tourists also constantly generates new ways of transporting alcohol to the Maldives. </p><h2>  Option one </h2><p>  To save at least a little of your hard-earned money on the purchase of strong drinks in the Maldives, there are several ways.  According to the personal experience of tourists who have already been to this paradise, customs officers, although they strictly study luggage, rarely resort to personal search.  That is why the necessary fluid can be poured into a small flask and put on the bottom of a handbag or just plug into a belt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Can I bring alcohol to the Maldives" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64890/2201731.jpg"></div>  Of course, at the same time, it is necessary to put on loose clothing so that the contours of the container are not striking to the airport staff.

    <h2>  Second way </h2><p>  The above method of transporting a lot will not work, and they can find it the fastest.  Tourists carry alcohol to the Maldives, using the entire arsenal of their own knowledge of physics.  One such option is as follows: </p><ol><li>  The soft drink should be placed in the freezer and cooled to a minimum temperature, but so that the alcohol remains liquid. </li><li>  After that, it is poured into a bottle of sparkling water and must be twisted with a cap and an intact safety ring.  To do this, you can buy another bottle of the same type and cut the throat from it, or search the cork separately for sale.  The ring of control of the first opening can be tried to solder yourself, but do everything as accurately as possible. </li></ol><p>  After the liquid warms up to room temperature, the bottle will become as tight to the touch as ordinary carbonated water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get alcohol to the Maldives" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64890/2201713.jpg"></div>  Craftsmen advise purchasing water from world brands for this, so that the inscriptions on them are also present in English.  Thus, you can bring vodka to the islands.  As for other drinks, you just need to choose so that their color resembles the color of the real contents: for whiskey or cognac - a Coca-Cola bottle, and so on.

    <h2>  Latest trick </h2><p>  Recently, some tourists have complained that they began to check bottles with any liquids more carefully, asking them to open them, smell them or just shake them to form gases, as it should be in the original drink.  Apparently, someone with this option was caught.  So how to bring alcohol to the Maldives now?  This method still works 100%.  To do this, you need to buy a pack of juice, a bottle of the desired alcohol and a condom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alcohol to Maldives" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64890/2201724.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <ol><li>  The contraceptive should be deployed and placed in an empty pack of juice. </li><li>  Leave its edges on top and pour in the rubber container inside the package the required amount of alcohol, not more than 700 grams. </li><li>  After that, the tail of the condom is tightly tied and lowered inside the pack, and from above the remaining space is filled with juice. </li></ol><p>  Thus, if customs officers want to try the liquid on the control, they will receive real juice, and the tourist upon arrival will carefully cut the top off the pack and get his trophy safe and sound.  By the way, the contraceptive does not affect the taste of the drink at all, so if you want to save money, disdain with the proven method is not worth it. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Can I bring alcohol to the Maldives?  Of course, this is forbidden by the legislation of the country and strongly recommends that all tourists not violate this rule, but the desire of our brother to save as much as possible pushes the majority of tourists to violations.  There are a lot of ways to do this, everyone uses his own, but most likely, if serious fines are imposed for transportation, this will quickly stop.  In the meantime, violators are only threatened with a warning, so soon new and even more sophisticated ways of transporting alcohol to the archipelago may appear. </p>
