    <p>  Today there are several versions of the origin of the name of the Russian capital.  The most common, to which the <span>history of Moscow</span> often refers to children, is the formation of a new word from two.  The name of the city has two roots - ‚Äúkov‚Äù, meaning ‚Äúto hide‚Äù and ‚Äúmosk‚Äù, that is, ‚Äústone‚Äù.  Thus, it means "stone shelter."  Later, the toponym crossed over to the river.  However, the annals indicate that the city, built by Yuri Dolgorukov, stood on the banks of the Moscow River, therefore, took its name upon itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow history for children" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/132699.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Why was Moscow called Moscow?  Today, the opinions of historians differ.  Some of them see the roots of the toponym in the Baltic and Slavic languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the tribes that once inhabited the territory of the modern metropolis.  Others are looking for its origins in the <span>Finnish language,</span> and even the Mongol-Tatar.  However, the majority of scientists recognized that the version according to which the Finns dubbed the river and then the city was generally accepted.  From their language, "mosk" can be translated as "bear" or "cow", the particle "wa" - like water.  Adherents of the "Slavic" version believe that the name means marshy, marshy area, dampness, because the city was indeed laid in hard-to-reach places.  Why was Moscow called Moscow?  There is also a biblical version, according to which a couple settled on the banks of the river - Mosokh and Kva.  These <span>first settlers</span> had children - I and Vuza, who gave their names to another river - Yauza.  Which version is correct, no one can reliably take it for granted.  Each year, researchers put forward new hypotheses, substantiate them, prove, but only time can judge them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How did the <span>history of Moscow</span> begin <span>?</span>  Briefly, it can be considered that since 1147.  It is under this date that the Ipatiev Chronicle mentions the city where Suzdal Prince Yuri invites Chernigov Prince Svyatoslav.  According to legend, the capital stands on seven hills, but this statement is no more than a myth.  Studies have not confirmed the existence of a single hillock within the ancient city, there are only small overpriced areas.  Already in 1156, the settlement was surrounded by a moat and wooden walls.  Dmitry Donskoy in 1367 ordered to build a stone wall instead of a stockade.  A brick monolith built around the Kremlin in the years 1485-1495.  At the beginning of the fifteenth century, the city won the championship in Tver and became the center of the unification of Russia.  The success of Moscow was provided by the river, which provided access to the Oka, Volga, Dnieper and Don.  She established herself in the role of the capital under Ivan Kalita. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow history briefly" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/132700.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In fact, it is not so important why Moscow was called Moscow.  The main thing is that this beautiful city exists on the world map!  This is a beautiful place filled with unique masterpieces of architecture, parks and squares, modern institutions and the wonders of engineering.  It has its own flavor, not comparable with anything.  The city, which went through many trials of history, like a <span>fairy bird</span> Phoenix, again rose from the ashes.  Neither crowds of conquerors, nor fire, nor time conquered him.  And only for this he can already be admired! </p>
