The secrets of the pharaohs and their temples continue to attract experienced archaeologists traveling to the banks of the Nile in the hope of learning something new.  The Egyptians believed in the obligatory transition of the soul into the afterlife, and for its implementation it was necessary to keep the body shell unharmed.  Dear tombs were built as the home of the deceased rulers of the country;  it was the pyramids that were considered royal tombs.  However, not all the pharaohs were buried there - most of them rest in a valley near the city of Luxor. </p><h2>  Valley of the Kings in Egypt: history, description </h2><p>  Located on the Nile River, the mystical valley is a unique place in which there are more than sixty tombs of the pharaohs, buried from the XVI to XI centuries BC.  The story of the appearance of the <span>royal tomb</span> begins with the desire of Pharaoh Thutmose I, who ruled during the so-called New Kingdom and dreamed that his body would be buried secretly. </p><p>  Fearing the plunder of his tomb, he gives the order to find a place inaccessible to thieves with an entrance hidden from prying eyes.  And after his death, the first burial, made in the form of a well, appears in a secluded desert gorge, called the Valley of the Kings.  Egypt has always been careful about its unique attraction, in which anyone can penetrate the very heart of antiquity.  For a thousand years now, tourists have come to this sacred territory, often behaving not so carefully with a historical monument and allowing themselves to leave graffiti and drawings on the walls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient egypt valley of the kings" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1065494.jpg" width="600"></div>

The funeral processions that took place here were hidden from unnecessary eyes by steep cliffs, and limestone has long been used in construction.  It was he who protected all burials from possible damage over time. </p><h2>  New disposal plan </h2><p>  The decision of Thutmose I changed the old burial system, according to a completely new plan, the Valley of the Kings in Egypt was built.  The scheme was as follows: now the place of burial of the rulers was carved into the rock, and the entrance in the form of a long inclined tunnel extending into the depths was necessarily masked.  The walls were decorated with carved bas-reliefs telling about the deeds of the deceased. </p>

    <h2>  Looting the tombs </h2><p>  It was not for nothing that Pharaoh was afraid of the desecration of his tomb.  At that time, dishonest people went to theft in a thirst to get rich fabulously.  After the capture of jewelry, criminals, fearing revenge and punishment, burned the remains of the mummy.  The facts are known when thieves turned out to be robbers, and in this risky way they avoided well-deserved punishment.  Archaeologists give another reason why the sarcophagus was subjected to vandalism.  Furious in religious fanaticism, the Egyptians pulled out the mortal remains of the pharaohs to really bury them, protecting the integrity of the soul of their master and at the same time fearing punishment for allowing thieves to plunder.  Often, mummies were hidden in the cellars, in which several centuries later they were discovered by archaeologists who were delighted with such a find. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Valley of the Kings Egypt" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1065485.jpg" width="550"></div>

And some families who hunted by robbery successfully passed knowledge to other generations, since this was a very profitable business. </p><h2>  Valley of the Queens </h2><p>  Nearby was the Valley of the Queens, where not only the wives of the rulers were buried, but also their children.  About seventy sarcophagi were found there, similar in appearance to the tombs of the rulers, but much smaller.  For example, scientists consider the burial of the <span>wife of the pharaoh</span> Nefertari to be the most beautiful of all found. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="excursion to the valley of the kings of egypt" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1066621.jpg" width="299"></div>

    <p>  Bright frescoes on the walls did not lose their colors, all the images are made according to the ancient tradition - portraits are painted exclusively in profile.  The wonderful illustrations of the Book of the Dead delight those who visit this sacred place.  Above, the sarcophagus seems to illuminate the radiance of the starry sky. </p><h2>  Archaeological sensation </h2><p>  A serious study of the sacred <span>territory</span> for the <span>Egyptians</span> began in the 19th century.  Then scientists found about three dozen desecrated burials.  Now under the protection of UNESCO is an amazing and completely unsolved place, whose name is the Valley of the Kings.  Egypt kept its secrets for a long time - until in the early 20s of the XIX century, archaeologists discovered the tomb of the pharaoh Tutankhamun, which became a historical sensation.  For thirty-three centuries, it stood unplanned, preserving thousands of luxurious works of art for posterity, and the most famous of them was the death mask of the ruler of death. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the valley of the kings in egypt" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1066595.jpg" width="351"></div>

    <h2>  Deadly Secrets of Tutankhamun's Curse </h2><p>  With the opening of this tomb is connected a mystery that claimed the lives of English archaeologists from that expedition.  The inscription in the sarcophagus said that anyone who disturbed the peace of the pharaoh would face death.  After this begins an inexplicable series of deaths.  The sponsor of the expedition is the first to die, and then his brother, for several months, scientists who have opened the tomb find eternal peace, and doctors are powerless in trying to establish the reasons for their sudden death.  On the second day, even an old sponsor friend who came to enjoy the treasure dies.  It is known about 22 deaths that happened completely unpredictably, but with the same symptoms of fever, subsequent chills and loss of consciousness.  A curious fact: the sponsor and his wife died from a bite of an ordinary mosquito.  But the founder of the expedition, Lord Carter, was the only one who died naturally in old age. </p>

    <p>  Researchers are still trying to unravel the causes of strange deaths.  Some believe that the fungus killed the spores of the expedition, all blamed the others, blamed the virus, which had been waiting for its victims for many centuries, others talk about the radiation that destroyed everyone.  However, people died for unknown reasons in the 70s.  Many wondered if the Valley of the Kings was to blame.  Egypt at that time was shaken by a <span>mystical incident that</span> happened to six robbers who tried to steal <span>a Tutankhamun mask</span> from the Cairo Museum <span>.</span>  Five of them died mysteriously before the trial and in prison, and the latter died when he was released.  The story goes that a note was found on his desk that spoke of the curse. </p><h2>  Valley of the Kings (Egypt): new secrets </h2><p>  Surprisingly, eighty-odd years after the study of the tomb of Tutankhamun, scientists found a new burial.  They found a shaft leading to the tomb, in which five sarcophagi were stored.  It was believed that the valley was fully explored, and the find casts doubt on this claim.  On the lid of a sarcophagus, archaeologists have found an image of an attractive woman and jewelry made of gold.  Hurrying to conclude a new discovery, the specialists were disappointed: there were no mummies under the lid, and the things found were nevertheless associated with the name of Tutankhamun or his relative. </p>

    <h2>  Features of the tourist route </h2><p>  Now everyone who comes to the country knows where the Valley of the Kings is in Egypt.  This is a very popular route, especially since comfortable roads have been laid to the city of Luxor.  Sometimes tombs are closed for maintenance, so you should clarify this point before starting the journey.  No one will remain indifferent after visiting this facility, because in the world there are very few places where you can get acquainted with the burial culture. </p><p>  From the very early morning, an excursion to the Valley of the Kings begins.  Egypt is a country with a hot climate, so many people can hardly endure the trip.  Guides advise stocking up with drinking water and warn of a ban on photography in tombs.  A lot of fines await those who manage to capture unique views, and all frames and videos will be deleted.  The tour fee includes tourists visiting three tombs, for the pleasure of admiring other mysterious objects you will have to fork out.  Tourists emphasize that poor ventilation and humid air are difficult to breathe inside.  Therefore, if possible, it is best to enjoy the tombs in the winter. </p>
