  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to reflash a Samsung phone: passions of a mobile tailor</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At some point, the OS operating the telephone, and in relatively outdated versions of the service software, needs to be updated.  Today, in modern devices, the process of replacing system software has been substantially eliminated.  However, for many connoisseurs and owners of branded communication devices of the Korean manufacturer, the question <span>"how to reflash a</span> Samsung <span>phone</span> " often remains not fully understood.  Indeed, very often on the Internet the user is faced with confusing instructions, and a “game” on a person’s ignorance often takes on stupid outlines of an understated amateur. </p><h2>  Three universal ways to reflash a Samsung phone </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to reflash a Samsung phone?" class="if" height="246" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/432831.jpg" width="320"></div></h2><p>  Your attention will be presented to several reliable methods of reprogramming mobile communication devices, the use of which is due only to the modification features of the widely represented Samsung line of phones.  In other words, for each group of cellular devices there is a solution. </p><h2>  Method number 1: the good old OneNAND Downloader </h2><p>  The phones of obsolete models X100, C100, E620 and others removed relatively long ago are worthy of being restored by software. </p><ul><li>  Download and install the program presented in the title of the paragraph. </li><li>  Locate and download the firmware appropriate for your software version. </li></ul><p>  The combination * # 1234 # or * # 9999 # allows you to find out the software used by the device.  Often, identification information about the device’s software is located on a sticker under the battery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Samsung phone is flashed using a service cable. </li><li>  In the case where it is possible, do a full reset (* 2767 * 2878 #). </li><li>  Unzip the firmware (two files with the extension * .cla and * .tfs) and enter the data in the corresponding check-boxes of the program (a larger file size is addressed to the “BIN” item). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung phone firmware" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/433615.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  The phone’s battery must be at least 50% charged. </p><ul><li>  Press the “Start” button and connect the turned off device to the computer.  Do not hold the red button (hang up) on the device panel for a long time. </li><li>  Then activate the “Download” key.  After a somewhat long wait, the question "how to reflash a Samsung phone for you will be practically resolved. </li></ul><p>  Of course, many of the nuances of reprogramming old software were not considered in this manual.  Often, before the firmware, the “Erase” function is used, and also actions that lead to the formatting of a separate area of ​​the phone’s memory are used.  However, you can study the question in detail if you read a sufficient amount of any specialized literature.  Nevertheless, the specifics are presented in full. </p><h2>  Method number 2: air connection </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Program for flashing the Samsung phone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/432829.jpg" width="483"></div></h2><p>  More advanced mobile devices support the FOTA method. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  You must go to the main menu of the phone. </li><li>  Then open the “Settings” tab. </li><li>  The next item is “Device Information”. </li><li>  And finally, activate the "Software Update". </li></ul><p>  It should be noted that the battery must be at least half charged.  An Internet connection must be activated, and free memory must exceed 100 MB. </p><h2>  Method number 3: the program "Odin" </h2><p>  Android smartphones are incredibly versatile, and the variety of service software can confuse anyone who is interested in a practical solution to the question of how to reflash a Samsung phone.  However, using this software, you will not be disappointed. </p><ul><li>  First of all, you need to own information about which firmware your device uses. </li><li>  To do this, go to settings and select "About device".  Rewrite the data on a separate sheet. </li><li>  Find the firmware you are interested in on the Internet and download it to your computer’s hard drive. </li><li>  Turn off the phone. </li><li>  Press the Vol-, Home, and Power buttons in sequence. </li><li>  After entering the service menu, release the keys.  And press "Vol +". </li><li>  Connect the USB cable to the telephone jack (the cord is pre-connected to the computer). </li><li>  After installing the drivers, open the Odin program. </li><li>  In the “PDA” field, insert the firmware file. </li><li>  Press “START” and wait for the end of the “refilling” process. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to flash a Samsung phone ..." class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/432828.jpg" width="483"></div></li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that the software for a smartphone can have a different structure.  That is, sometimes software has up to 5 installation files.  This program for flashing the Samsung phone has five main check-boxes: </p><ul><li>  “Bootloader” - for a file with “ABOOT” in its name. </li><li>  “PDA” - if you see “CODE”. </li><li>  “PHONE” - when there is a name “MODEM”. </li><li>  "CSC" is the component of the same name. </li><li>  “PIT” - rarely applicable, however, the file will also have the abbreviation “PIT”. </li></ul><h2>  To summarize and some useful tips </h2><p>  Now you know that flashing a Samsung phone is, in general, not a very tricky business.  However, requiring attention and careful action on the part of the user.  The most important thing is not to disrupt the sequence of strictly defined actions and to observe some mandatory rules associated with the preparatory and active moment of the firmware: </p><ul><li>  First of all, the state of the battery is not less than 50% of the charge. </li><li>  The firmware cable must be known to be working. </li><li>  In no case should the computer turn off during the reprogramming of the telephone, that is, the availability of an uninterruptible power supply is mandatory. </li><li>  Interrupting the firmware is strictly prohibited. </li></ul><p>  That’s probably all.  Do not be afraid of rumors and look at the world more optimistic! </p>
