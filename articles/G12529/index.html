However, not everyone came across another primordially Russian measure of weight, which is called the "Berkovtsy".  What is it, or rather, how much?  Let us consider in a historical context the connection between these two measures of weight, specify that it is harder - pood or Berkovets, and also discuss several other interesting points related to their use in the <span>culture of Ancient Russia.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  To begin with, both measures of weight are already seriously outdated, but if the word ‚Äúpud‚Äù is not often found in the modern language, but it still happens, then the ‚ÄúBerkovets‚Äù has long been buried as unnecessary.  It is not surprising, because the first mention of the use of measuring weighing systems dates back to the tenth century AD, and which, now, in the yard, I think, does not have to be reminded.  Why did you need a weight measurement system?  The thing is that it was at this time that serious trade relations between different regions began to develop, which inevitably required a certain standardization of exchange systems.  Which led to the appearance of these heavyweights in use. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So how much does a pound (in kg) weigh?  Almost any student will answer this question.  Of course, about 16 kilograms.  Surely many guys in their youth tried to pull a sixteen-kilogram weight, and, I want to believe, not without success.  Be that as it may, this weight is firmly held in memory, and the word ‚Äúpud‚Äù arises associatively from the depths of consciousness.  With the second <span>measure of weight</span> mentioned <span>,</span> everything is much more complicated.  And although the Berkovets were used no less intensively in those days, it was precisely the pood that was fixed in everyday life, as being closer to the reality of an ordinary person.  To his vital necessities of life, not related to the measurement of heavy loads. </p><h2>  Which is harder? </h2>

    <p>  To the question of which is heavier, pood or Berkovets, the answer is unequivocal: of course, the last.  Since it was used to weigh the heaviest cargoes, mainly in the wholesale trade.  Mainly to measure the mass of such goods as honey, potash, wax.  How much does a Berkovets weigh?  Exactly ten pounds.  Simple and convenient, right?  And although there were other names in the system of scales of Ancient Russia, it was the pood and Berkovets who were reliably fixed as the most convenient from the point of view of measuring heavy loads, which were operated by wholesalers of those times. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The origin of the word "pud" </h2>

    <p>  Consider both <span>units of weight</span> in terms of their origin.  Pood was originally forty pounds.  This, by the way, is another measure of weight widely used in Russia, but not in this article.  The name of the pud goes back to the pre-Slavic word that came from Latin.  And it meant "weight."  So the origin is quite obvious and hints to us for what purpose it appeared. </p><h2>  The origin of the word "Berkovets" </h2><p>  The history of the appearance of the Berkovets, or Berkovsk (also such a designation can be found in ancient sources) is somewhat more ornate.  In this <span>measure of weight,</span> you can catch the Swedish name subsequently of the Russian town - Bierke.  Now it‚Äôs just Primorsk, and once upon a time something difficult to reproduce in Russian.  And what was used more often - Berkovets or pood?  It turns out that both words are often mentioned in Novgorod and Pskov annals.  However, their paths diverged in a historical perspective.  And if the first has almost sunk into oblivion, then the second can be met even in the modern slang language in various combinations. </p><p>  By the way, berkovesk, from which the most used form of the word came, was originally an adjective.  There is reason to believe that it came from the phrase ‚ÄúBerkovsky pood‚Äù, all from the same Swedish settlement mentioned above.  And since this settlement was an important transport hub on the trade route from Scandinavia to Asia and Byzantium, and the most popular goods that traveled along this route were salt, wax, etc., the name of the measure of weight that traders began to cost , this word has become fixed. </p>

    <p>  It is rather difficult to imagine a reader reflecting on the question, which is harder: pood or Berkovets?  Since the use of the latter is quite specific and is found only in narrow historical circles.  However, we hope that the information was useful.  And now, if it becomes necessary to explain what was used to measure the heaviest loads: Berkovets or poods, the reader will not be confused, but will be able to show off his knowledge of Ancient Russia. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The affairs of bygone days rarely interest the reader turning over the pages of online publications, however, knowledge of history never disappears in vain.  If a person learns something new about his native history, about the roots going back to the deep centuries, then he will always encounter cognitive and necessarily useful information.  In this article we tried to answer the question: "What is harder: pood or Berkovets?"  History keeps many interesting secrets that hide the true roots of man, his behavior, thoughts, aspirations and hopes.  I would like to believe that entertaining metrology brought at least a slight desire to learn more about the amazing reality that took place ten centuries ago. </p>
