Therefore, a huge number of mothers and grandmothers seeks to dress their child in a similar thing.  However, knitting for a child is slightly different from knitting for an adult.  That is why we have prepared the current article.  In it we will tell needlewomen about how to knit a blouse for a newborn.  And even novice masters will be able to cope with the task. </p><h2>  How to choose the right yarn </h2><p>  For an adult, you can purchase any knitting thread.  The main thing is to focus on the season in which the owner will wear a particular thing.  But when the knitter decides to make clothes for the baby, you should correctly choose the material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.knittingmatters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blouse for baby raglan" class="if uuid-2906910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2906910.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, professional craftsmen advise giving preference to yarn made from natural materials.  However, for wearable products it is not wise to buy woolen threads.  They will inject and may even cause an allergy in the child.  In order not to get lost among the abundance of yarn, professional craftsmen recommend considering a special nursery.  It meets all the requirements.  Thanks to what, it is ideal for knitting on newborns.  Knitting a blouse will be done or crocheted, it does not matter.  The main thing is that the baby will like it and does not injure his skin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Knitting tips </h2><p>  When it comes to choosing a tool, the knitter should rely solely on her taste.  After all, the baby does not care what knitting needles the new thing will be connected.  But mom or grandmother will have a hard time working with an inconvenient and low-quality tool.  However, what does the phrase ‚Äúperfect knitting needles‚Äù mean?  Professional knitters say these are those made of metal.  They have a well-turned tip; chips, defects and roughness are absent.  Due to this, the yarn glides perfectly on the knitting needles, a blouse for a newborn is quick and high-quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.freeknittingpatternsfor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blouse for baby step by step" class="if uuid-2919829" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2919829.jpg"></div><h2>  Taking measurements </h2><p>  To tie a thing that fits the baby in size, will not hamper movement or crush, you should measure your child.  To do this, prepare an elastic centimeter, a notebook and a pen.  And then determine the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  the estimated length of the blouse and gloves; </li><li>  armhole level; </li><li>  neck width; </li><li>  the girth of the handle in the place where the cuffs will be located; </li><li>  body circumference. </li></ul><h2>  Calculation of the number of loops and rows </h2><p>  A knitted blouse for a newborn is ideal for him, if you convert the centimeters to the units we need in advance.  To do this, we knit a sample (10x10 cm), count the number of loops and rows in it, divide each parameter by ten.  Due to this, we determine the number of loops located in one centimeter of the selected pattern.  Knowing that loops (A) are horizontally located and rows (B) vertically, we multiply the calculated values ‚Äã‚Äãby the required measurements.  We mark them on the schematic image of the idea.  And then we just knit, based on our parameters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.freeknittingpatternsfor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself blouse with knitting needles" class="if uuid-2919844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2919844.jpg"></div><h2>  The implementation of the main part </h2><p>  Since our product is small enough, professional knitters advise knitting a blouse for a newborn (from 3 months, younger or older) on tools that are usually used to make socks and mittens.  Therefore, we calculate the number of loops for the set by multiplying parameter A by the circumference of the body.  Then we collect loops and distribute them into four knitting needles, we use the fifth as an additional one.  We knit the product for the following number of rows: multiply parameter B by the level of the armhole.  After we divide the "pipe" into two parts.  And we knit each separately, forming a rectangle.  We close.  Finally, we calculate the number of loops for the gate: multiply parameter A by the width of the neck and divide by two.  We count the loops exactly in the middle of the back and front.  The remaining parts are stitched together.  These are shoulder seams. </p><h2>  Knitting gloves </h2><div class="photo" data-original="bigalittlea.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blouse for baby" class="if uuid-2906912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2906912.jpg"></div><p>  Without turning the blouse for a newborn almost knitted with knitting needles, with the help of a hook we collect loops along the cut-out line for the pens.  But not throughout the armhole, but only by 2/3.  We do not touch the part in the armpit area yet.  We knit the sleeve with an even cloth, pulling at the end of each row a new loop from the free part of the armhole.  When we collect all the loops, redistribute them into four knitting needles.  We check the number of loops, they should be no less than: parameter A multiplied by the girth of the handle in the place where the cuffs will be located.  If this condition is met, knit a sleeve of the desired length.  We move in a circle.  If desired, add cuffs at the end using a new pattern. </p><h2>  How to tie a blouse-jacket </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="simple blouse for baby" class="if uuid-2906929" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2906929.jpg"></div><p>  Very interesting on kids look products similar to what is shown in the photo.  To carry out such a blouse for a newborn, beginners on knitting needles must score half the loops of the amount required in the previous version.  After that, we knit the back with an even cloth throughout the entire length.  Close the loops and proceed to knit the front shelves.  First, we collect the following number of loops: 1/2 of the back plus 10-15.  We also knit an even cloth to the shoulders.  But closer to the top we make slits for buttons, first closing a few loops, and then adding air in the next row.  We finish the products according to the previously described technology, after which we sew the buttons. </p><h2>  Blouse-jacket with piping </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="blouse for baby scheme" class="if uuid-2906926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2906926.jpg"></div><p>  Here is another product that is also popular.  If the reader wants to knit the blouse for the newborn, shown above, we offer instructions.  We perform the back according to the technology described in the previous paragraph.  But we knit the front shelves differently.  We collect the following number of loops: 1/2 back - 10-15 loops.  The rest of the actions are the same.  As a result, the connection of the shoulder seams we get a vest, which should now be supplemented with the edging.  To do this, we collect loops on the lower edge, knit to the desired height, close.  Then add the vertical sticks, grabbing the bottom edge loops.  Do not forget to make a hole for the buttons!  And the last to complete the gate.  Then we knit the sleeves and sew the buttons. </p><h2>  Blouse Raglan </h2><p>  Knitting seamless items is best for newborns with knitting needles.  They are much more convenient, do not rub and do not press.  For this reason, professional knitters are advised to knit sweaters for kids with raglan.  However, this technology seems to some novice masters to be very difficult and hardly feasible.  But such fears are not at all justified.  We hope that the master class presented below will help the reader understand the knitting process, and then do the original thing on their own. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="9GARCwsKVN0" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1631&amp;v=9GARCwsKVN0" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/0/3/3/9/10339.jpg"></div><h2>  Pattern Patterns </h2><p>  Only professional knitters can independently invent and execute various patterns using knitting needles.  Beginners need a graphic instruction.  Therefore, in the current article we offer some of the most popular and interesting schemes.  They are quite simple and suitable even for beginners.  They can be used to create the entire product or individual fragments.  For example, if you want to highlight pockets or a collar. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.cl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blouse for baby pattern" class="if uuid-2906949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2906949.jpg"></div><p>  Tie the original product with your own hands is much easier than it might seem.  For this reason, we advise readers to at least try to bring their idea to life.  Most likely, the thing will turn out very beautiful.  In addition, the baby in it will look much better than in the store model.  And all because the blouse connected by mother is made with soul and great love.  Most often, such products are even warmer than purchased. </p>
