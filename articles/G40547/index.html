    <p>  The review authors note that in Anjuna, guests have the opportunity to get to know the real India - with a lot of cows, goats and dogs, to the delight of those who love animals. </p><h2>  About the beach </h2><p>  Morjim, according to tourists, is a wide, not crowded, clean beach, on which there are no cows and beggars common for India.  Compared to other beaches, there are usually the smallest waves.  In Morjim and its neighboring beaches - Mandrem and Ashvem - mostly Russian tourists rest.  Nearby is the 24-hour Russian restaurant Bora Bora.  The water in the Arabian Sea, according to the authors of the reviews, is warm, very comfortable for swimming. </p><p>  Tourists say about the weather that it is hot in Morjim during the day and pretty cool in the evenings (you have to wear something warm).  May be intermittent rain. </p><p>  Vacationers are advised to take a scooter for the entire duration of the vacation (350 rupees per day).  The rental point is located at the exit of the hotel to the right, around the bend at the end of the street. </p><p>  Holidays in Anjuna will fly by quickly, tourists are sharing.  Time is usually taken by the fact that vacationers ride on different beaches and attractions. </p><h2>  About the pros </h2><p>  Among the advantages of the hotel, the following is noted: it is located away from the main highway, sleeps well in it, is not far from the sea, there are two good restaurants on the way to the beach - Rainbow, Tibet.  Most importantly, there is no theft, there are no bedbugs, fleas, linen is clean, Wi-Fi is free.  Many travelers strongly recommend a hotel to stay. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Not everyone is happy with their stay at the Taha White Pearls Guest House 2 *.  Reviews of tourists about the hotel are striking in their inconsistency.  Some contain completely opposite information about this guest house.  So, many authors report that the hotel is too embellished in the photos and reviews posted on the networks.  Upon arrival, it turns out that the building in which the hotel is located does not look at all the way the images represent it. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Speaking honestly, tourists say this is not a hotel, but simply rooms in several different buildings in Morjim.  There is 1 sheet and 1 towel for one room; a blanket is suggested for shelter, in which, as the guests jokingly suggest, ‚Äúthey buried the former tenants eaten by unknown house insects‚Äù.  The hotel building is located at a busy road junction, and you have to go to bed under the roar of a ‚Äútransport passing by the bed‚Äù.  According to the authors of the reviews, some rooms have no air conditioning.  The ceiling fan does not save in the heat. </p>

    <p>  Numbers at the first acquaintance cause outrage of many.  According to the authors of the reviews, they can offer guests dirty bedding.  There is no closet, safe, TV, mold inside the fridge. </p><p>  Tourists report that during their stay at the hotel their toilet on the ground floor had a window broken, so they had to hide in bags from passers-by on the street. </p><p>  The audibility in the rooms by the guests is called "magnificent." </p><p>  The tenants call the beds very hard: it seems that hay is filling in the mattress - it is very hard and prickly. </p><p>  Some tourists report about the service that they never cleaned their room, and since there was no reception in their building, they did not know who to contact to ask for cleaning. </p><p>  The main disadvantage is mosquitoes.  Residents are advised to use a fumigator, but, according to reviews, and it does not help much.  Tourists recommend to take with them funds from mosquitoes, which are many in the rooms after sunset. </p><p>  The room may generally not supply water for some time, so taking a shower here is problematic.  Having negotiated with the hotel‚Äôs administration, which can be located a kilometer from the guest‚Äôs place of residence, you can get towels, sheets, as well as the assurance that soon (after 2 days) you will be relocated to the best place.  But in the proposed ‚Äúbetter places‚Äù there may not be a shower and a toilet.  Reviewers report that the hotel has rooms that cannot be accommodated. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Some vacationers report that the hotel is not at all where indicated on the maps, it is located 700 meters further from the sea.  This fact is important for those whose main selection criterion was proximity to the beach. </p><h2>  Breakfast </h2><p>  For breakfast, many received nothing but toast.  In the mornings, as tourists say, food is left in a bag on the doorknob of the room.  Some report that breakfasts were not always brought to them. </p><p>  Sometimes a serving consists of thin egg pancake and toast wrapped in reusable foil.  You can drink breakfast with freshly squeezed juices (a good jus center is 8 km away) or, as the hotel staff offers, nothing. </p><p>  Every morning, you must contact the reception with a request to serve breakfast, otherwise you can not wait.  The hotel staff, according to some guests, is extremely slow. </p><p>  Residents call some places in the hotel the ‚ÄúBermuda Triangle‚Äù.  The undoubted advantage of staying in a hotel, tourists consider the presence of sun, sea and delicious fruit.  Usually, all their time, residents try to spend on the beach. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Despite all the shortcomings, however, residents note that in Anjuna, and in particular at the White Pearl Guest House, it is "really great", there is a "very pleasant atmosphere", which has a deep relaxation. </p><p>  The authors of the reviews urge in India to forget about the usual comfort, and plunge into a world of complete harmony and true peace of mind. </p>
