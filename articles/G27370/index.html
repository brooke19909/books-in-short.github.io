The plans of the attackers were to capture Ladoga.  Already on July 15, a battle took place, in which Alexander Yaroslavovich won.  The prince, having learned of the arrival of the invaders from the elders, without asking for help from Vladimir, without collecting a complete militia with his squad, attacked the Swedish camp at Izhora.  In August, the Order began an offensive from the southwest.  The Germans captured Izborsk, defeating 800 Pskovs who came to the rescue.  Then they besieged Pskov.

The prince of Novgorod approached him.  Killing more than 8 governor, he took Toropets.  After that, he sent the Novgorod warriors home.  He himself remained and drove away and defeated the Lithuanian army at Lake y≈æycki with the forces of the court.  After that, he went home.  On the way, Prince Alexander Yaroslavovich of Novgorod defeated another detachment, located under the Sanctuary.  In 1246, his father was called to Karakorum, where he was poisoned.  Almost at the same time as this event in the Horde, Mikhail Chernigovsky died, who refused a pagan rite. </p><h2>  last years of life </h2><p>  In 1262, an uprising against the Horde took place in Vladimir, Suzdal, Pereyaslavl, Rostov and a number of other cities.  In the course of it, Tatars - tribute takers were killed.  Khan Berke requested a military recruitment of Russians to repulse the attack from the side of Hulagu (Ilham Iran).  Prince Alexander Nevsky went to the Horde to dissuade the ruler from this.  The trip dragged on for almost a year.  In the Horde, Prince Alexander Nevsky fell ill.  However, he still managed to calm the khan.  Being already sick, he went back to Russia.  At home, he took the schema and began to be called Alexy.  November 14, 1963 he died.

    <h2>  Board ratings </h2><p>  As a result of a large-scale public survey of Russians in 2008, Alexander Yaroslavich Nevsky became "the name of Russia."  But in historical publications there are various assessments of his activities.  You can even meet directly opposite views on the personality of the prince.  For centuries, it was believed that his role in history was extremely significant.  Russia was going through turbulent times - they tried to attack the earth from three sides.  Alexander Nevsky was seen as the founder of the branch of Moscow tsars, he was seen as the patron saint of the Orthodox Church.  However, its canonization over time began to raise objections.  Some authors tried to prove that Nevsky was a traitor, became a Tatar gunner on Russian soil.  In a number of publications one can even find the opinion that he was glorified and canonized undeservedly.  However, there is no concrete and clear evidence for these words. </p><h2>  Canonical evaluation </h2><p>  Nevsky is regarded as a kind of golden legend of Russia in the Middle Ages.  He has not lost a single battle in his life.  Alexander showed the talents of a diplomat and commander, made peace with the most powerful, but at the same time the most tolerant enemy of Russia - the Horde.  He was able to repel the attacks of Western opponents, protecting Orthodoxy from the Catholics.  Such an assessment of activity was officially supported by both pre-revolutionary and Soviet authorities.  The idealization of Nevsky entered its zenith before the Second World War, during it, and also in the first decades after its completion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lithuanian campaign of Alexander Nevsky" class="if" height="499" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1248998.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <h2>  Eurasian Assessment </h2><p>  <span>L. Gumilev</span> saw in Alexander the architect of Russian-Horde relations.  According to the author, in 1251 the commander came to Batu, made friends, and after a while he also fraternized with the son of Khan Sartak.  In 1251, Alexander led the Tatar corps, led by Noyon Nevruy.  Thanks to the commander's diplomatic talents, it was possible to establish friendly relations not only with Batu and his son, but also with the successor to Berke.  All this contributed to an active and peaceful synthesis of the Mongol-Tatar and East Slavic cultures. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Of course, the role of Nevsky in the history of medieval Russia is extremely large.  Indeed, the commander did not lose a single battle of his own.  He enjoyed the love of the clergy, the respect of neighbors.  Alexander worked closely with Metropolitan Cyril.  They came to see the commander from the west.  One knight later told me that he had never seen a man like Nevsky in either of the princes or kings in any of the countries he visited.  A similar review, according to some evidence, was given about the commander by Batu himself.  In some chronicles there is evidence that Tatar women in the name of Alexander scared their children.  The commander provided reliable protection to the borders of the state from raids from the east and west.  For his famous feats for the glory of the Russian land, he became the most outstanding historical person of ancient history from Vladimir Monomakh to Dmitry Donskoy.  The relics of the commander on the orders of Peter the Great are stored in the Alexander Nevsky Monastery (since 1797 - the monastery). </p>
