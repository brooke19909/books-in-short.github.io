    <p>  Perhaps the main factor that influenced the popularity of the PSP is Sony‚Äôs policy.  Experts regularly analyzed the market, took into account all the wishes of the consumer.  Thus, several variations of the beloved PSP were released, each of which had unique features.  For example, the PSP E1000 series was a budget model of the device, in which there was a rather cut functionality (lack of wireless interfaces, etc.).  And in PSP GO, a sliding moment was used at all, which was not in previous models.  In turn, the <span>PSP 3000</span> boasted a new display with modern image processing.  However, in this article we will not discuss the latest versions of the console.  We‚Äôll talk about the forefather of all Sony laptops - PSP 1008. Want to know more about this console?  Welcome to this article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  For the first time at Sony, they thought about releasing their own portable console back in 1997.  Then PocketStation entered the Japanese market, however, sales were quite low, and a year later the production of the set-top box ceased (it was for this reason that the console did not enter the European market).  Due to the failure at Sony, the idea was postponed with the release of a fee for the long run. </p>

    <p>  The lull continued until 2003.  It was then that ‚ÄúSony‚Äù at the E3 gaming exhibition announced that it was developing a portable gaming device called the PlayStation Portable.  A prototype console has not yet been submitted.  However, Sony has published a lot of information about the technical characteristics of the new gadget.

Thanks to what PSP possessed incredible (by the standards of 2004) performance?  You will find the answer to this question below. </p><h2>  PSP 1008: specifications </h2><p>  On board the 1008 is an incredibly powerful processor labeled CXD2962GG.  This beast was developed internally by the best Sony specialists.  When it was created, unique technologies were used that belonged to the company.  Thanks to this, the PSP 1008 had no competitors in terms of performance.

    <p>  <span>Full dominance of</span> memory bandwidth was also supported by the multimedia processor.  A video card labeled CXD1876 was also developed in the bowels of the company.  Its power could vary from 1 to 333 MHz.  Together with the processor, the CXD1876 provided amazing computing power.  The PSP 1008 motherboard carried out an uninterrupted relationship between components.  Thanks to this, the data were processed and displayed on the screen in a matter of fractions of seconds without any lags, braking. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The display of the device is also worthy of attention.  A widescreen TFT LCD (4.3-inch size) was installed on the PSP 1008.  He could reproduce more than 16 million colors.  Another advantage of the screen is the support of four brightness levels.  Thanks to all this, the PSP showed amazing and high-quality images.  Pixelization was completely invisible. </p><h2>  Sound and battery </h2><p>  Great and clear sound is provided by the built-in speakers.

    <p>  The new Sony gadget made a splash in the console market and did not cause any complaints.  Users and even popular gaming magazines rampantly praised the brand new PSP.  The main advantage that thousands of customers have noticed is compactness.  The new gadget, despite the powerful hardware, has a rather modest size.  The device fit into a backpack, bag and even pocket without any problems.  The gadget weighed about 300 grams, so fatigue in the hands was not felt even during long gaming sessions. </p><p>  Another advantage of the Sony PlayStation PSP 1008 is multimedia.  In those days, many thought that the prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãneeded for games, the player for music, the TV for films, etc. The brand new PSP made a real break in the template.  Through the console, it was possible to consume information in various formats.  Tired of playing?  Not a problem.  After all, using PSP, you can watch the series, etc. </p><p>  It is impossible not to say about the computing capabilities of the device.  At that time, the PSP 1008 was the most powerful portable gaming device.  Why, PSP could give odds even to some stationary consoles (for example, PlayStation One).  Thanks to the powerful stuffing, PSP could launch demanding games. </p>

    <p>  As for games, then in this regard, the portable is all right.  Many users enjoyed genre diversity.  Through PSP, you could play shooters, races, fighting games, arcades, puzzles, simulations and much more.  Well and exclusives became a cherry on a cake.  "Sony" actively negotiated with various development studios and agreed on the release of the game for the PSP.  Thus, you can enjoy projects such as GTA: Liberty City Stories, MGS: Peace Walker, God of War: Chains of Olympus only with the help of PSP. </p><h2>  PSP now </h2><p>  At the moment, the release of PSP 1008 is stopped, and the console went out of sale.  The fact is that the prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãout of date.  She is more than 10 years old, and this is considered to be the retirement age in the gaming industry.  However, this is not a reason to refuse to purchase this console.  Although the console is not able to run modern games, it has a lot of noteworthy projects.  In addition, the PSP 1008 firmware allows you to download games for free.  <span>What is firmware?</span>  How to flash PSP 1008?  You can find the answers to all these questions below. </p><h2>  Firmware </h2><p>  Speaking in a popular language, firmware is a replacement for the operating system on the device.  Any gadget (including PSP) consists of hardware and OS.  And if the components are the body of the console, then the operating system is its mind, the consciousness that regulates all processes.  The official PSP 1008 firmware prohibits the use of unlicensed, hacked games.  However, this system is fairly easy to get around.  You just need to demolish the standard firmware and install a pirated one.  The essence of pirated firmware is that it lacks a verification system.  Thanks to this, you can download games directly from the torrent and install them on your console using a flash drive. </p>

    <p>  Installing the new firmware is quite simple.  All that is needed is a hacked OS and, in fact, the console itself.  The pirated operating system for the PSP and all adjacent can be easily found on the World Wide Web.  Inexperienced users often have problems with the PSP 1008 firmware. The instructions in this, of course, will not help.  But finding a detailed description of the process is not so difficult, and those who do not dare to start flashing on their own can always turn to specialists for help.  Professional advice will help in difficult situations. </p><p>  If you do not want to waste your time, then you can contact specialized centers.  In stores that sell consoles and games, there is always a person involved in reinstalling operating systems.  For a small amount, he can reflash the console in a couple of minutes.  If in your city there are no gaming stores, then you can contact the local radio market. </p>
