    <p>  In the evenings, live music is played in the hotel restaurants, and in the later hours a radiant dance floor with incendiary music opens for everyone.  Every day, animated and various other entertaining shows are held. </p><h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  According to many operators, the tourist complex is one of the best places for a comfortable stay with affordable prices, which can be explained by the location of the hotel in the newest tourist zone, where the infrastructure, nightlife and entertainment outside the walls of the complex are not as well developed as in popular resorts Sousse and Hammamet. </p><p>  The average price of a tour at Golden Tulip Mahdia Palace Thalasso 5 * per person for a stay of seven days in a double standard room is 17 384 rubles.  You can save money through early booking, charter flights and the purchase of a last-minute package at a travel agency. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Without a doubt, one of the best tourist complexes in Tunisia can be considered the hotel Mahdia Palace Thalasso.  Photos of travelers confirm this: a beautiful beach with golden dunes, a beautiful well-groomed interior, excellent service.  Reviews of resort guests are mostly positive, but negative ones can be found. </p><p>  Tourists note the quality service, good and fast work of the staff, excellent food, well-groomed territory, a wide range of types of entertainment and sports, the presence of a modern SPA complex and thalassotherapy, a large number of attractions in the city. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, hotel guests distinguish a small territory, a great distance from the main international airports and the lack of developed urban infrastructure, since the complex is located in a quiet and calm city.  However, for couples with small children, such a minus can turn out to be a big plus. </p>
