Wood Burning for Beginners</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Wood burning is an art that first appeared at the end of the last century in the capital of Russia.  Initially, this technique was used to make nesting dolls.  Subsequently, this method of <span>artistic processing of wood</span> was called pyrography. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The first apparatuses that were intended for burning turned out to be imperfect.  They worked on gasoline, which heated a platinum needle.  In order to maintain a constant temperature, the person involved in the burning, had to constantly pump gasoline using the foot pedal.  Although the process was time-consuming, pyrography became more and more popular every day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Woodburning" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14723/380984.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Basically, the technique was used to make nesting dolls, it was only after many years that drawings for burning on wood became more diverse and beautiful.  As nesting dolls became more and more popular, labor-intensive pyrography had to be abandoned, and painting replaced it.  But they did not forget about burning, and now this technique has been used to decorate caskets, caskets and other wooden objects. </p><h2>  Modern appliance </h2>

    <p>  Burning wood for beginners has become a very simple and affordable technique after an electric device was invented.  Now it could be used to decorate leather, bone, paper and other materials. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The structure of the simplest electric burner includes: a step-down transformer, a rheostat, handles and replaceable filament, which are also called pins.  Professionals recommend replacing the rheostat with a laboratory transformer, which makes it possible to obtain high-quality burns of different tones. </p><p>  Burning wood at home involves the use of a factory-made school appliance.  Such an electric burner is mainly used for contour and tonal patterns. </p><h2>  Wood Burning for Beginners </h2><p>  In order not to be disappointed the first time in your skills and pyrography in general, you need to know all the subtleties of this type of needlework.  For the picture you need to take soft hardwood, for example, aspen, linden, poplar, etc. It is also worth considering the fact that some wood species can ignite at a temperature of about 150 degrees, while others withstand about 250 degrees.  Therefore, it is better to choose a soft material, so the firing process will be easier and faster. </p><p>  If you want to make a more complex picture, then for this it is worth using <span>carbon paper.</span>  In addition, it must be borne in mind that in order to keep the surface of the tree clean and tidy, you can use the method used by real masters.  To begin with, pictures for burning on wood are transferred to <span>tissue paper.</span>  Then, with the help of glue from starch or flour, paste it on the wood itself.  The actual burning process needs to be done on tissue paper.  When the painting is finished, the paper is carefully removed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  You need to start mastering the pyrography technique with some kind of light and uncomplicated drawing, for which complex pins are not needed.  By this concept we mean brackets of different sizes made of <span>nichrome wire,</span> which can be in diameter from 0.3 to 1.5 mm.  To make the pin, you need to cut the wire and use the pliers or round-nose pliers to give them the desired shape.  To make it more rigid, the wire must first be hammered.  Although you can not complicate the task, and in a specialized store to buy a set of different pins. </p><h2>  Important aspects </h2><ol><li>  Wood burning should start after the pin is hot and a small tongue of flame is visible from it, which should not be accompanied by smoke.  In this case, you can conclude that gasoline is of high quality, the device works perfectly and the temperature for burning is optimal. </li><li>  If the flame is extinguished, and you smell burning, then, most likely, the ventilation hole is clogged. </li><li>  When the tip of the pin is heated unevenly, this indicates that the gasoline you use is of poor quality or there is insufficient heat in the spirit lamp. </li><li>  If during the period of work you needed to take a long break and the tip has cooled, do not heat it again by blowing in air saturated with gasoline vapors, as this can lead to clogging. </li><li>  It is very important to clean the pin of toxins during the burning period, since it will work poorly, cool down, and the pattern will turn out to be bad and messy.  It is impossible to clean it with a knife or other metal object, since this can damage and spoil the pin. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Burning techniques </h2><p>  You must understand that the lines of the burner cannot be erased like a pencil, so there should not be any mistakes or blots in your work.  To avoid such problems, it is recommended to attach the wood obliquely.  The hand in which you will hold the burner must have good support.  In this case, you can draw straight lines, and they will not go to the side.  In addition, it is recommended to complete the entire drawing in one sitting.  If you don‚Äôt have so much time, then at least start by making a <span>contour of the picture,</span> and after a certain period of time, the background. </p><h2>  Wood Burning: Important Rules </h2><p>  To get a beautiful and vibrant pattern, it is recommended to use lines of different thicknesses and shades.  The first aspect depends on the speed of the hot pin, that is, the faster you move the device, the thinner the line will be, and vice versa.  To control the hue, it is necessary to control the supplied air and the temperature of the tip: the larger it is, the darker the line.  To quickly cool the pin, you need to touch it to a cold stone surface, for example, it can be marble, brick or granite.  The device for burning wood must be used like a pencil, that is, it should move easily, without any pushing and braking. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wood burning pictures" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14723/380983.jpg?1398334791338" width="600"></div></h2><p>  At the beginning and end of the line you need to be especially careful, as you can ruin the picture.  At an angle, strokes need to start from the top and do not burn immediately to full depth.  For starters, it is recommended to work with a chisel and only then finish with a pin.  To make strokes, the device must be flat.  In order to decorate the background, you can use pins with curly tips. </p>
