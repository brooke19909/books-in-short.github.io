    <h2>  Where is </h2><p>  Hotel Novi 3 * (Montenegro) is located in the famous resort of Igalo on the <span>Adriatic coast.</span>  Just a few kilometers away is a large city - Herceg Novi.  Its historic center can be reached in half an hour.  Also, from here it is literally within easy reach of the border with Croatia.  So, the distance to Dubrovnik is only 30 kilometers.  Getting to Igalo is convenient both from Tivat airport (about 40 minutes) and from Dubrovnik's air harbor (it will take about the same time, but you will need a national Croatian or Schengen visa).  You can travel from Igalo to other cities of Montenegro by bus, taxi or rented car.  As for the beach, the Novi Hotel does not have it.  The nearest beach is only one and a half hundred meters and is famous for its healing mud. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Novi 3 * <span>(Montenegro): reviews of</span> tourists from Russia </h2><p>  In order for your impression of the Novi Hotel located in Igalo (Montenegro) to be more complete and reliable, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the opinions of our compatriots who have already had a chance to relax here this year.  Looking ahead a bit, we note that most of the reviews from tourists are positive.  However, there are also a few negative ones (however, as is the case with other hotels).  But we offer to understand everything in order. </p><p>  As for the hotel itself, it is quite new and built in a modern style.  The rooms and apartments of our compatriots seemed cozy and fairly spacious.  In addition, they had everything they needed.  By the way, furniture and appliances are modern, which many tourists did not expect from a three-star hotel, which is far from the richest European country. </p><p>  As for the cleaning of the rooms Novi 3 * (Montenegro), then the guests in general were satisfied with its quality.  True, sometimes the maids forgot to replace bed linen or replenish supplies of toiletries on time, but contacting the reception quickly solved all the problems. </p>

    <p>  Since we touched on the topic of maids, we suggest finding out the opinion of travelers about the hotel staff as a whole.  So, many tourists note that the hotel staff are very working and friendly.  True, sometimes due to the large influx of guests they do not have time to do everything on time, but our compatriots do not blame it on the staff, but on the hotel owners, who did not take care of hiring a sufficient number of employees.  As for knowledge of the Russian language, only a few speak it.  But you can always explain in the Serbian language, as it is much like Russian.  In addition, the hotel almost always has a Russian-speaking guide, which you can contact on any issue. </p><p>  As for the territory of the Novi 3 * hotel (Montenegro), traveler reviews describe it as small.  There is no pool and special entertainment infrastructure.  However, according to tourists, this is quite normal for small European hotels.  Pleased guests with the location of the hotel.  So, you can reach the sea in just a couple of minutes.  Also in the vicinity of the hotel there are restaurants, supermarkets and small shops. </p><p>  Fairly controversial reviews received food at the hotel.  So, according to many guests, the food here was tasty and of high quality.  The choice of dishes, of course, cannot be compared with four- or five-star hotels in Turkey and Egypt, but it was impossible to stay hungry.  Every day, guests were offered meat and fish dishes.  Some tourists were dissatisfied with the choice of dishes and argue that the hotel should pay more attention to the issue of food. </p><p>  In general, experienced travelers recommend that people planning to stay in Novi 3 * (Montenegro) do not pay for all-inclusive meals by choosing the option ‚Äúbreakfast only‚Äù.  In this case, you will always have the opportunity to go for lunch and dinner to the surrounding taverns, where for more than an affordable price you can try a variety of dishes of the national Montenegrin cuisine. </p><p>  As for the beach, you can reach it in just a couple of minutes.  It is sandy here and has a gentle entry into the water.  The local beach is famous for its healing mud.  Therefore, the water here, according to tourists, is unclear.  However, lovers of mud smeared with healing mud, as well as families with children who are happy to play sand on the beach, will surely like it here.  If you want to relax on the beach with cleaner water, then you only need to take a little walk along the coast. </p><p>  As for entertainment, the Novi Hotel, like most Montenegro hotels, does not offer guests an animation program.  Mostly people come here in search of a calm, measured beach holiday away from the bustle of the city.  Therefore, this hotel is perfect for family tourists with children of different ages, as well as older people. </p><p>  Young people, accustomed to a stormy vacation, will be bored here, according to experienced tourists.  For this category of travelers it is recommended to choose hotels in Herceg Novi or Budva.  In addition, seasoned tourists strongly recommend that anyone who spends their holidays in Montenegro should definitely go on excursions.  You can do this both on a rented car, and as part of an excursion group.  Moreover, Montenegro can offer a lot of interesting places to visit not only on the Adriatic coast, but also inland (there are the famous <span>Skadar Lake, the</span> Durmitor National Park, the modern and historical capital of the state (Podgorica and Cetinje) and many other attractions). </p><p>  In general, summing up, we can say that the Novi 3 * hotel (Montenegro, Hercegnovsk Riviera), according to tourists from Russia, is a good place for a measured family holiday on the Adriatic Sea, offering comfortable accommodation and good service. </p>
