    <p>  The modern hotel complex is located in the quite popular center of Dubai called Deira.  Just a few steps away is the business center of the city, as well as shopping malls, shops and the largest shopping center.  The distance to the airport is only 5 km, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about a long trip.  And the Syaj Hotel provides its guests with a direct transfer - you will be on its territory a few minutes after leaving the airport building. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel is a large seven-story building, which, like almost all new buildings in Dubai, was built in an interesting modern style.  With a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout a thousand square meters, this is an urban-style hotel.  By the way, it was built in 2006.  The last major restoration was carried out here not so long ago, in 2013. </p><h2>  What do hotel rooms look like? </h2>

    <p>  This hotel by the standards of Dubai is quite small - there are 61 rooms on its territory.  These are standard rooms, which nevertheless pleasantly amaze with freshness, modern decor and neat design.  You can count on a comfortable bed, clean linen and a set of furniture is needed.  The room has its own balcony, from which you can enjoy the incredible panorama of the city (especially if your room is located on one of the upper floors). </p><p>  There is also a home appliance, without which comfort is hard to imagine.  You can use air conditioning and a telephone, and on TV you can watch the most interesting satellite channels.  For an additional fee you will be connected to the Internet, which is also important.  Also, guests use the safe for free, but you will have to pay extra for drinks from the minibar. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An individual room will also please with cleanliness and, of course, modern plumbing.  You can take a shower at any time of the day, as water is supplied constantly.  The stocks of gels, shampoos and soaps replenish constantly.  Every day, you can count on clean towels and thoroughly wet room cleaning. </p><h2>  Are there catering establishments on the territory? </h2>

    <p>  It's no secret that many tourists visit the country in search of a beach holiday.  What can the Syaj Hotel 2 * offer in this beach?  Dubai is a city that is famous not only for its developed infrastructure, but also for miles of well-groomed beaches.  The distance to the sea shore is about a kilometer.  Immediately worth saying that the hotel does not provide a shuttle service to the beach.  Nevertheless, the sea can be easily reached by bus or taxi. </p><p>  The beach here is big and long.  This is a <span>public place,</span> and quite often it is crowded.  Sun loungers, umbrellas and mattresses are issued for an additional fee, but, by the way, their price is not so high.  On the shore there are lots of bars and cafes where you can buy chilled drinks or a snack. </p><p>  Naturally, tourists who prefer active water recreation will also not be bored.  You can ride on water transport, take an exciting boat or yacht trip, go sailing, enjoy windsurfing and even join a beach volleyball team. </p><h2>  Does the hotel offer additional services? </h2>
