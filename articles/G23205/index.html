It is dedicated to the study of birds, their taxonomy, physiology, reproduction.  The geographical distribution and morphology of these animals is also being studied. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  The term was introduced at the end of the 16th century by the Italian naturalist U. Aldrovani.  Literally, "ornithology" is translated from Greek as the doctrine of birds (ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ - word, doctrine and ·ΩÑœÅŒΩŒπŒ∏ŒøœÇ - bird).  Thus, it becomes clear <span>what the</span> "profession of ornithologist" is.  One of the main tasks of the researcher is the systematization of species, the number of animals in the environment, their classification.  Of particular importance are the protection of rare species.  There is also a separate specialization - an ornithologist.  This activity involves the treatment of feathered individuals, including those kept at home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who is an ornithologist" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/359993.jpg" width="433"></div>

    <h2>  Objects of study </h2><p>  Birds belong to the class of vertebral ovipositing, feathered, warm-blooded animals.  Their forelimbs are represented as wings.  The special body structure allows animals to fly.  However, today there are many types of flightless individuals.  A distinctive feature of birds is the presence of a beak.  According to ornithologists, today there are more than 9800 birds.  About 600 species are distributed throughout Russia.  Because of this number, birds are considered the most common superclass group of tetrapods.  Animals inhabit all <span>continents of the Earth,</span> including Antarctica.  The smallest feathered individual is considered to be a hummingbird-bee (its size is about 5.7 cm).  The largest representative of the class is an <span>African ostrich</span> (grows up to 270 cm).  Archeopteryx (lived about 150 million years ago) and maniraptor dinosaurs (about 80 million years ago) are considered the ancestors of modern birds.  The groups of birds existing today belong to the infraclass of fan-tailed birds.  It, in turn, is divided into 2 categories: <span>flightless birds</span> (ratites) and other species (newborn). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what an ornithologist does" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/359996.jpg?1395753105465" width="500"></div>

When did people first start exploring birds?  The beginning of the development of science was laid by Aristotle.  It was he who first began to systematize animal species known at that time.  Aristotle lived in the 4th century  BC  e.  He created the works "On the parts of animals" and "On the emergence of animals."  Working on them, the ancient Greek scientist identified a separate genus of birds, describing the anatomy and life of 160 of their species.  This classification of Aristotle was far from perfect, but did not change until the 17th century.  Only in 1676, Francis Willoughby (English biologist) created the manuscript "Ornithologiae libri tres", which was published after his death by the scientist John Ray. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ornithologist" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/359995.jpg?1395753122512" width="450"></div>  After almost a century, in 1758, the work of Willoughby found its continuation in the famous treatise "The System of Nature" by Karl Linnaeus.  The Swedish naturalist distributed the animals according to hierarchical categories and formed a binomial nomenclature with species designations.  According to his classification, all birds were divided into six orders, which included 554 species from the existing 78 genera.  This systematization (almost unchanged) is applied today.  Linnaeus also developed an ornithophenology technique used in the study of <span>migratory birds.</span>  All the basic information about birds of that time was summarized by the scientist and writer J. Buffon.  He published a work in ten volumes <span>, The History of Birds.</span>  Since that time, everything that concerns these birds is explored by an ornithologist.  What does a scientist do to gather the necessary information?  About it - further. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what the ornithologist studies" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/359994.jpg?1395753141583" width="450"></div>

First of all, it is an observer.  One of the most affordable ways to study feathered individuals, their habits and life in general is observation.  It can be carried out with the naked eye.  But, as a rule, special equipment is used.  After all, who is an ornithologist?  This is a scientist, mainly.  Researchers use video cameras, cameras, binoculars and more.  It should be noted that observation is not only the prerogative of specialists.  Today it is a fairly common hobby.  Surveillance allows you to take measures to ensure the protection of rare species.  In addition to visual examination, birds are also listening.  In many cases, this can provide more information than observation. </p>

    <h2>  Banding </h2><p>  What does an ornithologist do to track bird migrations?  Banding - a method of ornithological research - has been used for over a hundred years.  Caught in the net birds put on a special aluminum or plastic (bright color) ring on the foot.  Sometimes a serial number is affixed to the device.  The ringing method allows you to accurately track the routes of seasonal migration of birds, to make a habitat for each specific area.  In addition, birds can be carriers of various diseases.  In this regard, tracking routes using the ring method is of particular importance.  Using this method, among other things, the estimated number of individuals is calculated.  The work at the world level is coordinated by the International Committee on the Banding and its European Section (Euring), formed in 1962 by the ornithologist Echekopar in Paris.  Essential in the work of Euring is the study of questions on the unification of the methods of collecting, processing and storing information. </p><h2>  The practical significance of science </h2><p>  Vital activity of birds, classification, migration, distribution, morphology - in general, everything that is studied by an ornithologist is of particular economic importance today.  Due to increased speeds and an increase in the volume of transport and passenger traffic, the number of aircraft and bird collisions has sharply increased.  In the process of developing uninhabited territories, people began to more often come into contact with feathered individuals, many of which are carriers of pathogens of dangerous diseases of both farm animals and humans.  In addition, hunting areas began to need regular forecasting and monitoring of migration and bird numbers. </p>

    <h2>  Development of science </h2><p>  Returning to the question of who such an ornithologist, it can be argued that today it is primarily a specialist, whose activity involves knowledge not only in the field of biology.  At the present stage, the protection and ecology of birds inevitably provides for international cooperation and the association of researchers from different countries.  So, for example, since 1963, meetings have been regularly held at which representatives of aviation departments and ornithologists meet.  In the development of science, both earlier and at present, international cooperation is of great importance. </p><h2>  Ornithology today </h2><p>  Currently, specialized centers and training institutes are working all over the world.  In addition, about two hundred journals devoted to the latest achievements in the field of ornithology are published.  It should be noted that some of the publications are purely scientific, and some are environmental and popular.  By tradition, publications issued in a particular country are called the most popular feathered specimen.  For example, in 1852, Ibis has been published in England, and Journal fur Ornithologie has been published in Germany since 1857.  Ornithological communities are of great importance in coordinating the work of scientists, many of which have been working since the middle of the last century. </p>
