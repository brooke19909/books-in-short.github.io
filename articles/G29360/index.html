    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Hilton Hurghada Long Beach Resort is twenty kilometers from the resort center of Hurghada and about a quarter hour from the airport.  Right outside the gate is a supermarket where you can buy alcohol, fruits, baby food, souvenirs.  The hotel is adjacent to the famous complexes "Titanic Resort", "Coral Beach Rotana" and "Golden Live".  If you approach the last one (and before it takes about a quarter of an hour to move at a slow pace), then on both sides you can see the rows of shops.  Near the gates of the hotel minibuses stop where you can leave for the center of Hurghada.  Near the hotel there is a diving center "Sadko", in which Russian instructors work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hurghada </h2><p>  For more than twenty years, our compatriots have come to this resort.  The annals of travel agencies say that the first charter to the Hurghada airport arrived from Russia in 1993.  Since then, the popularity of these places only increases in the ranking.  And many vacationers seek to buy permits in the direction of "Egypt, Hurghada."  Hilton Hurghada Long Beach Resort 4 * is one of the hotels where the flow of tourists is growing every year.  Although these places were considered forgotten by God back in the sixties of the last century, now there is the residence of the governor of the province.  In the Old Town, which is called El Dahar, mostly local people live, and tourists go here on excursions and shopping at the souvenir and grocery markets.  The new center, or Sakkala, is built in a modern way.  Apartments for rent here, McDonalds and resort hotels.  Here are the famous night clubs of Hurghada, its fish restaurants and supermarkets with fixed prices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hilton hurghada long beach resort 4 reviews" class="if" height="227" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/732519.jpg" width="600"></div>  Farther south stretched the promenade, along which stretched luxury hotels located on the first line.  On this pedestrian zone, tourists love to walk in the evening.  And the farthest area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe so-called "Little Hurghada", which is actually a huge coastal zone forty kilometers long, consists of four and five star hotels.  Here, the newest and most fashionable hotels are mainly located.  Hilton Hurghada Long Beach Resort 4 * in Hurghada is located here.  Therefore, on the one hand, it‚Äôs far to get to the city center, and on the other hand, the entire infrastructure of the resort complex is ‚Äúimprisoned‚Äù for tourists.

A beauty salon, spa, sports grounds, a business center, a conference room are all at the services of vacationers or organizations that order seminars.  Hilton Hurghada Long Beach Resort has its own discotheque, and therefore tourists do not have to travel to Hurghada to have fun.  Since the territory, as already mentioned, is large, and vacationers often walk and take pictures there, they sometimes forget things in different places - wraps, cameras, purses with money.  The staff takes it all and gives it away when you contact the staff.  No thefts were observed.

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p> Hotel Hilton Hurghada Long Beach Resort 4 * (Hurghada) offers tourists many trips.  First of all, this is the already mentioned bus to the city center.  Most vacationers go there for a walk, as well as to the market for fruit.  It is cheap enough.  For example, mangoes can be bought for three dollars per kilogram, strawberries for two, melons for one.  But the trip to Hurghada is also quite interesting (unless, of course, you come across a guide who is an expert in his field, and not just a ‚Äúcart carrier‚Äù).  Indeed, in the Old Town you can see the Coptic church, visit the villa of the former King of Egypt Farouk, an aquarium.  And after a sightseeing tour you can better navigate in Hurghada.  From the hotel you can go on longer trips.  This is a desert jeep or ATV safari, Venice in the Sands - a trip to <span>El Gouna,</span> and an excursion to Cairo.  The latter may seem heavy and tedious - still five hours there and as much back, although on very comfortable buses.  But how many impressions awaits you!  The famous Cairo National Museum, Alabaster Mosque and <span>Coptic Church,</span> a boat trip on the Nile, and, of course, the Giza pyramids and the mysterious Sphinx.  About where to buy excursions, opinions of vacationers were divided.  Some advise hotel tour operators, others suggest taking travel "on the street" - the program is the same, but half the price. </p><h2>  Hilton Hurghada Long Beach Resort (Egypt, Hurghada) - Reviews </h2><p>  This hotel is called a family hotel and is very suitable for children.  She is praised for the large and green area, hospitality and service.  The tourists who live here are mainly couples, people are very cultural and intelligent.  Food vacationers call insanely delicious.  She is especially appreciated by people who often went abroad on vacation - in the same Egypt or in other countries.  They have something to compare.  They write that they felt very comfortable at this hotel.  No one molested, did not impose their goods, no rudeness.  On the contrary, everyone is delicate and polite.  The kids club employs top-quality professionals.  The staff is very friendly.  In general, the service at the hotel is aerobatics.  For Egypt, this is a very good and pleasant hotel, it justifies its money.  By the way, if you register in advance on the Hilton website, then upon arrival you will not be given a white bracelet, like everyone else, but orange.  Some travel agencies can help you get into the VIP category at the Hilton Hurghada Long Beach Resort.  Apltravel is one of them.  And thanks to registration, you can enjoy various privileges (for example, fruits in the room, filling the minibar with cola, fanta, sprite, free daily access to the Podium restaurant √† la carte, gifts upon departure, and so on).  Many believe that this hotel even deserves the "five", and its current rating is underestimated.  For this price range, the best hotel is hard to imagine.  Here couples in love, families with children, and young people can relax.  For each category, there is entertainment for everyone.  Maybe that's why most vacationers want to come back here again. </p>
