    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Upper mamon" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1206947.jpg"></div>  The official date of foundation of the Upper Mamon is considered to be 1702.  It is believed that it was then that the outpost of the Ostrogozhsky regiment appeared on the Mamonka River.  According to some, the original settlement was called Mamodynovy.  There are historical documents that state that in 1731 the village had its own temple.  In 1771, the Kazan Church was built.  The neighboring villages on the banks of the Don - Osetrovka and Lower Mamon - were founded by settlers from the Upper Mamon closer to the middle of the eighteenth century.  These settlements exist today.  According to the ‚Äúcensus‚Äù for 1798, Upper Mamon is a village in which 1368 men and 1401 women permanently resided.  During the existence <span>of the settlement, the population</span> increased.  As of 2010, about 8,500 people live in Upper Mamon.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Upper Mamon Voronezh region" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1206946.jpg"></div>  In the ancient Greek language there was the word "Mamas", which literally can be translated into modern Russian as "property" or "condition".  What is noteworthy, the Greeks borrowed it from the Hebrew language.  The word "mammon" came to the Russian language from ancient Greek, meaning already "natural wealth" or "treasures of the earth."  It is from this definition that the river Mamonovka got its name.  According to historical evidence, in ancient times, local lands were fertile, many different animals lived in the forests.  It is not surprising that the new settlement was named Upper Mamon.

    <h2>  The history of the village during the Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  This settlement is also known as the place of military glory of Soviet soldiers during the Great Patriotic War.  In December 1942, Operation ‚ÄúSmall Saturn‚Äù was launched near the village - Red Army soldiers launched an offensive.  Soviet soldiers managed to cope with the task, the enemy‚Äôs defense was broken, and just before the New Year‚Äôs it was possible to free all occupied settlements in the area.  But, despite such a successful military operation, the village of Verkhny Mamon recalls not only the heroic feat of Soviet soldiers.  For all the time of the Great Patriotic War, more than 1,500 soldiers born in this village died on the front. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Interesting facts about Upper Mamon </h2>
