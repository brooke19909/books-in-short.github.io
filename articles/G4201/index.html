  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vegas hotels: comfort and uniqueness in everything</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Las Vegas is not just an American city where income levels are slightly higher than in other states of the country.  This is a whole separate world, a state in a state.  People from all over the world come here to recklessly spend several days, try their luck at the best casinos in the world, fall in love and get married right away, see unforgettable shows.  However, Vegas hotels, like the whole city, are all the luxury and wastefulness of mankind, it is here that there are numerous casinos and restaurants, it is here that the life of the city flows. </p><p>  Almost all the largest and most famous hotels are located on the Strip, which is recognized as the main one in this city.  As part of the ongoing City Center project, more and more hotels are constantly opening, surpassing each other in the breadth of design ideas and the amount of money invested in them.  Among them are such Vegas hotels as Aria, Mandarin Oriental, Vdara. </p><p>  Perhaps Mandarin Oriental can be safely attributed to the best hotels not only in Las Vegas, but also in the world.  It is located on Strip Street.  This hotel impresses with its luxurious design in oriental style, as well as cozy spacious rooms, which harmoniously combine technical innovations and a unique interior designed by designer Adam Tihani.  All this, combined with two restaurants, a fitness center, a yoga room, a spa, makes a vacation in Vegas not only unforgettable, but also as comfortable as possible. </p><p>  A favorite destination for world-class stars is the <span>Hard Rock</span> Hotel and Casino featuring HRH Tower Suites, located near the airport, Clark County Library and the University of Nevada.  A distinctive feature of the design of this hotel was rock and roll theme, which means a huge neon guitar on its facade.  By the way, Jimi Hendricks, Guns N 'Roses, the Rolling Stones, Kid Rock and many other celebrities loved to spend their free time here.  In addition to chic rooms equipped with the latest engineering ideas, there is an indoor pool, a sauna, a fitness center, the opportunity to ride a horse and play golf.  Such Vegas hotels as this one will be enjoyed not only by young drinkers, but also by couples with children, for whom cribs, a stroller rental and a special children's menu in restaurants are provided. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the territory of Hard Rock Hotel and Casino there are several restaurants, billiards, of course, a casino, a conference hall, and souvenir shops.  The level of service meets the highest standards of tourism and hotel business, so every day hotel guests receive fresh newspapers, cleaning is done twice a day.  In addition to the fact that the rooms themselves are masterpieces, there are designer accessories in every bathroom. </p><p>  Basically, all the reviews about Vegas hotels are positive, but this is not surprising, because a city of this format simply cannot afford boring hotels of the same type, the staff in which would have no idea about their responsibilities.  Before looking for cheap Vegas hotels, you should carefully read their description and rating of those people who have stayed in them.  Such savings can lead to the fact that at best the client will be simply deceived by the company, and at worst will spend several days in a hotel that vividly resembles an overnight stay with the corresponding contingent.  It is interesting that a person with an average income will be able to afford to stay in luxury hotels, if only just decide on a month of rest.  The fact is that the price of a room varies throughout the year, so you can easily save about 50% of the cost if you go to relax in Vegas at a certain time.  You can reserve a place online, and then confirm your reservation by contacting the selected hotel.  The time spent in Las Vegas cannot be compared with anything, and the best hotels in this city, which are open for any guest around the clock, will be able to provide maximum comfort, interesting show programs and gambling. </p>
