However, like many other important discoveries in various fields of science.  But which of the scientists first discovered the phenomenon of radioactivity and how did this happen?

    <p>  This very important event for science occurred in 1896 and was made by A. Becquerel while studying the possible connection between luminescence and the recently discovered so-called x-rays. </p><p>  According to the memoirs of Becquerel himself, he came up with the idea that maybe any luminescence is also accompanied by x-rays?  In order to verify his guess, he used several chemical compounds, including one of the uranium salts, which glowed in the dark.  Then, holding it in the sun, the scientist wrapped the salt in dark paper and put it in a cabinet on a photographic plate, which, in turn, was also packed in a lightproof wrapper.  Later, showing it, Becquerel replaced the exact image of a piece of salt.  But since luminescence could not overcome the paper, it means that it was the x-ray radiation that illuminated the plate.  So now we know who first discovered the phenomenon of radioactivity.  True, the scientist himself did not yet fully understand what discovery he made.  But first things first. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Academy of Sciences meeting </h2>

    <p>  Later that year, at one of the meetings at the Academy of Sciences of Paris, Becquerel made a report "On radiation produced by phosphorescence."  But after some time, his theory and conclusions had to be adjusted.  So, during one of the experiments, without waiting for good and sunny weather, the scientist put on the photographic plate a compound of uranium, which was not irradiated with light.  Nevertheless, the clear structure was still reflected on the plate. </p><p>  On the second of March of that year, Becquerel presented a new work to the Academy of Sciences, which talked about the radiation emitted by phosphorescent bodies.  Now we know which of the scientists discovered the phenomenon of radioactivity. </p><h2>  Further experiments </h2>

    <p>  Carrying out further studies of the phenomenon of radioactivity, Becquerel tried many substances, including metallic uranium.  And every time there were always traces on the photographic plate.  And by placing a metal cross between the radiation source and the plate, the scientist received, as they would say now, his X-ray image.  So we examined the question of who discovered the phenomenon of radioactivity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It was then that it became clear that Becquerel discovered a completely new type of invisible rays that can pass through any objects, but at the same time they were not X-ray. </p><p>  It was also found that the intensity of <span>radiation</span> depends on the amount of uranium in chemical preparations, and not on their types.  It was Becquerel who shared his scientific achievements and theories with the spouses Pierre and Maria Curie, who subsequently established the radioactivity emitted by thorium, and discovered two completely new elements, later called polonium and radium.  And when analyzing the question ‚Äúwho discovered the phenomenon of radioactivity‚Äù, many often mistakenly attribute this merit to the Curie spouses. </p><h2>  Impact on living organisms </h2>

    <p>  When it became known that all uranium compounds emit <span>radioactive radiation</span> , Becquerel gradually returned to the study of the phosphor.  But he managed to make another major discovery - the influence of radioactive rays on biological organisms.  So Becquerel was not only the first to discover the phenomenon of radioactivity, but also to those who established its effect on living things. </p><p>  For one lecture, he borrowed a radioactive substance from the Curie spouses and put it in his pocket.  After the lecture, returning to its owners, the scientist noticed a strong reddening of the skin, which had the form of a test tube.  <span>Pierre Curie,</span> after listening to his guesses, decided to experiment - for ten hours he carried a test tube bound to his hand containing radium.  And in the end, he got a severe ulcer that did not heal for several months. </p><p>  So we examined the question of which of the scientists first discovered the phenomenon of radioactivity.  This is how the effect of radioactivity on biological organisms was discovered.  But despite this, the Curie spouses, by the way, continued to study radiation materials, and <span>Marie Curie</span> died precisely from radiation sickness.  Her personal belongings are still kept in a special leaded storage facility, since the dose of radiation accumulated by them almost a hundred years ago is still too dangerous. </p>
