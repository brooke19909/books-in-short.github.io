Moreover, very often the choice of these people falls not on Russian health centers, but on those that are in the neighboring country of Belarus. </p><p>  There are many different resorts, and they are located in almost all regions of the country.  In Grodno, for example, there is Neman - a sanatorium specializing in a rather wide range of diseases and offering the most advanced treatment technologies. </p><h2>  For health - to Belarus </h2><p>  Many will probably be surprised: why do our compatriots choose sanatoriums not in Russia, but abroad, especially in Belarus?  The answer to this question is quite simple: very high-quality medical services are provided in this country of the former Soviet Union, while their cost is quite low. </p>

    <p>  And although in Belarus there is no sea to which you can go for healing, salty air, there is a magnificent nature here, which contributes both to raising the mood and a surge of health and vitality. </p><p>  Prices for accommodation and medical services in Belarusian resorts will pleasantly surprise many of our compatriots.  At the same time, the quality of services does not suffer at all, but, on the contrary, sometimes meets even the most overstated requirements.  Of course, there are expensive accommodation options here, but the variety of health resorts available to all segments of the population will make everyone think about which sanatorium to choose. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sanatorium in the city of Grodno </h2><p>  The Grodno sanatorium "Neman-72" exists since 1972.
