You can get to Lysy Gory by road (Saratov ‚Äì Lysaya Gora highway) and by rail (Arkatsk ‚Äì Kalininsk junction). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Based on archaeological finds and barrows, scientists concluded that ancient people lived on the banks of the Medveditsa River.  This is evidenced by numerous excavations. </p><p>  Since 1910, Ukrainian refugees lived in this territory, who, during cultivation of fields for farming, found archaeological evidence of the presence of ancient settlers here.  Some of the items found were: a <span>stone ax-hammer,</span> bronze items (ax, figurine), fragments of a saber. </p><p>  The village of Lysy Gory, the map (satellite) of which is presented below, was originally a village.  According to archival data, it was founded around 1740.  In the 19th century (in the second half) a steam mill was built in the village under the guidance of the landowner Barteniev Petr Fedorovich.  He was the last owner of the village.  In 1917, all the land of the landowners was distributed to local residents in connection with the proclamation of Soviet power. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bald mountains.

    <p>  Another attraction of the Bald Mountains is White Lake.  He is willingly visited by fishermen.  Around the lake there are recreation centers where you can stay for all visitors.

This area is located in the city of Kharkov.  Bald Mountain is adjacent to the Cold Mountain.  Between them there is a ravine, it passes along the street Nizhne-Gievskaya.  Not far from the district there are: Kharkov-Sortirovochny metro station, Oktyabr locomotive depot, and a railway line.  Neighboring areas - Zalyutino, Nakhalovka.  The streets that belong to the Lysogorsky district are Leningradskaya, Kubasova, 1905 Revolutions, Borderline, New Life, Progress, Ossetian, Elizarova, Dobrodetskaya.  The name of some streets was established by the Soviet government.  The area is located in the northwest of the city. </p><h2>  District History </h2><p>  Earlier, Bald Mountain was covered with dense forest.  It received such a name after cutting down forest trees for the construction of the bell tower of the Assumption Cathedral.  This happened in the 20s of the 19th century.  For a long time, the spring water of the district drowned the villages of Panasovka and Ivanovka.  The situation changed only in the 60s of the same century, when builders laid railway tracks and carried out drainage works. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kharkiv.

    <p>  At first, this area was populated by a poor population in 1840.  People who lived on Lysaya Gora did not have money to maintain their homes in good condition.  From the second half of the 19th century (70-80s) the area was inhabited by ordinary workers who worked at the <span>railway station.</span>  Also at that time, workers of the brewery and ceramic factories settled on Lysaya Gora. </p><p>  Since 1898, the construction of the Orthodox Church of the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God was carried out on Leningradskaya Street.  It was built in 1912 according to the project of the diocesan architect Vladimir Nemkin on the land of the rich merchant and resident of Kharkov - Konstantin Utkin.  It was he who gave the green light to the construction of the church.  He donated 3,000 rubles to it and contributed in every way to the construction work.  The church works to this day.  She never closed, it makes her unique.  Also, this church is a monument of architecture of the city of Kharkov. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, a kindergarten was opened on Lysaya Gora.  It was built for the children of workers and the simple poor and contained 100 children, which were looked after and looked after by two teachers. </p><p>  In the 20s on the top of the mountain began to build the village of Red October.  Low-rise residential buildings were built in it, the apartments of which were distributed to railway workers. </p><h2>  Current years </h2><p>  Now the Lysaya Gora area is divided into two parts: a village and a modern city.  Because of this, the area is called a place of contrasts.  Here you can purchase a variety of real estate.  In the city there are available for purchase guestrooms (from 9 to 19 sq. M.), One -, two -, three - and more room apartments.  Their price depends on the total area and housing condition.  In the village are offered for sale new individual residential buildings.  Some of them are built according to a special project. </p><p>  The main attraction here is considered the Avenue of Thieves Glory.  It is located at the 12th cemetery.  The most famous thief who is buried on him is Vasya Korzh. </p><p>  Only at the beginning of the 21st century, in the area during the land works, a cemetery was discovered for people who died from the famine in 1932-1933 of the last century.  People died on the streets of Kharkov, their corpses were demolished on the outskirts of Progress Street and buried in the ground.  Now a historical memorial has been erected at this place. </p>
