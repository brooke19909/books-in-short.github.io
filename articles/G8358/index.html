    <h2>  Reviews about the camp site </h2><p>  Picturesque places and good conditions for relaxation attract many guests who have been returning here for more than one year.  The recreation center "Kustorka" has become a favorite place not only for residents of the Nizhny Novgorod region, but also for Muscovites.  Almost every guest likes the service at the camp site, although some features were noticed.  For example, reviews show that the canteens follow the traditions of <span>Soviet catering.</span>  This means that the menu has meat dishes, pasta, borscht, cereals, but very few vegetables and fruits.  For many children and men, such nutrition is only a joy, but women understand that in the summer there should be more healthy food. </p><p>  Also, some advise you to order good rooms in the spring, for example in April.  The fact is that the base is very popular, and there are not as many rooms with all amenities as we would like. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shrub Nizhny Novgorod region" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1180984.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another point noted by vacationers was the lake, which seems a bit swampy.  Although this landscape looks picturesque, some do not dare to swim in a pond, and swim only in boats.  But if you take a walk to Pioneer Lake, which is a few kilometers from the base, you can swim in a clean but cool place.  On weekends, there are many vacationers on Pioneer Lake. </p><h2>  Other <span>recreation centers of the</span> Nizhny Novgorod region </h2><p>  But not everyone has the opportunity to go to the Kustorka, so you might think about visiting another camp site that is in the region.  For example, it can be ‚ÄúKhutorok‚Äù, ‚ÄúBoiling Key‚Äù, ‚ÄúVetluga‚Äù, which are located in no less picturesque place.  You can also visit the rest house "Vasilsursky" or the tourist village "Dubki".  All recreation centers of the Nizhny Novgorod region strive to settle down in such a place so that the time spent with them brings not only pleasure, but also recovery. </p>
