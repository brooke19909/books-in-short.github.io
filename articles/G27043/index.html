  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sights of Lysva: list, description, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Lysva is a city with a thousand-year history.  It is located in the eastern part of Perm Territory.  In fact, the city is a major center of the Urals in the field of metallurgy and electrical engineering.  The largest city is in 4th place.  The history of the city is very interesting and eventful. </p><p>  Lysva is known for the variety of attractions and helmets that were once issued in it.  Today, taking a walk along the streets of this town, you can see many beauties and buy in memory the quality enameled dishes that are produced here. </p><h2>  Interesting facts from history </h2><p>  Initially, on the territory of Lysva, the settlement appeared only in the XVII century.  The name of the city was formed from the words of Komi-Permian origin ‚ÄúLys‚Äù and ‚ÄúVa‚Äù.  The first of them means needles, and the second is the ending, very famous in the Kama region, and means "water".  Thus, you can translate the name of the city, as "water flowing along the needles."  This is not surprising, because not so long ago there were many coniferous forests around, of which only a small part has survived to this day. </p><p>  The iron foundry, which appeared in the city in 1785, passed to the Counts Shuvalov.  He was in their possession before the revolution.  It is worth noting that the unicorn on the coat of arms of the city is taken from the family coat of arms of this kind.  In the XIX century, the metallurgical plant in Lysva produced products with the stigma in the form of a unicorn, which guaranteed high quality.  The most famous product of this plant is a helmet.  One of the <span>helmets, the SS 40,</span> saved millions of lives during World War II. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What impresses guests in Lysva </h2><p>  This is a very beautiful city and there is something to see.  What is the city park named after A. S. Pushkin in Lysva, recognized as the most beautiful park in the whole region!  Even just walking along the streets of the city, you can see many interesting things, for example, how the epochs have changed.  So, walking along Peace Street, you can see how the 19th century passed into the 21st.  And some streets are entirely architectural monuments.  A striking example is Lenin Street, built in the 50s of the last century.  Like in the city and theatergoers.  They should definitely visit the Lysvensky Drama Theater. </p><p>  The main attractions of the city mainly appeared in the XIX-XX centuries.  It‚Äôs a pity that not all of them have survived to the present day, as, for example, the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Lysva, demolished in the 30s of the last century.  But the list of city attractions continues to replenish, attracting more and more tourists. </p><h2>  Museum of Local Lore </h2><div class="photo" data-original="amarok-man.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Local Lore in Lysva" class="if uuid-2959036" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2959036.jpg"></div><p>  It is with this attraction that it is recommended to begin acquaintance with the city of Lysva.  The building itself is a small wooden house, which was erected at the beginning of the XX century.  The museum presents an exhibition that displays the history of the district.  This museum is located on Peace Street. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Helmet Museum </h2><p>  This attraction has received many positive reviews from tourists.  Indeed, in this museum a huge number of helmets are collected.  Each of them has a history, and many have come here from different countries.  There is also an exposition reflecting the work of the plant during the war years.  Touching such an interesting historical moment, closely connected with the city, is worth every guest. </p><h2>  Enamelware Museum </h2><div class="photo" data-original="zavodfoto.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Enamelware Museum" class="if uuid-2961507" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/82172/2961507.jpg"></div><p>  Another museum in the neighborhood will introduce various thematic exhibitions.  It has a collection of enameled dishes made in Lysva.  Visitors are delighted with what they saw and the opportunity to even try to paint on a circle using the enamel technique on their own.  It should be emphasized that the museum building itself was built of brick in 1905, especially for Count P.P. Shuvalov. </p><h2>  Monument to Count Shuvalov </h2><div class="photo" data-original="rasfokus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Count Shuvalov in Lysva" class="if uuid-2959042" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2959042.jpg"></div><p>  Directly from this museum, you should go to Shuvalovskaya Square, which, as already understood, was named after the Count.  The architect of this monument is L.V. Sherwood.  The installation of the monument took place in May 1908.  Locals call the monument to Shuvalov in Lysva a bear.  Tourists are even told a funny story that before opening, they hung a bunch of bagels on the monument, put vodka nearby.  During the Soviet Union, the monument was removed, and Lenin was installed in its place.  Today, the monument to the count was returned to its place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The board building of the Lysvensky factory </h2><p>  Sights in Lysva are found literally at every step.  Staying in the square, tourists can see the Art Nouveau building, which appeared in 1915, this is an ordinary architectural monument.  But with his predecessor, burned down in 1914, a tragic story happened.  It is associated with the uprising of workers, and you can find out her details about the dead employees from local centenarians. </p><h2>  Trinity Cathedral </h2><div class="photo" data-original="parmaday.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trinity Cathedral in Lysva" class="if uuid-2959046" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2959046.jpg"></div><p>  Restored recently.  To recreate the original drawings were used.  However, the size of the cathedral, it was decided to reduce.  The first church was made of wood.  It housed a sculpture of Sabaoth, who moved to Perm from Lysva to the Art Gallery.  Many tourists, especially diggers, are interested in underground passages, which supposedly were located under the old building of the cathedral and connected it with other neighboring buildings. </p><h2>  School on Lenin Square </h2><p>  Also overlooks Shuvalov Square.  A two-story school was built at the beginning of the last century.  It is nothing but a sample of bright modern.  Currently, it houses office space.  The unusual architecture of the late XIX - early XX centuries always attracts people, especially those who visit the city for the first time.  And this school is one of such treasures of Lysva. </p><h2>  Platinum Mining Assay Laboratory </h2><p>  The building of this laboratory is located on the slope, which leads to the factory dam.  Shuvalovskie mines, which extracted gold and platinum nuggets, were in the village of Kosya.  In 1900, they were even shown at the World Exhibition in Paris.  It is worth a glimpse to feel a drop of the atmosphere of former gold prospectors.  Money may not smell, but gold has its own unique aroma. </p><h2>  Big pond </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.komandirovka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Big pond in Lysva" class="if uuid-2959048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2959048.jpg"></div><p>  It was formed on the Lysva River in order to improve the operation of mechanisms at the plant.  Later, ponds also appeared on the rivers Bolotnaya and Travyanka.  There are a lot of fish in all the ponds, so fishing in Lysva is strongly recommended for visitors.  Here you will certainly not be left without a catch and a delicious fish soup.  And if you take with you one of the local guides, you can hear many interesting stories. </p><p>  Nearby there is a dam that appeared in 1787.  A couple of shops, including a power station, which was considered the largest in the Urals in pre-revolutionary times, remained from the ironworks.  Its power reached 4,500 kW.  Near the buildings there is a rolling mill with a very rich history.  It is unfortunate that a couple of years ago the open-hearth shop made of metal was destroyed.  It was erected at the beginning of the 20th century, and the architect was A.V. Shchusev.  Now on Victory Avenue you can see only a metal farm. </p><h2>  Merchant houses </h2><p>  Ancient, with interesting architecture - what are not the sights of Lysva?  Merchants' houses began to appear in the city from the second half of the 19th century.  One of the most striking buildings is a house with trading shops, which belonged to the merchant Shilov.  It is located on Smyshlyaeva street.  On this street, it is worth paying attention to the bank building, which was also previously a merchant's house.  No less interesting is the architecture and houses with a printing house on Kirov Street.  This building was erected by the merchant Bektemirov. </p><h2>  Theatre of Drama </h2><div class="photo" data-original="uraloved.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Drama Theater in Lysva" class="if uuid-2959050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2959050.jpg"></div><p>  This theater is the real pride of the city.  His story began in 1944.  It is very interesting that he appeared during the war, despite all the difficulties.  The Lysven Drama Theater was created on the basis of theater groups that were evacuated from the center of Russia.  The theater is located in an old building, where there was previously a factory school.  This building was erected in 1914 on Peace Street. </p><h2>  Park named after A.S. Pushkin </h2><p>  If you walk along Peace Street to the very end, you can find yourself in an amazing park, which is named after the poet Pushkin.  The planting of this park was carried out by the famous scientist and forest researcher A.V. Zanuzzi.  On an old cast-iron plate there is this information and it is indicated when the park was established - in 1913.  The founder of the park served as the chief forester in the Lysvensky mountain district.  He did a lot to save the forests.  Walking through the park and looking at its mighty trees, one can and should recall the pleasant words of gratitude of this great man.  Locals love to come and wander through the quiet alleys, enjoying the proximity of a man-made corner of nature. </p><h2>  Church of St. John the Evangelist </h2><p>  This temple is located in an old cemetery.  It was erected in the 50s of the XIX century with funds donated by Princess V.P. Butero-Rodali.  The architecture of the church is made in a combination of Russian and Byzantine styles. </p><p>  During the Soviet period, the temple was not closed, which allowed to save many murals.  Those who really like ancient icons or want to see something very ancient should definitely visit this church.  It is surprisingly quiet and pleasant. </p><p>  The cemetery could not be saved.  It was destroyed in Soviet times, and instead a garden was set up, which is called Popovsky.  Now the street where the church is located is called Kommunarov, and before the revolution it was called Church. </p><p>  It is interesting that earlier, near the Orthodox Church, the Old Believer church with a chapel erected from wood was located, and a mosque was located a little further away.  It is worth noting that in Lysva today you can meet the Old Believers, as well as Muslim Tatars. </p><h2>  Sotsgorod </h2><p>  This complex is located on Lenin Street, behind the Traviansky Pond.  It was built in the 30-50s of the last century.  The construction of this object began after the city was visited by the People's Commissar Lunacharsky in order to see the wooden monuments of sculpture.  He was struck by the low beautification of Lysva. </p><h2>  Soviet sculpture park </h2><p>  Locals do not consider this park a tourist attraction of Lysva, but it can be interesting for visitors.  It contains plaster sculptures of the Soviet period.  Here you can see girls with a paddle, and pioneers with a horn, and other reminders of the Soviet past.  Of course, for nostalgia you can visit him once.  The park appeared in 2009 and is considered an open-air museum. </p><h2>  Factory Manager House </h2><p>  If you go to the other side of the dam, you can look at the house of the plant manager, which was built in 1898.  In the Soviet period, it housed a school for working youth.  The house itself is a two-story building half made of stone.  Many tourists like the legend associated with it.  It tells that under the building there is an underground passage leading to the workshops of the plant and the plant management.  It is worth admiring not only the building itself, but also the beautiful views of the city that open from here. </p><h2>  Kalancha </h2><p>  Those who first came to the city should definitely visit the observation platform from the side of Linden Mountain.  She got the name from the local "kalancha".  Despite the fact that its height is only 277 meters, it offers stunning views of the sights of Lysva.  It got its name because there was a tower on the top of the mountain in pre-revolutionary times so that forest fires could be easily detected. </p><h2>  Museum of Communications </h2><div class="photo" data-original="lysvafoto.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Communications in Lysva" class="if uuid-2959053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2959053.jpg"></div><p>  The history of the museum began in 1980.  However, it was updated 30 years later in 2010.  The founder of the Lysvensky <span>Museum of Communications</span> is S. V. Golyshev.  He wanted to simply and clearly illustrate how mail and telecommunications developed.  It is worth noting that the very first expositions were formalized by the postal staff and signalmen themselves.  The funds of the museum keep stunning exhibits that can tell a lot about the history of post, telephone and telegraph in the city.  Many tourists are very pleased with the photo and documentary materials of the museum. </p><h2>  Railway tunnel </h2><p>  This attraction is located near the cottage village Kamenny Log.  It is considered the longest in the Perm Territory - 180 meters.  This tunnel is part of the West Ural Railway, which appeared at the beginning of the last century.  It was used to transport ore to plants in the Middle Urals and coal to plants in the South Urals. </p><p>  In 1918, the road became a member of the hostilities.  During the Civil War, there were clashes between armored trains.  Moreover, some stations changed the conquerors several times.  You can learn more about these events from local residents. </p><h2>  Karst River </h2><p>  The karst river Obmanka is located near the village of Obmanka-1.  It got its name for a reason.  The river goes underground near the highway leading to the village of Obmanka-2.  On the way to Obmanka-1, you can look at the well, from which it smells of hydrogen sulfide, and a picturesque quarry formed by cemented pebbles. </p><h2>  Monument to the fighters for the revolution </h2><p>  What to see in Lysva yet?  Square to the fighters who fell for the Soviet power.  Before you visit it, it is worth a little plunge into history.  When the Soviet authorities tried to establish in most cities of the province, many city residents died.  In the 20s of the last century, it was decided to create the Communards Square in order to perpetuate the memory of those who perished in this way.  It is here that the monument to the fighters for the revolution is located. </p>
