Working with a network of cameras with one router is not technically difficult.  To do this, you need to know the main computer networks and security system.  In the past, they were controlled by a security guard who was locked in the room all day, watching the monitors to make sure that nothing illegal was happening on the premises. </p><p>  Modern devices have the ability to view the security system remotely, in real time.  The technology has made such progress that it can send notifications of an altered state directly to a mobile phone or tablet so that the user knows what events are recorded by the security camera. </p><h2>  Wireless Camera Router </h2><div class="photo" data-original="camaras4.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wireless Camera Router" class="if uuid-3252657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3252657.jpg"></div><p>  A router is a device that transfers data between network connections; it provides the ability to control several points simultaneously from one Internet connection.  Without it, it is impossible to configure the DVR for viewing via the Internet.  Today, many homes have Wi-Fi routers that connect devices to the Internet wirelessly.  Almost any router is suitable for remote access to the DVR.  Some of the major brands are: Linksys (Cisco), D-Link, Netgear, Belkin, and Apple. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  CAT5 Ethernet cables are used to connect the system to the Internet.  Digital devices with settings for remote access to the DVR come with a network port for connecting cat5, which is sometimes sold bundled with the system.  But in most cases it is too short.  Therefore, it is better to purchase an additional desired length.  In addition, you will need one Ethernet cable to connect the modem to the router.  They also usually come with their own short Ethernet cable, which is not enough to bundle a security system.  And it is better to pre-purchase a new one of the required length. </p><h2>  Monitor connection </h2><div class="photo" data-original="learncctv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monitor connection" class="if uuid-3252664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3252664.jpg"></div><p>  For the initial setup of the Tantos dashcam for viewing via the Internet, you will need a monitor, and in the future, the system can be viewed remotely.  Digital video recorders have outputs that can connect a TV as a monitor using BNC, HDMI, VGA, or even composite RCA connections, depending on the type of equipment purchased. </p><p>  Algorithm for setting the DVR for viewing via the Internet: </p><ol><li>  Connect the modem to the Internet.  Usually they have a number of indicators on the front panel that show the status, so that the user knows how the device is currently operating.  Typically, a router has one port for connecting to the World Wide Web.  Which is located far from others and is located on the rear panel of the router for devices connected to the Internet. </li><li>  The connection is made with a CAT5 cable. </li><li>  Connect the DVR to the monitor via the HDMI or VGA port, both on the DVR and on the monitor.  The first of these is preferred for use. </li><li>  Now that you have the equipment configured and connected, make sure that everything works. </li><li>  DVRs may have menus that look a little different, but the settings are usually the same.  The same goes for routers. </li></ol><h2>  Security system setup instructions </h2><p>  The next step is to configure the DVR to view it remotely over the Internet: access it through a web browser.  It is carried out using a mouse or a wireless remote control.  In the system menu of the DVR, select the ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù submenu and make sure that the ‚ÄúDHCP‚Äù and ‚ÄúWeb Service‚Äù checkboxes are selected. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="kintronics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Security system setup instructions" class="if uuid-3252669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3252669.jpg"></div><p>  DVR Network Setup: </p><ol><li>  Click the ‚ÄúApply‚Äù button, save the settings and a link to the IP address.  This is the local IP address of the DVR, and it will only be available on the PC to which the same network router is connected as the digital DVR (wired or wireless). </li><li>  A web browser is opened from a computer connected to the same network as the DVR. </li><li>  Enter the IP address in its address bar, for example: http://192.168.0.100:8080. </li><li>  Before proceeding to the settings of the DVR for viewing via the Internet, they perform port forwarding and make sure that you can connect to the DVR using a local IP address. </li><li>  In order to access the digital DVR and view video from security cameras connected to it remotely, you need to configure the router so that it transfers traffic from the local network to the digital device. </li><li>  Make sure that the ports 8080 and 554 are opened using the tool for checking ports in the complex settings for accessing the DVR via the Internet.  If the port is open, you need to use the remote IP using the IP DVR tool. </li><li>  Enter it as follows through the web browser http: // ipaddress: port.  For example, if the IP address is 74.96.36.98, it should look like http://74.96.36.98:8080. </li><li>  If the ports are closed, you need to call the DSL provider, you may need to connect the modem to a third-party router. </li><li>  Open a web browser and prescribe an external IP address. </li><li>  Enter username and password.  Default: ADMIN, 1234. </li><li>  When the connection is complete, you can see the cameras. </li></ol><h2>  New RVI DVRs </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.idisglobal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New RVI DVRs" class="if uuid-3252670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3252670.jpg"></div><p>  RVI cameras have online DVR setup applications for remote viewing from iPhone, Android, Mac, and Windows.  DVR software allows you to watch security cameras through an internal LAN.  The built-in remote station also makes it possible to study previously recorded surveillance videos.  An integrated remote system, sometimes called a DVR viewer, runs on a computer running Microsoft Windows. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Configuring the RVI dashcam for viewing over the Internet: </p><ol><li>  Assign DVR IP address. </li><li>  Connect to the DVR on the local network. </li><li>  Configure port forwarding on the router. </li><li>  Debug static DHCP IP address for DVR. </li><li>  Create and configure a DNS Dynamic account. </li><li>  Debug dynamic DNS on the router. </li><li>  Perform the setup of the RVI dashcam for viewing via the Internet through a remote connection to it. </li><li>  Assign an IP address to the DVR. </li><li>  Be sure that the DVR is connected to the Network by connecting an Ethernet cable to the back of the DVR and the other end to the router. </li><li>  Enter the DVR by pressing the menu button on the DVR or on the remote control. </li><li>  When prompted for a password, press the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button on the DVR or remote control. </li><li>  The default password for the DVR is blank.  If it is already installed, enter it and click ‚ÄúOK‚Äù. </li><li>  In the system menu, select "External device". </li><li>  In the menu set "TCP / IP Settings". </li><li>  On the screen, configure the video surveillance DVR over the Internet. TCP / IP determines DHCP Setup and press Enter. </li></ol><h2>  Auto DHCP </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.its.hku.hk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Auto DHCP" class="if uuid-3252681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3252681.jpg"></div><p>  On the screen, the DHCP settings confirm that the DHCP mode is set to automatic.  If this is not the case, adjust it by pressing the OK button. </p><p>  Algorithm for setting the DHCP mode: </p><ol><li>  Select "Define IP" and press enter.  They refresh the screen and wait until the new data is filled. </li><li>  Pay attention to the internal IP that the router has assigned the DVR, and port forwarding will be configured for it. </li><li>  Select DHCP Mode and click ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.  The mode will be changed manually.  This ensures that the DVR always assigns the same IP address from the router.  This is important because if the power of the router is turned off, it can assign the DVR to a different IP, and then the user will not be able to access the DVR remotely. </li><li>  Press the menu button once to return to the installation and setup screen of the TCP / IP dashcam. </li><li>  On the screen, select the IP configuration, press Enter and confirm the DVR port number.  The default port is 8000. If the DVR is not configured for this port, change this value to 8000. </li><li>  Click on the ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù several times on the DVR until it appears with the image of the cameras in real time. </li><li>  Choose Manul for the mix. </li><li>  Enter the IP address that was noted on the TCP / IP DVR settings screen in the "Address" field.  If any of the numeric fields in the IP address contain leading zeros, they should be deleted.  For example, if the IP address of the DVR is 192.168.000.066, you need to enter 192.168.0.66. </li><li>  Dial 8000 for the port. </li><li>  Enter admin for the USER ID. </li><li>  Leave the password empty if it has not been previously set, or enter if created. </li><li>  Click "OK" after the end of data entry. </li></ol><h2>  Connecting your phone to the Hikvision DVR </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gaurise.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Configure DVR to view" class="if uuid-3252655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3252655.jpg"></div><p>  The steps to access the Hikvision DVR from a mobile phone are very simple.  Install the iVMS-4500 application on a mobile phone, click the Hik-connect button to create an account, and finally add a DVR by pointing its QR code on the mobile camera. </p><p>  The step-by-step process of setting up a Hikvision dashcam for viewing over the Internet: </p><ol><li>  Install the application on a mobile phone.  Now that you have basic information about the IP address of the DVR and the ports, you can download the program for remote access to the DVR. </li><li>  Open the Play Store on Android devices or the App Store on iOS to download and install the Hikvision iVMS-4500 app. </li><li>  Create an account by clicking on ‚ÄúRegister HIk-Connect‚Äù in the next window. </li><li>  Enter the email address and click the button "Get confirmation code" </li><li>  Check mail, enter the code, "Next" and create a password. </li><li>  Add DVR to iVMS-4500 application. </li><li>  Open the iVMS-4500 and press the (+) button. </li><li>  The program opens the camera to scan the QR code, which is located in the DVR. </li><li>  The next window asks for the code located on the DVR. </li><li>  After entering it, the application shows the connected device, so the setup of the Hikvision dashcam for viewing via the Internet is completed. </li></ol><h2>  Set up a video surveillance system </h2><p>  The idea is to initially connect the cables from the digital DVR to the router and work in the local configuration for testing, and then in the remote network under normal monitoring mode. </p><p>  If the user already has access to the DVR from the Internet using a mobile application, and the local and remote configuration in test mode showed normal operation, but something still does not work properly in normal mode, you can perform the following steps. </p><div class="photo" data-original="learncctv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Set up a video surveillance system" class="if uuid-3252684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3252684.jpg"></div><p>  DVR - local connection and configuration: </p><ol><li>  Connect the DVR with cat5e network cable to the router. </li><li>  Connect the router to the Internet provider.  When configuring the DVR router, pay attention to the router.  It usually has blue ports, which are used for internal devices, and a yellow port for connecting to the Internet. </li><li>  Check local connection to DVR. </li><li>  Before setting up remote mode, make sure that you have access to the DVR using a computer or laptop from web browsers: Internet Explorer, Google Chrome or Firefox. </li><li>  Most digital DVRs and IP cameras are compatible with Internet Explorer (IE), so it is recommended that you try this web browser first and then others. </li><li>  In it (IE) enter the IP address of the DVR, as well as the username and password that are created. </li><li>  Usually, when a user first tries to access the DVR through a web browser, a message appears asking you to install the plugin.  Just click to accept the offer, and unpack it. </li><li>  After entering the correct username and password, you can see your cameras through a web browser, which means that the local installation is in order. </li><li>  The DVR works correctly through the local network and sends the video to a web browser (IE). </li><li>  Be sure that the DVR has all the correct Network information for the remote access configuration, which can be checked in its menu. </li><li>  Click on the DVR menu ‚ÄúConfiguration‚Äù and ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù. </li><li>  In the main settings menu of the Network, the following is checked: the IPV4 DVR IP address, depending on its range, the IPV4 subnet mask, usually matches the computer mask, the default IPV4 gateway is the IP address of the router, the DNS server can be used 4.2.2.2 and 8.8.8.8. </li><li>  If the DHCP - dynamic host configuration protocol check box is checked, the DVR will receive all the information from the router, just make sure that it is correct and uncheck the DHCP box. </li><li>  Configure DVR ports, the program uses them to communicate with a web browser, computer software and a mobile application.  These are virtual ports, not physical ones.  Information is available in the Network menu in the Basic Settings and Port section. </li></ol><h2>  Router Configuration for Hiwatch </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.spycameracctv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Router Configuration for Hiwatch" class="if uuid-3252685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3252685.jpg"></div><p>  After completing the camera setup, it's time to configure the router.  First you need to consider what configurations you will need to perform to configure the Hiwatch dashcam for viewing over the Internet: </p><ol><li>  Enables remote HTTP access so that the router can be accessed from any location. </li><li>  Specify the APN point name for the SIM used so that the router receives a public IP. </li><li>  Configure a port forwarding rule that sends all connections from one port to the IP cameras. </li><li>  They enable remote HTTP access, enter the router‚Äôs web interface on the administration page: System ‚Üí Administration. </li><li>  In this window, go to "Access Control" and find the "Enable remote access via HTTP" field, where they put a check mark. </li><li>  After you configure your Hiwatch dashcam to view it over the Internet with remote access, the router becomes vulnerable to malicious attacks across the World Wide Web.  It is highly recommended that after remote access is enabled, change the default password of the router to a string, your own password in the System ‚Üí Administration ‚Üí General ‚Üí Administrator Password. </li><li>  Install APN, being in the web interface of the router.  Go to the Mobile page located on the Network tab: Network ‚Üí Mobile. </li><li>  In the Mobile window, they find the APN field and enter the APN of the Internet provider.  In some cases, the SIM card does not require it to obtain a public IP address.  If so, just check the IP address of the WAN router - if it is a public IP, the user does not need to set the APN. </li><li>  The easiest way to find out which IP is on the Web is to log into the router‚Äôs web interface and check the WAN widget on the Overview page. </li><li>  Configure port forwarding, on the firewall page go to the tab of the same name.  Scroll down to the bottom of the page and find the ‚ÄúNew Port Forwarding Rule‚Äù section. </li></ol><p>  Create a custom name for the new rule, set the following parameters: </p><ol><li>  Protocol: TCP + UDP. </li><li>  External port (s): 8888. </li><li>  Internal IP: 192.168.1.64 (sample). </li><li>  Internal port (port): 8888. </li></ol><p>  Next, click the "Add" button after making the changes.  After the new rule, the user will be redirected to the settings window.  The rule will appear at the bottom of the port forwarding list, where you can check its status and make additional settings. </p><h2>  Setting dynamic DNS </h2><p>  Dynamic DNS (DDNS or DynDNS) is a method of automatically updating the name server in the DNS domain name system in real time, with the active DDNS configuration of its configured host names, addresses or other information. </p><p>  Dynamic configuration is required if the SIM card has a dynamic public IP address.  You can find more detailed information about what a dynamic external IP address is, but in the general case this means that it can change over time, as a rule, when a network is disconnected or re-registered.  Dynamic DNS assigns an IP host name and constantly updates this name.  But, even if the IP changes, DDNS will assign the same hostname to the new IP, making the router accessible through the same name at any time. </p><p>  You must use an external DDNS service to create a host name and assign it an IP.  Routers support many of these services.  You can find a complete list of DDNS services in the "Services" ‚Üí "Dynamic DNS" section of the router‚Äôs web interface.  Now that you‚Äôve completed the configuration of your devices, you should check whether the configuration works correctly.  Two common ways to configure the router for the DVR over the Internet: through a media player and a web browser. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Configure Dynamic DNS" class="if uuid-3252691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3252691.jpg"></div><p>  You can view the live broadcast from the camera using the VideoLAN Client (VLC) player.  VLC works on all systems: </p><ol><li>  Download and install the VLC player on the computer. </li><li>  Open it, go to Media ‚Üí Open Network Stream in the upper left corner of the window, or simply press Ctrl + N on the keyboard. </li><li>  In the ‚ÄúNetwork Stream‚Äù window, you will need to enter the address of the real-time streaming protocol (RTSP) of the camera.  It should look something like this: RTSP: // admin: password@84.15.186.115: 554 /. </li><li> ,       RTSP       ,       - ,     -. </li><li>  WAN IP-    URL ,    (:)    HTTP  .      - . </li><li>       ,   . </li><li>         .       .  Internet Explorer       . </li><li>     Internet Explorer     .          .   ,  ¬´¬ª  .             . </li></ol><h2>   Dahua </h2><div class="photo" data-original="cyberspaceandtime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="  Dahua" class="if uuid-3252694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/3252694.jpg"></div><p>      DNS   Dahua.

This is a real opportunity not only to prevent crimes, but also to monitor what is currently happening in the places where cameras are installed.  Equally important is the ability to remotely view and backup videos so that a copy is always saved, even if they are damaged or stolen. </p><p>  Modern devices have remote settings for DEXP DVRs and specialized cameras.  This is convenient if the owner has noticed that it is necessary to change some configurations of the DVR.  Especially if the user cannot get to the installation site of the cameras, this will allow him to change the settings, wherever he is. </p>
