    <p>  Among all places intended for recreation, camp sites, sanatoriums, boarding houses of the Leningrad region stand out especially.  Why?  There are more than enough grounds for such statements.  This region of Russia can boast of the presence of several factors at once: ancient history, picturesque nature and many amazing places with historical and architectural monuments of all-Russian and world significance. </p><p>  Choosing for yourself an inexpensive vacation in the Leningrad Region, you should not forget that most of the objects can be visited for free or at a very symbolic cost. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This territorial unit is located in the north-west of Russia, in the vicinity of Finland and Estonia.  In general, it is believed that for those who planned a vacation with their children in the Leningrad region, these regions are simply ideal, and a lesson for everyone here is for young travelers of any age, from very thoughtless to curious adolescents.  And if for the former, as a rule, fresh air and local flora and fauna are important, then the latter are already happy to go on excursions. </p><p>  One of the places worth visiting is Shlisselburg, located near St. Petersburg.  It is located near Lake Ladoga, on the banks of the Neva.  Here, on the island of the same name, seven centuries ago, the Oreshek fortress was erected.  Once here, travelers feel how time actually stops.  Fortress walls with weathercocks and ancient buildings have survived to this day. </p><p>  Many of the oldest monuments are located in Vyborg.  The symbol of the city was the only medieval castle in Russia, built in the XIII century.  From its observation deck, a panorama of the whole of Vyborg opens.  The castle hosts festivals and jousting tournaments.  Also in the city there is a rocky park Monrepos.  The manor and park ensemble embodied the beauty of architecture and landscape art.  But the piles of unique granite rocks are especially interesting. </p><p>  Another attraction of this region is the Assumption Monastery, where the miraculous Tikhvin Icon of the Mother of God is located. </p><p>  True, it should be noted that comfortable holiday homes in the Leningrad Region are located at a remote distance from the above places, so it would be rash to hope to see them in the company of the younger generation without any problems. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Section 2.

    <p>  Children were always interested in stories about knightly tournaments and campaigns.  In the vicinity of St. Petersburg are the most ancient fortresses from the Middle Ages, where you can get acquainted with history, watch knightly fights and battles.  It is easiest to get to the towns of Shlisselburg and Vyborg by transport.  Here are the Oreshek fortress and <span>Vyborg castle.</span>  You can go to the fortress in Koporye with your own transport. </p><p>  The building "Nut" was built on Nut Island in the XIV century.  Hence the name of the fortress itself, which is an example of an old Russian defensive structure.  It was used to maintain political prisoners.  Of the four prisons, two are preserved, which are open for inspection.  In the Secret House it is recommended to see the expositions about the prisoners of the fortress.  Also in the fortress is a branch of the Museum of the History of St. Petersburg.  You can get to the island only by water.  For excursion groups organized crossings.  The fortress is open from May to October. </p><p>  In Vyborg, on Volovy Ostrov, the only medieval castle of the 13th century rises in our country.  Once with the city, the fortress was connected by drawbridges.  In the center to this day stands a stone tower, named after the king of Norway, Olaf Saint.  It offers a beautiful view of the whole city.  In the chambers of the castle a historical museum of local lore is opened, where ancient artifacts are collected.  The zoological exhibition will tell about the wealth of flora and fauna of the Karelian Isthmus.  The castle regularly hosts festivals and knightly fights.  The tour takes a lot of time, so there is a cafe for visitors. </p><p>  In the village of Koporye, 100 km from St. Petersburg, on a hill, there is a 13th-century fortress built by German knights.  Initially, it was wooden, but after the capture of Alexander Nevsky it was destroyed and built of stone.  Preserved walls and towers, under which remained the underground passages that once led to the torture chamber.  Three towers are available for visiting.  In the center stands a small dilapidated Church of the Transfiguration (XVI century). </p><h2>  Section 6. The advantages of country hotels </h2>
