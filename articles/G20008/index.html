    <h2>  Situation overview </h2><p>  Over the past ten years, there has been a rapid growth in the lending market, and lending to individuals has become especially popular.  It is logical that the financial literacy of people has increased slightly.  In fact, it is right that people began to save their money and think about where they spend it.  I had to plan cash flows and imagine what means the loan payment would be made up of.  The secret is that the availability of credit makes you forget about the sense of reality.  That is, a person always has in stock a certain balance of funds, whether it be a credit card or a quick loan.  Moreover, the advertisement eloquently promises that in your wallet there will always be money for a new dress or covers for a car.  The pink veil will subside later, when it is time for reckoning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to calculate the monthly loan payment" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/1569390.jpg" width="600"></div>

Can you find the money for a monthly payment?  And do you really need that thing for which you want to take money?  You need to consult with family members and, of course, do not take the first loan you see.  Offers vary in different banks, and sometimes they may be beneficial for your category.  For example, an acceptable percentage may be offered to retirees, students, or young families.  It is worth considering the option of force majeure, when there is simply no money to pay for a loan.  A number of banks meet customers and offer debt restructuring.  Agree, confidence is added when emergency escape routes are thought out.  Well, of course, you can pre-calculate the loan payment.  Sberbank, for example, provides such an opportunity online.  On the official website there is a calculator where you can register the required amount and the preferred loan term. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calculate loan payment" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/1569389.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  In the process of solving </h2><p>  So, how to calculate loan payments?  And why is this necessary if the bank can do everything on its own?  For complete confidence in the transparency of services, the structure of payments and the absence of hidden fees.  You can make preliminary calculations at home, having on hand a calculator, pencil and a sheet of paper. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Annuity Payments </h2><p>  <span>The most popular in the practice of lending are <span>annuity payments.</span></span>  <span>Their amount is the same for the duration of the loan agreement.</span>  <span>Such a payment consists of two parts: funds that go to pay directly the loan, and interest accrued on the amount of debt.</span>  <span>Until the very end of payments, the amount remains unchanged, but initially interest prevailed in it, and by the end - the main debt.</span>  <span>And how to calculate loan payments of this type?</span>  <span>There is a special formula: P = C * (% * (1 +%) x</span> <span>n</span> <span>) / ((1 +%) x (</span> <span>n</span> <span>-1).</span> </p><p>  <span>In this formula, P is the amount of payment, C is the amount of the loan.</span>  <span>Accordingly,% - reflects the interest rate, and</span> <span>n</span> <span>is the accrual period in months.</span>  <span>In order to correctly calculate the loan payment schedule, the annual rate can be converted into a monthly rate, and then expressed in decimal.</span>  <span>It turns out a monthly payment.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="calculate loan payment schedule" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/1569388.jpg" width="599"></div>
