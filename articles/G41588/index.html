They were worn by shepherds.  Such shoes keep warm and wear well. </p><p>  Since then, ugg boots have undergone many changes, and today you can find countless models, so to speak, for every taste and color, and they can safely complement almost any outfit. </p><p>  Also, many fashionistas are able to sew them at home, make a pattern, create ugg boots with their own hands. </p><h2>  Women's and men's uggs </h2><p>  At first glance, it may seem that the uggs are kind of ridiculous and ugly in appearance. </p><p>  This is not their advantage.  Warmth and comfort - this is where they are not inferior to anything.  And everything else is not so important. </p><p>  The most famous brand of original uggs is UGG, the price of products of this brand is not small.  These are boots made of natural suede on the outside and with fur inside. </p><p>  But on sale you can also find fairly cheap analogues from a wide variety of materials, no worse in quality and design. </p>

    <p>  Outerwear should not be long - all kinds of jackets, parkas or sheepskin coats above the knee or to the middle of the thigh will be a great option.  In warm autumn, these shoes can be combined with wide, not very long tunics with a belt at the waist. </p><p>  Men are advised to choose down jackets or coats to match.  <span>Jeans, corduroy</span> pants and plaid shirts, warm sweaters or cardigans accentuate the image of a stylish and modern man. </p><p>  Do not neglect accessories: monophonic sets of hats, scarves and gloves will complement the outfit well. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Ugg boots can be trimmed with fur or flirtatious chatterboxes that young girls and children love.  You can independently design a pattern and children's uggs with your own hands can be sewn in just a couple of hours. </p><h2>  Ugg boots and health </h2><p>  But the comfort of this shoe can turn into a side effect.  Since ugg boots do not have a fixed hard back, the presence of a solid sole (without anatomical and orthopedic reliefs) can cause improper foot formation and flat feet, especially in childhood and adolescence. </p><p>  If you wear such shoes constantly, ugg boots tend to wear out.  They become quite free, which can lead to impaired gait. </p>

    <p>  It turned out four details: two soles (one is the outer part of the sole, the other is the lining of the sole), the front part with a fold, the bootleg with a fold. </p><p>  That's when all the parts are ready, we cut them out and transfer them to the fabric.  Two pieces are cut out.  And sewn according to the scheme of the outer seam. </p><p>  Given the density of the fabrics used, most likely, machine assembly is not suitable for you, of course, if you are not the owner of a furrier machine.  Otherwise, stitching the seams outward is most convenient on the hands.  Threads can be selected in the color of the material, or you can play in contrast. </p><p>  First we sew the upper parts of the shaft, then all the rest. </p><p>  Bows, flowers, buttons will help to add uniqueness to your uggs. </p>
