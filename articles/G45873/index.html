    <h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Boris Yulin is a historian whose biography is not very well known.  But perhaps this does not matter.  Here are some facts that are known to readers: Boris Yulin was born in the city of Khabarovsk in 1961, graduated from a local school, and then served in the army.  He has two higher educations: he graduated from the Moscow Aviation Institute, and then the Moscow Regional Pedagogical Institute.  He leads his historical forum on "Dead End", the author of a very popular live magazine.  Anyone interested in history, perhaps, should know Boris Vitalievich and his work. </p><h2>  Military historian </h2>

    <p>  Boris Yulin began his historical career, collaborating with historian Svetlana Samchenko.  At first he wrote works about the armored fleet of the First World War, as well as the Russo-Japanese.  For the most part, Boris Vitalievich was always interested in military equipment, this can be seen in his bibliography.  And although not so many books were created for them (about them - a little later), but a lot of small discussions, posts, videos and interviews with this historian appear on the Internet regularly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Other activity </h2><p>  Interestingly, Boris Yulin is a historian who collaborated with several computer game development companies through military-historical consultations.  Yes, and he himself, as readers of his LJ page writes, often likes to plunge into the atmosphere of virtual battles. </p><p>  In addition, Boris Yulin is very interested in pedagogy in Russia and the problems of its development.  He worked for a long time in his alma mater to develop new methods of teaching history.  He also entered the list of co-authors of a modern textbook on economics.  It is difficult to disagree with the fact that the topic is now extremely relevant. </p><p>  This writer has his own rubric on the Internet, Boris Yulin called it ‚ÄúIntelligence Interrogation‚Äù.  There, in the form of an interview, he answers questions regarding Russian and Soviet history to the notorious Dmitry Puchkov. </p>

    <h2>  Criticism </h2><p>  Judging by how netizens speak about this historian, he has enough ill-wishers.  The most controversial topic that Boris Yulin touched on is Ukraine and its modern politics.  But at the same time, his videos are gaining views very quickly, and there are a lot of subscribers to his pages on social networks.  There are very few constructive critical comments, and therefore it can be concluded that it is not worth paying attention to them.  It is better to make your own opinion by reading the publications of the author. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bibliography </h2>

    <p>  Today, Boris Yulin is the author of many articles and books on national history.  Moreover, most of all in his works he pays attention to military aspects.  If your interests in historical science coincide with the interests of this author, then you should familiarize yourself with the list of books that he created during his career.  By the way, now the author has returned to science and is working on serious projects, so we should expect to soon replenish the list of bibliography of the writer.  Boris Yulin, whose books are very famous in the Russian historical community, is worthy of the reader‚Äôs attention. </p><h2>  "Battle of Borodino" </h2><p>  The first book that I would like to discuss is the Battle of Borodino, published in 2008.  The edition is small (only 176 pages of text), but it is large-format and illustrated, and also belongs to the category of rare ones; the print run was only 4 thousand copies.  For the first time the book was presented in Moscow, now it can be found on the shelves of the largest bookstores or read the text in online libraries. </p>

    <p>  <span>The Battle of Borodino</span> is the most massive and bloody battle of the Patriotic War of 1812, it is often described as the main battle of Russian history, and it is often said about it that it is a symbol of Russian military glory.  Hundreds of paintings and colorful descriptions in fiction were dedicated to her.  Only there are still a lot of controversial issues that arise regarding the battle of Borodino.  And this is even if you do not touch the works of Western historians.  What is the current statistics regarding the balance of power before the battle, and what are the losses on both sides after it?  Until now, researchers can not come to a consensus.  But the most important, paradoxically, is the question of who won.  They argued about this in the nineteenth century, and they argue now. </p><p>  So what is the difference between the book of Boris Yulin from numerous works on the same issue?  The fact that the author approaches these issues from a very unexpected perspective.  The writer‚Äôs look is very fresh, innovative, for many, perhaps this will seem fiction.  But Yulin very intelligibly explains his position, reinforcing it with historical sources.  After analyzing the plans of Bonaparte and Kutuzov, their decisions regarding the battle, he correlates this information with genuine maps of the area, not forgetting to characterize the weapons of both sides.  The conclusions were very nontrivial. </p><p>  Initially, the author himself wanted to name the book in a different way: "Borodino. Stand and die."  But the publishers, having read the text, decided that a more concise version is more suitable.  The book is replete with quotes from the historical community, as well as the commanders of the Russian and French armies themselves.  All quotes have copyright comments, and in the reference material you can find interesting facts about the armament of both sides.  And this is no exaggeration, since the author is well versed in this matter.  The abundance of illustrations that appropriately complement the narration surprised readers, some of them were personally painted by Boris Vitalyevich, for example, schemes of some battles in stages. </p>

    <p>  The reviews of the critics turned out to be very favorable. </p><h2>  Myths of World War II </h2><p>  Boris Yulin co-authored this book with other modern historians.  She was released in 2009 and won many positive reviews from critics.  Although the publication has enough ill-wishers. </p><p>  What modern pseudo-historians do not come up with to denigrate the Soviet period of Russian history.  This is especially true of the history of the Great Patriotic War.  This book was created in order to refute the terrible slander that spreads on the pages of magazines, as well as on radio waves and on the pages of online publications.  Holy war - as these terrible four years are called, denigrating the generals or facts is a low matter.  It is necessary to honor your story, protecting the truth and memory of our great-grandfathers.  To defend your past, and not to slander it, is the goal of this book and its authors. </p>

    <h2>  "Economic Security" </h2><p>  The book is completely new, written last year, has a large circulation and unconditional popularity among specialists in economics.  This textbook was created by a group of authors, including Boris Vitalievich Yulin. </p><p>  This is a very good manual on economics, which is devoted to the very urgent problem of economic security.  This textbook examines the issues of organizing a security system; it acquaints readers with the main strategic and regulatory legal documents.  What is important, this publication meets all the parameters of the modern educational standard.  And it will be appropriate for in-depth study of the subject. </p><p>  Yulin Boris Vitalievich is a modern unusual author with atypical views.  Definitely worth getting acquainted with his works in order to broaden his horizons. </p>
