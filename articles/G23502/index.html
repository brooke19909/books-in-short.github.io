    <p>  Important: for no reason, "Mobile Bank" does not turn off.  And just like that, Sberbank does not block this option.  The most common problem is the lack of funds on the phone tied to a bank card.  But there may also be other reasons.  For example, a system failure in the work of Sberbank.  In this case, company employees will quickly solve the problem. </p>
