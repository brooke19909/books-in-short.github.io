On average, visits to Moscow by guests increase annually by 10-12%.  In 2016, over 17.5 million guests visited Belokamennaya. </p><p>  Approximately 36% of the tourist flow comes from business tourism.  Guests arriving for leisure are traditionally interested in Red Square, the Kremlin, Kazan and St. Basil's Cathedrals, the Bolshoi Theater, the Tretyakov Gallery, the Moscow City complex, the zoo, the Moskvarium, interactive parks, and the Moscow circus.  The ideal starting point for such excursions are fashionable hotels located in the city center. </p><p>  26% of all tourists in the capital of Russia are guests from abroad who prefer 5 star hotels to stay in Moscow.  The truth of these words is emphasized by one fact: during the imposition of sanctions against Turkey, the Red Hills Hotel was forced to temporarily suspend its work. </p><p>  Among the annually growing flows of foreign visitors to Moscow, the largest share (about 40%) falls on guests from China.  Although among the foreigners visiting Belokamennaya, so far the representatives of European states dominate: Germany, Greece, Italy, the Czech Republic and France, however, in the future, residents of Asia will dominate. </p><h2>  Five star hotels in Moscow.

Hotel guests feel attention to themselves, receiving additional bonuses, for example, a fruit platter and champagne in the fridge, cosmetics for children. </p><h2>  Rating and location of metropolitan five-star hotels </h2><p>  It is not difficult to find out how many five-star hotels are in Moscow thanks to the existing information support of the tourism business.  The most advanced sites of tour operators link to three dozen hotel complexes of the highest category.  Among them are hotels: </p><ul><li>  Radisson (Kutuzovsky Prospect, 2/1); </li><li>  Hilton (Kalanchevskaya St., 21/40); </li><li>  Marriot (32 Novy Arbat St.); </li><li>  "Savoy" (st. Rozhdestvenskaya, 3/2); </li><li>  The Golden Ring (5 Smolenskaya St.); </li><li>  "National" (Mokhovaya St., 15/1); </li><li>  ‚ÄúRenaissance Moscow Olympic‚Äù (Olympic Avenue, 18/1). </li></ul><p>  The most exquisite tastes of its visitors will satisfy the listed 5-star Moscow hotels.  Addresses, as well as information on how to get to each such institution, can be found in the citywide information desk 09, as well as on the websites of tour operators.  At the same time, the choice of a hotel should not be based only on the contemplation of photographs; it is equally important to take into account the opinion in most reviews.  If space is important for a comfortable stay, we recommend looking for rooms from 35-40 m <sup>2</sup> .  Those wishing to enjoy the silence can reasonably choose a hotel with the number of rooms no more than 200-300.  When looking at a boutique hotel, pay attention to the year of renovation, preferably no more than two years ago. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moscovery.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how many five-star hotels in Moscow" class="if uuid-2757892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/2757892.jpg"></div><p>  It is characteristic that wealthy foreign tourists prefer certain Moscow hotels (5 stars).  Their reviews on TripAdvisor have been calculated and rated.  So, in the top three, you can name Radisson (from 22,000 rubles per day stand), ‚ÄúSavoy‚Äù (from 12,500 rubles), ‚ÄúRed Hills‚Äù (from 20,000 rubles).  Ararat Park Hyatt takes the fourth position (from 37,000 rubles).  Fifth place behind the Marriott Hotel (from 24,000 rubles). </p><p>  This is exactly what the rating of Moscow 5-star hotels looks like from the point of view of foreign tourists.  Although it is also a subjective view.  Just read the reviews of guests of such hotels, and you begin to understand that among them, one part prefers historical hotels, the other - youth hotels, the third - spa hotels. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  5 star Moscow hotels have status, name, charm and attractiveness.  However, among them there are institutions with their own special ‚Äúzest‚Äù that distinguishes them and makes them unique.  Such hotels are guaranteed long-term popularity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="weddingblog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="5 star hotel rating in Moscow" class="if uuid-2757894" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/2757894.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, staying in hotels of the highest category is not cheap.  However, it leaves behind a warm impression.  Undoubtedly, such hotels are the pearls of the tourist infrastructure of the ancient and modern metropolis.  Indeed, the impressions of tourists from excursions in Moscow, thanks to the positiveness and comfort they receive from staying in these hotels, do not fade, but rather intensify. </p>
