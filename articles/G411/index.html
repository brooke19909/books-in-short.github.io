Many tourists in their reviews call it tiny, and there is some truth to this.  Small, mountainous, green - it exudes calm, impresses with its ancient beauty.  Located on it, the Natasa Hotel 3 * hospitably welcomes lovers of peace and nature. </p><h2>  Island for family holidays </h2><p>  Hippocrates also admired the unusually clean air of Thassos, which has healing and soothing properties.  Oddly enough, but since the time of the great healer, little has changed in this sense.  There is no industry here, as on the mainland, even the machines fail to pollute it with exhaust gases. </p><p>  This is due to the fact that the mountains that make up the island and the lowlands are covered with coniferous forests and cypress groves.  This is where you should come to relax with children, who are especially often sick in the autumn-winter period. </p>

    <p>  In order for a family vacation to be not only useful, but also interesting and safe, you should choose Natasa Hotel 3 * (Thasos Island), reviews of which are not many, but they are positive. </p><p>  The fact is that the island is located next to the Golden Beach, one name of which suggests that it is comfortable, beautiful and safe.  Some customers of the Natasa Hotel 3 * in their responses "grumble" that they have to get to the island by transfer from an airplane to a ferry, but such a walk, on the contrary, pleases many, especially children.  Impudent and eternally hungry seagulls accompany travelers all the way to the pier, and tourists at this time have fun by feeding them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel and its territory </h2><p>  As vacationers correctly note in their responses, today many three-star hotels are not inferior in service and improvement to hotels of the 4th and 5th categories.  Natasa Hotel 3 * (Thassos and Golden Beach) is a confirmation of this. </p><p>  Three snow-white buildings under the roofs of red tiles were comfortably attached to a small olive grove that separates them from neighboring buildings.  A small territory of the hotel is surrounded by greenery and provides everything necessary for a comfortable pastime. </p><ol><li>  Swimming pool with an original bridge in a marine style - with a lifebuoy and rails instead of railings.  Sun loungers and umbrellas are waiting for their guests. </li><li>  Well-kept lawns, flower beds and trees border the azure water pool. </li><li>  The open terrace of the restaurant lures guests for breakfast, lunch and dinner. </li><li>  For kids, a small playground is provided. </li></ol>

It is nice that some of them know Russian, which is mentioned in almost all of the Natasa Hotel 3 * tourist reviews.

    <p>  As the guests of Natasa Hotel 3 * note, if the view from the balcony was not attractive, the friendly staff will meet you and provide another room if there is free space.  Of course, at the height of the season this is unlikely, but the hotel staff will do everything possible to satisfy the request of the client, or at least surround him with additional care to compensate for the inconvenience. </p><h2>  How is the hotel fed? </h2><p>  Greek cuisine is as popular in the world as Italian or French.  Culinary specialists from about will not let her taste disappointed.  Thassos, Greece.  Hotel Natasa Hotel 3 * offers customers breakfasts for which a separate room is equipped.  They serve everything that the body needs in the morning: delicious cheeses, homemade bread, vitamin juices, salads and fruits.  Refreshing frappe - a special type of chilled coffee with high froth, will help you wake up and give energy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The famous Greek salad is always on the tables, but, as guests of the Natasa Hotel 3 * (Greece) note in their reviews, not only cooks prepare it on the island, but also local residents. </p><p>  If you are not satisfied with the restaurant menu, which offers local and international cuisine, you can eat in the cafe next to the hotel.  They cook hearty and tasty at home.  You can’t leave the island without trying squid or fish platter, grilled or kleftiko and giant shrimp. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Given the size of the territory of the Natasa Hotel 3 *, it is difficult to expect anything special from it.  The main attraction is the pool with sun loungers and umbrellas, but the view from it opens up lovely: on the one hand is the sea, on the other is the mountain.  Miraculous local air and nature should be mentioned: a picture of an idyllic quiet family vacation will be ready immediately. </p>

    <p>  There is a small playground for children, and an entertainment program awaits adults every evening.  As hotel guests write in reviews, lovers of parties, discos until the morning and enchanting attractions on the island of Thassos will be bored.  But those who prefer any kind of fun to admire nature are waiting for the mountains, a natural font, hiking trails in olive and cypress groves, and an indescribably beautiful Marble Beach.  He is the pearl of the island of Thassos. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  What is convenient for a small island?  On it you can choose any coast, but from the hotel to it will still be "at hand".  Directly near Natasa Hotel 3 *, reviews confirm this, there is Gold Beach.  That's just about him the most contradictory responses. </p><p>  Some do not like that the sand on it is golden in color, others its length of several kilometers, and the third - entry into the sea.  This beach has a lot of advantages: </p><ul><li>  fine sand, resembling goldfields in the light of the sun, gently springs underfoot. </li><li>  the gentle entrance to the sea, which is so loved by parents who protect their children from dangerous depths (they can relax on this beach - they will have to stomp a hundred meters before real diving into the Aegean Sea); </li><li>  numerous cafes, sun loungers with umbrellas (for a fee) and the necessary amenities allow you to relax and "not die" from hunger. </li><li>  on the golden beach there is a sports center where not only they will be trained in diving, but also in other water sports. </li></ul><p>  Hotel customer reviews warn that for those who like to dive deep right away, this place is not suitable.  Do not despair, because on Thassos there is Marble Beach, where instead of sand there is small marble chips, and diving begins with the first steps. </p>

    <h2>  What to see on the island? </h2><p>  Many tourists believe that in such a small territory there are no worthy sights.  They are fundamentally wrong, which is confirmed by guests of the Natasa Hotel 3 * (Greece, Thassos island).  Their reviews describe interesting places and attractions. </p><ol><li>  Museum of Olive Oil, where you can not only taste all the varieties that exist on the island, but also buy them at a very low price. </li><li>  The historical museum is beyond praise.  Such a rich exposition of ancient sculptures, utensils and clothes from little Thassos is not expected. </li><li>  Convent of St. Michael, the patron saint of the island, which must be visited.  Here, not only peace in the soul sets in, but also silence in the mind, since it is located at an altitude of 250 meters above the sea, and from there a stunning view of Athos and the water surface opens.  The monastery is buried in verdure, each of its guest is greeted by nuns. </li><li>  Old Agora will appeal to lovers of ruins.  Admission is free, the site is not even fenced, so everyone can touch the history of the ancient city in the literal sense of the word. </li></ol><p>  These are far from all the attractions that Natasa Hotel customers describe in their reviews.  Boat trips with a sumptuous dinner and diving into the waters of the Aegean Sea, stunning sunsets from the observation deck near Palataki - an empty large building that was never destined to become a factory, and much more awaits tourists. </p><h2>  Shopping near the hotel </h2><p>  What to bring from a small Greek island?  Here, tourists are offered numerous souvenirs that will remind you of a vacation in Thassos.  It is also worth paying attention to Greek wines and local cheeses, olives and, of course, oils from them. </p><p>  In the monastery you can buy one of the icons that the nuns painted on marble, as well as other objects of worship.  They are all sanctified and, according to vacationers, help to cleanse themselves spiritually. </p>

    <h2>  Why thassos? </h2><p>  Should I go to this island?  This question is asked by those who have not been here.  Thassos is the northern tip of Greece, small, and there is little entertainment.  Before choosing it is worth reading the reviews of those who visited it, because you can not help falling in love with Thassos. </p><p>  Why do the Greeks from the mainland prefer to spend their weekends here?  There are several reasons for this: </p><ul><li>  there are no crowds on the beaches (by the way, the number of vacationers on them increases precisely on the weekend, when vacationers come from the mainland); </li><li>  the clear, slightly cool water of the Aegean Sea refreshes in the heat; </li><li>  wide selection of beaches; </li><li>  pristine nature, lovingly preserved by the Greeks; </li><li>  always free parking spaces, which is important for residents of megacities; </li><li>  stunning sunsets and views of Mount Athos. </li></ul><p>  This is what people come from the mainland for, while tourists are waiting for a meeting with the ancient history of the island, delicious food, healing air and the famous Greek hospitality.  You can start your acquaintance with the island from the Natasa Hotel 3 * hotel. </p>
