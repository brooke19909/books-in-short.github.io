    <h2>  Cons of the hotel </h2><p>  Garni Hotel Koral 3 * reviews get mostly positive, but there are some negative points.  Tourists were unhappy that the five-story building does not have an elevator, and had to climb the upper floors through a narrow and uncomfortable staircase. </p><p>  As visitors note, some rooms are too cramped, and the furniture in them does not allow you to place all the tourist‚Äôs belongings.  This is especially inconvenient for those traveling in pairs or entire families.  The more expensive the room, the less such inconvenience.  Many guests came across rooms with creaky beds or without hangers in the closets, as well as with a TV with lost settings. </p><p>  For those who like to sit in a room with a cup of tea or coffee, it seemed unacceptable the absence of teapots in the rooms.  The only cooler is located at the reception on the ground floor.  Tourists every time when there was a desire to drink a cup of hot drink, had to climb the uncomfortable stairs with boiling water in their hands. </p><p>  Some tourists expressed their dissatisfaction with the fact that at least a few minutes walk to the beach, but the road passes through a dirty area, which has a lot of garbage.  It really can spoil the mood of those who are used to order and cleanliness.  And pebbles on the shore and bottom of the sea are not happy with all vacationers.  In addition, in the afternoon the sea becomes dirty, which invariably causes discontent among vacationers. </p><p>  Some guests also noted the lack of a consistently good Wi-Fi signal.  In principle, it is in every room, but very often the signal disappears or becomes weak.  But this is an insignificant minus for those who came to relax, and not to surf the Internet. </p>
