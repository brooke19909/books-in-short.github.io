Indeed, it is difficult to place von Derviz‚Äôs estate on a par with other buildings characteristic of central Russia.  Nevertheless, this fairy-tale castle has been decorating the Ryazan region for more than 120 years and attracts thousands of tourists from all over Russia. </p><h2>  Von Derviz family story </h2><p>  The noble German Wiese family still moved to Russia under Peter III.  Members of the family quickly adapted on Russian soil, actively participated in the political life of the country, worked hard and earned a considerable fortune by honest work, were engaged in charity work.  For his services, the head of the family Johann-Adolf Wiese received the noble title and the prefix to the name "Von Der". </p><p>  Among the descendants of Johann-Adolf, the name of Pavel Grigoryevich von Derviz is preserved in history.  He was a well-known Ryazan businessman who became famous for his success in the construction of railways.  He built railways from Moscow to Ryazan and from Ryazan to Kozlovka. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lounb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sergey von Derviz" class="if uuid-2704849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100466/2704849.jpg"></div><p>  His favorite business enriched Pavel Grigoryevich - he became one of the richest people in Russia.  At that time, the von Derviz family owned estates in the Ryazan region, Moscow, St. Petersburg and even owned real estate abroad (in Switzerland and France). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, soon the family is overcome by adversity - two children of Pavel Grigorievich die from bone tuberculosis.  Paul could not survive the loss, he soon died of a heart attack.  Part of Paul‚Äôs colossal fortune and the role of the owner of the family passes to the eldest son, Sergei.  It was he who then decided to buy the village of Kiritsa and invested most of the inheritance in the construction of the estate. </p><h2>  Construction of the von Derviz Manor in Kiritsa </h2><p>  The young and ambitious architect Shekhtel Fedor Osipovich was involved in the construction of the manor house and all the buildings adjacent to it.  He was given complete freedom for creativity.  Fedor did an excellent job and was able to fully realize his ideas.  So, in 1889 the estate of von Derviz was built in the Ryazan region. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.com" data-author=": deligent, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Photo of the facade of the estate" class="if uuid-2704814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100466/2704814.jpg"></div><p>  It was a two-story palace of incredible beauty, decorated with arches, towers with spiers and delicate balconies.  From the manor house down to the ravine cascaded down two stairs that connected to a wide terrace.  Below the terrace were flower beds.  Further below you could see an orchard, a pond and a mill. </p><p>  Not far from the estate, the famous Bridge of Love was erected, as well as the Red Gate - two decorative turrets connected by a bridge.  A fence with Gothic-style turrets came down to the lower ponds, and a fence, stylized as a medieval fortress wall, went down to the river.  A cast-iron patterned fence separated the manor from the farmyard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The loss of the estate by the von Derviz family and its further fate </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the fabulous estate of von Derviz soon ruined its owner - Sergey Pavlovich abandoned his family business and after the death of his mother, at the beginning of the 20th century, he sold the estate.  In 1908, the estate was acquired by Prince Gorchakov, but he practically did not live on the estate and did not monitor the economy, so very soon it fell into decay and was partially destroyed by peasants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.geni.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bridge on the territory of the estate" class="if uuid-2704870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100466/2704870.jpg"></div><p>  At the end of the revolution, von Derviz‚Äôs estate was nationalized.  Since then, an agricultural school was located in its walls, then a technical school, and then a rest house. </p><h2>  Homestead today </h2><p>  From 1938 to the present day, a children's medical sanatorium has been operating within the walls of the estate, which specializes in the treatment of children with osteoarticular tuberculosis.  Amazing coincidence, isn't it?  The estate itself was preserved, but much has lost over the years of devastation and has undergone many renovations and repairs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotokto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deer sculptures on the estate" class="if uuid-2704819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100466/2704819.jpg"></div><h2>  Decor and interior decoration </h2><p>  The mansion was designed by the architect Schechtel in the style of the Italian Renaissance.  In the center of a two-story building is a risalit with a front porch adjoining it.  On both sides of it are semicircular ramps with large lamps in the form of female figures.  The facade of the estate is decorated with various elements of Renaissance architecture - stucco molding, double arches.  The facade is decorated with large rust, and the base is made of granite. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The luxurious decoration of the von Derviz manor is a harmonious combination of elements and motifs of different styles - oriental, classic and gothic.  The richness of decoration and style diversity is achieved through the use of paintings, stained-glass windows, wood carvings, silk fabrics and stucco in the interior decoration. </p><p>  On the ground floor there is a living room and a dining room.  Carved wooden panels and paintings were used in the design, and stained-glass windows were made according to the author's drawings of the architect Shekhtel himself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lounb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Homestead Decor in Kiritsy" class="if uuid-2704859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100466/2704859.jpg"></div><p>  On the second floor there is a white front hall, decorated with gilded stucco molding and a picturesque ceiling.  The main staircase is made of marble, and the walls of the landing are decorated with landscape paintings and lamps in the form of statues.  Above the staircase there is a stained glass window depicting the family coat of arms of von Dervizov. </p><p>  The mansion has a special living room - it is called Chinese or Oriental.  Silk fabrics on the walls, ornament, painted wooden panels, as well as a ceiling decorated with a stylized painting in the shape of a dragon give it sophistication and oriental flavor.  There is also a winter garden on the estate - a corner room on the second floor, decorated with large stained-glass windows with a light lamp. </p><h2>  Where is von Derviz Manor House located? </h2><p>  The von Derviz manor is located in the Ryazan region, Spassky district, in the village of Kiritsy.  Manor coordinates: N 54 ¬∞ 17.548 'E 40 ¬∞ 21.350'. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="54.29335512209439" data-lng="40.357664800000066" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/1/5/5/7155.png"></div><h2>  How to get to the estate? </h2><p>  Obviously, first you need to get to the city of Ryazan - the von Derviz manor is only 60 km from the city on the M5 highway in a southerly direction.  Railway and bus connections between Ryazan and many other cities of Russia are very well developed, so there will definitely not be any problems with the road. </p><p>  But here you are in Ryazan.  What is the next way?  There are several options: </p><ul><li>  By bus. </li></ul><p>  Unfortunately, there is no direct route to the village of Kiritsa, but you can get there in passing.  For example, from the Ryazan central bus station, on Moskovsky Highway, buses and minibuses regularly go towards the village of Saray, just past the village of Kiritsy. </p><p>  For more information about passing routes and flight numbers, see the ticket office of the station. </p><ul><li>  By car. </li></ul><p>  It‚Äôs great if you have your own car - in just 1 hour you can easily get from Ryazan to the village of Kiritsy.  You need to go along the M5 highway on a ring road, focusing on the sign "Sanatorium Kiritsa".  You do not have to worry about parking spaces - there is a car parking near the estate. </p><h2>  What to look for when visiting the manor of Baron von Derviz? </h2><p>  Entrance to the estate is free, but you cannot enter the building itself - only staff and children undergoing treatment are allowed to enter the sanatorium.  If you want to visit the estate as part of an organized tourist group, then it is advisable to coordinate your visit with the administration in advance or use the services of a travel agency. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turbina.ru" data-author=": annite, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Red Entrance Gate" class="if uuid-2704896" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100466/2704896.jpg"></div><p>  It is important to understand that on the territory of the sanatorium you can meet children in wheelchairs - these are patients of the sanatorium undergoing rehabilitation.  Do not be scared and pay attention.  Once on the territory of the von Derviz manor, be sure to take a walk through the manor park, admire the arched bridge and reach the Red Entrance Gate. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Many people have already visited this bewitching place and willingly share their impressions.  Tourists note that getting to the estate is not difficult - the road is simple, it will not work to get lost.  Many travelers turned out to be passing through here and have never regretted that they decided to look into Kiritsy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baron von Derviz Manor" class="if uuid-2704909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100466/2704909.jpg"></div><p>  A visit to the von Derviz Manor in Kiritsa will make a lasting impression on everyone.  The view of the medieval palace, harmoniously blending into the surrounding landscape, is simply mesmerizing.  Having looked at the photo of the von Derviz estate, having studied the history of the owner‚Äôs family, I immediately want to go to Kiritsa to see this object of Russia's cultural heritage with my own eyes. </p>
