According to many travelers who have already been fortunate enough to visit there, in fact, everyone will find something to their liking, and the friendly and smiling locals, among other things, will also give a sense of a fairy tale. </p><p>  <strong><span>Kiev: Attractions</span> - General Description</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiev sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5067/179881.jpg" width="600"></div>  As you know, the geographical map over the past decades has changed a lot.  The collapse of several <span>federal states</span> created new independent countries.  These included Ukraine, located in the very center of Eastern Europe.  The capital of this young state is Kiev - a city with a rich centuries-old past, one of the ten largest on the entire European continent.

    <p>  It is no secret that the historical fate of this beautiful ancient city is associated with a number of political and cultural events that are reflected in architectural monuments.  All this can be seen with your own eyes, walking along the streets, looking at old buildings, reading inscriptions on places of worn <span>memorial boards,</span> peering at the faces of monuments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The doors of a large number of museums and libraries, theaters and concert venues are open for both Kiev residents and guests of the capital.  And “Kiev.  Sights »- photos that are usually sold in a set - must be in souvenirs brought home. </p><p>  <strong>Kiev.</strong>  <strong>Sights.</strong>  <strong>What to see first?</strong> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiev sights photo" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10499/180493.jpg" width="600"></div>  Located on the banks of the glorious Dnieper River, this ancient city amazes with its beauties, the atmosphere of warmth, comfort and tranquility.

    <p>  It should be noted that it is precisely in Kiev that modest ancient buildings and magnificent modern complexes made of glass and concrete are successfully combined.  Why is the Ukrainian capital annually attracting such a huge number of tourists?  An important role in this was played by the temperate climate and fertile land.  They turned into a measure a noisy metropolis into a green paradise. </p><p>  Most people who have visited here at least once dream of if not to live in this city, then at least come here again to walk along the chestnut alleys of Khreschatyk, the main street of the metropolis, which also turns into a pedestrian zone on weekends and holidays. </p><p>  <strong>Kiev is a city that literally breathes history</strong> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For example, every believer seeks to visit the Kiev Pechersk Lavra, in the ancient caves of which holy relics are stored.  And the <span>St. Sophia Cathedral</span> , laid down by Prince Yaroslav the Wise, amazes visitors with images of saints executed on the walls and columns in the form of frescoes. </p><p>  A book called “Kiev.  Sights.  Guidebook ”is also useful to you.  Do you want to get to know the city more closely or even to be related to it?  Go to St. Andrew's Descent.  This is a place that artists, theatergoers and art lovers have chosen for their exhibitions and vernissages. </p><p>  Grateful residents of the city embodied the tribute to historical figures in the monuments to Prince Vladimir (the Baptist of Russia), <span>Bohdan Khmelnytsky</span> (commander and leader of the national liberation movement), Taras Shevchenko (the great Ukrainian patriotic poet). </p><p>  The monument "Motherland" is the central figure of the Museum of the History of the Second World War and is stunning with its majesty. </p><p>  <strong>Section 3. Kiev.</strong>  <strong>Sights.</strong>  <strong>Landscape Alley</strong> <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiev sights guide" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10499/180495.jpg" width="600"></div>  Along with the well-known buildings, churches, monuments, museums, galleries, boulevards and <span>parks, Kiev has</span> prepared many exciting surprises.

    <p>  Passing to the Andreevsky descent, you just need to turn off Bolshaya Zhytomyrskaya Street, and the marvelous beauties of the Landscape Alley will open your eyes.  It is here that the townspeople bring their nonresident guests to finally fall in love with them in their capital. </p><p>  This unusual park surprises visitors with mosaic panels depicting various animals in bizarre poses.  Children especially like it here. </p><p>  Small sculptures of fairy-tale men sitting on multi-colored stone pillows cause their delight.  The figures of the Flying Cow, Ballerina, Hedgehog in the fog make the square bright and colorful to such an extent that even the most cloudy day cannot spoil the atmosphere of the holiday. </p>
