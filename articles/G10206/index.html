In the Kingdom of Belgium</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The first mention of a fortified settlement in the place where Brussels is located appeared in 979.  It was built by the dukes of Lower Lorraine, choosing one of the islands on the Senna River.  Six years later, everything was surrounded by walls. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Very early, a small town got the right to manage independently - in 1229.  And after a hundred years he already has trade privileges.  The marshland surrounding the city was drained.  The name Brussels itself can be translated as “settlement in a swamp”.  It was there, in the former swamps, that the Great Square was defeated.  In its center stood the town hall, which surrounded the ring with houses.  A fortress wall was later built.  In the 14th century, the construction of a new, more powerful city wall was completed, in which there were several gates. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is brussels" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1206342.jpg" width="600"></div>  In the Middle Ages, Brussels many times passed from hand to hand of various rulers from France, Burgundy, Spain, Austria and Holland.  Since 1830, after a fairly peaceful revolution, in the country independent of Holland, Brussels <strong> </strong>  gradually becoming a measured calm city of aesthetes, romantics and gourmets.  Neither the First nor the Second World Wars went around Belgium.  She was occupied.

    <h2>  Belgium is a federal country </h2><p>  The state is divided into three regions: Flemish, Walloon and tiny Brussels between them.  And the question of where Brussels is located has an answer: in the Brussels metropolitan area.  Relations between these two areas are very tense.  For a long time, the French language was common to the country.  But this is the native language for the Walloons, who in no way associate themselves with the French.  There are about four million of them.  In the Flemish region, the official language is Dutch.  This is approximately six million inhabitants.  In the area of ​​Liège, they speak German.  There are three language communities in this small federal country.  In a dispute between two languages ​​(German does not count), <span>national identity</span> is manifested <span>.</span>  Where is <span>Brussels, the capital of</span> Belgium?  In a state with federal division. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mentality </h2><p>  Two groups of nationalities that did not form a single nation are divided by hostility.  Flemish and Walloon are connected by the capital and the general government.  Well, maybe the royal family and the football team.  And so even their emblems are different: a rooster is from Wallonia, and a lion is from Flemish.  The population primarily speaks French where Brussels is located.  The Brussels-Capital Region consists of 19 municipalities.  About two million inhabitants live in the capital.  High affluence, independence, good relations with neighbors - this is what an exemplary Belgian citizen strives for.  An atmosphere of goodwill pervades the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is Brussels the capital" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1206345.jpg" width="475"></div>  In the Kingdom of <span>Belgium, where the</span> city ​​of Brussels <span>is located</span> , <strong> </strong>  it is the capital of both the European Union and the federal state.  The whole society as a whole can be attributed to the middle class.  Of course, aristocrats have survived here.  Residents calmly, without envy, look at them and are primarily proud of their middle-class values.

    <h2>  Where is Brussels located?  In which country? </h2><p>  The correct name of this state is the Kingdom of Belgium.  What is it famous for?  A special attitude to cleanliness.  Everyone is in awe of her.  The houses that are now being built like medieval castles, with stained glass windows, are ideally clean.  On Saturdays, after a weekly general cleaning, wash the sidewalk in front of the house. </p><p>  Food is generally a special conversation.  Belgians simply bow before food.  Their products are considered the best in Europe.  They like to eat tight and tasty.  Their cuisine is French, but without newfangled frills, when you want to know not the name of the cook, but the name of the artist, who so curiously laid out everything on a plate.  To products sold in sausage and pastry shops, and even to small stalls, they make the same high demands as to first-class restaurants.  The highest class chocolate in Belgium, especially pralines.  The company "Sniffer" delivers it to the royal court.  White chocolate, like black, is diverging from countries all over the world.  Fried fries are one of the favorite treats. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is Brussels" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/1206582.jpg"></div>  Thick slices about five to six cm long, tender inside and covered with a golden crisp on top, are sold everywhere.  If they are taken away, then they will be given a fair portion of mayonnaise.  And there are also alcoholic drinks, and beer, which is released by the monks and which is never sold abroad.

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  A person who has fallen into the capital will not have a question about where Brussels is located, in which country.  Since the tourist is surrounded by the unique historical atmosphere of the Big Square (Grand Dance), with which the city began and which is considered one of the most beautiful <span>squares in Europe.</span>  It is imperative to see three pissing figures on it - a boy, a girl and a dog.  And also inspect the town hall - this is the most noticeable building in the square.  Her cone crowns the weather vane.  He is the archangel defeating Satan.  There is another amazing structure made in the form of a molecule - Atomium. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the city of Brussels" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1206348.jpg" width="550"></div>  From its observation deck you can take panoramic pictures of the city.  You need to explore the city in a city called the European Quarter.  It is in it that the headquarters of the European Union is located, here the European Commission sits.  The Mini-Europe park is also curious.  It contains models of the most remarkable buildings of the continent.  In addition, there are about eighty museums in the Brussels region. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Brussels Panorama" class="if" height="118" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1206349.jpg" width="600"></div>
