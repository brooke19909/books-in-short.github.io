    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  You always want to buy quality goods for relatively little money.  But it is not possible to do this often.  This model of the DVR from the company "Prestigio" has very good technical specifications and at the same time is not too expensive.  A metal case immediately catches your eye.  Immediately the impression of high quality and durability of the product.  The rather massive optics make this recorder more like a modern digital camera. </p><p>  But even more interesting is behind the shockproof housing of the device, as evidenced by numerous consumer reviews.  <span>The Prestigio</span> RoadRunner 555 dashcam boasts an SPCA6330A processor, which uninterruptedly provides smooth video shooting and high quality.  And besides this, the device has a huge number of functions, each of which will be discussed in detail in this article. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  High quality video </h2><p>  Some DVRs do not give the owner any advantage.  And everything is due to such a low quality video that it is almost impossible to make out what is happening.  But all this is already behind, because the Prestigio RoadRunner 555 car DVR appeared. Reviews among motorists about this device are almost always positive.  Most often pay attention to a fairly high quality video.  This is not surprising, because there is a 3-megapixel camera installed.  There is a CMOS sensor and 6 levels of lenses.  This ensures a high smoothness of frame change (30 frames / sec) and an excellent viewing angle (156 degrees). </p>

    <p>  If we take into account that Full HD video is being recorded, then these characteristics are simply surprising.  The picture is quite saturated and bright.  The video shows absolutely all the details.  Even a dirty room can be considered.  With such a registrar, you will feel completely safe in the event of a conflict on the road. </p><h2>  Loop recording and G-sensor </h2><p>  Both of these functions are extremely useful and should be present on a modern navigator.  At least that's what many motorists and experts say.  What is loop recording?  Imagine a situation where your dashcam takes photos of the traffic situation for days on end.  At the same time, the place on the flash drive is not infinite, but no one usually clears it.  And then one fine moment the memory is full.  Usually this happens at the wrong time.  But the loop recording function works so that the device continues to record information, while deleting the oldest and unnecessary. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many ordinary motorists leave reviews about the Prestigio RoadRunner 555 PCDVRR555, its functionality and filling.  Discussions touched on a feature called the G-sensor.  This is a sensor that detects sudden acceleration and braking.  If you get into an accident, the video recorded with the G-sensor will not be deleted during loop recording. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car dvr prestigio roadrunner 555 reviews" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18954/1813168.jpg" width="404"></div>

    <h2>  Proven brand for years to come </h2><p>  The Prestigio company has been pleasing consumers with a wide variety of IT products for more than 10 years.  The company successfully sells its products in more than 80 countries.  This already indicates that the products of Prestigio are in high popularity and demand.  This is because the manufacturer offers reasonably high quality at a reasonable price, and there is no special mark-up for the brand either. </p><p>  Over the past 6 years, Prestigio has been a leader in GPS navigation in Russia and the CIS countries, as well as Central Europe.  In the direction of "Prestigio" very often there are positive reviews.  The Prestigio RoadRunner 555 PCDVRR555 video recorder is a high-quality and durable device.  The rugged case is reliably protected from scratches, advanced electronics do not give failures.  Everything works smoothly and efficiently, which simply cannot but rejoice, moreover, the situation does not change at all over time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Motion detection system </h2><p>  Shooting in Full HD requires a fairly large amount of space on the drive.  That is why the developers have implemented a motion detection system.  The essence of her work is that when a new moving object appears in the frame, recording begins.  It turns out that leaving the car at night, you can use the DVR as a surveillance camera.  At the same time, space is saved during downtime, which is very important.  All this, along with loop recording and a G-sensor, makes this DVR almost completely autonomous.  All you have to do is remember to recharge the device. </p><p>  If necessary, you can take the DVR with you wherever you go.  It fits easily in your pocket.  The shock-resistant case with scratch protection allows you to use the device even with outdoor activities. </p>

    <h2>  Prestigio RoadRunner 555 Car DVR: customer reviews </h2><p>  When buying such a technique, you should always turn to consumer opinion.  Indeed, it sometimes turns out that branded expensive products are no better than a budget model from a little-known manufacturer.  As for this model of the DVR, then there are a lot of positive feedback.  Most often, the following advantages are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  shockproof and stylish device case; </li><li>  high build quality of the registrar; </li><li>  simple and intuitive menu navigation; </li><li>  G-sensor system, loop recording, etc .; </li><li>  compact, does not impair frontal visibility. </li></ul><p>  As for the cost, such a pleasure will cost about 3 thousand rubles.  According to customers, this is the best price / quality ratio.  After all, for the money you get a durable, reliable device with good optics.  The video quality is very decent, and not only during the day, but also at night, which is quite important. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dvr prestigio roadrunner 555 pcdvrr555 reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18954/1813197.jpg" width="591"></div>

    <h2>  Good doesn't mean expensive </h2><p>  Many of us are used to finding a budget product that meets certain requirements quite difficult.  If you want a good DVR, you need to give 7 thousand rubles or more.  However, if you dig deeper, this is not entirely true.  The company "Prestigio" offers a fairly high-tech video recorder at the best price.  Compared to competitors, devices with similar characteristics are more expensive, starting from 5.5 thousand and higher. </p><p>  Very often they pay attention to a fairly high-quality lens, there are often references to it in the reviews of the owners.  The Prestigio RoadRunner 555 with a viewing angle of 156 degrees almost got rid of the fisheye effect.  If slight distortion is noticeable, then only at the corners of the image.  It is noteworthy that the device shoots <span>video with a resolution of</span> 1920 √ó 1080, while the video files do not take so much time.  All thanks to the H.264 video codec, which is considered one of the most economical.  Therefore, you can put a lot of records on a flash drive. </p><h2>  A few words about the device screen </h2><p>  The gadget's screen is large enough, the diagonal is 7.6 inches.  This can not but rejoice, because such a display allows you to comfortably consider all the details of the recording.  And just navigating through the menu is quite convenient, but not only thanks to the wide screen.  The developers made managing the device as simple and straightforward as possible.  Even a beginner will understand navigation.  But just in case, you can use the instructions, where there is all the necessary detailed information on management.  The screen is bright and saturated, pixelation is almost invisible. </p><p>  Another important point - you can install a flash drive to 64 gigabytes.  To save and remember the settings, there is a small amount of internal memory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="car dvr prestigio roadrunner 555 pcdvrr555 reviews" class="if" height="446" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18954/1813184.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  Are there any disadvantages? </h2><p>  Despite the large number of strengths, the Prestigio DVR has its drawbacks.  The most urgent problem that occurs in almost every second user - the computer does not see the device.  Therefore, you have to remove the USB flash drive and use a card reader.  Not very convenient, but nowhere to go.  Also, consumers note that the G-sensor is too sensitive.  It works when hitting even a small pit.  As a result, almost all of the memory on the device will be occupied by files that are not deleted.  Therefore, loop recording will not work as expected. </p><p>  In addition to all of the above, I would like to note that the device does not like low temperatures.  There are freezes that are fixed by restarting or everything normalizes after the recorder warms up.  This is where the shortcomings of Prestigio end.  In fact, there are not so many cons.  In most cases, they are non-critical.  For example, the G-sensor actually works as it should, so it‚Äôs more likely to sin on the quality of the road surface. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prestigio roadrunner 555 owner reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18954/1813154.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  So we have reviewed the Prestigio DVR.  As you can see, this is a budget option and, nevertheless, the quality here is at the highest level.  No wonder "Prestigio" is considered the virtuoso of modern electronics.  The company has all the necessary quality certificates.  This model boasts excellent optics, a robust body and small dimensions.  This is a really high-quality video recorder that shoots not only during the day in good weather, but also at night, unlike some other products. </p><p>  Progress does not stand still, and Prestigio is constantly improving its electronic devices.  This also applies to DVRs.  A few years ago, a model with similar characteristics would cost several times more.  Now it is more than an affordable product, which at this price has a lot of advantages.  This is clearly seen in the many positive consumer reviews of the Prestigio RoadRunner 555 PCDVRR555 Car DVR. </p>
