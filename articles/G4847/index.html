It was founded in the 18th century, when French forwarders landed on these lands.  They were followed by the colonists, who formed a full-fledged settlement on this site.  Later, the land became the possession of England, as a result of which this settlement was named after the British Queen - Victoria.  Today, the capital of the Seychelles is located between the mountains that surround it on three sides.  And from the fourth it is washed by the waters of the Gulf of the Indian Ocean. </p><h2>  How to get to Victoria? </h2><p>  You can get to this town, as well as to any other point remote from us - by plane, however, you will have to fly with a transfer.  Bangkok, Paris, London, Johannesburg, Amsterdam, Rome, Milan and Frankfurt - these are the cities from which the capital of the Seychelles receives flights.  The airport is located on the island of Mahe, near Victoria, so getting to the city after landing will be quick and easy (by taxi or public transport).  There are three terminals at the airport - international, cargo and home.  It was founded in 1972 by order of the British Queen Elizabeth II. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capital of Seychelles" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/624252.jpg" width="600"></div>

A little cooler (which is not at all felt) here in July and August.  The thermometer drops to 28-29 Celsius.

    <h2>  Hotel issue </h2><p>  Now we will consider what housing conditions the Seychelles islands can offer us.  Victoria, the capital, is the most built-up city in the entire archipelago.  There are hotels of various categories, ranging from two stars, ending with fashionable bungalows and cottages.  The first are located in the city, close to the center, or in <span>sleeping areas.</span>  If you are planning an economical <span>vacation in the Seychelles,</span> then you need to book a room here.  Cottages, penthouses, bungalows and simply expensive hotels are located on the ocean, of course, with a stunning view from the window.  However, in comparison with other world resorts (Bahamas, Canaries, etc.), rental prices of even the most elite housing are not too high here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capital of Seychelles photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/624250.jpg" width="600"></div>

The food that goes around here is coconuts, seafood and spices called curry.  Local restaurateurs are not particularly sophisticated, and in order to feed tourists, as a rule, combine elements of Creole and European cuisines.  In an establishment called Islander, you can eat very economically at any time of the day.  It serves both ordinary burgers and more exotic dishes that gravitate according to the type of preparation for the local indigenous cuisine.  In the Marie Antoinete restaurant you can just taste the truly Creole cuisine, with all its spices and specialties.  But the institution La Perle Noir is famous for its high prices and first-class service.  It is the perfect place for a romantic evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Seychelles capital airport" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/624249.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  Once the capital of <span>Seychelles</span> was founded by the French.  Their colony was evicted on the shores of Mahe Island, and a Possession Stone was installed in honor of the development of new lands.  Now it is a memorable place for all Seychelles.  If you stroll along the central avenue of the city, you will definitely meet a mini-copy of Big Ben, the one that is located in England.  Next to him, you should definitely take a picture for memory.  Also, numerous cathedrals, and most importantly, belonging to different religions, boasts the capital of the Seychelles.  Photos of the city show us that on the streets there are the following sacred buildings: the Indian pagoda, the English Church of St. Paul, the <span>Catholic Cathedral</span> and the adjacent episcopate.  Here you can see beautiful images that mimic biblical stories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capital of Seychelles Victoria photo" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/624248.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  All purchases that can be made in Victoria, and indeed, in the Seychelles, are local souvenirs, trinkets, food, as well as <span>national costumes</span> and paraphernalia.  There are no shops, shopping centers, boutiques here, but shops with designer goods are at every turn.  Honestly, buying souvenirs here is not so interesting.  They are not as bright and original as in India or Thailand.  But the national Seychelles hats are a real memory of the rest here.  And such a thing is quite inexpensive.  Also note that you can weave it yourself.  Local residents are ready to provide a free master class on weaving such hats, and you will become a master no worse than themselves. </p><h2>  Travel and entertainment </h2><p>  If you are planning an economical vacation, then most likely you will not leave Mahe.  The capital of Seychelles itself - Victoria (see photo in the article) - is scarce on nightlife.  Because tourists go to the west of the island, to the bay of Intense.  There are bars, restaurants, night clubs and other entertainment venues around the clock.  The bay itself is also famous.  Emerald waters washed by the white coral sand cannot leave anyone indifferent.  You can swim in the sea at any time of the day.  There are no storms, as this is a cozy bay, therefore it is also an ideal place to relax with children. </p>
