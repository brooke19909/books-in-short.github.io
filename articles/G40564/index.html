All Inclusive Hotels in Turkey</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  You may not have been to Turkey yet.  Or, on the contrary, they visited her, having paid a tour to a five-star hotel.  Liked?  Still would!  True, one significant drawback of such hotels is the high price of accommodation.  People who want to save some money will no doubt like the information below.  In Turkey, the infrastructure and service for tourists are developed just fine.  This country attracts various categories of travelers: beach ‚Äúseals‚Äù, restless explorers of attractions, mothers with young children, and young people eager for entertainment.  Even lovers of solitude and contemplation of natural beauties will find a place to relax in Turkey.  But in this article we will focus only on one resort, which adorns the country's Mediterranean coast.  It will be about Antalya.  As you know, hotels in Turkey are famous for their "ol inclusive" system, which is also loved by our compatriots.  So, we suggest considering <span>hotels in Antalya</span> (4 stars, all inclusive). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Antalya 4 Star All Inclusive Hotels" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/670794.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <h2>  What is the Turkish "four" </h2><p>  With all responsibility, it can be argued that such hotels offer an excellent vacation for a reasonable price.  A tourist who has already visited the "five", once in the hotel one category below, will constantly exclaim: "Why pay more?"  Indeed, why?  Just to get to the beach twenty meters less?  Or to choose a snack in a restaurant not from five different options, but from seven?  Or will we measure in steps the adjacent territory of a four-star hotel and find out with sadness that it is a couple of tens of square meters less than in the "five"?  Do you need it?  Indeed, all-inclusive four-star hotels in Turkey offer the same standard set of services as the most fashionable hotels.  Only the prices are lower.  The hotel can be on the second strip or across the road from the beach.  It can be located near the old city or directly in it, and can occupy the green areas of satellite villages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey antalya hotels prices" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/672934.jpg" width="550"></div>

Even fewer are those where ‚Äúsuper all-inclusive‚Äù is practiced (under such a system guests are served free imported alcoholic drinks).  Moreover, the "four" of Antalya differ in prices.  Sometimes the difference in room rates is quite serious.  Compare for yourself: in ‚ÄúArgos 4 *‚Äù - 1572 rubles per room per night, in Lara Park in the popular beach area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLara - from two thousand rubles.  The Best Western Plus Khan and Acra Park Barut hotels are already asking for 2,555 and 2,751 rubles for an identical room.  respectively.  The IC Airport 4 * hotel also offers all-inclusive meals, although, judging by the name, only tourists with an early departure stop there.  But this does not prevent the administration from asking for 3,865 rubles for a standard number.  Based on prices, the cheapest hotels in Antalya (4 stars, ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù) are Lara Adrianus (1310 rubles) and Argos.  And the most expensive hotel of this category is Miracle Resort (from 4127 rubles). </p><h2>  Which resort area to choose? </h2><p>  The answer to this question should be sought based on your preferences.  In the old city there are more "three rubles" in which young people live.  There is a rocky relief, it is possible to go down (and, naturally, climb) along endless steps.  The beach, most likely, will be a platform with ladders for entering the sea.  Therefore, older people and parents with young children need to think three times before choosing the center of Antalya for relaxation.  But there are many discos, bars, nightclubs.  Antalya hotels (4 stars, ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù) are located in the satellite villages - Lara, Kundu, Konyaalti.  In the first two, the beaches are sandy, a gentle entry into the sea is exactly what is needed for a baby up to three years old.  Lovers of ‚Äúwarm bones‚Äù on pebbles prefer to settle in the Konyaalti region.  And tourists who prefer solitude and silence choose Mermerli. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best hotels of Antalya" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/670807.jpg"></div>

It should be noted right away that it is rather difficult to please our compatriots.  So, a quiet hotel, where everything breathes bliss and peace, they characterize how ‚Äúyou can die with boredom‚Äù, a hotel with animation is called noisy.  Someone perceives the presence of Russian tourists as a disaster, while others are lost in the society of educated Europeans.  But still there are hotels in Antalya that everyone liked.  If we consider only those where they practice the all-inclusive food system, we can distinguish the Falcon Club, Lara, Best Western Plus Khan hotels, Antalya Hotel, and Grida City hotels.  What can you count on in such hotels?  On the beautiful views, a restaurant with a large selection of dishes, a large pool (and not even one), animation, free Wi-Fi.  Often in hotels of this category, the price of a vacation includes visits to their own spa center. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Antalya hotels 4" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/670826.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels for active tourists </h2><p>  Very often hotels in Antalya (4 stars, all inclusive) in terms of infrastructure and level of service are no different from luxury hotels.  Only their distance from the beach lowers their status.  Well, if you are not burdened with years, young children and sores, you can walk for about twenty minutes - through the park, along the streets or along the steps from a steep bank.  Such a path separates from the sea, for example, Best Western Plus Khan and Grida City.  They are located in the city center and are the best suited for active tourists, because museums and other attractions are within easy reach.  A half-hour walk through a beautiful park will lead you to a sandy beach.  Too lazy to stomp legs?  Most hotels provide a free shuttle service to the coast. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="All Inclusive Turkey Hotels" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/670822.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels for lazy tourists </h2><p>  This category of vacationers selects hotels on the first coastline so that you can reach the sea at any time.  <span>The resort of Antalya,</span> 4 * hotels of which are located sometimes on the very shore, stretches for many kilometers.  In this regard, the tourist has a lot to choose from: sandy, pebble, rocky beaches.  It should be borne in mind that four-star first-line hotels are often located on a high bank.  Such, for example, "Antalya Hotel 4 *".  But from the ‚ÄúBilem High Class‚Äù to the beach you only need to cross the road.  The only drawback is the rocky shore with a pontoon platform for tanning.  From "Agros" to the sea you need to go about 150 meters.  A beautiful pebble beach is located across the road from the Blue Garden.  Of the similar hotels, one can also name Aspen and La Boutique Antalya (there is no private pool, but it is located next to the Dedeman water park). </p>
