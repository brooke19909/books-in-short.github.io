Rustaveli - the street on which it is located.  The area in which lush green lands are located has a four-hundred-year history. </p><h2>  Lianozovsky park </h2><p>  The wealthy landowner Prince Kurakin built the estate on the present territory, created a garden and dug a pond, which is today.  Once, his house was visited by Krylov, Fonvizin, Rokotov.  After the war with the French, there was a lot of destruction, but new houses were gradually rebuilt.  And in the nineteenth century, the Moscow businessman Lianozov began to own the manor house, thanks to which a village appeared for Moscow dacha owners Lianozovo. </p><h2>  Park - decoration of the area </h2><p>  To this day, Lianozovsky Park, which adorns the surroundings of the neighborhood with its greenery, is a favorite vacation spot among the <span>indigenous people</span> .  A hundred years ago, capital gentlemen led their ladies along the alleys of the park, and now it is a favorite place for <span>modern youth</span> and local residents.  It was in this green land that entertaining attractions first appeared.  The authorities began to hold mass public events - thanks to this, the park received the status of a state institution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Goncharovsky park" class="if" height="475" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/820490.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Park branch </h2><p>  Having created an unusual corner for relaxing in Lianozovsky Park, local authorities decided to make a branch of this unusual place for entertainment.  So Goncharovsky Park appeared.  It is located in the Butyrsky <span>district of Moscow.</span> </p><p>  Goncharovsky Park on the street  Rustaveli is a green land that has occupied an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than six hectares.  Previously, the monument of landscape gardening art was abandoned and was in unsuitable condition.  But now Goncharovsky Park is completely unrecognizable - its beautification was begun in May two thousand of the thirteenth year, and the result was not long in coming. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Goncharovsky park photo" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20787/820493.jpg" width="350"></div>

All three months of the summer, the reading room welcomes guests from twelve to twenty hours daily. </p><p>  Every Saturday at eight in the evening on the site of the Goncharovsky Park for children and their parents will be shown new author's cartoons.  For the youngest guests, the organizers made it possible not only to read books, but also to participate in interactive games. </p><p>  Throughout the summer, various cultural and entertainment events will be held for vacationers.
