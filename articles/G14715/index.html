This also applies to Otium Hotel Seven Seas 5 *.  Reviews in 2015 indicate the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  the design of the buildings, as well as the interior of the hotel, look somewhat ascetic; </li><li>  different changes of waiters in a restaurant have a different attitude to their work (someone does everything with a soul and responsibly, while someone does it scornfully and sloppy); </li><li>  on the beach at the entrance to the water there is a slippery stone slab, which can be hit hard in case of a fall; </li><li>  the hotel often recorded cases of poisoning; </li><li>  in the exchange office on the hotel territory is just a predatory rate; </li><li>  between the bathroom and the bathroom, instead of the wall, frosted glass is installed, which, translucent, creates some inconvenience. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The Otium Hotel Seven Seas 5 * is very popular.  The reviews suggest that this hotel deserves its high five-star status.  Everything is done here for the comfort and pleasure of guests.  The friendliness and smile of the staff from the first day conquers and disarms.  The picturesque and thought-out area pleases not only with its beauty, but also with functionality.  And, of course, the all-inclusive meal plan complements the picture. </p><p>  Claims by guests to the hotel are immaterial.  For example, for a five-star hotel, the interior could be brighter and more original.  Also, some complaints are caused by the beach, namely, an inconvenient entry into the sea.  But if you walk a few meters to the side (to the coastline of a neighboring hotel of the same chain), you can enjoy the soft sandy bottom without a single stone. </p>
