    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Travelers mostly arrive at the Islazul Oasis 2 (Cuba) from the Juan Gualberto Gomez International Airport.  It is twenty kilometers from the hotel.  As a rule, tourists use a shuttle service.  And since the hotel stands at the entrance to the famous resort, the residents of the hotel, to which our article is devoted, get to the ocean first, and pick them up last. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Islazul oasis 2 varadero" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/766654.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Islazul Oasis 2 is a two-hour drive from the capital of the island of Havana.  But it is much closer to the international airport.  Transfer from there in time is no more than half an hour.  Its location, according to tourists, is more attractive than other hotels of this kind.  First of all, it is remote from the tourist center of Varadero (actually standing on the road), which ensures its inhabitants peace and quiet.  In addition, it is close to the Matanzas district, where you can inexpensively take a taxi and take a look at the life of ordinary Cubans.  The center of Varadero can be reached on foot - not really in a hurry somewhere in half an hour.  Or take a taxi in just five minutes.  Some "fours" and "fives" are even further from the center, at the very end of the sand spit. </p><h2>  Varadero </h2><p>  This is the most important and, one might say, an exclusive tourism center in Cuba.  It has everything that the island is famous for and why foreigners visit it.  The azure expanse of water, white sand, warm water, scuba diving and acquaintance with exotic fish and <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãanimals,</span> clubs and parties - all this awaits you here.  Varadero has practically no local attractions, but they are more than replaced by the most beautiful beaches in the world and the best rum on the planet.  And if you want to see Cuba, you can easily find many travel companies and <span>individuals who are</span> ready to send you on a trip to any corner of the island.  That is why both Russians and foreigners increasingly choose <span>Varadero</span> as their vacation spot <span>.</span>  <span>Varadero</span> Islazul Oasis 2, although located a bit off the beaten track, is a great starting point for travel and is suitable for both beach lovers and avid excursionists.  But the "party people" is better to choose some hotel closer to the center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Islazul oasis 2 carabara varadero" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/766651.jpg" width="550"></div>

There is no access to the World Wide Web in Islazul Oasis 2 (Varadero), but this service is only in the top five, and even then the Internet is very slow and expensive.

The hotel provides a doctor.  Here you can rent a bicycle, scooter or motorcycle, for greater convenience of traveling around the island.

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Islazul Oasis 2 has two restaurants and three bars.  Buffet breakfast is served in the main hotel establishment.  Here you can also try dishes of Cuban or more familiar European cuisine for lunch and dinner.  There is also an √† la carte restaurant.  The hotel practices different <span>food systems.</span>  The price includes breakfast, but you can pay for trips with all inclusive.  The latter system gives you the right to enter the √† la carte restaurant.  For breakfast, the choice is not very large, but all the products are fresh, and there is the most necessary.  Tourists write that they give eggs, vegetables, fruits, sausages, cereals, cheeses, pancakes, pancakes, tea and coffee.  Fans of excursions prefer to take only breakfast, because they still have to eat day and evening in the restaurants and cafes of Varadero.  But if you still decide to enjoy the cuisine of the Islazul Oasis 2 hotel (Cuba), this does not mean that you made the wrong choice.  The food here, according to tourists, is very tasty and varied.  For example, on Wednesdays, king prawns are served here for dinner.  Seafood comes every other day.  Very tasty soups.  Different types of meat - chicken, rabbit, pork.  From fruits - guava, watermelon, papaya, grapefruit.  Twice a day they give ice cream.  Great coffee in the lobby bar.  Fine rum of excellent quality is poured everywhere. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Islazul oasis hotel 2" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/766646.jpg" width="366"></div>

    <h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  The coast near the Islazul Oasis Hotel 2 is small.  However, the beach is clean, with sunbeds, mushrooms and a bar.  The sea is simply beyond praise.  Sunset in the ocean is very smooth.  But if you want <span>white sand</span> like in the picture, bars with Cuban music and parties, souvenir shops, then go to the center of Varadero, you will find all this only there.  But on the local beach they make good cocktails, and you can immediately listen to music.  And besides, there are no people on the beach, unlike Varadero, where there is simply nowhere for an apple to fall.  True, there is no beer in the beach bar, but you can take it at the hotel in thermo jugs from the rooms and carry with you.  A huge advantage of this beach is that there are no other hotels nearby, and thus, neither locals nor visitors come here.  So you can safely leave things and swim.  Tourists are advised to definitely visit the beaches and the Caribbean, especially with a mask.  The underwater world is amazing.  To the left of the beach there is a completely wild territory - it is very good for divers and underwater hunters.  You can find lobsters, moray eels.  On the territory of Islazul Oasis 2 (Cuba, Varadero) there is a good, clean pool with sun loungers, however, without a children's section.  But with it there is a jacuzzi, which can accommodate six people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Islazul oasis 2 cubes" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/766649.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  They can be taken from Islazul Oasis Hotel 2 both from tour operators and from private guides.  There are a lot of the latter, and their prices are two to three times lower.  The most popular trips from Varadero are to Havana, to the islands of Cayo Largo and Cayo Blanco.  More tourists respond positively to the excursions to the Indian village and jeep safari.  Private guides have an average price of 25 cookies per person per day of travel.  But if you just want to go to Havana on your own, then you should not overpay or drag yourself through the resort to the bus station.  Moreover, regular buses do not go from here to the center of the capital.  You don‚Äôt even need to go anywhere for this.  You can reserve a seat on a tourist bus without even paying for a guide ‚Äî just for the fare.  Then he will pick you up right from the hotel.  Hotel Islazul Oasis 2 is no exception in this regard.  Such a round trip will cost you thirty cookies in both directions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel islazul oasis 2" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/766652.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Islazul Oasis 2: reviews </h2><p>  Of course, this is a simple hotel, from which one should not expect chic and luxury.  Tourists write that this is one of the cheapest and at the same time decent <span>vacation</span> options <span>in Cuba.</span>  In addition, there are not very many Russians in the hotel; mainly Canadian citizens rest here.  However, it is cozy, a few meters from the seashore, very polite and helpful staff.  Clean the rooms perfectly.  In the evening they sing and dance with vacationers.  Beautiful beach.  In a word, to spend a week or two on the <span>Atlantic Ocean</span> with a swim in the Caribbean, among the magnificent nature and heavenly weather - it is always divine.  Especially in such a special, indescribable family atmosphere that has developed in the Islazul Oasis 2 Varadero hotel.  Even tourists who did not previously live in hotels below four stars have called it wonderful. </p>
