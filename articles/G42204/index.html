Reviews in 2016 indicate the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  rocky entry into the sea; </li><li>  to use <span>beach towels,</span> you need to leave a cash deposit; </li><li>  due to the fact that the doors in the rooms are very old, they creak and slam a lot; </li><li>  there are many small fish in the sea that bite painfully by the legs; </li><li>  photographers who provide paid services at the hotel do not work very well (similar pictures can be taken independently); </li><li>  maids ignore the need to replace towels; no tips in this situation help; </li><li>  despite the fact that the hotel‚Äôs website promised a separate children's menu and a dedicated area in the restaurant, provided that more than 20 children are resting, this service is not provided in fact; </li><li>  at every step you can meet a smoker, and therefore the whole territory smelled of tobacco smoke (given that the hotel has many families with children, this is very unpleasant); </li><li>  the doctor serving this hotel is not very attentive to the complaints of guests and prescribes treatment at random; </li><li>  the pillows are very uncomfortable; after sleep the neck hurts; </li><li>  during cleaning, the maids absolutely do not pay attention to the balcony; </li><li>  the tiles around the pool are very slippery, and therefore you need to move extremely carefully. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Based on reviews of Novostar Khayam Garden Beach &amp; Spa 4 * hotel, we can conclude that it deserves five stars.  Of course, there are a lot of shortcomings in it, but, compared with numerous advantages, they are not so significant.  The hotel is very beautiful and well-groomed (both inside and out), the staff is polite and competent, the atmosphere of relaxation is light and relaxed. </p><p>  If we talk about the advantages of the hotel, then in the first place, of course, it is worth putting animation.  The guys literally go out of their way so that vacationers do not have to get bored for a second.  At the same time, entertainment is not imposed on anyone.  It is also worth noting a lot of opportunities for children's recreation.  The mini-club is significantly different from those that can be found in other hotels.  Here, kids are immersed in creativity and fun. </p><p>  The hotel staff is very welcoming and helpful.  Especially touching look Tunisian attempts to communicate with guests in your own language.  However, if you have a serious problem, you can always contact the Russian-speaking administrator.
