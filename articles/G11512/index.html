    <h2>  Where is the recreation center "Salute" </h2><p>  Yeysk in Russia and abroad is not very famous as a place of rest.  But in fact it is a rather large resort city on the Sea of ​​Azov.  It is located near the Yeisk Spit, which leaves a narrow wedge in the sea from the port and extends for 3 km.  On the one hand it is washed by the <span>Taganrog Bay,</span> and on the other is the Yeisk estuary.  It is quite small and warm, so it is great for families with small children. </p><p>  Yeisk Spit is the main resort area of ​​the city.  There are many <span>boarding houses, recreation centers,</span> children's camps.  In addition, there are numerous beaches, cafes and restaurants, attractions and playgrounds.  Therefore, the recreation center "Salute" in Yeysk is so popular.  It is located almost at the very tip of the Yeisk Spit, on the central street of Beach.  From there, a magnificent view of the Sea of ​​Azov opens.  You can get to the recreation center either by your own car or by one of the many fixed-route taxis.  Those who arrived in Yeysk on their own, go to the recreation center nearby, only 4 km. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews recreation center salute in yusk" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/1998527.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The recreation center Salyut operates in Yeysk from April to October, since the sea occupies the main place in recreation here.  It is located just 20 meters from the base.  Therefore, vacationers have the opportunity to take the best places on the beach.  It is worth taking a few steps from the building, and you can take sunbathing, enjoy the soft sand and warm healing water of the Sea of ​​Azov.  Vacationers can swim at any time, even at night, when the water is especially warm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A feature of a beach holiday on the Yeisk Spit is that the sea is not deep here, especially from the estuary.  A smooth sandy bottom and a slight slope allow even small children who cannot swim to swim.  Comfortable sun loungers, as well as 24-hour security allow you to relax.  But not only a family with a child can have a good rest at the Salute base.  Lovers of outdoor activities are waiting for riding on a catamaran, boat, banana or hoverboard.
