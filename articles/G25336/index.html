    <p>  Before you start the device of <span>screw piles,</span> you need to familiarize yourself with their features.  Among others, the possibility of carrying out work in a maximum of 2 days should be highlighted.  Such a base is perfect for those soils, the operation of which is accompanied by certain difficulties.  Piles have high stability and good strength.  The landscape of the territory during their installation will hardly be changed. </p><p>  The construction of such a foundation can be carried out almost at any time of the year, while the climate and weather will not affect the quality.  This foundation can be operated for a rather long period, the minimum reaches 45 years.  Piles can evenly distribute load-bearing loads.  Sometimes installation work is not accompanied by land-related manipulations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Such a construction is an excellent solution if construction is planned to be carried out near seas, rivers, and also on inclined surfaces.  This foundation is especially popular in urban areas.  When saturated communications systems are present on the construction site, the pile foundation allows the construction of buildings without destroying the natural landscape and neighboring structures.  In addition, such supports allow you to continue work on the construction of the house immediately after the installation of piles. </p><h2>  Varieties of screw piles </h2>

    <p>  Before you start the device of screw piles, you should ask what varieties they are represented.  Products can have wide blades that are designed for the construction of lightweight structures.  On sale there are piles with wide blades, which are installed under load-bearing walls, critical nodes, fences and hangars with more than two floors. </p><p>  Considering the types of supports for the foundation, it is necessary to highlight products with trunks on which the blades are wound in large quantities.  They are suitable for installation in harsh climates.  The design provides for a helical blade, which is welded to the barrel itself.  Install similar supports on hard-to-work and stone soils.  With the help of such piles, buildings with a lightweight construction are being erected. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Products can have a cast tip, which simplifies the work on the foundation.  Before starting the device of screw piles, you must choose their diameter, which is calculated taking into account the total weight of the building, as well as the load that will be applied to the structure.  The supports can also be classified according to the manufacturing features.  Supports are welded or cast.  The first variety is used on stony soil, which allows for high adhesion of the soil to the foundation. </p><h2>  More about piles and their varieties </h2>

    <p>  Welded products are used for those buildings that have a small number of floors.  Such supports have an open tip, with the help of which it is possible to achieve reliable fixation on the soil surface.  But supports with a closed tip are not so common.  Cast products are stronger and able to withstand enormous loads.  These piles are ready to serve a longer period, and their cost is an order of magnitude higher. </p><p>  Before you start screw piling, you should consider their varieties.  For example, molded products can have medium blades, be represented by a standard type or a small diameter.  As for the first type, then with the help of them you can penetrate the thawed soil.  But for permafrost soil piles with a small diameter are used.  Standard products are common in the construction of small residential buildings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  About the device of screw piles </h2>

    <p>  The pile foundation was first used in the military industry, where the need arose to build strong supports or structures in a short time.  Such a foundation later spread to low-rise buildings.  Today, new piles are known, with which you can build foundations not only for lightweight buildings, but also for multi-story buildings. </p><p>  The use of such structures is associated with the presence of moisture in the soil, the need to equip the foundation on a complex terrain, the presence of an equipped landscape or <span>replacement of the foundation.</span>  Screw piles allow you to restore the design and reduce the amount of excavation.  Establish support in the case when the soil freezes deep enough. </p><h2>  Installation technology </h2>

    <p>  The <span>foundation</span> device <span>on screw piles</span> provides for the use of products in the form of a steel pipe made of metal.  The thickness of the latter is 4 mm or more.  Screw supports have a sharp end with a cutting blade, which allows screwing.  For the installation of piles there will be enough strength of 3 people. </p><p>  If the construction object has differences, it is recommended to use supports with a sharp end and two blades.  This will allow you to get a building with additional power.  The average diameter of the blade varies from 20 to 80 cm. Sometimes the described supports are compared with a self-tapping screw, the diameter of which varies from 5 to 35 cm. </p><p>  The length of the product will depend on the location where the installation is carried out, this parameter is equal to the limit of 2 to 10 m. The minimum value is suitable for fences and billboards.  Sometimes hollow or cast piles are installed.  The blades are placed perpendicularly, which eliminates loosening of the soil.  Bearing capacity can be equal to 5000 kg minimum, while the maximum value reaches 25 000 kg. </p><h2>  Work Tips </h2>

    <p>  The construction of a bath on screw piles should begin with a study of the soil.  This will determine the depth of groundwater and the presence of certain layers of soil in a given area.  If you plan to carry out the work manually, then one person must monitor the evenness and quality of the screwing, while other people will carry out the installation. </p><p>  After installing the support with the help of a device for twisting screw piles - a multiplier, the upper part of the product is cut off taking into account the level and filled with concrete mortar.  As soon as it hardens, a metal structure in the form of a head is mounted on each support. </p><p>  For a uniform load distribution along the perimeter of the building, it is necessary to tie the piles.  To give the foundation additional strength, a channel is used.  During work on uneven terrain, piles will vary in height, but they must be positioned at the same level.  For installation, a medium-sized support will be enough for half an hour. </p><h2>  Sex in the bath </h2>

    <p>  The device of the floor in the bath on screw piles provides for laying the strapping beam on the supports.  It is important to ensure that there are holders for the beam so that they are parallel to each other in increments of 1 m. Mounting of the holders is carried out so that the laid beams are at the same level with the strapping beam. </p><h2>  Methodology </h2><p>  When the floor is mounted on screw piles, beams are placed in the holders, and it is necessary to try to measure out their length so that each beam is laid indented from the strapping beam.  A gap of 1 cm will allow ventilation of the wood during the operation of the bath.  On top of the beams is a rough floor, which is fastened with screws.  At the final stage, the finishing floor is covered.  There should be 8 mm gaps between the boards.  On this we can assume that the leaking floor on the stilts is ready. </p><h2>  Screw piled floor </h2><p>  If you have erected a frame <span>house on stilts,</span> then the flooring can be started after the construction of the pile foundation and the completion of the strapping.  It is made of timber, channel or I-beam.  As an example, we consider the binding of wooden beams, to which the logs are fixed. </p><p>  The span of the strapping beams is 3 m or less.  If this value is increased, then additional supports from piles should be used.  For beams, a square beam with a side of 100 mm is selected.  It is better to prefer coniferous wood.  Before installing the harness when installing the floor in the house on screw piles, it is necessary to waterproof the base using a plastic film, roofing felt or penofol. </p>
