At the moment, this is not about RAM (although its ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù eats well), but about the device‚Äôs memory available to the user.  As a rule, it is already catastrophically small.  And if the gadget owner does not have a microSD card, this becomes a problem.  And over time, the situation becomes simply disastrous.  And this is even the case when the poor user does not download anything.  And gigabytes still evaporate.  What to do?  One of the reasons for this behavior of Android may be the Thumbnails folder.  What is this folder and what is it used for?  We will try to answer this question. </p>

    <h2>  What is this folder? </h2><p>  The folder with the intriguing name "Thumbnails" is a system folder.  It is used by the operating system to store a cache of thumbnails of images and video files.  This is to speed up the process of displaying them in applications such as Gallery.  This program is known to many.  Some other applications can also use this folder.  If there are indecently many images on the device, then the cache size is also rather big.  And he eats up a precious place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is useful to know for those who want to end this disgrace, to demolish the entire cache and everything that can be deleted?  The Thumbnails folder is a system folder.  This means that it is hidden and so easy to not reach it.  In addition, removing the cache at first will help.  But then the folder will again be cluttered with thumbnails.  You have to delete everything again.  But we‚Äôll talk about how to overwhelm the system and not fill this folder.  In the meantime, let's figure out how to remove thumbnails. </p><h2>  Delete content using a PC </h2><p>  This is the first way you can delete the Thumbnails folder or its contents.  In principle, it makes no sense to delete the directory itself, because the system will immediately create another one.  But to demolish its contents is more effective.  So, first you need to connect the gadget to the computer in media device mode.  This will show not only the contents of the SD card (if any), but also the file system of your phone.  However, it is not so easy to find the desired folder.  In Windows Explorer, you need to enable the display of hidden files.  Then she will be visible. </p>

    <p>  Now you need to open the folder, select all its contents and delete it in the usual way.  If the system swears that "the file is read-only", then you need to go back one step, right-click on the folder, open the "Properties" item and carefully look at the file attributes.  Uncheck "Read-only" and click "Apply to all files in the directory".  Then repeat the removal procedure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Uninstall via smartphone </h2><p>  Can I delete the Thumbnails folder using my phone?  Can.  But for this, you need a device that has gone through the rutting procedure, that is, you must have superuser rights.  This can be done using the free Framaroot or Kingoroot apps.  After obtaining superuser rights, you need to install the Root Explorer program.  It is she who shows all the contents of the file system and allows you to change it.  Without this conductor, nothing will come of it. </p>

    <p>  In the <span>Root Explorer,</span> you need to find the desired folder, select all its contents and click on the "Delete" button.  The application will request superuser rights.  It is necessary to agree with their provision.  After that, you can reboot the device and enjoy the free space on your smartphone.  But that is not all.  It is also necessary to prohibit the system from creating thumbnails.  More about this below.  In the meantime, consider special programs to remove the cache. </p><h2>  Uninstall using apps </h2><p>  Now there are many applications on Android that clean the system, remove program remnants, clear the cache, including the Thumbnails directory.  What is this folder, you already know.  Now consider the programs that can help clean it up.  The most popular utility is CCleaner for Android.  She enjoys such love of users due to the fact that it has rich functionality, does not load the system and works well.  And most importantly - this program is completely free. </p>

    <p>  CCleaner application will not cause any difficulties in its use.  The interface is intuitive.  In addition, there is a Russian language.  All that is required of the user is to run a scan.  The program itself will find unnecessary files and offer to delete them.  The owner of the device will only have to agree.  You can also schedule automatic maintenance, and the utility will clean these directories once a week.  This is the first way to combat the constant filling of the Thumbnails directory.  What is this folder and how to deal with its volumes, you already know. </p><h2>  Keeping the catalog clean and tidy </h2><p>  With the removal of the folder or its contents, everything is clear.  But how to prevent her from filling up again?  The first method was described above: you can use the CCLeaner application with configured weekly system maintenance.  However, there are other ways.  They are suitable for those who do not have so much RAM so that some application constantly hangs there.  They are quite simple and do not require any special knowledge. </p>

    <p>  An infection such as the Thumbnails folder on Android (what we‚Äôve covered above) is constantly filling up due to the use of the gallery.  Therefore, the solution is this: do not use this application at all.  There are third-party utilities that do not use thumbnails.  Can also be applied to all Root Explorer files.  He also does not need miniatures.  Yes, the standard "Explorer" does not use images.  So there are plenty of opportunities. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what the name Thumbnails means.  What is this folder, too, is clear.  It has also been proven that you can delete a directory and its contents.  There will be no damage to the system from this.  You must also keep the folder clean with special applications.  Then there will be enough free space in the device. </p>
