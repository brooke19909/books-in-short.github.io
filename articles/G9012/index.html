    <h2>  Guest Impressions </h2><p>  Loutsiana Hotel Apts 4 * reviews receive mostly positive.  The first thing people who have been here to notice is the clean, well-groomed, green area.  Near the room there are deck chairs, a table, and chairs.  Ideal setting for a romantic evening. </p><p>  The staff is nice - rooms are cleaned daily, and towels and linen 4 times a week.  The beach is 500 meters away.  There is clean sand, comfortable entry into the water and sun loungers at 2.5 euros per person.  But by no means the worst option is the decision to simply spread a towel and sunbathe on it. </p><p>  Near the hotel there is a bus stop with bus number 101 (to the city center) and number 102 (to Luna Park).  It costs only one and a half euros per person, regular flights, so you can not go broke by taxi.  In the center, by the way, there are a huge number of restaurants and cafes - there are reasonable prices, a wide range of dishes of different cuisines and drinks, and even very large portions.  By the way, alcohol in Cyprus is cheap.  You can even buy a bottle of delicious wine for 2 euros. </p><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  Many tourists leaving a vacation at Loutsiana Hotel Apts 4 * <span>(Cyprus) reviews,</span> in their comments give tips for the future to those people who are just going to go to this hotel. </p><p>  Before you go to Ayia Napa, you should throw several fumigators in your bag, as mosquitoes can fly at night.  There are English sockets in the hotel‚Äôs apartments, but European ones are rented out at the reception.  But it‚Äôs better to buy it in the shops located next to the hotel - there they cost less than one euro. </p><p>  And here you can‚Äôt take sun loungers by the pool, throwing a towel on an empty seat.  There are other rules.  Whoever came first - that is and takes a deck chair. </p><p>  By the way, the staff working at the hotel speak only Greek and English.  But for people who came from Russia, small instructions and announcements in Russian are hung out for convenience. </p>

    <h2>  What else is worth knowing? </h2><p>  The hotel is located very well, as mentioned above.  But it is worth noting the fact that from it you can quickly walk to four beaches, and not to one.  The nearest is Kandy Beach.  If you believe the reviews of the Russians, then this is not the best option.  Many scolded him for stones in the sea. </p><p>  The second beach that can be reached in 20 minutes is Makronissos.  With gorgeous white sand and cool azure water.  There is also Landa Beach, which is about 25 minutes on foot.  Also sandy, with a shallow approach, but algae in the water.  It is especially popular among people who come to give with children. </p><p>  And there is Nissi Beach, which is about 40 on foot, so many go there by bus.  Nice beautiful beach, but you need to walk 300 meters to get to the depths.  The place of youth is many British, and the girls are sunbathing topless. </p><p>  When making an application for booking in additional wishes, it is desirable to indicate information about the building in which I would like to live.  It is better to ask for apartments in the farthest building.  The rooms have good soundproofing, but still, if you want to open the windows and the balcony door for the night, you should settle in the building away from the road. </p><p>  To summarize, we can confidently say that the hotel is an excellent option for people who dream of an eventful vacation, for which you could pay a small amount of money. </p>
