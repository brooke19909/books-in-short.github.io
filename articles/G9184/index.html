Pattern dress with a one-piece sleeve from knitwear is very simple, and you can create it without even being a professional in the field of sewing.  <span>Seam allowances</span> can be minimal. </p><p>  When working with knitwear, you need to follow certain requirements, otherwise your dress pattern with a one-piece sleeve will turn out wrong.  Do not stretch the canvas when cutting.  It is best to mark the cut lines on the fabric with chalk.  A dress pattern with a one-piece sleeve from knitwear is loved by many dressmakers. </p><p>  Stitching details of knitted fabrics is best done with a special overlock sewing machine or with a double needle of an ordinary sewing machine. </p><h2>  Silk dress </h2><p>  A dress with a one-piece silk sleeve looks very elegant.  This is usually a dress with a bat sleeve or a kimono sleeve. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dress pattern with one-piece sleeve burda" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/731042.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  A dress pattern with a one-piece sleeve (Burda Moden often offers such) is simple.  But tailoring it has its own characteristics.  <span>Silk dress</span> can be both lined and without it.  Lining is required if the silk for sewing is translucent or if your dress is tight-fitting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Keep in mind that <span>silk fabric</span> usually sits after washing, so before cutting it needs to be decorated, that is, washed.  Silk should be washed in cool water with the addition of shampoo.  Dry such a fabric in a shady and cool place. </p><p>  It needs to be cut too.  If you have a dress pattern with a 3/4 full-cut sleeve, then you first need to put silk on a surface that is already covered with fleecy material.  So your silk will hold on better. </p><p>  The dress pattern with a one-piece sleeve for the girl in this case is done already with allowances for seams, since it is better to pin a cardboard pattern to the fabric in the allowance zone.  When sewing silk on a typewriter, it is best to put thinner needles there and make sure they are brand new, there are no roughness on them.  The dress pattern with a one-piece sleeve, the photo of which you have already seen, is simple. </p><h2>  Dress for fat </h2><p>  If your parameters are far from model and those around you consider you complete, do not rush to get upset.  With skillfully sewn clothes, you can hide your flaws and emphasize your dignity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dress pattern with one-piece sleeve for full" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/731041.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The dress pattern with a one-piece sleeve for the full is in the special magazine ‚ÄúBurda Moden‚Äù.  If your parameters are slightly more than model, then two-layer dresses are perfect for you, the top layer of which is made of satin, and the bottom - of lace material.  In such a dress, the optimal length of the sleeves is three quarters; a cape, bolero or stole will suit you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <span>Models of dresses</span> that suit you are a sheath dress, a dressing gown.  Choose light, almost weightless fabrics for sewing. </p><h2>  Greek style outfit </h2><p>  For the summer season, you can choose a dress that looks spectacular, and at the same time it is easy to sew.  In this case, a <span>dress in the Greek style</span> is quite suitable. </p>

    <p>  A dress pattern with a one-piece sleeve is optional in this case.  You will need three to four meters of material that is draped in folds.  It can be chiffon, satin, silk, satin, velveteen. </p><p>  First you need to mark the middle of the material with chalk.  There will be shoulders.  Put down fifteen centimeters, an armhole for the head will appear here.  The armhole must be done carefully, it can be round, it can be oval or rectangular.  Designate the place where the belt will be on the dress, and tie the waist with a ribbon.  Do not forget to process the edges of the fabric so that they do not split.  You can use a sewing machine, or you can manually. </p><h2>  Leather dresses </h2><p>  Genuine leather is an interesting material from which you can create outstanding products if desired.  A dress pattern with a one-piece sleeve made of leather will allow you to create a beautiful dress that you can wear for an evening out and not only. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dress pattern with one-piece sleeve photo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/731032.jpg" width="290"></div>

    <p>  Going to the store to buy leather, remember that it is sold in pieces.  Therefore, you need to calculate in advance how much skin you need.  To do this, you need a ready-made dress pattern with a one-piece sleeve. </p><p>  Before sewing a leather product, sew it with cheaper material.  So you can check how it sits on your figure.  When you sew leather on a sewing machine, it is recommended to lubricate the skin on this section with sunflower oil, so your machine foot will move better. </p><p>  A leather dress is unlikely to be washed.  It is better to give it to dry cleaners.  All tips also apply to artificial skin, but it will be easier with it, since it is sold by the meter. </p><h2>  Linen dresses </h2><p>  Flax is a beautiful natural material from which a wide variety of products are created.  A linen dress is perfect for socks in the summer heat. </p><p>  A dress pattern with a one-piece sleeve for linen exists, but some features of cutting <span>linen fabric</span> must be taken into account <span>.</span>  Flax can sit strongly during washing.  Therefore, initially it is necessary to acquire this fabric ten percent more, and it must be washed and dried before cutting. </p><h2>  Print dress </h2><p>  Chintz is a material well known to us, which is inexpensive and there are a wide variety of colors.  Therefore, it is so popular.  From this material you will get a great dress for the summer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dress pattern with a one-piece sleeve for a girl" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/731044.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The dress pattern with a one-piece sleeve made of chintz is very simple, and it is not even necessary to take it from magazines.  You can cut directly on the fabric.  You can sew a long cotton dress for yourself in just an hour. </p><p>  For this you will need: two meters of chintz fabric, matching threads, tailor's chalk, scissors and ruler, sewing machine and overlock.  Fold the fabric in half to make a square. </p><p>  Chalk out a circle on the fabric, draw a neckline.  The result should be two details that resemble a cone with a cropped top in shape.  There should be two side seams. </p><p>  Side seams are sewn on a sewing machine or on an overlock.  It is necessary to leave 27 centimeters on each side for armholes.  From the remains of the material you need to make a belt with a length of ninety centimeters and a width of ten, with which you will draw a waist.  A dress pattern with a one-piece sleeve, the photo of which is in the magazine, is also suitable for chintz. </p><p>  This dress can be worn with sandals and high-heeled shoes.  It is suitable for a simple walk, and for evening publication. </p><h2>  Chiffon dress </h2><p>  Chiffon is a very beautiful thin fabric from which you can create a great dress.  But if you don‚Äôt have much experience with this fabric, then it‚Äôs better for you to start sewing free models from it, since chiffon has the property of ‚Äúmoving apart‚Äù at the seams.  A dress pattern with a one-piece 3/4 sleeve for chiffon is suitable. </p><p>  If you cut chiffon, then be sure to use patterns.  Before cutting, it is advisable to lay a bike cloth or heavy blanket on the table, so it will be more convenient for you to cut.  To facilitate cutting, you can spray chiffon with hairspray.  In this case, the needles with which you will sweep the chiffon should be smooth, not have nicks. </p><p>  The pattern of a dress with a one-piece sleeve is very suitable for chiffon, and to sew such a dress will not be difficult for you.  The neck of such a dress will be V-shaped, and it will need to be processed with the help of a trim. </p><p>  The front and back parts must be folded together and then the side and shoulder seams should be sewn.  Note that the threads for this work must be thin so as not to tear the fabric.  If you want to process them on an overlock, then a three-thread seam will be quite enough, while you need to use threads no thicker than 40 numbers. </p><p>  First, the seams and sections are processed on the overlock.  And then the edges of the sleeves and the bottom of the dress are sewn on a sewing machine.  We determine where the waist is on our dress, and sew the elastic there.  It is advisable to sew it in two lines. </p><h2>  Dress pattern with one-piece sleeve </h2><p>  You can sew such a dress, following the instructions of the magazine "Burda Moden".  To get the evening version, you need to take four meters of silk fabric, which has a width of 140 centimeters.  A hidden zipper 60 centimeters long is useful. </p><p>  The pattern set includes a front shelf, which is cut together with sleeves, a back with a sleeve, a side part and a neckline hem.  At the front there is a fold that needs to be laid and swept, iron its fold and sew up on a sewing machine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dress pattern with a one-piece sleeve for a girl" class="if" height="487" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/732755.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  From the corners, it is necessary to grind the side parts, the allowances of the front and backs are cut in the corners.  The lower parts of the sleeves are sewn to the whole-cut parts of the sleeves and then are sewn into the armholes of the side parts from corner to corner. </p><p>  The dress is turned inside out, you need to overcast the inside cut of the front neckline.  A single line to perform shoulder seams and upper seams of the sleeves.  After that, the dress is turned out facing out.  The allowances for hemming the bottom are ironed to the wrong side, and then they can be hemmed manually. </p><p>  The middle sections of the back parts are processed as follows: an invisible zipper is attached to them.  The ends of the hidden zipper remain protruding. </p>
