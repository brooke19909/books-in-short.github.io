    <h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  Before you start knitting, you need to purchase yarn and tools.  Then select the appropriate model.  And then build a full-size pattern and calculate the number of loops needed to get started. </p><h2>  Choose yarn and knitting needles </h2><p>  Since knitted models of outerwear are usually made of rather voluminous yarn, beginner craftswomen should not depart from established traditions and choose a thread of medium thickness with a footage of 200-250 m in a hundred-gram skein.  The composition of the thread can be any, it all depends on the preferences of the knitter.  This can be fully wool yarn mixed with various fibers - mohair, acrylic, nylon, silk or cotton.  The variety of types of yarn currently does not limit the tastes and imagination of the knitter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted women's coats and cardigans schemes" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1119427.jpg" width="501"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Knitting needles No. 3-4 are most suitable for threads of any composition and medium thickness.  If the <span>yarn is thicker</span> (120-150 m / 100 g), then the size of the needles increases to No. 5-6.  They are also selected from the material that the craftswoman prefers, but it is necessary to take circular knitting needles of different lengths: they may be required for the convenience of performing various parts.  So, it is more convenient to knit the back on knitting needles with a fishing line length of 80-85 cm, and the sleeve on knitting needles with a shorter fishing line length. </p><h2>  How to make a pattern </h2><p>  It is desirable to use a pattern in the performance of a knitted model: it will turn out more beautiful, it will be better to sit on the figure.  The inability to build it according to all the canons of sewing art in the case of knitted knitwear is absolutely not critical, since the plasticity of the knitted fabric is amazing: it hides many flaws.  Beginning craftswomen who decided to tie a coat or cardigan can be guided by the following tips: </p><p>  • Choose your favorite model, not necessarily knitted, comfortable and comfortable "sitting" on the figure and having suitable sizes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted coat cardigans knitting with patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1119425.jpg" width="312"></div>

    <p>  • If the shape of the chosen thing is completely satisfied - this is the best option for future patterns.  The silhouette is transferred to paper, after checking and adjusting (if necessary) the dimensions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Loop test calculation </h2><p>  After the pattern is ready, you should correctly calculate the number of loops needed for the set.  This is necessary for a good fit on the figure of any model of clothing, even such as <span>knitted coats</span> and <span>knit</span> cardigans.  Pattern patterns are also important, so before you calculate the number of loops, you should choose a pattern. </p><p>  In order to calculate the number of loops for the set, knit a sample and, steaming it, measure it.  The number of loops in 1 cm of the canvas is multiplied by the number of cm in the part.  Thus, the desired number of loops are found.  In most cases, it has to be subsequently adjusted depending on the selected pattern and the number of loops in the rapport. </p><h2>  Knitted coats and cardigans with knitting needles: patterns for beginners </h2><p>  For needlewomen who have recently taken knitting needles in their hands, it is better to start with simple patterns.  Cardigans made with a <span>garter stitch</span> look <span>perfect, the</span> basis of which is one loop - the front, that is, work is done both from the face and from the wrong side with the front loops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted coats and cardigans knitting scheme photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1119403.jpg" width="500"></div>  Knitted fabric tied with a garter stitch - plastic, easy to perform and very effective.  Knitted coats and cardigans with knitting needles, the schemes for which are so simple - the best option for beginners.

    <h2>  Structural patterns </h2><p>  Favorite drawings of beginners - structural.  These include simple alternations of the front and back loops.  For example, very often models of outerwear are performed with a “rice” pattern, where the alternate knitting of these loops changes with each subsequent row, that is, the front <span>loop is</span> knitted over the <span>wrong loop</span> and vice versa.  You can alternate not one, but two or three loops.  You can increase the number of rows, performing 2-3 rows without changing the pattern, and from the 4th row to change the loop. </p><p>  Such patterns are valuable in that you can independently conceive any alternation and translate them into the author's model. </p><h2>  Knitted patterns made from braids </h2><p>  Knitted coats, cardigans with knitting needles with patterns of braids, plaits, rhombs or aranas are always in demand and never go out of fashion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted coats and cardigans knitting patterns for beginners" class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1119397.jpg" width="600"></div>  Since the article is aimed at the audience of needlewomen striving for mastery, we will consider simple patterns from braids.  The photo shows a pattern of narrow braids turning into rhombs.

    <p>  The rapport of the pattern is 11 loops, i.e., for knitting parts, dial a <span>number that is a multiple of</span> 11 + 2 edge ones to knit the needles.  They knit a braid along the back field, overlapping in each row 2 loops to the right, then to the left.  Even rows (all) are performed according to the established pattern.  Having knitted 24 rows, they begin to knit a rhombus, and from the 33rd row, the pattern repeat is repeated. </p><p>  Braids can be small and large, voluminous and embossed.  Knit can be tight or loose enough.  The master, of course, chooses himself, relies on his own experience, preferences and fulfills the planned knitted coats and cardigans with knitting needles.  The schemes whose photos are offered are simple, and it is almost impossible to make mistakes in them.  In addition, you can perform the canvas, knitting one braid on the wrong field, placing it along the line of longitudinal tucks. </p><h2>  Knitted coats and cardigans with knitting needles: patterns of openwork drawings </h2><p>  Spectacular and airy lace cardigans and <span>summer coats.</span>  Such clothes are always very individual, and doing it with your own hands will further emphasize a certain highlight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted coats and cardigans knitting patterns for children" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1119393.jpg" width="398"></div>  The proposed scheme consists of a wide openwork "Christmas tree" framed by narrow paths.  When performing such drawings, the skills of the same thread tension are necessary, so it is better for novice masters to perform openwork inserts, as suggested in the photo. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted coats and cardigans with knitting needles" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1119433.jpg" width="320"></div>  This method allows you to get products no less spectacular than fully openwork knitted coats and cardigans with knitting needles.  Pattern patterns, even the most primitive ones, are always elegant, so yarn for making such models needs to be selected more current than for braids and arana.

    <h2>  Children's models </h2><p>  No less popular are children's knitted coats and cardigans with knitting needles.  Patterns (for children, by the way, there are many different models) and patterns are made by the standards and are built according to the laws of sewing or are copied from any suitable model.  The pattern will help to do the job more clearly and accurately. </p><p>  Children's coats are knitted from more tender yarn, for example, from the line of special collections.  Patterns should also be visually smaller than for adults. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted coats and cardigans with knitting needles for children" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1119430.jpg" width="500"></div>  Models made with a fine structural pattern, <span>front smooth</span> and decorated with patch or sewn-in collars - lace, guipure, knitted look great.  The photo above shows a similar model with pockets connected by “rice”.
