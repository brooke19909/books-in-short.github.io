Apartments in Montenegro on the coast, as well as in the resorts of Bulgaria, are in houses with additional service.  Usually it is assumed that there is a concierge, security system, video surveillance, swimming pool, playgrounds for children, SPA centers for adults, saunas, tennis courts.  For the maintenance of such residential complexes an additional fee is charged from the owner, as a rule, it is low, especially when compared with similar tariffs in Spain, France and Italy. </p><p>  What are apartments to buy? </p><p>  In recent years, buying property in resort countries has become a profitable venture.  This is explained by the availability of prices, ease of registration of property, low cost of maintenance.  Apartments in Bulgaria and Montenegro can be rented out, while there is no need to do this on your own, this will be taken care of by the management company with whom a <span>contract for the provision of services</span> is signed <span>.</span>  It is possible to obtain a loan for the purchase of an apartment in Bulgaria, while in Montenegro this possibility is not yet foreseen, since the banking system is imperfect in the matter of collecting debt from foreign borrowers. </p><p>  Buying real estate provides for a good investment in terms of its resale.  As the <span>price growth index</span> shows <span>,</span> every year there is a significant increase in housing prices in Bulgaria and Montenegro (both new and secondary). </p>

    <p>  What is a holiday apartment? </p><p>  A great opportunity to rent apartments in a foreign country is provided to families with children, large companies who do not want to adapt to the hotel schedule.  This will allow you to choose your own menu, prepare the children’s dishes that are necessary for you, calmly buy a bottle of delicious wine in the nearest supermarket and, while sitting on the terrace with sea views, enjoy the evening sunset.  Renting an apartment will cost less than a vacation in a hotel, since the fee is not charged per person, but for the accommodation itself. </p><p>  Of course, in <span>holidays abroad</span> in your own apartments there are many advantages.  The only condition: it is worth considering the traditions and features of the lifestyle of the local population.  Do not forget that each country has its own rules, and it is necessary to honor them. </p>
