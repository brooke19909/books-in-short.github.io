Expensive or functional - what to choose?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Phones have long ceased to be just a means of communication.  Models of many firms have moved into the category of an expensive and beautiful accessory.  Now very often by the presence of a “cool” phone, one can judge the social status of a person.  And here the question arises: what is meant by the “coolness” of the phone?  Everyone will answer this in their own way.  For someone, the most important thing is the price of the device, someone values ​​the look most, and for many, an important indicator of an excellent phone is its functionality, and everything else doesn’t matter.  So what is better - the sky-high cost of the phone, showing that its owner is a wealthy person, or its functionality? </p>

    <h2>  The coolest touch phones </h2><p>  The share of touch phones in the market is constantly growing.  While older people consider mobile phones with a conventional display more convenient, middle-aged users and young people prefer models with <span>touch screens.</span>  If you choose the “coolest" phone in the world from them, then it will be smartphones of such companies as Samsung, Apple, HTC, Nokia.  They are the most dynamically developing companies that either develop their OS, or constantly modify it.  They are the leaders in sales, but the main competitors among them today are two major manufacturers - Samsung and Apple.  The struggle for the buyer and clarification of the fact that it is one of them that produces the “coolest” phone in the world are the main points of competition between these two largest manufacturing companies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Apple" holds the brand </h2><p>  The new iPhone 5s is a serious statement from Apple.  The attitude to the products of this company is surprisingly diametrical - iPhones are either madly in love or just as selflessly hated.  But all this does not prevent Apple devices from becoming leaders in sales around the world.  What is the merit of the iPhone 5s?  It captivates with its perfect design.  It has not yet been possible to create a smartphone better in external parameters.  The case is made of aluminum, and from a single piece, which already gives the device an expensive and stylish look.  The rectangular shape of the iPhone with nicely rounded corners is very comfortable for the hand.  The Apple product is the thinnest among other competitors. </p><p>  A huge plus of all devices from Apple is an infinite number of exclusive games and applications that are available only to owners of "apple" products. </p><p>  What the new iPhone loses is the quality of the shoot.  On a little, but it was bypassed by flagships from Samsung, HTC and Nokia. </p><h2>  Samsung is a worthy rival to Apple </h2>

    <p>  It happened - the Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone has finally gone on sale, and fans of this brand can see for themselves how different it is from the previous model.  New items are impressive.  The device withstands immersion in water for 30 minutes and is completely protected from dust.  A 16 megapixel camera turns the smartphone into a high-quality camera.  There is an advanced software for those who are seriously monitoring their health - a heart rate monitor.  All this allows us to say that Samsung struck back Apple with the release of its new products.  The cost of the Galaxy S5 is almost $ 300 lower than the price of the latest <span>iPhone model,</span> which is also a big plus for the new items from the Korean manufacturer.  With such functionality and cost, you will not have to wait long for buyers. </p><h2>  The coolest phone in 2014 in functionality </h2><p>  According to research by TopTenReviews, a rating company, and TechRadar, an online publication that specializes in mobile device reviews, HTC One (M8) was <span>the best smartphone of</span> 2014. </p>

    <p>  Like the iPhone 5, the new HTC is equipped with a monolithic aluminum case.  Smooth forms of the device allow him to lie comfortably in his hand.  The smartphone has a huge screen of 5 inches, but this does not make it look like a "shovel".  To the edges, it is thinning, and this gives the feeling that it is thinner than it really is. </p><p>  The performance of the device is at a high level, since it runs on Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 (MSM8974AB) - the latest platform. </p><p>  All these characteristics ensure that HTC’s new product is highly appreciated by both experts in the development of mobile phones and ordinary users. </p><h2>  Gold and diamonds - this is also relevant for the phone </h2><p>  If you choose the world's coolest phone not in terms of its advanced functionality and performance, but in terms of cost, then there is also something to see.  A phone can be not just expensive, but a luxury accessory worth several million dollars.  For example, such as the amazing creation of the jeweler Stuart Hughes.  He recently created the most expensive phone in the world.  It was called the iPhone 5 Black Diamond.  It is made on the basis of Apple products and covered with 600 diamonds.  Even the company logo is made of precious stones - it took 53 diamonds.  In the world there is only one instance of the iPhone 5 Black Diamond, its cost is $ 16 million. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  So, the answer to the question of which is better - the functionality of the phone or its cost, everyone will find for himself.  If you need it primarily as a means of communication, communication, as well as for watching videos, surfing the Internet, reading books, then the choice will be with a smartphone with a good set of necessary functions, applications and programs.  If he should play the role of an indicator of the material well-being of its owner, then the choice is quite extensive here - from the latest generation smartphones, the price of which starts at $ 800, to the luxurious creations of the jeweler Stuart Hughes.  So, which is more important - the functionality or cost of a mobile <span>phone?</span>  <span>The choice is</span> always yours. </p>
