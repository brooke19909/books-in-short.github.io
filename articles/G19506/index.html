Due to the fact that this material is easy to care for, it weighs little and does not cause allergies, clothes and blankets made of it are popular in children's everyday life.  Also from this fabric are amazing toys and other crafts. </p><h2>  Fleece octopus: materials </h2><p>  A cute and funny crafts made of fleece can be made even without sewing and patterns.  To do this, you will need: </p><ul><li>  small pieces of black, white and gray fleece; </li><li>  2 meters of ribbon; </li><li>  old tennis ball; </li><li>  pink fleece with polka dots in size 20 x 20 cm; </li><li>  a piece of blue fleece measuring 40 x 40 cm; </li><li>  strong threads; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  glue for the fabric. </li></ul><h2>  Making octopus </h2><p>  To begin, we make the body of the toy by placing the ball in the center of the blue piece of fabric and tightly rewinding the threads.  After this, the threads should be unwound, the ball removed, and the fabric straightened.  You will need a trace left from the threads, so as not to overdo it with cuts. </p><p>  Now, from each corner of the expanded fabric, it is necessary to cut out a 12 x 12 cm square. A piece in the shape of a cross should be obtained, on each side of which another 6 cuts must be made.  Try so that the cuts do not reach the contours left by the thread by 2-2.2 cm. </p><p>  We again place the tennis ball in the center of the part and tie it with a thread.  We cut the cut strips into pigtails, forming the legs of the craft from fleece.  From below we tie ribbons to them. </p><p>  It remains to make an octopus face.  We cut out two white circles from white, gray and black fleece.  White should be the largest and black the smallest.  Glue circles to the head of the toy in turn: first a white circle, then gray and black. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We embroider a smile with red threads and tie a scarf made of fleece and polka dots on her head. </p><h2>  Piggy </h2><p>  A self-made fleece pig will surely please the child.  And for its manufacture you will need such materials: </p><ul><li>  fleece (pink, yellow, raspberry); </li><li>  white flannel fabric with a colorful pattern; </li><li>  hollofiber or sintepon; </li><li>  threads (white, black, pink and yellow); </li><li>  pig pattern; </li><li>  needle for sewing and scissors; </li><li>  small black beads. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Mumps pattern" class="if uuid-3171794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3171794.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  First you need to draw or print a toy template and cut out the necessary details from paper.  Then the pig's pattern needs to be cut out of fleece, making small allowances. </p><p>  The head, ears and paws are made pink, the body is yellow, and the patch is raspberry.  The skirt for the toy is cut out of the flannel. </p><p>  In total, you need to embed two parts for the head, skirt and body, and four for the ears, front and hind legs.  Only one part is needed per patch. </p><p>  Take the two parts of the head, fold them face up inward and sew together, leaving a small hole for the filler.  In the same way we fasten all the other details of the fleece crafts, except for the skirt. </p><p>  We turn the prepared elements of the pig and fill it with holofiber or synthetic winterizer.  Ears do not need to be stuffed, just tuck in the edges left from below and sew in. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The details of the skirt must be folded with the front side inwards and sewn along the edges with white threads.  Then we turn the skirt on top and bottom and stitch it.  Then we turn out the part and stitch it from one edge so that it can be pulled and put on a toy. </p><p>  Now the fleece crafts need to be assembled.  First we connect the head and body, then we attach the legs and ears.  Sew a piglet and black beads to the place of the eyes to the muzzle of the pig.  Embroider the nostrils and mouth with black thread, and put on a skirt on the finished toy. </p><h2>  Fleece tilda: materials </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fleece bunny" class="if uuid-3171788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3171788.jpg"></div><p>  Tilda is a rag doll created by Norwegian Tone Finnanger.  Tild's most recognizable hallmarks are eyes with tiny dots and rosy cheeks.  Often Tildas are female dolls, but there are other variations.  For example, you can sew Tilda - a bunny from fleece. </p><p>  To do this, you will need: </p><ul><li>  fleece (white and blue polka dots); </li><li>  pattern; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  baking paper; </li><li>  holofiber; </li><li>  sewing machine; </li><li>  black beads for the eyes. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Bunny pattern" class="if uuid-3171869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3171869.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Bunny Tilda: master class </h2><p>  Follow these steps: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Circle the pattern and cut out the necessary parts of the toy from the fleece with 0.5 cm allowances. </li><li>  We fold the ears and paws with the front sides inward, sew on the typewriter, leaving holes for the filler. </li><li>  We sew two parts of the body along the middle seam.  Also do not forget to sew tucks.  We turn the prepared part to the front side. </li><li>  From the baking paper, cut 6 parts of the ears, sew them to the blanks of the ears in three layers.  After that, carefully turn out the workpieces. </li><li>  Inverted ears again we prostrate on a typewriter. </li><li>  Now turn out all the workpieces of the legs and fill them with holofiber, but not completely. </li><li>  On the front part of the body, you need to pin and sew the ears, departing from the middle seam by 1.5 cm. </li><li>  Sew the upper legs directly under the neck to the body, and sew the lower legs from the bottom, at a distance of 0.5 cm from the middle seam. </li><li>  We take the second part of the body, apply it with the face to the first part so that the ears and paws are inside, and sew the parts together.  From below, you need to leave a hole so that the blank of a soft toy from fleece can be turned out. </li><li>  After you sewed and twisted the craft, fill it with holofiber and sew the hole manually. </li><li>  Glue the eyes to the muzzle and embroider the nose. </li></ol><h2>  Snowman: necessary materials </h2><p>  To sew a snowman out of fleece with your own hands, you will need: </p><ul><li>  white and blue fleece; </li><li>  two small black beads; </li><li>  large red bead for the nose; </li><li>  white and blue threads; </li><li>  two buttons; </li><li>  synthetic winterizer; </li><li>  scissors. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Snowman pattern" class="if uuid-3171769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3171769.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  How to sew a snowman? </h2><p>  The pattern consists of two circles of different diameters and a rectangle for the cap.  You can draw such a snowman pattern yourself and cut it out of paper.  Then, using the pattern, cut a smaller circle from the white fleece, and the second circle from the blue rectangle.  Also cut a small strip of blue fleece to make a scarf. </p><p>  We make long stitches along the edges of both circles, put a synthetic winterizer in them and tighten the thread.  As a result, you should get two balls. </p><p>  On the edges of the scarf we cut small strips, making a fringe. </p><p>  The cap piece is doubled and sewn.  Turn the cap below, and rewind the thread or cord from above. </p><p>  Sew the white ball to the blue and decorate the bottom with two buttons. </p><p>  We put a hat on the snowman and tie a scarf, and sew beads on the muzzle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Snowmen from fleece" class="if uuid-3171791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3171791.jpg"></div><h2>  New Year hat </h2><p>  Fleece is perfect for making a merry Christmas cap.  You will need red and white fleece, threads of appropriate colors and a pompom. </p><p>  First you need to measure the girth of the head to determine the required amount of fleece.  For example, the head circumference will be 58 cm and the cap height 50 cm. We draw a pattern in the shape of a triangle on a rectangle on paper.  The total height of the figure should be 50 cm, the height of the rectangle is 8 cm, and its width is 29 cm (half of the circumference of the head). </p><p>  According to the pattern from red fleece, we cut out two such details, and from white we make only two rectangles 29 x 8. </p><p>  Fold the parts with the sides inward and sew them around the edges.  Sew a white strip to the bottom of the red cap so that it can then be turned off with the face up.  We turn off the white strip and sew it on top of the hat.  At the end, we sew on a pompom, which can be made from tinsel. </p><h2>  Fleece applique </h2><p>  To make such an application is quite simple.  All you need is a pattern and multi-colored fleece.  For example, if you want to embroider a beautiful owl on a pillow on the pattern below, then first you need to cut out all the details separately, and then assemble the future application in stages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Owl application" class="if uuid-3171798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3171798.jpg"></div><p>  You will need to cut 6 circles for the eyes (2 larger, 2 medium and 2 small), one torso, beak, 2 legs, 2 wings, two parts of a branch and several leaves. </p><p>  First you need to collect the owl's eyes, taking turns sewing circles on each other, starting from the largest and ending with the smallest.  Then you need to sew eyes to the head.  After that, we sew the beak, wings and paws.  Then we sew a twig and leaves to the pillow, and on top of them we attach an owl. </p><h2>  Cat pillow </h2><p>  To make such a craft from fleece, you will need a bright fabric, scissors, threads, small pieces of red and white material, a synthetic winterizer or holofiber and a pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="unicornhatparty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cat pillow pattern" class="if uuid-3171795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3171795.jpg"></div><p>  We attach the pattern cut out of paper to the fabric and cut out two parts of the body.  Fold the parts together with the front sides inwards and stitch them, leaving a small area.  We turn the craft out and stuff it with a synthetic winterizer.  The amount of pillow filler depends on your preference.  The main thing is that it be packed evenly. </p><p>  From the red fabric we cut out the nose and heart, and from the white - two eyes.  Sew the eyes and nose to the cat's face, and the heart - from the bottom to the body.  Embroider thread in the mouth, pupils, mustache and cilia. </p><h2>  Dog toy </h2><p>  To make a wicker toy for a dog, you only need three strips of fabric in different colors measuring 7 x 30 cm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.luxrysale.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Toy for dogs" class="if uuid-3171820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3171820.jpg"></div><p>  The strips need to be folded together and tied in the middle with a thread or cord.  On both sides of this place we weave the fabric into a tight pigtail to the middle of the length.  For convenience, it is worth fixing the second half of the pigtail with something heavy. </p><p>  Fold the braided braid in half and braid the remaining edges into one pigtail.  At the end, we tie the edges of the braid into a tight knot, and your toy is ready. </p><h2>  Fleece flowers </h2><p>  From this material you can make a cute decoration for a hairpin, headband or doll.  You only need a strip of fleece fabric 56 x 2.5 cm and a needle with thread. </p><p>  Fold a strip of fabric and secure it from the bottom with pins.  Sew a flower from below with a red thread, as shown in the image, passing with a needle through all layers of the rose. </p><div class="photo" data-original="whileshenaps.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fleece flower" class="if uuid-3171901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3171901.jpg"></div><p>  From a green cloth, cut a leaf and stick it under the flower.  The first should be large enough to completely cover the bottom of the flower.  If desired, veins can be embroidered on it. </p><p>  If you make several of these colors, then they can be attached to the hoop.  Or you can glue a fleece rose to a pin or hairpin. </p><p>  Fabric flowers are also easy to make in another way: just cut out a few details of the flower and sew them in the middle.  You can decorate the craft with beads or ribbons, as you like. </p>
