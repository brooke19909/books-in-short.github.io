    <p>  Tourists visit the cooper's workshop in Kranevo primarily to get acquainted with the process of making barrels.  This business, as you know, is rather complicated.  At the end of the tour, the group independently collects a mock barrel. </p><p>  The Baltata Nature Reserve is one of the most beautiful natural areas of the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria.  It is a forest flooded with water.  In total, more than 16 species of fish and about 250 species of plants live in this reserve. </p>
