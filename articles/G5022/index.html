We will not wonder here what attracts tourists to the Costa Brava.  Let's consider better where to stay in Lloret de Mar.  This is a rather large resort, but not far from the sea.  True, there are new quarters located behind the Blanes-Tossa highway. </p><p>  But if you want to be in the midst of the evening life of Lloret de Mar, and reach the beach in five minutes, you need to look for a hotel in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe main avenue of the resort.  Nightclubs, discos and the like entertainments are concentrated on this important highway which is perpendicular to the sea coast.  In this vibrant area is the hotel, which will be discussed in this article.  It is called Gran Hotel Don Juan Palace 4 *.  Photos of the hotel and reviews of tourists will complement our description of the hotel.  To begin with, we say that the rating of the hotel, according to "Booking", is 6.5 out of ten possible points. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gran Hotel Don Juan Palace 4" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2086450.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Location in relation to urban infrastructure </h2><p>  Hotel Gran Hotel Don Juan Palace 4 * (Spain) is located at: Carrer de la Riera, 77. Avenue Marles Vilarrodona - the main boulevard of the resort of Lloret de Mar - is a hundred meters away.  Thus, evening entertainment is located quite close to the hotel.  But the street itself is very quiet.  To the embankment an unhurried step to walk from the hotel for about six minutes.  The access to the sea is closer to the place where the monument ‚ÄúThe Wife of the Sailor‚Äù (Donna Mariner) stands.  There is a bus stop near the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, it is easy to go to the more secluded beaches of the neighboring small resort of Fenals (and at the same time visit the wonderful botanical garden of St. Clotilde in this town).  The hotel is also located three kilometers from the Lloret Water World water park.  Within walking distance is one of the resort's attractions - the church of Sant Roma, built in an interesting modernist style and externally similar to a painted casket.  Barcelona Airport is 92 kilometers away, and Girona is 23. Near the hotel there are many shops and cafes.  The nearest beach is three hundred meters away. </p>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Gran Hotel Don Juan Palace 4 * - chain hotel.  She belongs to the Don Juan Hotels.  The representative office of this network in Lloret de Mar was built in 1972.  Since then, the hotel has been renovated several times.  The latter took place in early 2017.  The hotel consists of one six-story building.  It is easy to recognize from afar by its beautiful white facade with a semicircular trellised ledge.  The building faces the road.  Thus, very few rooms face the street.  The hotel building stretched like a half-open book deep into its territory.  Next to the building are two outdoor swimming pools with a sun terrace and jacuzzi.  Since the Grand Hotel Don Juan Palace is located in the very center of the resort, its territory is small.  There is a walking alley past the pools, very beautifully designed.  Reviews claim that it creates the illusion of a large space.  The greenery of palm trees and Mediterranean vegetation creates a wonderful shadow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gran Hotel Don Juan Palace 4 pics" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2086451.jpg"></div>

The simplest is the standard.  There are more than half of such rooms in the hotel.  Some tourists complain that it is not easy to travel alone.  Often you have to pay for a double room.  But the Don Juan hotels have prepared standards for one guest.  There are also double rooms - both for couples and for two friends, with separate beds.  Reviews say that the beds are so wide that three people can live in a room - for example, parents and a child.  Families of four are provided for families of four.  These rooms include a bedroom with a living room with a seating area and a sofa.  There is also a junior suite category.  The room consists of two bedrooms without an adjacent door and a living room.  The upper class is the "family suite".  These rooms are located on the top floor and have a spacious wooden terrace, two bedrooms and a living room.  However, balconies have all the facilities for guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gran Hotel Don Juan Palace 4 Spain" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2086448.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Room filling </h2><p>  Reviews note that the bedrooms <span>of the Gran Hotel</span> Don Juan Palace 4 * are quiet and cozy.  The soundproofing in the building is excellent, and blackout curtains completely darken the rooms.  Each room has a flat-screen satellite TV, air conditioning, a safety deposit box and a telephone.  Bathrooms are equipped with showers and hairdryers.  Cosmetic supplies are replenished with every cleaning, which is carried out daily.  Maids change bed linen twice a week.  The downside of equipping the rooms was called the lack of a refrigerator.  But there is a ‚ÄúWi-Fi‚Äù - fast, but alas, paid (five euros per day, 10 - for three days).  Reviews of hotel rooms are mostly very friendly.  Extensive sizes, stylish design, comfortable mattresses and pillows are praised.  In case the weather is cold, the guest will find blankets in the closet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gran Hotel Don Juan Palace 4 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2086453.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Gran Hotel Don Juan Palace 4 * does not limit its guests in the choice of modes.  In Spain, the all-inclusive concept of nutrition is almost not practiced.  But you can choose ‚Äúbreakfast only‚Äù, ‚Äúhalf board‚Äù and ‚Äúfull board‚Äù.  Drinks are included in the morning meal.  For lunch and dinner, you need to buy them - except ordinary water.  All meals are served buffet style in the hotel restaurant.  It has a beautifully decorated air-conditioned room.  In addition to this institution, the hotel has two bars - in the lounge and near the pool.  Reviews all praise the food at the hotel as one.  Breakfast is no different, but there is always a wide selection of dishes.  There are boiled eggs (guests decide whether to make soft-boiled or hard-boiled eggs), scrambled eggs, sausages, fried bacon.  Hotel guests with nostalgia recall cheese and meat cuts.  You can eat plenty of jamon there.  But the guests especially praise the lunches and dinners at the hotel.  Seafood paella, octopus salad, gazpacho soup, cream catalan - you can hardly try such Spanish dishes in the a la carte restaurant!  There are always a lot of meat and fish dishes, fresh fruits and wonderful pastries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Gran Hotel Don Juan Palace 4" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2086454.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches.  Pools Gran Hotel Don Juan Palace 4 * </h2><p>  The description of the hotel would be incomplete if we did not devote a few lines to freshwater tanks on its territory.  There are only three swimming pools.  Two of them are located outdoors.  One is surrounded by a wooden sun terrace, while the other is surrounded by greenery.  There is also a small hot tub - also in the open.  A third heated pool is located indoors.  There are very few reviews of these freshwater reservoirs.  It is only known that they are clean, and there are enough sunbeds for everyone.  But most tourists did not rest there, because even the most wonderful pool does not compare with the Mediterranean Sea. </p><p>  The nearest beach is Playa de Lloret.  It‚Äôs about five or six minutes to go to him.  Fine sand, wide and vast coast.  The beach is well maintained and meets European standards.  There is a first-aid post with rescuers, and a toilet, and showers.  But the changing cabins on the Spanish beaches for some reason are not provided.  Sun beds and umbrellas are paid.  Lloret beach has a lot of water activities.  Excursion boats depart regularly.  If you want a more relaxing beach holiday, reviews recommend that you take a bus and ride to the neighboring village of Fenals.  The same soft sand and clear water, but the people are many times smaller. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gran Hotel Don Juan Palace 4 hotel reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2086455.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  What service awaits guests at the Gran Hotel Don Juan Palace 4 *?  Description of free services does not take up much space.  The first is animation.  Although the hotel positions itself as a youth, the administration is trying to please guests of all ages.  Sometimes groups of Spanish pensioners drop in here.  For them, dances with a master class are arranged.  Also often show programs are invited by professional artists.  You can watch the performances of flamenco groups, belly dancing, magicians, etc.  Parking in front of the hotel offers guests a free place.  There is also a tennis court at the hotel - you need to pay out money only for evening lighting. </p><p>  Paid services include hairdressing, wi-fi.  The reception is open around the clock.  Some clerks speak Russian.  They will help you to book tickets or excursions, call a taxi, wake up by phone call at the appointed time. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Hotel Gran Hotel Don Juan Palace 4 * is a five-minute walk from the main bus station Lloret de Mar.  Thus, you can make independent one-day excursions in Catalonia.  For example, it‚Äôs easy to go to Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãfirst by bus to Blanes, and then by train directly to Plaza Espanya.  Reviews strongly recommend a trip to the medieval town of Tossa.  There are buses from Lloret de Mar station.  And at the resort itself, tourists are advised to take a walk to the ancient Iberian settlements and the castle of San Juan.  The last building is a remake, but it looks very romantic. </p><h2>  Gran Hotel Don Juan Palace 4 *: hotel reviews </h2><p>  This hotel will appeal to those who are looking for incendiary fun and drive in Catalonia.  The hotel is inhabited by 85 percent of young people from Western Europe.  There are very few Russians, but there is a girl from the Russian Federation at the reception who helps former fellow citizens who do not know languages ‚Äã‚Äãto solve their problems.  Many tourists note the extremely good location of the hotel to places of entertainment in the city.  Nearby there are McDonald's, KFC and Burger King, the USSR nightclub.  Despite the fact that the public at the hotel is noisy, the nights here are quiet.  And for this you need to thank the excellent soundproofing in the rooms of Gran Hotel Don Juan Palace 4 *.  Reviews praise the food in the restaurant and the friendliness of the staff.  The cleaned rooms are also excellent. </p>
