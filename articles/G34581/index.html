  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Phones Vertu</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <strong>A little bit about the manufacturers</strong> .  The Vertu brand created by Nokia.  Vertu - these are phones of the elite class, the case of which is made of wood, white and yellow gold, platinum, decorated with precious stones.  This brand, created for people of fairly high material wealth. </p><p>  By the way, the very word Vertu from French means "courageous" and from English as "ascent", which even the name emphasizes the success of the owner.  These phones are manufactured in the UK, where Vertu is bought by Ukrainian and Russian intermediaries.  Of particular value, design and quality are the Signature and Ascent line phones.  These phones consist of over 900 tested parts. </p><p>  You can distinguish these phones from others by the capital letter V on the top panel of the phone and V-shaped contours on the display and buttons.  If the owner wants to contact the world help desk, a special Vertu Consierge call button is provided on the phone. </p><p>  On this phone you can answer a number of questions about medical treatment, foreign tours and which countries are best to go to relax, which beauty salons to put in order, as well as entertainment and events dedicated to sports of art, where you can eat and etc.  In addition, you can also call an ambulance using this button or wizard. </p><p>  The most typical models for this brand are Vertu Ti, Vertu Constellations Precious, Vertu Ascent X and others. </p><p>  <strong>Review of</strong> <strong>Vertu</strong> <strong>Signature</strong> <strong>II</strong> .  For example, the article will outline the Vertu Signature II model. </p><p>  <strong>Design.</strong>  The button on the left is the volume control, the button on the right is a concierge call to turn the phone on and off - the button is on top, like with many simple Nokia models.  Also on the right is the connector for the USB cable. </p><p>  At the back there is a lever for removing the cover in the battery area, and under it is the name of the master who assembled this model. </p><p>  <strong>Screen</strong> <strong> </strong>  rectangular, but outlined by contours in the form of V. When you turn on, you can see that the colors are not bright, but calm.  The backlight also has a moderate light, turns on and off smoothly.  Glass does not scratch. </p><p>  Sound.  Used Yamaha sound processor.  The sound is not so loud, but saturated. </p><p>  <strong>Control.</strong>  Standard.  It has the functions of simplifying control when several processes are performed using the navigation button or a number of others, which is quite convenient to use. </p><p>  <strong>Keyboard.</strong>  V-shaped buttons, which are inconvenient for a set of messages, but probably a person with a lot of money calls more often than writes.  Therefore, most likely, this is not necessary. </p><p>  <strong>Functions</strong>  For the phone, image is more important than functions.  Although the phone still has a standard set: a 4 gigabyte memory card, support for 3G format, the presence of Bluetooth, a good player, with synchronization of music by genre and other settings. </p><p>  <strong>Options</strong>  Packaging <strong> </strong>  Stylish and strictly design.  In the presence of a disk with software, a napkin for the screen.  Two batteries and a charger.  But there is no case and headset. </p><p>  In general, the phone justifies its price when it comes to image design and a number of other characteristics. </p></div></article>
