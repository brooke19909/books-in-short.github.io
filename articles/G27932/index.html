    <p>  However, this is the best time for surfers.  Turbid water does not upset them.  At this time, they can go kiteboarding or surfing.

In the reviews, the girls write that, yes it is possible.  Becoming a mulatto while relaxing on Koh Samui will work out without much difficulty.

There are a lot of interesting sights.  Every tourist should visit the botanical gardens and nature parks.

    <p>  There are many Buddhist temples on Koh Samui that will not leave you indifferent.  Or you can go to the Muslim village, where you will see non-tourist life.  Poverty and mountains of garbage are everywhere.  But still there is something very beautiful, namely the yellow-green Muslim mosque. </p><p>  Locals earn their living by fishing.  For this reason, the beaches have a huge number of boats anchored.  Catch is sold in markets, restaurants and shops. </p><p>  You can rent a jeep on Koh Samui and go on your personal excursion.  Unfortunately, taking a bike will not work, as it rains quite often here.  A jeep will be great for a ride on the ring road, stopping at places you like.  True, not everyone will like to ride potholes - a similar ride for those who love extreme sports. </p><p>  In the village of Chaweng a lot of entertainment for young people.  Soi Green Mango is the center of nightlife.  There are many bars, clubs, as well as discos.  Many beloved fast foods, such as McDonald's and Starbuks, also work here.  In general, in this place you can have a good time. </p>

    <p>  True, you should not live in this area.  Since if you want to go to bed early, then this will not work, because the music plays here until dawn. </p><p>  On Fridays, after four in the evening, take a trip to Bophut or Nathon Beach.  On this day there are pedestrian streets.  That is, you will not meet any bikes and cars, only walking people.  In this place, tourists have the opportunity to enjoy the reigning atmosphere of the holiday.  Here you can try different goodies and listen to live music.  If you get to the very end, you can find yourself by the sea. </p><p>  I would like to tell you about one wonderful cafe on the beach - Coconut.  It is located at Bophut.  Incredibly delicious desserts and drinks are served there, prepared, as you might guess from the name, from a real coconut.  The cafe has tables with large pillows, where you can comfortably sit down, relax and enjoy the sunset and beautiful views. </p><h2>  Festivals and holidays on Koh Samui </h2><p>  On September 15, the island celebrates Mid-Autumn Festival.  Also, a major Jazz festival takes place here one of the weeks of the month.  It gathers a lot of musicians and listeners from different countries.  Some specially come to Samui in order to get to this holiday. </p><h2>  What are the prices of food and housing? </h2><p>  Holidays in September has another advantage.  Due to the fact that precipitation is getting larger, the cost of housing and airline tickets is significantly reduced, compared with August.  Fruits and souvenirs are also sold here cheaper than usual.  The same applies to various excursions. </p><h2>  Little conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know what the weather is in <span>Koh Samui (Thailand)</span> in September.  As you can see, it is difficult to predict it. </p>

    <p>  There are heavy rains here from time to time, and the sea becomes restless, but this alone can be considered a lack of relaxation.  Many, on the contrary, like this weather.  Tourists claim that the air then becomes even cleaner. </p><p>  In September for vacationers there are lots of options for recreation.  After all, the sea is still warm, while there is no extreme heat.  And the prices for entertainment and goodies are noticeably lower. </p>
