Girls are ready to watch for hours on beautiful dresses with cute tutu skirts and tops embroidered with beads or rhinestones.  And if the child does not practice ballet, but wants to try on a similar outfit for himself, why not please the little daughter and turn her into a ballerina at the New Year's party?  Moreover, creating such an image is not at all difficult and not costly. </p><p>  The ballerina costume is suitable not only for the New Year celebration.  It can be worn without problems for a birthday or just for the game.  Therefore, you should not put off creating it and think that now is the wrong time.  The description below will make it easy to understand the sequence of work, as a result of which a delightful ballerina costume will surely come out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ballerina costume" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1163528.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Image Details </h2><p>  In order not to forget a single trifle, it is worth immediately determining which elements of the image must be present in the suit.  It is best to take a photo as an example or sketch a sketch of the desired outfit yourself.  A ballerina costume must have <span>a tulle skirt</span> and a beautiful top or a tight-fitting long-sleeve T-shirt.  You can take ready golf with a throat.  <span>White tights</span> or socks are also required.  Pointe shoes can easily replace Czechs or shoes, on which you can attach pieces of satin ribbons, which will need to be wrapped around the lower legs.  If a t-shirt on thin straps is used for the top, white gloves will perfectly complement the suit.  Artificial flowers can be woven into long hair, and hairpins or a headband with a beautiful decoration are suitable for a short haircut. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Suit color </h2><p>  Children's costume ballerinas can be made in absolutely any color.  A key detail, such as a tutu skirt, will make the image easily recognizable, whether it is made in white or black, or in any other shade of the rainbow.  It is better to consult with a little fashionista and give her the opportunity to participate in creating her image. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a pack" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1163785.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Skirt making </h2><p>  The main question when creating the <span>image of a ballerina</span> is how to sew a pack.  It is this garment that in most cases causes difficulties.  However, the process of creating a tutu skirt is complicated only at first glance.  There are several options for creating this thing, one of them does not require sewing skills at all.  To work, you need a dense elastic band according to the child‚Äôs waist and three meters of tulle, cut into strips 10-15 cm wide and 60 or 80 cm long, depending on which skirt you need.  The whole process consists in the fact that strips of fabric need to be tied to an elastic band with a loop close together.  It is very important that the tulle be well ironed, because the finished product is quite difficult to put in order if the fabric is wrinkled. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ballerina costume for new year" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1163786.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is also worth considering the option of how to sew a bundle using a sewing machine.  Everything here is also quite simple.  Three strips of tulle with a width equal to the length of the skirt + 3 cm, and a length of 4.5-6 meters are folded into cuts, a line is drawn, departing from the edge of 1 cm, then the back seam of the skirt is sewn and a drawstring is made for the elastic at the top, tucking the stitched edge of the fabric inward.  After that you will have to put a strong elastic into the drawstring.  Everything, the pack is ready! </p><h2>  Top creation </h2><p>  If a suitable shirt is not found in the child‚Äôs wardrobe, it can be sewn from a knitted fabric.  This will require a strip of fabric with a width equal to the measurement from the shoulder and just below the waist, and the length of the child‚Äôs waist.  The fabric is folded in half, the neck and armholes are drawn, the excess is cut off, and then the shoulder and side seams are processed.  If for work take a supplex, then the slices can be left just open.  They will not crumble or go arrows.  In the case of a cotton cloth, you can treat them with an elastic band.  As you can see from the description, it‚Äôs not very difficult to sew a top on a ballerina‚Äôs costume, the whole process will take no more than 20 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ballerina costume for girls" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1163779.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Making gloves </h2><p>  Gloves are best made from either supplex or oil.  Cotton is not suitable for this purpose.  Of course, a ballerina costume will look more harmonious, in which the top and gloves are sewn from the same material.  However, using an identical canvas is completely optional.  In addition, gloves can be sewn from knitted guipure, which will look very gentle and romantic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  So, in order to sew gloves, you need to cut a strip of fabric equal to the desired length and a width of the child‚Äôs wrist + 1 cm. Sew an elastic band on one edge of the strip (top of the glove).  After the workpiece is folded over long sections and a small corner is cut off at the bottom of the glove to make an arm lap.  Sew a loop from a satin ribbon for a finger.  And last but not least, the glove seam is closed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="children's ballerina costume" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1163788.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  Decorative elements </h2><p>  A ballerina costume for a girl must be decorated with various flowers, stones, rhinestones or sequins.  These elements will add chic and shine to the created image.  The ballerina's costume for the <span>New Year</span> can be embroidered with rain.  At the same time, the outfit itself should be done in green, as if the ballerina was playing the role of the Christmas tree, or else leave the image snow-white, associating it with soft fluffy snowflakes. </p><h2>  Outfit Tips </h2><p>  An ideal option for creating a pack is tulle.  But it has many varieties.  There are canvases with brilliant spraying, with small looped peas and even with a pattern.  It is also distinguished by stiffness.  Too dense tulle holds its shape well and can be used as one of the layers of an embroidered bundle for a more magnificent form. </p><p>  You can also not disregard such material as organza lace.  Quite often it is embroidered with sequins and looks very unusual.  It can be combined with hard and soft tulle and make an original skirt.  However, with such a rich decor of the packs, the top should be left matte and plain.  The ballerina's costume for the New Year can be made from tulle to a small snowflake in combination with a calm top.  Or make a pack of strips of material, and glue pieces of tinsel on top. </p><p>  A ballerina costume for a girl can be themed.  What prevents, for example, from making a character from Swan Lake?  A beautiful tutu with glued swan down and an appropriately decorated rim - and the outfit of a charming swan is ready. </p><h2>  Pack creation options </h2><p>  Of course, it is very easy to work with tulle, but there are other worthy materials that are worth paying attention to.  Carnival costume "Ballerina" will look great with a pack of chiffon or the above-mentioned organza.  The cut and sewing techniques of such a skirt are slightly different and require some skills. </p>

    <p>  To create such a product, you will need a template for a sun skirt, <span>basic fabric, a</span> thin regeline, a <span>slanting trim</span> for processing the hem and elastic at the waist.  The amount of fabric is calculated based on the number of layers of the skirt.  To make the product look beautiful, there should be at least three layers. </p><p>  The creation process consists in cutting out three or more circles from the main fabric according to the pattern, making a waist cutout with an elastic band, connecting all the layers together, and then treating them on the outer edge with regeline and oblique inlay, stretching the canvas to form waves.  Such an original skirt is good for combining with a satin top, organza flowers, stones and rhinestones. </p><h2>  Optional accessories </h2><p>  Quite often, for a ballerina's costume, they sew small skirts on their hands, which are worn on the forearm.  And I must say, such elements look quite interesting.  To stitch such an accessory, you will need a strip of the main fabric of which the bundle is made, about 50 cm long and no more than 7 cm wide. It is sewn together in a smaller cut, one edge is sewn into the backside or with an oblique trim, and on the second a drawstring is made for the elastic band. </p>

    <p>  To make the image more realistic, you can not do without pointe shoes or their imitation.  Shoes or Czechs and satin ribbons have already been mentioned, but the whole problem is that if the child moves a lot, the entire binding around the leg will simply fall down.  Therefore, you can take advantage of a little trick: take knee-high socks, put on a child‚Äôs foot, wrap around a linen and tie with a beautiful bow, and then gently place a ribbon for golf with small stitches.  With such a secure fit, you can dance for hours on end. </p><p>  Another interesting accessory that is usually worn by ballerinas is a flower on the wrist.  You can choose a suitable size of a rose or a lily in a wedding salon, even with swan feathers and bead pendants, and sew it onto a regular white hair elastic.  You can decorate the hair with a similar flower. </p>
