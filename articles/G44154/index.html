In our country, this is the norm that allows a change in one direction or another by up to 10%.  That is, as long as the voltage is in the range from 200 to 245 volts, household electrical appliances operate normally.  However, the state of the majority of operating energy systems, including devices for the transmission, conversion and distribution of energy transfer, is such that quite often the mains voltage drops below the mentioned 200 V. Because of this, many household appliances may not work properly and even fail.  Partially solve the problem can single-phase <span>voltage stabilizers for the home.</span>  There are three-phase modifications, but their use at home is limited due to the small distribution of home appliances at 380 V. </p><h2>  Magic devices </h2>

    <p>  A single-phase voltage stabilizer is a device consisting of a relatively small transformer with several terminals of the secondary winding, a control unit and auxiliary elements (protection, cooling, indication).  Electricity is supplied through two input wires from the network to the device, and the required 220 V are supplied through the other. Everything is very simple.  Depending on the method of adjusting the input voltage, three types of these devices are distinguished: electric, relay and electronic voltage regulator single-phase.  Just note that the best among them is not.  For example, from the point of view of manufacturability, an electronic model is preferable, but at a cost it significantly exceeds two other modifications.  Not every buyer can spend several thousand on a modern electronic single-phase voltage stabilizer.  The features of each of them will be discussed below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The most important characteristic </h2><p>  Before buying, it is important to remember that any electrical appliance is characterized by the amount of power consumption.  This value is always indicated both on the nameplate and in the accompanying documentation.  For example, a small storage boiler will take about 1.5 kW of energy from the network;  the vacuum cleaner will pull on all 3 kW;  and iron - about 2 kW.  These are one of the most powerful consumers in a modern home.  Televisions, pumps, light bulbs, computers also require a certain amount of electricity to operate.  Why is this important to understand?  The fact is that the selected single-phase voltage stabilizer should be able to pass the necessary power through itself.  Otherwise, he not only fails to issue the necessary 220 V, but he himself may fail.  Moreover, regardless of the design. </p><h2>  Power selection </h2><p>  If a single-phase voltage stabilizer is connected to power any one device (computer, boiler, pump), then it is necessary to compare their power.  So, the value declared in the stabilizer in watts or kilowatts should be 40-50% higher than the consumption of the connected device. </p>

    <p>  Immediate equality is unacceptable!  This is due to the fact that when the mains voltage drops to 150 V, the single-phase voltage regulator, although it continues to produce 220% (+ ‚Äì10%), loses power twice in this mode of operation.  The exact value cannot be called, since it is determined by the type of transformer used (torroid, -magnetic circuit), consumer characteristics, etc. It can be roughly assumed that a single-phase voltage regulator of 10 kW, working at 150 V, can supply electrical appliances with a total power of no more 6 kW  And the declared characteristics are achievable only if 200-240 V are supplied from the external network. This is such a feature. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If it is planned to power the whole house or apartment through the device, then the same rule must be observed.  Before buying, it is recommended to make a list of home electrical equipment, highlighting the one that often works at a time, and summarize the power.  Usually it will be 30-50% of the total brownie.  Since this parameter directly affects the cost of the product, it is usually considered that the power of the selected stabilizer should be 20% higher than the obtained value: <span>this is a compromise</span> between cost and capabilities. </p><h2>  Full and active power </h2><p>  Before buying, you should carefully read the specification for the device, since the power value can be given both in kilowatts (kW) and in kilovolt-amperes (kVA).  The specifics of household electrical equipment is such that the first is more important.  If the manufacturer indicated the full (kVA), then tentatively we can assume that the active (kW) will be 30% less.  That is, a 3 kVA stabilizer will be able to pull home appliances with a total consumption of no more than 2 kW.  Of course, the calculation is indicative, and other factors can influence, but usually it is enough. </p>

    <p>  As we have already indicated, in addition to power, the most important characteristic of any stabilizer is its design.  Before buying, be sure to pay <span>attention</span> to <span>this.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Installation method </h2><p>  Single-phase voltage stabilizers for a house can be used both to supply a stable 220 V to any one device (for example, a wall-mounted heating boiler), or to a group (the whole house).  Of course, the second option is more convenient when always 220 V in any home outlet, regardless of power surges in the external network.  The disadvantage is that if, for example, the Resant model for 500 W, ideal for a boiler, costs 1,700 rubles, then a 15-phase voltage regulator of the same company, ideal for a modern house, will have to pay as much as 27 thousand rubles.  Comments are perhaps unnecessary. </p><h2>  Relay models </h2><p>  According to many owners, the best voltage regulator is a relay.  It is based on a transformer with several terminals of the secondary winding.  A special electronic unit constantly compares the value of the incoming voltage with a reference voltage of 220 V and, if there is a discrepancy above a certain value, it activates the relay for switching the windings, thereby increasing or decreasing the effective value at the output.  When these elements are triggered, characteristic clicks are heard.  The number of relays determines the number of stages.  The more of them, the softer the switch. </p>

    <p>  Let's see how similar models work.  While 220 V (+ ‚Äì10%) is supplied to the stabilizer, no adjustment is made.  But here the voltage dropped, say, to 190 V. The comparison unit sees this and turns on the relay, thus switching the windings, that the missing 30 V is added to the output. As a result, 220 V. This is one triggered stage. </p><p>  The same mechanism is activated when necessary, lowering the only difference that other winding leads are used.  If there are several steps, then the switching in the considered example will occur not only at 190 V, but also at intermediate values.  The more steps, the more often switching, and the difference, respectively, is less than the mentioned 30 V. This allows you to always get 220 V at the output, and not 220 V (+ ‚Äì10%).  The voltage stabilizer circuit of this design is quite simple and maintainable, since it most often uses automotive relays.  True, the owners note that because of the clicks, it is better not to install models of this class in rooms where people are constantly located.  Among budgetary, but rather reliable solutions, we can mention the products of Resanta, Energy, Voltaire companies. </p><h2>  Servo </h2>

    <p>  No less interesting are the models in which there are no switching steps in the classical sense.  Inside such models, a fairly simple scheme is established for comparing the input voltage with a reference value.  Current collectors driven by a small electric motor move along the transformer windings: there are no relays.  The adjustment is smooth.  Due to the presence of moving parts, reliability is lower than that of electronic versions.  Nice build in the Rucelf SDW line.  The scourge of models of this class is frequent jumping.  Therefore, if drawdowns occur on the line due to welding, then servo-drive modifications cannot be used.  In other cases, these stabilizers are an excellent acquisition, since they are quieter than relay ones and cost less than electronic ones. </p><h2>  Managed keys </h2><p>  The most expensive and most advanced are stabilizers on thyristors or triacs.  These semiconductor elements perform the same function as the relay - they switch the windings.  Since there are no moving parts, the reliability is the highest.  In addition, the switching speed is a fraction of a second.  If you have extra cash, it is recommended to buy models of this particular class. </p><h2>  Problem of choice </h2><p>  A person who decides to purchase a stabilizer for the home is faced with an abundance of conflicting information.  For example, in different outlets the same model can be endowed with characteristics taken from the ceiling.  Especially regarding the adjustment method.  Accessing the developer's site often confuses the customer even more.  For example, conventional relay models can proudly be called electromechanical, electronically controlled.  Indeed, <span>the voltage stabilizer circuit</span> in them is such that the comparison unit is made on microcircuits.  True, for the future owner, frankly, it does not matter.  Or, to attract buyers, some sellers and manufacturers began to use the term ‚Äúdigital‚Äù.  In practice, this means that the comparison unit is slightly redesigned, and the voltage indication is not arrow-shaped, but display.  Did this element work poorly in models of past generations?  Great, of course.  So, maybe it makes no sense to overpay for a fashionable term?  When choosing a stabilizer, you need to remember that the main thing in these devices is a way to switch windings.  It is this characteristic that affects performance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="voltage regulator circuit" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/735663.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If in doubt, it is recommended to look inside the case through the ventilation holes or ask to turn on the stabilizer through an autotransformer and create power surges.  If it clicks, then the switch is relay.  It is barely audible buzzing - the electric motor is working, this is a servo-drive model.  Well, complete silence means that electronic keys are installed inside. </p><p>  If you call the leaders, then we can say that the company "Energy" produces excellent models of stabilizers, as can be judged by the reviews of the owners.  But the products of Chinese manufacturers are not always at the level: buying products from Forte is a lottery.  For some it works for years, for others it burns out in a month. </p><h2>  Cost issue </h2><p>  It is not enough to determine the required power and method of connection (powering one appliance or a group of them).  In addition, the price of the product is important.  The market offers a huge number of stabilizers from different manufacturers.  Moreover, from the point of view of design, models of all three types are usually present in the product line of each.  Because of this, it is quite difficult to choose the best voltage regulator.  For example, one buyer wants to get the most reliable device, so to speak, for centuries.  He chooses the electronic option.  This can be, for example, a Resant single-phase voltage regulator with an ASN-8000/1-Ts electronic control type or Energy classic with a power of 7500 W, for which you will have to pay 25 thousand rubles.  Another likes the Voltron RSN-8000 model, which is based on a relay, which costs less - about 12 thousand.  Well, someone will like the price of the servo-drive "New Line-10000", amounting to 16,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  One way to choose a quality stabilizer is to study the opinions of people who have already managed to work with a particular model.  So, an excellent acquisition, according to users, is the Forte TVR-3000.  Active power is around 2.2 kW, although 3 kW is allowed at peaks.  This is a relay-type model that clicks during operation, so it is better to install it outside the living room (for example, in the hallway or in the kitchen).  Reviews indicate that the power is sufficient for a small house.  The features include some problems when working at high voltage.  That is, people living near the <span>step-down transformer,</span> it is better to refuse to buy this model. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about powering the entire house with a model with electronic switching of steps, then, according to reviews, Volter HL-9 has proven itself perfectly.  This stabilizer is designed for 9 kW, designed for wall mounting.  Quiet and reliable.  It has nine steps.  If necessary, power the boiler, computer, TV and other low-power equipment, consumers are advised to purchase a small Sven Neo R-500 stabilizer.  It works properly, the clicks of the relay are almost inaudible.  There are no voltmeters, but this is offset by the low cost (about 1000 rubles). </p><p>  Well, models from Resant deserve a thorough check.  They are most in the market.  However, the percentage of calls to repair shops is higher than that of others.  The main problem is that Chinese craftsmen have learned to stamp outwardly exact copies.  That is why in the original the excellent model ACH-8000/1-EM not only can quickly fail, but also looks different than the manufacturer. </p>
