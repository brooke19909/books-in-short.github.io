It covers the risks associated with loss of efficiency, death of the driver / passengers.  In the process of applying for the policy, the insurance amount is set at the request of the insured.  Depending on the terms of the contract, there are two ways to calculate it: according to the system of places and the lump-sum system.  In the first case, the payment is determined based on the number of seats in the car, and in the second, a percentage of the sum insured is established. </p><h2>  The essence of the term </h2><p>  The concept of “lump-sum payment” in translation from German means the total purchase amount for a certain amount of goods.  In franchising, the term implies the cost of the right to enter the market under a well-known brand.  The lump-sum insurance system is a specific system within which the payment amount is provided for the entire vehicle: each person who was in it during an accident is recognized as insured and receives a certain share of the total amount. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneydonut.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance protection" class="if uuid-2986986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2986986.jpg"></div><h2>  For whom? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the number of accidents on Russian roads is increasing.  If another driver is found guilty of the accident, then the insurance company (IC), which issued him the CTP policy, is obliged to pay compensation.  However, there are times when there are no perpetrators of the accident.  In such situations, compensation can be obtained from insurance in the accident.  Under this agreement, two payment options are provided: lump-sum and place insurance system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The lump-sum payment system is suitable for vehicles of legal entities in which passengers are located.  For example, taxi drivers should insure passengers at every seat they occupy.  The limit is set for the victims in a percentage ratio: 40% of the total amount per person, no more than 35% - for two.  If there are more victims, then the payment is divided equally into all.  At the same time, according to statistics, in an accident, the passenger sitting in the front seat is most at risk.  The severity of his injuries is much higher than that of passengers in the rear seats.  This despite the fact that payments are divided into all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneydonut.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="conclusion of an agreement" class="if uuid-2986989" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2986989.jpg"></div><p>  An accident according to the lump-sum system is the infliction of damage to life and health as a result of which the victim died, received a disability group, an injury.  In the event of complete disability, the size of the payment depends on the assigned group and is calculated as a percentage of the sum insured per person: </p><ul><li>  for group 1 - 90-100%; </li><li>  for 2 groups - 70-80%; </li><li>  for 3 groups - 50-60%. </li></ul><p>  In the event of the death of a passenger, a payment of 100% is made. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gurustrahovka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="policy and money" class="if uuid-2982196" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2982196.jpg"></div><p>  It should be noted that not all companies pay in the event of a complete disability.  If such an item is present in the contract, then the calculation of the amount on a lump-sum system can be carried out in two ways. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  In% of the sum insured for each day of disability.  In this case, the maximum payout is set at 10-50% of the limit. </li><li>  Depending on the degree of injury.  The Appendix to the Insurance Rules contains a table with a list of possible consequences of the National Assembly.  It sets the size of the payment. </li></ol><h2>  Limitations </h2><p>  The lump-sum payment system provides for limits that depend on the number of persons: </p><ul><li>  were in the cabin at the time of the accident; </li><li>  victims of road accidents; </li><li>  applying for payment. </li></ul><p>  The limit per person is: </p><ul><li>  40-50%, if only one victim; </li><li>  35% if two are injured; </li><li>  30% if three are injured; </li><li>  the insurance amount is divided by the number of people if four or more people suffered as a result of an accident. </li></ul><p>  Important!  When calculating the payment, the policyholder divides the total amount by the number of persons, regardless of the number of victims.  For example, if at the time of the accident only the driver was in the car, the payment will be 2-2.5 times less than the total amount under the contract. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gurustrahovka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="policy payment" class="if uuid-2982243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2982243.jpg"></div><h2>  What else to look for </h2><p>  Before signing an insurance contract, you should study in detail the rules and parameters of the product.  For different companies, insurance differs in the following ways. </p><ol><li>  The list of events.  It does not always correspond to the list of risks related to the vehicle.  So, when registering an NS policy, passengers can expect to be paid only in case of an accident. </li><li>  Term of notice.  Sometimes victims are given more days to fill out an application than in cases of damage to the car. </li><li>  Territory coverage.  Even if hull insurance is valid in the territory of foreign countries, insurance against NS may not cover the risks of harming the health of passengers outside the Russian Federation. </li><li>  The policyholder can rarely choose their own risks, apply a deductible.  This "inflexibility" reduces the demand for this product.  Nevertheless, the payment of the policy from the National Assembly does not depend on compensation for hull insurance.  Human life and health are priceless.  Therefore, compensation is always paid in full for all policies. </li></ol><h2>  How to get paid </h2><p>  After the insured event, you must notify the company.  Within 5 days, a decision is made whether the case is insurance.  If questions arise, the company has the right to conduct its own investigation for 30 days.  After making a positive decision, the victim must be provided with the results of a medical examination.  Payments are made at the described limits.  However, under the law, the UK must pay compensation, even if all certificates are not provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gurustrahovka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance policy" class="if uuid-2982195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20992/2982195.jpg"></div><h2>  Where else is the term used </h2><p>  For sailors a lump-sum wage system is provided.  The amount consists of the base salary and other payments, such as compensation for overtime.  The seafarer's employment contract clearly indicates the number of hours that he must work for a fee, as well as all kinds of payments under the lump-sum system.  If an hourly scheme is applied, then the rate should be at least 25% higher than the base rate.  The same principle is used if overtime hours are paid on a lump-sum basis. </p>
