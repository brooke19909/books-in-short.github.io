A loan will be fully issued without insurance, however, bank employees often impose an insurance procedure on the client, appealing that they may refuse to issue a loan without it.  A citizen always has the right to refuse insurance, and this will not be a reason for refusing credit (this rule does not apply to car loans and mortgages). </p><p>  That is, insurance is not mandatory, you can safely refuse to persuade a bank employee.  You can apply for a loan without issuing an insurance policy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="starbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to return insurance to the client" class="if uuid-3138551" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/3138551.jpg"></div><p>  However, there are situations when a person first draws up a loan agreement and insurance policy and only then thinks about what insurance was imposed on him.  In such cases, you can try to partially or fully return the insurance.  Theoretically, the return process is very simple, but in practice it turns out that it is not always possible to return insurance to the Post Bank. </p><p>  After applying for a loan and signing an insurance contract, it is important to act as quickly as possible, since due to any delay the return of insurance may become impossible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, we will find out how to return the loan insurance at the Post Bank. </p><h2>  Ways to return the insurance policy </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.sc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="return credit insurance mail bank" class="if uuid-3138538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/3138538.jpg"></div><p>  It is recommended to refuse personal insurance at the moment when a loan agreement is signed, that is, simply exclude the corresponding clause from it and refuse to pay the insurance premium.  It is very important to read the loan conditions before signing the contract.  If it is necessary to draw up an insurance policy, for example, when a bank refuses to lend without insurance, and finances are very much required, it is recommended that you immediately check with the bank employee the rules by which the policy is returned and the money paid for it is received. </p><p>  How to return credit insurance in the Post Bank, many are interested.  There are several options for the development of the situation: </p><ol><li>  Early repayment of a issued loan.  When a bank customer repays all debts ahead of schedule, he automatically no longer needs to use insurance.  In this regard, it makes sense to try to return part of the money.  However, this option is suitable only for those people who pay the premium in installments.  In this case, the client has the right to terminate the contract ahead of schedule and return part of the contributions.  But when insurance is paid in full when applying for a loan, it will be possible to perform the specified manipulation and return part of the insurance only if the loan agreement contains the corresponding clause.  Still how to return insurance on a loan in "Post Bank"? </li><li>  Unwillingness to use an insurance product.  When a bank employee imposed insurance, and the client himself did not initially plan to arrange it when lending to Post Bank, a policy can be returned, but only within the allotted time and only if there is information about such a possibility in the contract. </li></ol><h2>  The full amount is unlikely to be returned </h2><p>  In each of these cases, returning loan insurance to Post Bank is a rather painstaking task.  Even if you act in accordance with all the rules, it is unlikely that it will be possible to return the full cost of the policy - the insurance company and Pochta Bank will still withhold a certain amount in payment of interest on the provided service or other obscure procedure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Therefore, it is worth calculating how beneficial the return of insurance will be before contacting the bank.  In some cases, the amount that is returned to the client as a result is not worth the effort and time that was spent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankrate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="return credit insurance mail bank reviews" class="if uuid-3138537" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/3138537.jpg"></div><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  It is worth making a return of insurance under a loan agreement at Post Bank if the amount exceeds several tens of thousands.  The procedure for the return of the insurance premium must be followed strictly by the bank customer if he wants the insurance company to return the maximum amount. </p><p>  How to return the loan insurance in the "Post Bank" in case of early repayment, we will describe below. </p><h2>  Early repayment order </h2><p>  In order to return part of the sum insured (it is impossible to return the entire amount exactly - only for the period during which the person did not use the insurance), several actions must be performed in a certain order: </p><ol><li>  Contact "Post Bank" for information on the full repayment of credit debt. </li><li>  Contact the policyholder by providing him with an insurance contract and the specified certificate, and draw up an application for a partial refund.  You can get the application form directly from the policyholder or bank representative. </li><li>  Attach a package of necessary documents to the application.  As a rule, this is a certificate, a loan agreement, an insurance contract.  Sometimes a photocopy of your passport or other documents may be required.  How to return the insurance of the loan in the "Post Bank" after a year of repayment of the loan - this is a common question. </li><li>  The insurer is obliged to make a refund no later than 10 days from the receipt of the request. </li><li>  When the insurance company refuses to refund part of the funds, a written refusal should be requested from its representative. </li><li>  After receiving a written refusal, insurance documents and a statement are sent to the court for subsequent proceedings.  It should be borne in mind that in court it will be necessary to pay for some services yourself.  It is important to find out in advance how to repay loan insurance at Post Bank in case of early repayment of the loan. </li></ol><p>  It should be noted that the application and all documents for the return of insurance should be submitted exclusively to the office of the insurance company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to return postal loan loan insurance for early repayment of a loan" class="if uuid-3138539" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/3138539.jpg"></div><p>  If the loan was repaid ahead of schedule and the insurance was short, then the company quickly agrees to a refund.  But when the amount is large enough, you often have to insist on your right to refund.  Moreover, the insurance company will keep a part of the amount for payment of the commission. </p><h2>  Refund of insurance in case of unwillingness to use it </h2><p>  Sometimes a person at home understands that insurance was included in his contract, and its cost is quite high.  In this case, you should immediately begin the process of returning the insurance policy, and paid money to yourself. </p><p>  An application for the return of this amount should be submitted within a maximum of 14 business days from the date the policy begins.  Otherwise, the policyholder has the legal right to refuse to terminate the insurance contract and to refund the premium paid under the contract. </p><h2>  Procedure </h2><p>  In this case, the order of the borrower's main actions should be as follows: </p><ol><li>  Contact the bank and make a statement of your desire to return the insurance and refuse to use it. </li><li>  Attach a copy of your passport or other document that can verify your identity to the application.  You will also need the insurance agreement itself and the check for payment of the company's premium. </li><li>  Get your insurance premium back within 7 days. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.approvedfp.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to return insurance" class="if uuid-3138540" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/3138540.jpg"></div><p>  Employees of "Post Bank" will assure the impossibility of returning insurance, saying that its design is a condition of lending and more.  Believe them in this case is not worth it.  You must carefully read the insurance contract, study the points regarding the rules and terms of returning the premium (in some contracts it is indicated that if you want to return the insurance, it will not be returned).  After that, you can contact the bank to draw up an application, referring to the contract and legislation. </p><p>  The client of the bank should not sign the documents until the full study of all of their items.  If the contract has already been signed, do not wait - you must begin the process of returning your money as soon as possible. </p><p>  How to return the insurance of the loan in the "Post Bank" after 14 days? </p><h2>  Situations when insurance can be refused </h2><p>  The insurance company has the right to refuse to return the insurance premium for a Post Bank loan in the following cases: </p><ol><li>  Within 14 days from the start of the policy the insured event occurred. </li><li>  The person did not personally file an application with the company or the bank within 14 days. </li><li>  The insurance contract contains the relevant clause. </li><li>  The insurer does not fulfill its own obligations. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.kotak.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to return post bank credit insurance after 14 days" class="if uuid-3138548" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/3138548.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, it is theoretically quite easy to repay a loan insurance premium issued at Post Bank.  However, in practice, this is a rather time-consuming and time-consuming process.  It is important to complete and submit all documentation within a very short time, and then request a written response from the insurance company.  If all the conditions and rules for paperwork are not met, even the court will not help the bank's client in returning insurance. </p><h2>  Read contract </h2><p>  You should always carefully study the contract before signing it, and if some of its provisions remain unclear, consult your bank representative with them.  As practice shows, insurance in many cases is beneficial only for the bank itself. </p><p>  Many customers want to return loan insurance at Post Bank.  Reviews on this are presented below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="articles.bplans.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to return insurance postal bank loan after a year of loan repayment" class="if uuid-3138549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/3138549.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Customer reviews of Post Bank about attempts to return insurance are not very positive.
