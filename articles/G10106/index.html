But when the hotel is large, then there are many people in it ... But I want peace and quiet!  But also so that the animation is also present - especially for children.  I want beaches, and various - sandy, pebble, rocky.  And so that there was a large territory, but everything could be quickly reached.  And the pools?  After all, if the hotel is large, then in an artificial reservoir, as a rule, there are a lot of people, all the pleasure of swimming disappears.  And who would care about children?  After all, on vacation I really want to feel the romance of the first dates with my beloved again, wander around the edge of the surf, dine by candlelight in an a la carte restaurant.  But what if you are the parents of one, or even several fidgets?  It was for such cases that the Pak Land family vacation program was invented.  The Italian company RAS GROUP has provided all the little things and provided its customers with unforgettable vacation days in three seaside hotels of the country: on the islands of Sicily and Sardinia, as well as in the province of Tuscany.  In this article we will consider the first hotel.  It is called "Arenella Resort Pak Land <span>4 *" (Italy,</span> Syracuse).  The Ras Lend program is beneficial for the family budget.  By agreement with the company, hoteliers accept children under twelve years old absolutely free! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arenella Resort 4 (Sicily)" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1415308.jpg" width="600"></div>

For several years, the PAK Group has been announcing the campaign ‚ÄúFree Summer‚Äù.  From June 1 to September 1, all children under the age of twelve can relax in one of the three hotels listed above (in Sicily, Sardinia and Tuscany) for free.  But, besides this bonus, the Pak Land program also provides for others.  For example, you can come here completely with babies.  For kids there is a special kitchen where you can prepare mixtures for baby food, heat the bottle to the desired temperature, etc. Our tourist will no longer be surprised at the mini-clubs where you can record a child from four years old.  What about the nursery at the hotel?  "Arenella Resort PAK Land 4 *" provides such a service.  True, it is paid.  But older children - from three years old - are free to attend various mini-clubs.  There are three, according to age categories.  Russian-speaking animators are engaged with kids and teenagers.  And they do not just entertain children by painting their faces or organizing team games.  According to the reviews of tourists, animators conduct master classes, moreover, on such unexpected activities as directing, pottery, and the like. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arenella Resort Pak Land 4" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1415320.jpg" width="600"></div>

Russian tourists notice that on the <span>Apennine Peninsula</span> they have a special sympathy for kids, and to all - both to their own and to strangers.  Little guests are allowed a lot, they are pampered and cared for.  The same customs are in Sicily.  The Alpitur World Hotels chain of hotels, which also owns the Arenella Resort hotel, is guided by the motto ‚Äútrue Italian hospitality‚Äù (‚Äúfaith of the Italian Oscillation‚Äù, for short - VOI).  Arenella Resort 4 * has created conditions on its territory where every child will feel like visiting a loving grandmother who spoils a fidget and forgives him all kinds of pranks.  There is everything that children usually love: a huge park, along which a free train travels, lots of fun, four mini-clubs, a pool with shallow water, a sea with a smooth sunset and a sandy beach.  But ‚ÄúPak Land‚Äù also took care of the rest of the parents.  They also have an animation program, two restaurants, a spa, and bars.  This hotel complex was built in two thousand and five.  It is the largest hotel on the <span>island of Sicily.</span>  Its territory is about seventy hectares.  All of it is perfectly landscaped and equipped.  In the middle of the magnificent park stands a large building - for those who like to live in a party place.  Well, for those who prefer silence and solitude, the hotel offers several two-story villas.  If the distance in the hotel seems excessive, you can always use the train, which runs through the territory and carries vacationers to the beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel location and how to get there </h2><p>  Hotel Arenella Resort 4 * is located on the southern tip of the island of Sicily, on the second line from the sea.  He owes his vast territory to the fact that there are no settlements in the immediate vicinity.  The city of Syracuse lies ten kilometers away.  But the guests of Arenella Resort will not at all feel completely isolated.  Indeed, according to the schedule, a hotel bus runs to Syracuse (twice a day, the service is paid).  Before this city, which in ancient times was the main one in Sicily, it took ten minutes to go.  But to the nearest airport (it is located in Catania) the road will take almost an hour.  After all, the hotel and the air harbor of the southern part of the island are separated by seventy-six kilometers.  ‚ÄúPackage‚Äù tourists arriving at the Arenella Resort 4 * (Sicily) on a package tour do not need to rack their brains on how to get to the hotel - a transfer from the airport is provided for them.  For others, clarification is needed.  Buses depart from Catania Airport to Syracuse.  If you rent a car, you should take the motorway at number one hundred and fourteen.  Interbas and AST bus companies send their cars to Syracuse from the modern capital of the island of Palermo.  It is better to get from Messina to the city by train through Catania.  The train station in Syracuse is a ten minute walk from the historic city center. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arenella Resort 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1415309.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Room Categories </h2><p>  Despite the enormity of the territory, which stretches for four kilometers along the sea, the Arenella Resort 4 * hotel (Sicily) has only four hundred and sixty guest rooms.  For the convenience of vacationers, two receptions work.  The rooms are divided into categories.  The simplest is the classic or standard.

    <h2>  What can I eat here </h2><p>  Rest on the program Arenella Resort Pac Land 4 * (Italy, Syracuse) includes half board.  This means that guests can have breakfast and dinner buffet in the main restaurant.  In general, HB food (half board) provides for paid drinks during the evening meal.  But Arenella Resort makes an exception for its guests resting on the Pak Land program.  Mineral water, soft drinks and homemade table wine at dinner are also free.  You can order (or buy on the spot) <span>full board</span> or All Inclusive.  At the first option, meals are supplemented by lunch.  The reviews reveal to us the nuances of the All Inclusive program in Sicilian style.  This is the same full board, but with additional service in the bars from ten in the morning until midnight.  Moreover, alcohol is free only if it is Italian-made.  Also, "All Inclusive" does not give you the right to spend your entire vacation in a restaurant.  Breakfast at Arenella Resort Pak Land 4 * runs from half past seven to ten, lunch from half past one to two, and dinner from nineteen thirty to nine.  In the Aretusa restaurant, where the √† la carte service is required, a preliminary reservation is required.  Drinks are paid there.  There are bars in both receptions.  Refreshing drinks can also be freshened up by the pool and on the far beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Arenella Resort Pak Land 4 reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1415314.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What tourists say about food </h2><p>  Hotel Arenella Resort 4 * reviews describe as a place of excellent gastronomic relaxation.  The cooks in both restaurants are just magicians.  They often organize shows, demonstrating with you their skills in cooking pasta, lasagna, grill and a variety of Mediterranean dishes.  And once a week, an action called "Sicilian evening" takes place.  Then on the tables solemnly exhibited dishes that are traditional for the inhabitants of the island.  But even in ordinary meals, assure reviews, you can swallow your tongue.  Swordfish, dorado, several types of pasta, meat, vegetables, delicious Italian soups are always present at dinners.  Tourists sing odes to desserts - they are beyond praise.  Usually breakfasts in hotels are monotonous.  But the Arenella Resort 4 * hotel (Sicily) pampers its guests.  Tourists say that full meals were served for morning meals - you could eat and be full until the evening.  Mention reviews about the bar in the middle of a huge swimming pool.  Swim and order expertly mixed cocktails. </p><h2>  Beaches and Pools Hotels </h2><p>  Although Arenella Resort 4 * (Sicily) is called a second-line hotel, it has three private beaches.  Two of them are rocky, located in bays, which, incidentally, are located in the national park.  Wooden stones lined with sunbeds and umbrellas are lined with stones.  And in the sea you need to go down the ladder and pontoon.  Reviews strongly recommend entering the sea that way, since sea urchins are found on the coast.  Of course, you can‚Äôt buy this with a small child, and for those who can‚Äôt swim, these beaches are also not suitable.  But there is an alternative: a little further, five hundred meters from the hotel "Arenella Resort Pak Land Syracuse" 4 * there is a wonderful sandy coast with a gradual set to the depth.  There goes a free ‚Äútrain‚Äù.  This beach is more comfortable.  There is a bar, shower, toilet, lifeguards on duty.  But the water is cleaner on rocky beaches - reviews say, and there are fewer people there.  The hotel has a huge swimming pool.  For children there is a dedicated area with shallow water.  There is also an indoor heated pool.  It can be used when the sea is cold - this also happens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Arenella Resort 4" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1415325.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conditions for little guests </h2><p>  The program of rest in the hotel "Arenella Resort Pak Land" 4 * reviews are called a paradise for children.  You can come here even with newborns - the hotel has a kitchen with products for feeding babies.  A child up to two years of age can be recorded in a paid nursery "Mini Bimbo" (if you have a certificate of health and vaccinations).  For children who are already three years old, a club operates.  Three age groups work in Bimbo Village, which is free to visit: Baby for preschool children, Junior for boys and girls from seven to twelve, and Young for teenagers.  Especially a lot of praise for this latest mini-club.  If animators deal with younger children from ten in the morning, playing active games with them, and at half-past nine, after a disco, send them to sleep, then the teenage group gathers at 16.30.  Members of the Young Village club are engaged in dancing, sports, attend creative groups, including the Young Director and entertainment events.  Reviews say that teens are very willing to spend time with their animators. </p><h2>  Conditions and entertainment for adults </h2><p>  Do not count the bonuses that the Hotel Arenella Resort 4 * (Sicily) offers its guests.  Reviews in 2016 mention that the bus to the center of Syracuse became a free service.  Many tourists visited this ancient and beautiful city, which in the ancient world competed with Athens on its own.  From late May to September 29, you can purchase a club card at the hotel, which gives its holder a lot of advantages.  You can use tennis courts, billiards equipment, a shooting range and archery absolutely free.  Superior rooms are free to use the sauna, Turkish bath, mini-pool with jacuzzi, and they enjoy a discount on massage and beauty treatments.  In summer, for adults guests have their own animation.  The amphitheater hosts discos, music evenings, and shows.  Guests are entertained in the piano bar, and on the beach the guys from the animation team organize volleyball sports.  The hotel has seven meeting rooms and a business center with office equipment.  Parking at the hotel is free for guests.  This hotel accepts small pets. </p>
