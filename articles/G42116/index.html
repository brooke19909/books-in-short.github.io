The need to illuminate a dark space can arise both in the process of moving along the street at night, and when performing repairs in hard-to-reach corners.  There are also specialized modifications designed for mining workers, tourists, emergency workers, etc. In the technology market today you can find a rechargeable LED flashlight, which has many significant differences from traditional models. </p>

    <h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  Any flashlight is evaluated by two main parameters: the luminance range and brightness.  Often these characteristics are interconnected and flow from each other, but there are also special versions in which this connection does not work.  As for the first parameter, <span>powerful</span> rechargeable LED <span>flashlights</span> with a lens can provide a range of about 150-200 m. But even a lens does not always contribute to maintaining the width of light coverage.  To ensure long range, focusing of the beam is required when it is narrowed.  Accordingly, the beam will be "long-range", but modest in diameter.  Most often, models with a range of 50-120 m are used. In this case, even modest flashlights without a lens can provide a significant light spot in diameter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The situation with brightness, which is expressed in lumens (Lm), is ambiguous.  The initial segment represents 300-350 Lm models.  Such devices rarely provide a range of more than 100 m, and also do not differ in large spots of light.  Professional devices have LEDs of 900-1800 Lm.  This allows, at a minimum, to expand the coverage area, but in terms of range, the number of diodes used will play a significant role.  For example, a rechargeable LED flashlight with two glow elements is quite capable of delivering light at a distance of 150 m for small sizes, while its brightness will be no more than 350 Lm.  Is the exchange of high brightness for a second LED justified?  In cases where it is important to optimize energy supply, such a configuration is truly cost-effective. </p>

    <h2>  Battery Features </h2><p>  Traditional flashlights with 2-3 batteries are still found on the market, but battery models are increasingly replacing them.  Actually, two versions of batteries of this type are produced - the modern Li-Ion and the aging Ni-Cd.  The average voltage in both cases is 4-6 V. The volume, on which the duration of the device depends, is in the range of 1-4 A * h.  Depending on the operating indicators, the same brightness and the number of LEDs, the battery can maintain performance from several hours to a day in a continuous glow mode.  And here the battery itself is of considerable importance, which is equipped with a rechargeable LED flashlight in a specific design. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Nickel-cadmium blocks are characterized by resistance to temperature fluctuations, high speed of charge, but at the same time and short service life.  More in demand are lithium-ion cells, which, with their compact size, can have a large volume.  But they are more expensive.  By the way, you should not completely abandon battery models, if they are suitable for other characteristics.  They can be improved by replacing the power system - this operation is often subjected to professional rechargeable LED headlamps.  Upgrading at home will be reduced to removing the battery compartment and installing the battery holder.  The latter can be taken from the line of conventional mobile devices. </p><h2>  Protective qualities of LED flashlights </h2><p>  Even if we are not talking about specialized areas of application, flashlights can be subjected to various external factors - from high humidity to unforeseen mechanical shocks.  And yet, the most advanced in this regard are headlamp LED rechargeable flashlights designed for work in mines.  They are characterized by IP68 protection level, which means high resistance to physical damage.  There are also special versions for tourists.  In this case, emphasis can be placed on the properties of water resistance.  Modifications of this type, for example, can be immersed in water to a depth of about 1-2 m. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rechargeable led flashlights china" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47310/1755647.jpg" width="355"></div>

    <h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  In the budget version, you can find interesting offers from domestic manufacturers of lighting equipment.  Under the brands "Bright Beam" and "Svetozar" are presented inexpensive, but high-quality models for home use.  As for the special versions, modifications for construction and industry should be sought in the Camelion, Dewalt and Bosch families.  Noteworthy are the hybrid rechargeable LED Flashlights Police from Hangliang.  In particular, the HL-W110 modification is not only a flashlight, but also a baton.  This is a model characterized by a high-strength housing and a powerful stream of light.  Devices with combined functionality are also offered by JTC, Enkor and others. </p>

    <h2>  How much does a rechargeable LED flashlight cost? </h2><p>  The most affordable LED flashlights cost up to 500 rubles.  This is the simplest version of the home device without any special operational advantages.  The market also offers medium-sized models, available for 1-1.5 thousand. At the same time, much depends on the manufacturer, which produces rechargeable LED flashlights.  China is the most democratic in this respect - for example, multi-functional versions from TrustFire cost up to 1000 rubles, but at the same time demonstrate the same power as individual modifications from Bosch worth 2 thousand. </p><h2>  How to choose a flashlight? </h2><p>  In addition to the characteristics described above, one should not forget about the functionality, adjusting capabilities and additional equipment.  For domestic needs, a model with minimal settings will be enough.  But the professional sphere may require the device to have several modes of operation, high energy saving and auxiliary fasteners. </p>

    <p>  So, rechargeable LED flashlights with a lens for a powerful stream in a mine or under water conditions are usually supplemented with special clamps - wrist or the same head-mounted.  As for the adjusting capabilities, depending on the conditions of use, the user will be able to optimally adjust the range of the beam and the diameter of the spot. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The modern market for LED devices is steadily developing both in terms of optical filling and ergonomic properties.  A successful combination of several technical and operational parameters differ even budget LED flashlights.  China also contributes to the popularization of such products attractive and due to low prices.  Another thing is that quality in this case is inferior to European, and often domestic products.  Appearance and functionality come to the fore, but the durability of the battery cells and LEDs still leaves much to be desired. </p>
