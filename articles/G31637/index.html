  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most common cash transactions of commercial banks</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Bank is a credit institution, which is part of the <span>banking system of the Russian Federation.</span>  The most important area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity of credit organizations in the Russian Federation are cash operations of commercial banks.  They are carried out by crediting cash funds from citizens or organizations with transferring them to accounts, preserving the finances received and issuing them at the request of the client.  Particularly significant and important for a credit institution is the satisfaction of customer requirements in full.  By accepting <span>cash, the</span> bank increases its reserves, and due to this, operations of an active property are strengthened, thereby, the bank's profit is multiplied.  When dispensing cash to customers, banks charge a commission from it.  At the same time, they have the right to provide the client with additional services, for example, collection.  This is how the cash operations of commercial banks go short. </p><p>  Other types of operations of commercial banks are important.  Active and passive operations of a commercial bank of a special nature represent financial and exchange services.  This activity of the bank consists in the management of securities, in particular stocks, in matters of consulting, in <span>planning the budget</span> and tax periods.  The predominant operations in the considered activities of the credit organization are <span>trust operations,</span> which consist in the management of trust property and the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the fund.  The company enters into a so-called trust contract with a credit institution, according to which the bank takes control of the financial resources assigned to it in a reasonable manner and receive income for the owners.  In turn, the bank receives a fee for these services. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Despite the fact that <span>cash operations of</span> commercial banks are ubiquitous, nevertheless, all operations are generally classified.  In banking practice, the types of operations of credit organizations are represented by passive, active, intermediary operations.  When conducting passive operations, banks collect the funds necessary for their successful work.  It can be own finances or attracted.  Sources of banks' own finances can be long-term loans and proceeds from the sale of securities, deductions from current profits to <span>the reserve fund</span> .  The funds that were raised by the bank are generated through customer deposits in various types of savings accounts.  When attracting funds, the most important place is given to loans and bill counting.  Usually, banks own funds make up a small part of the funds.  For example, it can be noted that even with banks with a well-known name, own funds do not exceed 10 percent. </p><p>  Active operations are focused on the application of an organized cash fund so that profits are made.  They are divided into investment and credit.  Recent operations are aimed at individuals and legal entities, investment also have their customers. </p><p>  Despite the fact that cash operations of commercial banks play a role in the development of this organization, intermediary operations are interdependent credit, they gave rise to such a configuration of servicing by a credit organization as factoring, in addition, leasing became popular.  This activity is aimed at serving citizens and organizations.  So, factoring should be considered the resale of rights to collect debts, in addition, commercial operations, discussed by proxy from customers.  Leasing acts as a long-term lease or finance lease.  Bank operations with bills of exchange have the basic forms.  This is the accounting of a bill by a bank, in the case when the bank pays the bill holder a certain amount of financial resources.  The holder of this security can be both an individual and a legal entity.  In addition, the forms of bank operations with promissory notes include loans secured by this security, acceptance, aval of promissory notes and commission transactions with promissory notes. </p>
