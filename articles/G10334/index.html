Party leaders, ministers and officials, singers, artists, writers and other cultural figures came here with pleasure.  The Soviet Union was long gone, but the glory of the resort did not fade.  Already in our 21st century, the resort has been updated.  There were comfortable hotels and camp sites, motels and rest homes.  The entertainment industry has stepped far forward.  But against the background of the ultra-modern infrastructure of Gelendzhik, other wonderful places were not lost where you can relax and enjoy the beauties of the Caucasian nature.  This is the village of Kabardinka, the Old Park, which is divided here.

The location of the village is extremely convenient.  It seems that nature itself took care of this blessed corner.  What is Kabardinka famous for?  The old park, where thousands of tourists visit the excursions with pleasure for the season.  <span>Tsemess bay,</span> from where an amazing sea panorama opens.  In the valley of this bay, gently sloping down to the bay, the village spread out.  Cape Doob obscures the village from piercing winds and storm waves during bad weather.  The Markotkh Range hides it from the weather and the elements in the north-east.  Thanks to this, Kabardinka has an extremely comfortable microclimate.  The old park, by the way, is also preserved in its original form and does not become a victim of the weather precisely because of the geographic location of the village.  This is the driest place in the Gelendzhik area, with the most optimal ratio of rainfall and sunny days.  In general, mountains covered with forests, and the sea, warming up already by the end of spring and keeping warm until mid-autumn, allow you to open the holiday season in May and last almost to November.  During this time, Kabardinka itself, the Old Park and its other interesting places manage to receive a huge number of guests.  Most of them try to come here again next year.

Mostly families with children and people of middle and retirement age who prefer a quiet environment to the noise of large resorts.  The main thing Kabardinka is known for is the Old Park.  How to get there: from Gelendzhik or Novorossiysk (depending on where you are) you need to come to the village itself.  If you go for a walk privately, without a tourist group - do it early, before the arboretum is filled with sightseers, who abound here every day.  The streets, in fact, in the village there are only two.  The old park in the village of Kabardinka is located on the Black Sea.  Opens at 8 in the morning.  The facility closes at 10pm.  A few words about the cost of tickets (yes, admission is not free).  If you plan to get the whole family to the Old Park (Kabardinka), the prices are as follows: children - 150 rubles, adults - 350.

Let's learn more about its attractions.  The first miracle, perhaps, is that all its amazing corners are the work of one person, the local sculptor-enthusiast <span>Alexander Alekseev.</span>  This he invented and embodied in the objects of architecture on a small plot of land of the era of our human civilization.  Ancient Greek temples and Islamic mosques, the Orthodox church with golden domes and <span>the Cheops pyramid</span> with precisely reproduced frescoes and even the sphinx, medieval castles, romantic bridges and arbors in the spirit of classicism, mysterious grottoes, intricate fountains, sculptures in the style of Slavic paganism.  Even stones, such as those described in Russian folk tales, with philosophical inscriptions that make you think "about the eternal," are placed on "unknown paths."  Due to the overall color, not only this place has a special energy, but the whole Kabardinka.  The old park, the photo of which you see, is striking in its harmony and proportionality.  Wandering along its alleys, as if traveling in a time machine.  And not a single exhibit here is perceived as superfluous, each complements the rest.  It's not just beautiful here - it's amazing, wonderful, great!

Plants planted in the park are also of great interest.  These are southern exotics: banana and date palms, agaves, cypresses, plane trees and hornbeams, <span>mulberry trees,</span> citrus fruits, tulip trees, magnolias, laurels.  Deciduous breeds interspersed with evergreens.  Roses, rhododendrons, phlox, bamboo, mimosa and many other flowers fill the park with festive rainbow colors and delicate aroma.  Decorative flower beds are a real work of the sculptor's creative imagination.  The whole park is extremely clean and well maintained.  The order here is carefully monitored, trying to keep the attraction in perfect condition.

    <h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Coming out of the Old Park you get a rather strange impression.  You suddenly begin to understand that the West and the East may well get along peacefully, that Antica and modernity are not at all opposed to each other!  And that we are all together and each individually - links in the endless chain of humanity.  What art unites, and long-gone civilizations have not been completely erased from the face of the Earth by ruthless time.  Art is eternal, life is eternal, nature and Creativity are eternal.  Here's how much you can understand from one walk through the amazing Old Park ... </p>
