  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Polish houses: features, number of storeys and differences</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union, Polish houses are gaining more and more popularity.  They stand out for their elegant appearance, practicality and affordable price.  Such buildings can be of various configurations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Polish single-storey house projects" class="if uuid-2981980" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97994/2981980.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of houses in the Polish style </h2><p>  Classical Polish-style cottages are built from natural materials.  For roofs, which often have a complex shape, they use natural or artificial shingles.  Such structures have two- or four-gable roofs, there are also cottages with a flat roof.  The facade is finished with stone and wood.  Today they often use their imitation.  Feature is: </p><ul><li>  low floors 1-2 floors; </li><li>  small area, the classic version does not imply a garage; </li><li>  many windows providing good lighting and comfort. </li></ul><p>  In Polish houses, a spacious living room is central.  The kitchen is also allocated a large area, and the bedrooms are small, bright and comfortable. </p><p>  To design the basis of the facade, materials of the following colors are used: </p><ul><li>  Gray; </li><li>  white; </li><li>  brown; </li><li>  beige. </li></ul><p>  And an additional color for him is selected in the tone of the roof.  An important point of houses in the Polish style is a reasonable distribution of resources and comfort.  During the construction, European materials are used, which provide excellent thermal insulation, therefore a comfortable temperature is always maintained in such a room. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.designideas.pics" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="polish house photo" class="if uuid-2981982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97994/2981982.jpg"></div><h2>  The specifics of building houses </h2><p>  As can be seen in the photo, the Polish house has no more than 2 floors.  At the initial stage of construction, hollow blocks with a ceramic base and a standard framework technique are mainly used.  In cheap projects, they use cheap components, which, however, do not make the building worse.  In luxury homes, a beautiful tile with a long service life is used as a roof.  Typical houses for the Polish project meet the following requirements: </p><ul><li>  building plot should be at least 120 square meters.  m .; </li><li>  big windows; </li><li>  2- or 4-pitched roof; </li><li>  porch in harmony with the general view. </li></ul><h2>  One-story houses </h2><p>  Polish projects of one-story houses are designed for an average family.  Basically, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis house is 120-150 square meters.  m. A frame is used for construction, because of it the load on the foundation is insignificant.  A feature of national construction is a complex roof.  In houses with low cost the project does not provide: </p><ul><li>  balconies; </li><li>  ground floor; </li><li>  built-in garage. </li></ul><p>  Instead of the second floor - a bright comfortable attic.  Polish one-story houses are often decorated with wide terraces with a canopy and canopy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.jbsolis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Polish one-story houses" class="if uuid-2981981" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97994/2981981.jpg"></div><h2>  Two-story houses </h2><p>  The construction of two-story houses in the Polish style will require significant financial investments and will take quite a lot of time.  This project usually includes: </p><ul><li>  study; </li><li>  the smallest - 4 bedrooms; </li><li>  canteen; </li><li>  kitchen; </li><li>  living room; </li><li>  other premises (at the request of the owner). </li></ul><p>  The presence of an extension in the form of a garage to a large extent depends on the size of the site, but most tend to the fact that this is not necessary.  Two-story Polish houses have a basement.  There are relaxation rooms, it can be a billiard room, a gym.  There is also a wide porch with a terrace. </p><h2>  The difference between modern Polish buildings and traditional buildings </h2><p>  Previously, Polish houses were built of natural brick.  The roof and balconies had a rather complicated shape, for example, there was a dormer window, which from afar looked like a bull‚Äôs eye.  In modern cottages built according to the Polish project, these elements are not.  Often, materials that copy tiles are used to build the roof.  Plastic, which visually resembles stone or wood, is used for home decoration.  The front side is decorated to the color of the roof. </p><p>  In modern designs, there are no complex structures, including columns.  Today, such houses and cottages have a lot of layout options.  They comply with the most stringent fire safety requirements.  Such houses stand out for their simplicity, they do not have excess decorative elements.  All this is an additional advantage that increases their popularity.  Polish projects of 1 and 2-storey houses show a reasonable distribution of resources.  This is reflected in the construction and further operation.  They are aimed at the use of European materials with excellent thermal insulation properties.  Thanks to these characteristics, it will be possible to save on air conditioning and heating. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dezeen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="polish houses" class="if uuid-2981978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97994/2981978.jpg"></div><p>  The project can be carried out from those building materials that the client wishes.  In the world market, such houses are competitive, due to the peculiar design, high performance and free layout.  Currently, small houses in a laconic restrained style are most in demand, where all rooms are compactly located, and there is absolutely nothing superfluous.  And many people prefer this style today; it is gaining momentum. </p>
