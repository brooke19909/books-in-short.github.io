  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Choosing the best washing vacuum cleaner</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A decision was made to purchase a new vacuum cleaner.  It remains only to decide which model to give preference.  First you need to thoroughly study the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãinformation and process it in order to choose the really best <span>washing vacuum cleaner.</span>  It is not enough to know the technical characteristics of a household appliance, there are various nuances, including both its advantages and disadvantages. </p><p>  To choose the really best washing vacuum cleaner that is right for you, you need to know which meter will be cleaned, and on this basis, choose the appliance.  It should be noted that in order to use a washing vacuum cleaner for cleaning carpets on a natural jute basis, a necessary condition is their further drying in air and not otherwise.  In this case, you will not be disappointed in any case, moreover, the results will be unsurpassed.  To clean the parquet, it is pre-treated with special water-repellent impregnation.  The thing is that no matter what power you get, even the best washing vacuum cleaner, no matter how it draws in moisture - it's still not all.  And if you do not take into account the measures described above regarding natural carpets and parquet boards, after some time, after cleaning, you will not be able to enter your home because of an unpleasant smell.  As for the rest of the flooring, the use of this household appliance is the best choice.  It is also worth noting that a washing vacuum cleaner for a laminate is ideally suited when a high-quality floor material is selected, otherwise it is enough to process it, like parquet. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A washing vacuum cleaner, in contrast to a conventional one, is much better at cleaning.  The fact is that the principle of operation is quite simple, but that through a special hose that is included in the kit, water is supplied with detergent, which washes away the dissolved dirt and dust, after which it is drawn into the reservoir for the spent liquid.  Thus, the dust does not scatter in different directions, as when cleaning with an ordinary vacuum cleaner, the most hygienic cleaning of the room is ensured.  In addition, more expensive models have multi-stage cleaning (up to 4 steps), with an additional function of air deodorization. </p><p>  So, before choosing the best washing vacuum cleaner, special attention should be paid not to the power consumption of the vacuum cleaner itself (varies from 1400 - 1600W), but, very importantly, the retraction power, which happens even with expensive models up to 1000W, while budget ones models to achieve more or less normal cleaning - 400W.  The quality of cleaning with the minimum time for further drying of the treated surface depends on this indicator.  Do not forget that to use the device you will need a special shampoo for washing vacuum cleaners. </p><p>  When choosing, pay attention to the configuration of the washing vacuum cleaner.  Well, if it includes vacuum nozzles with automatic control of the supply of the washing solution, in which case the carpets do not have time to be saturated with excess moisture, the brush thoroughly cleans each villi, washing away all the accumulated dirt. <br>  The volume of the tank of the chosen model directly depends on the size of the cleaned area.  The best option for an apartment of 3 rooms is a washing vacuum cleaner with a tank of 4 to 5 liters, for 1-2 rooms - 2 to 4 liters is enough, and only if the house is large, you can choose a tank volume of 8 to 10 liters. </p><p>  Well, the last thing you need to know when buying a vacuum cleaner is that after using this household appliance, which will undoubtedly become a reliable multi-functional cleaning assistant, he needs special maintenance.  After each use, it is necessary to thoroughly rinse the tanks, which takes, depending on the model, from 10 to 20 minutes of time, with its subsequent disassembly and drying. </p><p>  As for the choice of brand: Karcher has a narrow focus with specialization in cleaning equipment, THOMAS and VAX are exclusively engaged in the production of vacuum cleaners, and such well-known companies as Electrolux, LG, Miele, Samsung make various home appliances, from which its quality does not suffer at all , but, on the contrary, has high competitiveness.  There really is plenty to choose from. </p>
