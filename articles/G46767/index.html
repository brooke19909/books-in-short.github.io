It is located on the banks of the Seine, where it developed as an imperial capital.  The right bank was a shopping center, where already in 1183 the indoor market Les Halless appeared.  And on the left bank many church schools, monasteries, colleges were built. </p><p>  In 1163, <span>Notre Dame Cathedral</span> was built <span>.</span>  Later, during the reign of Philip of the Second Augustus, the construction of the Louvre began.  And his very devout grandson Louis (Louis the Ninth Saint) built the magnificent church of Saint-Chapelle and Saint-Denis. </p>

    <p>  Paris was a state and religious center, and by the 14th century it had become the largest European city in which nearly two hundred thousand people lived. </p><h2>  Relics </h2><p><strong> </strong>  Thanks <span>to St. Louis,</span> Paris became considered the second capital of Christianity.  It was he who, from the seventh and eighth <span>Crusades,</span> brought to France values ​​that are very significant for Christians, which have long been stored in Constantinople: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  part of the cross of the Lord; </li><li>  Savior's crown of thorns; </li><li>  Longin's spear. </li></ul><p>  Louis built Saint-Chapelle specifically for the storage of these relics.  The desire to possess these shrines was so great that Louis laid out a fabulous sum for that time - 135 thousand livres. </p><h2>  Chapel Saint Chapelle </h2><p>  The majestic architectural monument of the Middle Ages is located in the center of Paris on the <span>island of Cité,</span> adjacent to the Palais de Justice and the Conciergerie prison (where Marie Antoinette was once held before execution).  This cathedral is truly a masterpiece of the architectural structure of the mature Gothic period. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the Holy Chapel played an important role in enhancing the authority of the king, as it contained a large number of different values ​​and holy relics.  The Chapel of Saint-Chapelle has long been considered the main relic chapel until the revolution, during which it was badly damaged in the fire. </p>

    <p>  The Catholics, trying to save the holy relics from the atrocities of the revolutionaries, hid them in different places.  The crown of the Savior was even cut into three parts. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And only in 1806 the shrines were collected in one place, but they were already placed in the treasury of the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris, where they are stored today. </p><p>  The building itself was successfully reconstructed in the 19th century.  The restoration was worked by Jean-Baptiste Lassius, Viollet de Luc and Felix Duban.  The roof, spire, <span>external staircase,</span> stained-glass windows were repaired and interior decoration was done. </p><h2>  Construction </h2><p>  The construction of Saint-Chapelle in Paris was carried out on the site of the former Royal Palace and was completed as soon as possible for the Middle Ages.  The process was led by Pierre de Montreux.  During the construction of the chapel, technologies unique at that time were used, namely metal structures (they began to be actively used in construction only after six centuries).  The fittings that permeate the entire space of the church, the architect managed to very skillfully weave stained-glass windows into the fittings. </p>

    <p>  Thanks to this technique, a feeling of lightness and infinity of the upper part of the building was achieved.  Outside, a powerful foundation and heavy buttresses go as if in opposition to this lightness.  The material for the construction was a very strong light sandstone. </p><p>  Despite its small size (length - 35 meters, width - 17 meters and height - 43 meters), Saint-Chapelle impresses with its sophistication and grace. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The cathedral consists of two chapels, the upper and lower, which are interconnected by a spiral staircase.  The spire is crowned with the figure of the archangel Michael, and on the roof there are sisters of the chimeras of the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris. </p><h2>  Lower chapel </h2><p>  The lower chapel serves as a kind of foundation.  On its low arches (6.6 meters), which are supported by massive columns, it holds the weight of the entire building.  Initially, the lower chapel of Saint-Chapelle was intended for the worship of court ranks. </p><p>  The lower chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary is consecrated.  At the entrance to the building visitors are greeted by her statue.  Most of the drawings and sculptural decoration in the temple were restored in the 19th century.  But there are also unique things, for example, a 13th-century fresco that illustrates the Annunciation and is the oldest mural in Paris.  Also here you can see the coat of arms of Queen Blanca of Castile (mother of Louis the Ninth), 12 bas-reliefs with images of the apostles. </p><h2>  Upper chapel </h2><p>  Compared to the modest interior of the lower chapel, the upper one is striking in its splendor and luxury.  For a long time, entrance to this part of the building was possible only through the gallery, which adjoined the king’s chambers.  It was here that a silver cancer with gilded copper was exhibited, in which the holy relics were kept: </p><ul><li>  The crown of the Savior; </li><li>  part of the cross; </li><li>  a cover from the head of St. John; </li><li>  Virgin's milk; </li><li>  the icon "Savior Not Made by Hands" and other values. </li></ul><p>  All this was acquired by Louis the Ninth in 1239.  That was until the revolution, during which the Great Cancer was destroyed. </p><p>  Only the king and members of the royal family could visit the upper chapel.  Sanctified the upper chapel of St. Chapelle in honor of Jesus Christ.  Here, as in the lower part, most of the masterpieces restored in the 19th century.  But there are miraculous survivors.  The original are statues of the five apostles.  Among them is the statue of St. Peter, who holds the keys to paradise in his hands. </p><p>  Ornaments in the form of leaves that adorn the capitals of the side walls are never repeated.  The cathedral was decorated with many images of the royal flower - lilies.  The angels depicted in the ornaments recreate scenes of 42 torment.  The ceiling of the chapel is strewn with golden stars. </p><h2>  Windows of Light </h2><p>  But nevertheless, stained-glass windows brought world fame to the Cathedral of Saint-Chapelle.  The upper chapel, whose height is more than 20 meters, has no walls - all of them are replaced by huge window openings.  These windows are filled with medieval stained glass windows, with a total area of ​​600 meters.  Most of them are excellent reproductions, but there are also originals. </p>

    <p>  Fifteen stained glass windows depict 1113 biblical scenes.  Fourteen stained-glass windows are “read” from left to right, looking at them, you can learn the whole history of the world from birth to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.  The stained glass window “The History of Relics of the Passion of Christ” is the only one that is read “along the serpentine”, from bottom to left, and then from right to left.  It describes the scene of the relics of St. Helena in Jerusalem and their arrival in France. </p>

    <p>  It is best to visit Saint-Chapelle in sunny weather, then these stained-glass windows give an extraordinary light, while there is a feeling of touching something very great. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If you want to admire this masterpiece of French high Gothic, you first need to buy a ticket Moscow-Paris.  And already on the spot there are many options to visit Saint-Chapelle. </p><p>  Traveling in Paris by car, you need to go along the Seine to the Boulevard du Palais, turn onto it and you will be at the target.  Or you can get there by bus - there are many routes that will take you to the cathedral.  If you move around the city by metro, you need to get off at Cite station. </p><p>  A visit to the cathedral will cost eight euros, with young people from 18 to 25 years old - six euros, and children under 18 years can go on a guided tour for free.  Or you can buy a Museum Card, which costs from 39 to 69 euros, depending on the validity period.

Basically, these, of course, are words of admiration and delight.  This small but stately building evokes some special feelings and emotions. </p><p>  The only thing that does not work out is to enjoy the beauty alone, and most likely you will have to stand in line in front of the entrance, as there are always a lot of visitors there.
