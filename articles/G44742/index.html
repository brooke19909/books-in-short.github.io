However, they quickly fade or need care.  But there is a great alternative - artificial flowers, which you can make from improvised materials.  For example, very original and original crafts are obtained from ordinary foil. </p><h2>  Materials </h2><p>  The base material you need to make the flower is foil.  In the store you can find decorative paper of different weights, but thinner is best for fine jewelry.  Also, to create a flower from a foil with your own hands, you will need silver or simple scotch tape, scissors and a stick or tube for the rod. </p><h2>  Create blanks </h2><p>  The existing foil needs to be cut into strips of 3 cm wide. It is not necessary to make them perfectly even, but it is advisable to produce blanks carefully so as not to tear the foil. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Roll of foil" class="if uuid-3101908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3101908.jpg"></div><p>  In total, you will need 27 parts per flower, which will consist of three petals made of 9 strips, as well as 3-4 extra for stamens. </p><p>  Next, from the blanks you need to make thin wires.  To do this, gently crush each strip, and then twist it into a tube. </p><p>  It's okay if the wire breaks during the folding process.  The pieces of the workpiece can easily be joined together without the use of glue.  Just lay the torn ends on top of each other and twist them tightly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Foil Flowers: Workshop </h2><p>  Having prepared the necessary details, you can begin to manufacture the flower itself.  First, we form a ‚Äúnose‚Äù in the center of one of the strips, and bend the remaining 8 wires in half.  Then on both sides of the "nose" we put on four bent parts. </p><p>  From above, press the strung wires to the main element with the ‚Äúnose‚Äù, and then collect them together from below.  Wrap the resulting bundle with the edges of the main wire.  Thus, you will get the first petal.  According to the same scheme, two more of the same elements must be made.  From the remaining parts we twist the stamens, forming small balls on the tips. </p><p>  We assemble the finished petals and stamens together and attach to the stem using adhesive tape.  The base itself also needs to be wrapped, and a do-it-yourself foil flower will be ready.  You need to create several of these and collect them in an original bouquet.  Also, using the same technique and showing a little imagination, you can weave other types of flowers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="saranyajo.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Foil Crafts: Flowers" class="if uuid-3101863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3101863.jpg"></div><h2>  Foil lily </h2><p>  To create such a <span>flower from foil with your own hands,</span> you need to cut 30 strips and twist them into tubes.  You will also need a sheet of base material 20 cm wide for the stem. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Do-it-yourself foil flower making in stages: </p><ol><li>  Take one of the blanks as the basis and alternately wind four more wires on it. </li><li>  The edges of the main so-called thread also bend down. </li><li>  Make 4 more petals in the same way. </li><li>  We collect the lower ends of the elements together, and the product itself is beautifully straightened. </li><li>  From two wires we make the leaves of the flower according to the same method as the petals. </li><li>  We take one more blank, fold it in half and round off the edges.  Thus, you get a stamen for a flower crafts made of foil. </li><li>  Now you need to make a stalk.  To do this, crush a wide blank and twist, making a small hook at the end. </li><li>  We cling to the stamen and fix it. </li><li>  Around the stamens and stalk we collect the finished petals.  On top we wind up another wire to better fix the flower on the base. </li><li>  We also attach leaves to the stem, fixing them with an additional wire.  On top of it you can additionally wrap with foil. </li></ol><p>  You can make some more of these colors of foil with your own hands to get a beautiful composition, and put them in a vase. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kiflieslevendula.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Foil roses" class="if uuid-3101725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3101725.jpg"></div><h2>  Plain Foil Rose </h2><p>  If you want to make a flower of foil in a very simple way, then you only need silver paper, a ruler and wire. </p><p>  First, we tear off a strip of width 50 cm from the foil roll. Then we put it with the shiny side down and bend its lower part to the middle.  On the side we also make a small bend of 1-1.5 cm. On the other hand, we begin to fold the workpiece into a tube until the middle of the strip. </p><p>  Roll the resulting part in a spiral, forming a flower bud.  Squeeze the remaining part from below and twist into a stalk. </p><p>  Make as many simple foil colors as you want, and then assemble them together and tie them up with wire. </p><p>  To make the bouquet even more beautiful, you can apply paint to it or supplement it with dried flowers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="igottacreate.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY foil flower" class="if uuid-3101784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3101784.jpg"></div><h2>  <span>How to make a foil flower in</span> another way </h2><p>  You will need to cut circles of 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5 cm in diameter from the foil. In total, 4-5 parts of each size are needed.  Also, to make this flower from foil with your own hands, you will need a glue gun and a large clip. </p><p>  From the smallest circle, roll up a tight tube to create a core.  Then twist 3-4 more loose cones, performing the central rosebud. </p><p>  After you make the center of the flower tight, use medium-sized circles to create the next row of leaves.  Use a heat gun to secure them at the base of the rose. </p><div class="photo" data-original="igottacreate.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rose petals" class="if uuid-3101781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3101781.jpg"></div><p>  Use the largest details to create the outer petals.  But instead of twisting into a cone, collect the bottom of the circle into a small accordion, and then glue the petals to the bud. </p><p>  By opening a large paper clip and inserting it into the base of the rose, you can place it vertically and decorate your table with such a flower. </p><h2>  Foil daisy </h2><p>  For work, you need to take a piece of foil measuring 15x15 cm. Foil is folded in half to get a fold line.  Tear it along this mark.  You will get two rectangles, one of which set aside for now. </p><p>  Place the other part on the surface with the shiny side down and bend one of its sides to the center.  Then bend the opposite part to the middle so that the edges touch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.abovetopsecret.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flower details" class="if uuid-3101762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60571/3101762.jpg"></div><p>  Fold the entire workpiece in half.  Repeat this step 3 more times. </p><p>  Fold the resulting strip in half again, but this time in width.  Set the part aside and start making petals and leaves.  To do this, take the previously left rectangle, fold it in half and tear along the fold line.  Then repeat this action with the two resulting parts.  As a result, you should get 4 identical rectangles. </p><p>  Take one of these elements and bend both of its edges to the center.  Then connect the corners, as when folding the airplane.  After that, fold the part in half to form a trapezoid-shaped workpiece.  Perform the 3 remaining parts in the same way. </p><p>  Take these pieces and put them together.  Then insert them into the workpiece you made earlier.  After that, start twisting it, fixing the trapezium at the top.  Reaching about the middle, insert the rest into the main workpiece and finish rotating the stem. </p><p>  To give the foil flower created by your own hands the desired shape and aesthetic appearance, spread the petals and leaves of the craft.  Also, if desired, you can slightly bend the edges of the parts. </p>
