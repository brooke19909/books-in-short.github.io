  <section class="page js-page"><h1>UN creation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For over 65 years, the UN has been the most representative international organization that addresses the key issues of world politics and ensures universal security. </p><p>  The creation of the UN became possible after the victory of the <span>Anti-Hitler coalition</span> over Germany and its allies in World War II. </p><p>  The first step towards the creation of an <span>international organization,</span> which was assigned the functions of resolving conflicts between countries in order to prevent the emergence of new wars in the future, was the signing of the Agreement between the USSR and Great Britain (07/12/1941).  After that, similar agreements were concluded with Czechoslovakia and Poland. </p><p>  Although the year the UN was founded in 1945, the process of preparing for this event began much earlier.  Back in August-September 1941, a document was created that united the interests of three powers - the Soviet Union, the United States and Great Britain.  He became the ideological foundation of the new anti-fascist coalition.  The signed <span>Atlantic Charter was</span> based on the general principles that the country should adhere to during the war: no territorial increments, all changes to the borders of countries only with the consent of the peoples living on them. </p><p>  On January 1, 1942, Roosevelt, Churchill, USSR Ambassador Litvinov, and Chinese Foreign Minister Song Zi-wen signed the United Nations Declaration.  This document was a logical continuation of the earlier adopted Atlantic Charter. </p><p>  After the victories at Stalingrad and on the Kursk Bulge, issues of post-war settlement came to the fore.  Victories significantly strengthened the authority of the USSR on the world stage.  Moscow seized the initiative on the diplomatic front.  The creation of the UN was initiated precisely by the Union, which understood the need to create an organization that could maintain security and peace. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The question of creating such an organization was raised at the Moscow Conference (October 1943).  At that time, a document was signed regarding global security.  The ‚ÄúDeclaration of Four States‚Äù was drawn up on the basis of mutual agreement of the participating countries to build their relations on the <span>principle of a democratic</span> union. </p><p>  The date of the creation of the UN, however, was still not short.  Although States recognized the need to establish an organization as soon as possible, it took several more years to make a final decision. </p><p>  The Soviet side proposed the creation of a commission of representatives of the three powers to develop questions regarding the approval of a new representative organization.  The decisions taken at the Moscow Conference were reaffirmed at the meeting of Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran. </p><p>  By 1944, the outcome of the war was already obvious.  Work to solve the problems associated with the creation of an international organization has intensified significantly.  The US government has proposed a conference in Washington.  The countries of the "Big Three" exchanged memoranda with their proposals on the main positions.  On August 21, the opening of the conference took place. </p><p>  The creation of the UN has become a matter of time.  Countries have developed the following principles for the work of the International Organization: 1. sovereign equality of all states;  2. rejection of the threat by force when solving problems;  3. fulfillment of obligations;  4. refusal to provide assistance to countries against which actions of a compulsory or preventive nature have been taken;  feasible assistance to the Organization by all states ;.  6. ensuring the actions of other states in accordance with the principles of the Organization. </p><p>  The main <span>UN bodies</span> were the General Assembly, the <span>International Court of Justice,</span> the Security Council and the Secretariat. </p><p>  The final creation of the UN will take place in 1945, when the UN Charter was signed at a conference in San Francisco (June 26). </p>
