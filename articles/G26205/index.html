Regardless of what exactly led to the ‚Äúbreakdown,‚Äù the user should know that the further scenario will require, if not repair in the service, then precisely rollback the system and a number of other manipulations.  Unfortunately, the more ‚Äúkilled‚Äù the model of the smartphone, the less likely it is that the failure to activate the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù can be fixed.  It is important not only to conduct an external inspection of the phone, but also to restore the picture preceding the breakdown.  This will help to understand why the failure of activation of the "iPhone" in general took place, as well as how to behave further.  It is likely that it will be necessary not only to roll back (return the previous version) the changes made to the smartphone, but also to clean the device itself.  However, it is fair to say that there are still chances for a smartphone recovery. </p><h2>  Why do I need activation </h2><p>  Before thinking about what to do when iPhone activation fails, some angry users will reproach for the imperfection of the device of developers from Apple Inc.  Many adherents of the "apple" more than once seriously criticized the activation procedure as ineffective and problematic. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone activation failure" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57634/2145390.jpg"></div>  In fact, the process of activating a smartphone helps to individualize it and specify it according to the needs of the owner.  Skipping such a process is not recommended, since in the future it can lead to data loss or to disrupt the synchronization process.  Therefore, the corporation strongly recommends that users go through the activation process each time the device requires it.

The first is the hardware of both the device itself and the Apple servers. </p>

This happened when updating iOS 9.3, when the company's servers crashed due to the simultaneous launch of the download process from several million devices.  This problem can be solved by a banal reboot in the least peak periods.  I would like to add that Apple technical support quickly eliminates problems with the platform load.

    <h2>  Modem malfunction </h2><p>  If the problem is hardware in nature, but the Apple server is in order, then the matter is in the device.  If iPhone writes about an operation failure, but another device is updated without problems, then it is most likely a matter of processing the data of a specific device.  Checking this is quite simple, just select the item with the letter ‚Äúi‚Äù circled in a circle, after which it will become clear whether the device is capable of receiving data.  This item also shows the <span>serial number of the</span> device.  If this is not the case, then it‚Äôs almost 100% in the smartphone‚Äôs modem. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to fix it </h2><p>  A hardware failure in the activation of iPhone can be eliminated either in a licensed service center for a rather tangible amount, or with artisanal technologies. </p>

The more expensive the device is, the more appropriate it is to transfer it to a service center, rather than trying to solve the problem yourself.

    <p>  Also, the cause of iPhone activation failure may be a short circuit in the contacts of the board where the modem is located.  In some cases, a sharp change in temperature can help, when the smartphone is suddenly cooled or heated up.  However, to carry out such manipulations is at your own peril and risk. </p><h2>  Software crash </h2><p>  In the case of a software failure, we are talking about installing suspicious software or the shell as a whole.  In this case, you can save the entire smartphone, as well as fragments of the system and user data, by rolling back all changes in the gadget to the previous version. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone network activation failure" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57634/2145388.jpg"></div>  Therefore, it is recommended to perform these functions not only at the request of the software, but also independently.  Systems can also be rolled back in a regular service, after which there is a high chance of resuscitation of the device.  Otherwise, the gadget will also have to be given to the official service, in which the system will simply be demolished and re-installed, which will also be expensive.  Moreover, the owner will have to say goodbye to their files.

    <h2>  Several other causes of iPhone activation failure </h2><p>  The iPhone activation process itself can be terminated for several other reasons independent of the software.  Before going to the service center, it is worthwhile to conduct a few simple manipulations with the device: check the presence of a SIM card in the slot, rearrange it, and then try to activate the device in a new way.  It is also recommended to change the Internet channel.  It is possible that the next device update is too "heavy" or the data packet channel is occupied by another gadget.  Another option is to activate the device through iTunes.  If this does not help, then the service will offer to perform data recovery, after which the device will automatically return to its previous state. </p>

    <h2>  If the device is not registered </h2><p>  The failure to activate iPhone on the network when the gadget and Apple servers are working properly can also be dictated by the fact that a beta version of the firmware was installed on the smartphone.  In this case, with the release of the already full version with corrections, a certain number of devices may ‚Äúfall out‚Äù of the register.  In this case, you can fix the activation failure of "iPhone" by going to the developers website, where the gadget will have to be manually entered into the database by entering information.  If this does not help, then you need to contact the official service center, after which the device will be working properly.  If "iPhone" writes activation failure, then this is always an occasion to contact a service center. </p><p>  Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to say for sure why the iPhone activation failed.  Some factors leading to error may be related.  The owner can only be advised to conduct a full external inspection of the device, after which not to resort to the artisanal methods of restoring the gadget, but immediately turn to professionals.  Almost any precedent for activation failure can be fixed, except for a modem breakdown.  Much more destructive are the attempts of users to independently solve the problem, after which the gadget can no longer be repaired. </p>
