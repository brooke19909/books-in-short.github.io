At the disposal of scientists were new ice drifts.  Scientific expeditions were funded by the state.  It bore fruit. </p><p>  Although it could not do without funny situations.  One of the most difficult cases was the drift of the ship, which in the cinema was called "Mikhail Gromov."  The icebreaker stuck in the ice of Antarctica in 1985, having stood so for 133 days.  What was the ship really called?  And what is known about those complex and heroic events? </p><h2>  Ship prototype </h2>

    <p>  ‚ÄúMikhail Gromov‚Äù is an icebreaker that has become the main venue for the events of the 2016 film.  Its prototype is called "Mikhail Somov."  The real ice drift was laid in 1974 by the Kherson Shipyard, and a year later it was launched. </p><p>  It was used in swimming in the northern latitudes, was able to break through the thickness of the ice up to seventy centimeters.  The ship got its name in honor of the Soviet <span>Arctic explorer,</span> who died two years before the launch of Mikhail Somov. </p><p>  The icebreaker participated in <span>twenty-one Soviet and Russian Antarctic expeditions.</span>  Specialists were able to study the hydrometeorological regime of the Southern Ocean, landing on the shores of the Antarctic.  The ship was also used to deliver the necessary equipment and supplies to researchers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Three drifts </h2>

    <p>  The ship‚Äôs birthday is considered 07/08/1975, when the flag of the USSR was hoisted on it.  Over the years of operation, ‚ÄúMikhail Gromov‚Äù (the icebreaker in the picture of 2016) survived three drifts with the crew. </p><p>  This first happened in 1977.  The icebreaker was supposed to deliver the cargo to the Leningradskaya Antarctic station.  The ship was thirty miles from its destination when the situation worsened.  He was swept west for fifty-six miles.  Piles of ice debris did not allow the vessel to move.  The drift lasted fifty-three days, from February to March 1977. </p><p>  The second drift formed the basis of the above film.  It happened in 1985. </p><p>  The icebreaker drifted for the third time in 1991.  The ship was heading to the Molodezhnaya station to evacuate about one hundred and fifty polar explorers.  When people were brought aboard, Mikhail Somov suddenly found himself caught in ice and could not get out.  People had to be transported by helicopters.  In the conditions of the polar night, it was a difficult task.  The ship drifted from August to December 1991. </p><h2>  133 days in ice captivity </h2>

The ship carried out the next voyage to Antarctica to the Russkaya station.  It was located near the Ross Sea. </p><p>  This area has always been famous for its heavy ice massif.  The icebreaker‚Äôs flight was delayed, so he approached the station at the beginning of the Antarctic winter.  The ship needed to complete the wintering shift, to unload fuel and food.  Due to the increase in wind, the ship was blocked by heavy ice.  He was stuck in the Ross Sea. </p><p>  To analyze the situation, satellites and ice reconnaissance were involved.  Only Pavel Korchagin was in relative proximity to the icebreaker, but he could not come.  It was decided to evacuate the crew by helicopter.  Seventy-seven people were taken to the Pavel Korchagin.  Fifty-three crew members decided to stay.  They were led by captain Valentin Rodchenko. </p><p>  In May, the ship almost got out of captivity, but the reinforced winds began to blow ice along with the ship to the south.  In June, it was decided to save the icebreaker with the help of Vladivostok.  The captain of the rescue expedition was appointed Gennady Anokhin. </p><h2>  Salvation story </h2><p>  While Vladivostok was reaching its destination, the crew of the prototype icebreaker Mikhail Gromov, whose history cannot but attract attention, saved fuel and food.  Laundry and bath arranged only twice a month.  Crew members freed the steering wheel from the ice from the ice, sorted out the engines.  By the time help came, everything was supposed to work perfectly. </p><p>  In July, a helicopter landed next to a drifting ship.  He delivered doctors and essentials.  At this time, only two hundred kilometers from Mikhail Somov, Vladivostok stuck in the ice. </p><p>  Fortunately, the rescue ship was released on ice the next morning.  The events of July 26, 1985 were monitored by the entire Soviet Union.  Finally, a message came to Moscow that Vladivostok had reached the drifting icebreaker.  The conclusion of the latter from the zone of heavy ice began. </p><p>  Vessels were able to reach the open ocean by August 1985.  Soon they were off the coast of New Zealand.  Having rested for four days in Wellington, they each set off on their own course ‚Äî to Vladivostok and Leningrad. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the sports commentator <span>Viktor Gusev,</span> known to everyone today, took part in the rescue expedition <span>.</span>  He willingly shares memories of those events.  It was after them that the leadership of TASS agreed to transfer Gusev to a sports editorial office.  He has been asking for this for a long time. </p><p>  Such is the real story of the icebreaker Mikhail Gromov in 1985, more precisely, its prototype.  Despite the fact that he drifted three times, the greatest publicity was the case that occurred in the mid-eighties of the twentieth century. </p><h2>  Based on real events </h2>

    <p>  The film about the icebreaker Mikhail Gromov was created by <span>Nikolai Khomeriki</span> in 2016.  The director relied on historical facts, as well as on the stories of participants in those events. </p><p>  Some points were exaggerated, others missed.  Do not forget that the film cannot completely repeat the real story.  The director was able to create a realistic exciting plot.  Which ship was used to show the icebreaker Mikhail Gromov (1985 story)? </p><p>  When creating the picture, an atomic ice drift called ‚ÄúLenin‚Äù was used.  It is located in Murmansk in an eternal parking lot.  By design, it vaguely resembles a ship drifted one hundred thirty-three days.  Filming took place in difficult weather conditions for three months. </p><h2>  Current state </h2>

    <p>  The icebreaker was able to survive not only three drifts, but also the collapse of the Soviet Union.  It is still in service and is used to deliver fuel and supplies to the Arctic.  This indicates that Soviet engineers could make machines that regularly operate in the most difficult weather conditions for many decades. </p><p>  The courage and courage of Russian scientists always amaze ordinary people.  The crew did not leave the drifting ship.  People have proven that coherence and determination can work wonders.  They managed to rescue the ship from ice captivity and deliver it safe and sound to the port. </p>
