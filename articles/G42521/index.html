    <h2>  Map location </h2><p>  The spit is located in the Petrograd district of the city.  It runs from the main square to the yacht club.  For some time, the Petrovskaya Spit was included in the avenue passing nearby.  Since 1940, for unknown reasons, she was expelled from there.  Driving in the city is often associated with the attractions that are next to it.  For example, many have heard about the charming Nobel house, the western (guest) harbor, St. Petersburg yachting community.  In addition, not far from the spit is the shipbuilding company Almaz and the shipyard NP Project Standart. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Night clubs </h2><p>  Quite often, tourists, and locals visit clubs.  Petrovskaya Spit is an ideal place for entertainment.  Among the most popular nightlife establishments, the Cote d'Azur and SYDNEY Beach Club stand out.  Also, those who wish to have fun may be interested in the clubs “Air”, “Savage” and “ArcticA”. </p><p>  SYDNEY Beach Club is considered one of the best and most popular.  It is located on the beach and works mainly in the summer.  The unique restaurant offers its visitors to enjoy excellent sound and lighting equipment, try the best dishes from the restaurant chef and feel a surge of energy and joy from a party in the fresh air.  And although at first glance it is an ordinary tent, but it is equipped so well that it can compete with the best institutions of the city.  In addition, you can visit other clubs.  Petrovskaya Spit offers a glimpse into the equally popular "Cote d'Azur", which is located on the territory of the Central Yacht Institution.  It also works in the summer and is noticeably transformed on Fridays and Saturdays.  The Cote d'Azur will allow guests to relax and have fun, leaving only positive emotions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="clubs petrovskaya spit" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/465897.jpg" width="590"></div>

So, more recently, it was decided to build a green area, taking as an example the “New Greenland”.  It is intended primarily for outdoor sports.  In addition, the platform (Petrovskaya Spit) will be available for families and friends: you can sunbathe on the sunbeds, play mini-golf, look at the movie screen at night and, of course, attend parties.  This is the main feature of the fabulous place. </p><p>  The organizers claim that guests can also play basketball, table tennis, attend yoga classes and relax in hammocks.  The project "Site" (Petrovskaya Spit) was launched in June and will work all summer.  A stage has been built on its territory that will allow you to enjoy a night movie screening or a concert, and the audience, by the way, will be able to watch the event, sitting comfortably on sunbeds with soft pillows.  The townspeople liked a wonderful project, so they plan to return to it every summer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Petrovskaya Spit" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/465901.jpg" width="600"></div>
