Not by mileage, of course.  Just in 2015, the tourist tax from foreigners was canceled both at the entrance and at the departure.  And this significantly reduces the cost of travel.  It is expensive and long to fly to Bali, but all tourists call the rest there fabulous.  Is it worth considering that the country of Indonesia is designed only for wealthy travelers?  Not at all!  There are also budget hotels there. </p><p>  But if you really pay for a tour to Bali, then you want to live in decent conditions.  What about the Indonesian three rubles?  Just like in all other countries, you need to study hotel reviews.  Hotels in Bali have an established world classification.  But five stars, in addition to the high price of accommodation, still do not guarantee anything.  Just like a hotel, the name of which means “3 *” modestly, is not a completely killed overnight stay.  “Treshki” in Bali can get low status simply because of its location or small territory.  Let's see what tourists say about the Santika Hotel Siligita Nusa Dua 3 * hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotels.webjet.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Santika Hotel Siligita Nusa Dua 3 * - reviews" class="if uuid-3180017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3180017.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  As you can understand from the name of the hotel, it is located in the resort town of Nusa Dua.  This place is almost unknown to Russian tourists.  Europeans, Americans, Japanese are resting here.  So if you want a break from your compatriots, Nusa Dua will definitely suit you.  However, it should be borne in mind that no one speaks Russian here.  So a minimum knowledge of English is required. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Hotel Santika Siligita Nusa Dua 3 * itself is located not in the city center, but on its outskirts.  Many just like this circumstance.  There are no noisy bars and discos near the hotel.  The “Santi Siligita” is adjoined by the fashionable hotels “The Grand Bali” and “Mercury Nusa Dua”.  Life in the area freezes at seven in the evening.  Ngurah Rai International Airport is 12 kilometers from the hotel.  The same distance separates the hotel from another resort - Kuta.  But a few minutes walk from the hotel is the water sports center Tanjung Benoa. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="-8.804883" data-lng="115.22201599999994" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/3/9/0/16390.png"></div><h2>  The territory of the hotel Santika Siligita Nusa Dua 3 * </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists on this subject are very mixed.  Some characterize the territory of the hotel as a small one, consisting of one four-story building with a swimming pool adjacent to it.  Other tourists mention ponds with goldfish, flower beds, a small green lawn.  We turn to the information provided by the hotelier.  The area of ​​Santika Siligita Nusa Dua 3 * (Indonesia, Bali) is 6,230 square meters.  Whether it is a lot or a little is for you to judge. </p><p>  The hotel was erected in 2010 and is part of the Santika Hotels chain.  But what all the tourists are unanimous in is that the hotel area is very clean, well-groomed, and reasonably thought out.  The restaurant occupies the first floor of the building and has an outdoor pool terrace.  The rooms are located on floors 2-4.  There are two elevators in the building.  So ask for a room on the upper floors - the view is more pleasant there, and no noise is heard.  The only criticism caused the lack of a playground for tourists, although there is a swimming pool for small guests.  The hotel grounds are well guarded.  There are always two security guards at the entrance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="planetofhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Santika Hotel Siligita Nusa Dua 3 * (Indonesia)" class="if uuid-3180039" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3180039.jpg"></div><h2>  Room Categories </h2><p>  Guests call Santika Siligita Nusa Dua 3 * the average largest hotel.  It has only 153 rooms.  Their lion's share (108) belongs to the “superior room” category, but in the reviews tourists call them “standards”.  These rooms are located on all residential floors of the building (2-4), but on the upper level they overlook the road.  The area of ​​such double "superior" is 22 square meters.  The bedroom adjoins the balcony, there is a bathroom.  It is nice that in this category of rooms there are adjacent rooms for large families or companies. </p><p>  On the second and third floors are the Deluxe Rooms.  Their balconies overlook the pool.  The area of ​​such rooms is only two square meters larger than the "standards".  On the top floor of the building (and all - overlooking the pool) are "suites".  They consist of two rooms - a bedroom and a living room, and are designed for 2-4 people.  The total area of ​​these rooms is 53 square meters.  m. For guests of the "suites" the hotel offers bathrobes and slippers.  Tourists in the reviews mention welcome drinks for VIP guests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Santika Hotel Siligita Nusa Dua 3 - rooms" class="if uuid-3180014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3180014.jpg"></div><h2>  What is in the rooms </h2><p>  Guests praise the decoration of the rooms.  They all have huge floor-to-ceiling windows, making it light and comfortable.  Furniture and sanitary ware in the rooms of Santika Siligita Nusa Dua 3 * are new, everything functions without any problems.  Living in the "superiors" mention that the closet is quite small and it has few shelves for clothes.  But overall, guests were satisfied with the rooms.  Even in the “standard” there is air conditioning (silent and wisely located a little off the bed), a flat-screen TV with cable channels (no Russian), a minibar with drinks and a free, daily replenished bottle of drinking water, a safe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Throughout the hotel there is pretty smart Wi-Fi.  Tourists called the availability of an electric kettle and replenished bags of drinks in the rooms a huge plus.  The bathroom includes a hairdryer and toiletries.  Room cleaning is good, no complaints.  The only thing that puzzled many tourists (every third review mentions this) was the frosted glass door that separates the bathroom from the bedroom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="poihalyznamy.lviv.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Santika Hotel Siligita Nusa Dua 3 * in Bali" class="if uuid-3180035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3180035.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  “For fans of Turkish“ all inclusive ”, please do not worry,“ say the guests of Santika Siligita Nusa Dua 3 *.  The hotel practices the concept of nutrition BB, that is, guests are fed only breakfast.  But in the hotel restaurant "Mengiat" you can have lunch and dinner.  Do this if you are a fan of Indonesian cuisine. </p><p>  Most tourists had lunch and dinner outside the hotel, as in cafes on the beach it is much cheaper, and there is more choice of dishes.  Kedai n'deso, which serves deliciously cooked fish and seafood, has earned many commendable reviews from the closest to the hotel.  To the right of the hotel is the Pepito grocery store.  Some tourists went to the fish market in Jimbaran.  The seller will clean the bought food, gut it and, if you wish, also cook it on the grill. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cybevasion.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Santika Hotel Siligita Nusa Dua 3 * - restaurant" class="if uuid-3180029" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3180029.jpg"></div><h2>  Breakfast </h2><p>  All reviews of Santika Siligita Nusa Dua 3 *, one way or another, affect the theme of food in the hotel.  Most of the guests were satisfied.  The restaurant is located on the ground floor and has a spacious terrace next to the pool.  The tables are covered with tablecloths, dishes and appliances are clean.  What pleasantly surprised the hotel guests was that the waiters were delivering tea and coffee, and there was no need to go with splashing drinks through the entire room.  Breakfast is served in buffet style. </p><p>  In the trays there are always dishes that are traditionally eaten in the morning: sausages, boiled eggs, cereals, sliced ​​vegetables, fruits, pastries.  And the cook in the hall with visitors fries what is tasty and hot: scrambled eggs, pancakes, pancakes.  There were no queues for food.  Whenever you come for breakfast, at the beginning of the meal or at the end of it, there is always the same assortment of dishes.  Waiters very quickly replace empty trays with full ones, change tablecloths, clean dishes from tables.  Tourists in the reviews say that the assortment includes both European dishes and Asian dishes - Chinese and Indonesian. </p><h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  Many travelers wonder why such a wonderful hotel as Santika Siligita Nusa Dua 3 * has only three stars.  Probably the whole thing is in its location.  You need to go to the sea for 15-20 minutes, while on a not very convenient road (there is not a sidewalk everywhere).  The hotel has an arrangement with Mengiath Beach.  To relax there for free, you need to take a coupon for a sunbed under an umbrella at the reception, and a towel at the pool. </p><p>  Three times a day, a bus runs from the hotel to the beach and back.  What do travelers say about Mengiate itself?  The beach is very beautiful, with white clean sand.  The bottom is shallow, there are almost no waves, which makes it safe for children to swim.  A nice feature of the beach is that it almost does not feel the ebb.  Mengiat - the coast is very comfortable.  There is a shower, a toilet, lifeguards are on duty.  There is a bar on the beach, but it is paid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cybevasion.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Santika Hotel Siligita Nusa Dua 3 * - beach" class="if uuid-3180020" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3180020.jpg"></div><h2>  Service at the hotel Santika Siligita Nusa Dua Bali 3 * </h2><p>  In reviews, tourists often mention a spacious swimming pool with a children's section.  In addition to transfer to the beach, the hotel also offers a free trip to the Bali Collection Nusa Dua shopping mall (scheduled bus).  The reception desk is open around the clock and its staff are fluent in English. </p><p>  All hotel staff is very friendly, helpful, fulfills the slightest request.  Wireless internet is available throughout, and in the rooms as well.  Another "feature" of the hotel is the spa with a variety of massages.  His services are paid, but tourists highly recommend going there for at least a couple of sessions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hotels.webjet.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Santika Hotel Siligita Nusa Dua 3 - pool" class="if uuid-3180015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3180015.jpg"></div><p>  If you wanted to visit Bali, but want a budget trip, this hotel is just for you! </p>
