Features, conditions and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The</span> ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù <span>loyalty program</span> from ‚ÄúSberbank‚Äù is an accrual in the <span>form of bonuses</span> for purchases from the card.  The amount of contributions depends on the type of card, promotion or special offer from a partner, but cannot be less than 0.5%.  Clients of the bank can use the accumulated points depending on their preferences: in cafes, shops, pharmacy points.  Active buyers are advised to know all the options that you can spend "Thank you" from "Sberbank." </p><h2>  How to use bonus points? </h2><p>  Accumulating "Thank you", the owners of credit cards in "Sberbank" can get a discount of up to 100% by paying for the goods due to the bonuses used.  1 bonus point is equal to 1 ruble when purchasing a product or service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="odemeteknolojileri.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what you can spend &quot;thank you&quot; from Sberbank" class="if uuid-2872882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2872882.jpg"></div><p>  To write off bonuses, the client must contact the cashier with any of Sberbank cards - the bonus balance on all plastic products of the client is the same.  It is allowed to write off all bonuses or a certain amount, as well as partially pay them, for example, 50% "Thank you" and 50% by funds from the card. </p><p>  If the customer has refused the purchase, the accumulated points are returned in the same way as the deducted funds from the credit card.  When making a mixed purchase (points + bonuses), the "Thank you" accrual also affects the balance of the spent funds in the amount of 0.5% of the amount of the check. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before payment, it is recommended to clarify in which stores you can spend ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù to ‚ÄúSberbank‚Äù, as the shares and addresses of partners may vary depending on the period and region of residence of the client. </p><h2>  Bonus points payment options </h2><p>  Unlike ordinary promotions and bonuses, ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù is multifunctional: points are an analogue of payment in rubles, promotional codes or a percentage of discounts.
