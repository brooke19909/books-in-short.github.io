This is logical, because no one will be pleased to visit the service center and use warranty repairs on their purchase. </p><p>  We will devote this article to devices that differ from others in their strength and reliability.  By purchasing one of the devices described in this article, you can be sure that it will work perfectly without any problems. </p><p>  Also in the article we will describe what criteria should be used to select a reliable phone.  These are the options that will ensure long and uninterrupted operation of your device.  We will start with them. </p><h2>  Which phone can be considered ‚Äúreliable‚Äù? </h2><p>  First, let's decide what exactly should be called a ‚Äúreliable‚Äù smartphone.  Because, as a rule, under this concept most often people mean two categories of phones - these are either physically strong models, or devices that will work for a long time without any interruptions. </p>

    <p>  In this article, we will try to find the most reliable smartphone on a universal basis.  This should be a model in which not only some kind of ‚Äúartificial‚Äù malfunctions does not occur, but also which is distinguished by its strength and resistance to shock. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Protected Models </h2><p>  It‚Äôs worth immediately pointing out that it‚Äôs not so difficult to look for the most reliable smartphone that could withstand external influences.  There is a whole line of ‚Äúprotected‚Äù phones, the casing of which is made accordingly in order to withstand shock, moisture and dust without consequences.  A vivid example is the products of the manufacturer Sigma, as well as models under the brands Caterpillar, Seals, Land Rover, N1 and others.  It‚Äôs not difficult to distinguish a secure phone (which, of course, can be classified as the ‚Äúmost reliable smartphone‚Äù) - such a device has a large metal case trimmed with rubber caps, thick glass and, as a rule, closed outputs (for headphones, a USB input, etc. e). </p><p>  But, again, in this article we will consider several other phones - simple smartphones that can last you longer than others. </p>

    <h2>  Body material </h2><p>  It is not so difficult to find out what material a reliable phone should be made of - take a look at the flagship models, which, according to the idea, are the most durable.  The phone cases are metal, because this material is more durable than plastic. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, there is an alternative theory, according to which a plastic smartphone, due to its low weight, is damaged less in the event of a fall than a metal filling.  Perhaps this is so - but a metal smartphone is better protected from simple scratches and scuffs.  Yes, and he looks better. </p><p>  Thus, from this point of view, the most reliable smartphone is the representative of the iPhone family, as well as Android devices such as Asus PadFone, HTC One, Huawei Ascend, Lenovo K900, S860, Vibe Z8;  LG G2.  All these devices are made of metal, due to which they last longer.  And they look, frankly, better. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Since in this article we are talking about smartphones, in such cases a large screen should be installed on such devices.  In turn, the large surface of the glass makes the device vulnerable to some extent.  Therefore, you should look for a device equipped with a more durable display than others.  For example, one that will be covered with <span>red-hot</span> Gorilla Glass, which is now used on the best phones. </p>

    <p>  As tests show, the devices of the newest generation (fourth) with such a display serve better than others.  An example is the <span>Samsung Galaxy Alpha,</span> released in the fall of 2014.  The device‚Äôs screen has a thickness of 0.4 mm, but shows an incredible strength when struck. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  User reviews show that the third generation of Gorilla Glass also deserves attention.  True, it is not a panacea and does not guarantee that after a serious fall your smartphone will remain 100% intact. </p><h2>  Insulation </h2><p>  If you are looking for which smartphones are the most reliable and inexpensive, do not forget about isolation.  We are talking about the ability of the device to withstand the ingress of dust and moisture inside.  Each smartphone has a large connector for charging, so there is always a chance that it will get there that will negatively affect the operation of the device.  Nevertheless, pay attention to at least the tight-fitting cover and the minimum clearance between it and the phone case.  You need to take a gadget, the risk of getting such substances inside which will be minimal.  Plus, do not forget to properly operate it - for example, keep it away from sand and water. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  It is important to note about the design and its impact on which smartphones are the most reliable.  The fact is that there are preferences of buyers that manufacturers are trying to chase - smaller dimensions and large displays on devices.  At the same time, due to the smaller size, the design of the phone becomes more vulnerable.  Remember at least the first batch of Apple iPhone 5, which literally bent in the back pocket of jeans.  Then a considerable scandal erupted over this issue, and the manufacturer strengthened the body of the device. </p><p>  Such stories are not unique: the thinner the phone, the more vulnerable it is (in the sense of physical impact). </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  No matter what they say, the most reliable smartphone on Android differs from the same on iOS.  Therefore, it is obvious that what operating system is the basis of your device determines its further work. </p><p>  Apple's technology has a reputation for being the most reliable device.  In some ways, the company's merits are really hard to overestimate - constant iOS updates and attention to details really positively affect the performance of models.  As for Android, here everything is not so simple.  For example, the device manufacturer plays a large role - the ‚Äúflagship‚Äù models from Samsung do not work like Lenovo or Impressio phones, for example.  What matters is which version of the OS is on the device, and how optimized it is.  For example, the most reliable budget smartphone is Asus Zenfone, Xiaomi Redmi, Huawei Ascend P6, LG Spirit.  If we do not talk about ‚ÄúAndroid devices‚Äù, then we can call Microsoft <span>Lumia 430</span> - a budget model for Windows Phone. </p>

    <h2>  Technical stuffing </h2><p>  Speaking about what should be ‚Äústuffed‚Äù a reliable phone, we should mention the processors, on the basis of which the model will work.  So, the overwhelming majority of manufacturers use the same processors to create their devices - this is the Snapdragon 800 (if the model is older, then 600 or 400);  as well as Mediatek (with corresponding serial numbers).  To find out how reliable your phone is, just find the name of the components that are used on it in the technical description and look for information (reviews) about them.  You will quickly understand if you are dealing with a slow or ‚Äúsmart‚Äù device. </p><p>  If we are talking about Apple technology, then this company produces its A7 processors. </p>

    <h2>  Manufacturer </h2><p>  As you noticed, there are certain trends in which company makes reliable phones and which does not.  It is easy to identify the manufacturer‚Äôs attitude to their products here - look at least for the warranty period.  In this regard, it should be noted positively Fly - the company gives a 2 year warranty on its gadgets.  Another criterion is customer reviews.  About the ‚Äúnew Apple‚Äù, as it is called - Xiaomi, there are positive recommendations as a manufacturer of reliable devices.  And all this despite the fact that the price is quite low.  Here is another example of how the most reliable and inexpensive smartphone looks like. </p><h2>  The most reliable models </h2>

    <p>  If you take into account many parameters, then in the first ‚Äúline‚Äù of reliable devices you can build ‚Äútop‚Äù devices - iPhone 6S, Samsung Galaxy S6, Lenovo K900, HTC One.  You can immediately recall the ‚Äúmid-range‚Äù models - <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Grand Prime Duos, Philips Xenium, LG G3, <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 830. These devices are cheaper, but due to the high-quality assembly from famous manufacturers they also ‚Äúkeep the mark‚Äù.  Finally, the most reliable smartphones with two SIM cards are also presented by some Chinese companies, such as Highscreen, Meizu, Xiaomi, Huawei and others.  These products are familiar to a smaller circle of customers, are cheaper - but also able to show excellent performance.  If you are looking for which smartphones are the most reliable and inexpensive, you should not neglect them, because even among little-known brands you can find something worthwhile. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Of course, the way the telephone is made determines the quality of its future work.  The same applies to its design, materials used in the development, components, as well as the approach of the manufacturer.  Still, some companies are more responsible for some small things than others - due to which they deserve widespread recognition of customers. </p><p>  However, no matter which device you choose, the term of its ‚Äúlife‚Äù will be determined by you at 80 percent.  How carefully you will operate this or that model will determine the period during which it will serve you.  Therefore, try to maximize it by taking care of your phone, providing it with protective accessories, and the like. </p>
