Still released all the new modifications of this game in the form of balls, eggs, dodecahedrons and much more.  This is despite the fact that the Meffert pyramid was invented before the famous cube. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to assemble a pyramid" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64890/2139100.jpg"></div>  Collecting such puzzles today is possible not only by the colors of the faces, but also by observing the correct shape of the figure.  In any case, such an activity helps not only spend time, but also develop logical thinking.

    <h2>  Pyramid features </h2><p>  How to assemble a pyramid?  The action algorithm in this case is different from working with a cube, but the principle remains the same.  It is necessary to collect each of the four sides of the figure of a certain color.  For this, the Meffett pyramid has 14 elements.  All of them are able to rotate individually along the axis, but, unlike the famous cube, not at right angles. </p><h2>  Interesting fact </h2><p>  Interested in the question of how to assemble the Rubik pyramid?  But did you know that the inventor Uwe Meffert from Germany actually invented this puzzle?  This happened back in 1972, and at that time the inventor managed to collect even several modifications of the puzzle, only now he quickly lost interest in it and abandoned it until better times.  They arrived a few years later, when the Rubik's Cube began to gain popularity in the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Instructions: how to assemble a pyramid.  First step </h2><p>  Before you begin, you should decide which color will be collected first and on which face of the figure it will be placed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to assemble a Rubik pyramid" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64890/2139102.jpg"></div>  Initially, it is necessary to build the borders of the color side.  To do this, place your finger on one of the vertices on the side that meets the requirements listed above.  After that, the same thing is done with other vertices.  Small tetrahedra should be rotated to fit, most importantly, do not be afraid that other sides of the figure are destroyed.

    <p>  Before you teach to assemble the pyramid of your friend or child, you must independently understand all the intricacies of the process.  To proceed to the next stage, on the first facet to be assembled, rhombuses should be formed, which are a combination of two triangles of the same desired color.  They should move away from every corner.  At this stage, only 3 triangles of a different color should remain on the edge of the tetrahedron.  Now you need to fill them. </p><p>  Tip: to simplify the task, you should determine in advance the color to be collected.  Elements with it should not be on the opposite side of the pyramid. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Step two </h2><p>  Before you assemble the pyramid completely, you should evenly fill the remaining faces with flowers.  This is precisely the second stage of assembly.  For all operations to be successful, you need to learn how to move puzzle elements from edge to top, while not destroying previously built diamonds on the edges of the figure.  You should also be able to bring to the initial position part of the lateral sides of the figure, so that rhombs can be formed from them on other sides of the pyramid. </p><h2>  Final stage </h2><p>  After 2 sides of the Meffert figure are assembled, its base should be assembled.  All actions with the rearrangement of elements are carried out in a similar way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to teach to assemble a pyramid" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64890/2139101.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In fact, the question of how to assemble a pyramid does not always have only one answer.  The more popular Rubik's Cube makes it possible to form various patterns on its sides; the same can be done with the tetrahedron.  Of course, in this case there will be much less options for arranging multi-colored elements, but you can try to collect something of your own, individual.  Otherwise, you can find on the network a lot of pictures with patterns on the sides of the pyramid and try to bring them to life on their own.  Of course, it is easier to start experiments after the instructions for the standard filling of the sides are mastered. </p><p>  Good luck to everyone in their endeavors and the development of their thinking! </p>
