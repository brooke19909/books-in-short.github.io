In the course of this activity, facts are collected, analyzed, systematized and further synthesized based on the available data of new knowledge, which allow scientifically based forecasting of the future. </p><p>  The concept of science in philosophy occupies one of the most important places.  Science is the main <span>form of knowledge of the</span> world.  For a philosophical vision of the world, it is necessary to have a definite idea of ‚Äã‚Äãscience, what it is, how science is organized, how it develops, what is available to it, and what can be hoped for thanks to its achievements. </p>

    <p>  <strong>The concept of science in philosophy</strong> consists of its definition, goals, ideological basis (paradigm), a set of ideas and ideas about what science is, etc.  This also includes the problems of scientific ethics - a system of rules governing the relationship of people in the field of scientific research. </p><p>  Any ideology is the registration of data obtained empirically, which relate to the interaction of people between themselves or with nature.  Almost always truth-setting is fraught with error.  The verification of ideological postulates by <span>empirical methods</span> is a rather complicated task. </p><p>  The concept of science in philosophy is defined as the sphere of activity of people whose main function is to develop knowledge about reality on an objective basis.  Science is a form of social consciousness.  It includes activities for the acquisition of new knowledge, as well as the sum of all the knowledge that underlies the picture of the world.  Under the science also understand the individual branches of scientific knowledge. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The system of sciences in philosophy is divided into social, natural, humanitarian and technical.  It originated in the ancient world, but as a system began to take shape from the 16th century.  In the course of its development, it has become an important social institution, which is necessary for society and has a huge impact on its activities. </p>

    <p>  Historically, certain <strong>stages of the development of the philosophy of science</strong> are distinguished.  This philosophical discipline began to develop along with positivist teaching.  It was then that the first urgent need arose to study the language, logic, and methods of the <span>exact sciences.</span>  At various stages, various phenomena stood out as the main problems of study, different topics were discussed, and there was no unity of opinion on what to include in the concept of science in philosophy. </p><p>  In positivist philosophy (at all three stages), the main <span>task of the philosophy of</span> science was to understand the essence of the natural science theory as a whole, attempts were made to determine its structure, means of knowledge formation.  At this time, the problem of the growth of scientific knowledge appears. </p><p>  At the subsequent stages in the development of the philosophy of science, positivists more and more departed from the actual content of scientific theory.  Logical-positivist teaching in general has actually gone into metaphysics, moving away from science.  Neopositivists continued to rely on empiricism.  They reduced philosophy to the logic of science.  Post-positivists tried to analyze the influence of ‚Äúextra-scientific‚Äù factors (cultural, spiritual, social) on the development of science.  At this stage, science began to interact with the social environment.  From that moment on, science became a promising and interesting topic for philosophers.  The theories of neopositivists and postpositivists remain relevant to this day. </p><p>  There is such a thing as <strong>problems of the science of philosophy</strong> .  By it we understand the problems of the growth of scientific knowledge, the study of the emergence of science and its development at each stage of social development.  The philosophy of science seeks to develop worldview guidelines for solving these problems.  <span>The main problem of the philosophy of</span> science is the problem of the emergence of scientific knowledge itself.  In general, all problems are divided into three groups: problems of the philosophy of science arising from the characteristics of philosophy;  problems within science itself;  problems of the interaction of philosophy and science. </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
