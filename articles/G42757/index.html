The Four Main Classes of Ancient Indian Society: Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, Sudras</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Over the millennia of life, the four main classes of the ancient Indian society have practically not changed their life rules and moral principles, while preserving the huge chasm of alienation between the varns: the social strata of the population.  What are varnas in <span>the Hindu tradition</span> and what impact do they have on man?  Is the secret of the Indian nation kept in the knowledge of its place?  After all, it is known that India is the most peaceful country, which has never attacked other nationalities. </p><h2>  What are varnas? </h2><p>  This concept in Ancient India was formed in the II century BC, when the basic law of Manu, the progenitor of mankind according to Hinduism, was formulated.  This set of laws contained 2685 slokas, that is, couplets, in which the essence of social (caste law), legal and legal legislation was transmitted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is varna" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/2092043.jpg"></div>  The estate of society, containing a certain group of people, the social layer of the population (varna in ancient India), was determined by birth, it could not be bought or presented.  Marriages between different varnas were strictly prohibited, which was meticulously prosecuted.  Moreover, if a person violated the division of estates and created an unequal marriage, he was declared a sinner who violated centuries-old foundations: his children “inherited” this sin and were persecuted by society.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are four main varnas: brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras, but there was also an unspoken caste of untouchables.  Later, the word “varna”, meaning “color” (skin?), Was renamed to “castes” (from Portuguese. “Kind”) from the filing of the Portuguese, who first visited India in the sixteenth century, although, according to some reports, it is believed that Varna and caste is still different concepts: Varna is a class by birth, and caste is by type of activity. </p><p>  If the first three classes could interact at the level of work, housekeeping or other social issues, then contacts with sudras were extremely undesirable.  For each Varna, a special charter of conduct and morality was drawn up, which was forbidden to violate: </p><ul><li>  The Brahmins studied the Vedas from the age of 8, and coming of age at 16. </li><li>  Kshatriyas studied the scriptures from the age of 11, came of age at 22 years old. </li><li>  Vaishya studied Vedic wisdom from the age of 12, and entered into adulthood from the age of 24. </li><li>  The sudras were forbidden to study ancient Vedic texts. </li></ul><h2>  History of Varna </h2><p>  "Vedas" - the ancient Indian books of wisdom, transmitted for many centuries as the main heritage of Indian culture.  According to the Vedas, the supreme creator of the material world, Brahma, from his mouth gave birth to a varna of brahmanas, endowing them with holiness, the highest spiritual knowledge and wisdom of truth, from his hands he recreated a varna of ksatriyas, therefore they are characterized by power, strength and activity.  From his hips, the <span>god Brahma</span> created a vaisya - people with a market mentality who could create wealth or even a non-poor existence out of nothing.  The last varna - the sudras - was created from the feet of Brahma, so she was written to obey and serve all the rest of her superiors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Varna in ancient India" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/2092039.jpg"></div>

That is why since the birth of a child zealously guard against communication with other classes, so as not to distort his one-pointed mind. </p><h2>  The essence of the idea - in one word </h2><p>  Some teachers have a fairly simple explanation of how to designate varna in one word: </p><ul><li>  Sudra - “I'm afraid.”  The lower class, living in constant base fears: hunger, cold, insecurity from people and the elements. </li><li>  Vaisyas - “I ask.”  People from this varna are easy to ask for, they often achieve everything thanks to their “thick-skinnedness” while promoting their interest. </li><li>  Kshatriyu - “I believe.”  People of strong faith, often not based on any solid facts. </li><li>  Brahman - “I know.”  An estate whose life is based on true knowledge. </li></ul><h2>  High Caste: Brahmins </h2><p>  Priests and scientific thinkers, spiritual mentors who thoroughly know the sacred Vedas and religious figures, teachers - they all belong to the Brahmin Varna, the highest and most revered among the estates that participate in the fate of the city (government, courts), are engaged in scientific activities.  They are ascetic and balanced, merciful and highly spiritual. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="brahmanas priests scientists" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/2092038.jpg"></div>  Even if a brahmana was engaged in agriculture, or weaving, which was unworthy for his family tree, this was explained by the fact that he comprehends the nature of this action, that is, he conducts philosophical observations and reflections.  It was believed that white is exclusively for Brahmins.

To do harm to a brahmana is very heavy karma, which for years has haunted the daredevil to transcend centuries-old traditions. </p><h2>  Average person </h2><p>  They are called kshatriyas: warriors, rulers, military leaders, public and administrative figures.  In ancient times, they were considered the descendants of the Aryans, aristocrats by birth and special warriors who achieved this position with their exploits: they are full of heroism and fortitude, patience and generosity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ksatriya warriors rulers" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/2092042.jpg"></div>  The political power of the city or region was concentrated in their hands, quite often they possessed vast estates and lands, therefore, in fact, they had a double income: from the lands and salaries from the state for military operations (if there were any).  Kshatriyas were even allowed to kill women and children in the name of justice and defending the honor of those who could not stand up for themselves.  Red is ksatriya.

    <h2>  Estate traders </h2><p>  People closely dealing with money are merchants, farmers, and artisans — vaisyas (vaisyus).  Their mentality was strikingly different from brahmana or dalit: the entrepreneur’s vein was bloody, and from early childhood, representatives of this varna were able to earn a living. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vaisya farmers artisans merchants" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/2092047.jpg"></div>  This does not mean that such a person necessarily lived in abundance, being a speculator or a money-lender, no, but a vaisya surely possessed a worthy craft that maintained a level of being sufficient for that time.  With all this, the vaishya belonged to yellow, was considered a commoner and did not have a significant voice in society, but was not persecuted, like a sudra.

    <h2>  Lower Level: Sudras </h2><p>  Wage workers, servants, and in general the entire population living below the poverty line, both material and spiritual, are called sudras.  Communication with them of the higher castes was considered unworthy, on the verge of a lifelong shame. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sudra servants hired workers" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/2092041.jpg"></div>  Of all the varnas, it was the sudras who suffered the most severe oppression by the state: they paid a large tax, they were judged for misconduct particularly severely and were not allowed to conduct religious rites, which is considered a rather significant sign.  A sudra could be bought and sold, his property taken away without fear of punishment: there was only one explanation - he was born to serve, which means he cannot murmur in fact.  The color of a sudra is naturally black.

    <h2>  Dalits (untouchables) or pariahs </h2><p>  Twenty percent of the total population of India are precisely Dalits who do not have any social and legal rights: they are forbidden to communicate with them, they are not allowed to enter the temple or the courtyard of a person from another varna or caste, and if they dare to take water from a common well , which are full in India, they are simply torn to pieces by an insulted crowd. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="four main classes of the ancient Indian society" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53524/2092040.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Historians believe that this varna arose in ancient India from the local population conquered by the Aryans, who settled their settlements on their territory and used the natives as slaves for the most dirty and hard work.  At the present time, nothing has changed: the untouchables clean the toilets, kill animals for food and dress their skin, remove dead animals and garbage from the streets, wash clothes (dhobi laundresses).  Such a Varna is a stigma of its own kind and forever: since the attitude to Varna is inherited, the Dalits have no chance to break this vicious circle, unless the government changes the ancient code of laws and abolishes an outdated system that violates human rights, for which a long time fought Mahatma Gandhi. </p><h2>  Analogs in Slavic culture </h2><p>  To understand what Varna is, let us turn to the tradition of Slavic peoples, which also had their own tribal differences: </p><ul><li>  Magi, or sorcerers, are Brahmins in Hinduism, in Ancient Russia they were also the guardians of spiritual knowledge, carrying them through centuries of generations. </li><li>  Knights - Kshatriyas, warriors and defenders of the fatherland, as well as rulers: princes, kings and governors. </li><li>  Vesi - Vaisyas, merchants, farmers and artisans are the main layer of society in any country. </li><li>  Smerds - sudras, also exist to serve the other three classes, as they have no inclination for mental or philosophical activity, and also have a low level of spirituality.  It is enough for them to eat and sleep, copulate - their consciousness does not require more, in contrast to the higher classes. </li></ul>
