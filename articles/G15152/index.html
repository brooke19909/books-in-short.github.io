So: ‚ÄúThe first spaceship starts from the surface of the earth at a speed of 0.68 s.  The second apparatus starts moving from the first in the same direction with a speed of V2 = 0.86 s.  It is necessary to calculate the speed of the second vessel relative to planet Earth. " </p><p>  Those who want to test their knowledge can be trained in solving this problem.  You can also take part in the test solution together with schoolchildren: ‚ÄúThe first spaceship starts from the surface of the earth at a speed of 0.7 s.  (c - designation of the speed of light).  The second apparatus starts moving from the first in the same direction.  Its speed is 0.8 s.  The speed of the second vessel relative to planet Earth should be calculated. ‚Äù </p><p>  Those who consider themselves versed in this issue have the opportunity to make a choice - four possible answers are offered: 1) 0;  2) 0.2 s;  3) 0.96 s;  4) 1.54 s. </p><p>  The authors of this lesson put forward an important didactic goal to introduce students to the physical and philosophical meaning of Einstein's postulates, the essence and properties of the relativistic concept of time and space, etc.  The educational goal of the lesson is to develop a dialectic-materialistic worldview in young men and women. </p><p>  But readers of the article, who are familiar with the history of domestic space flights, will agree that the tasks under which the expression ‚Äúthe first spaceship‚Äù is mentioned can play a more significant educational role.  If desired, the teacher using these tasks could reveal both the cognitive and patriotic aspects of the issue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first spaceship in space, the successes of domestic space science in general - what is known about this? </p><h2>  The importance of space research </h2><p>  Through space research, valuable data have been introduced into science, which made it possible to comprehend the essence of new natural phenomena and put them at the service of people.  Using artificial satellites, scientists were able to determine the exact shape of the planet Earth, by studying the orbit, it became possible to trace the areas of magnetic anomalies in Siberia.  Using rockets and satellites, they were able to open and explore the radiation belts around the Earth.  With their help, it became possible to solve many other complex problems. </p><h2>  The first spaceship to visit the moon </h2><p>  The moon is a celestial body with which the most spectacular and impressive successes of space science are associated. </p><p>  The flight to the moon for the first time in history was carried out on January 2, 1959 by the automatic station "Luna-1".  The first launch of <span>the Luna-1</span> artificial <span>satellite</span> was a significant breakthrough in space exploration.  But the main goal of the project was not achieved.  It consisted of a flight from Earth to the moon.  The launch of the satellite provided valuable scientific and practical information regarding flights to other space bodies.  During the flight of the "Moon-1" was developed (for the first time!) The second <span>cosmic velocity.</span>  In addition, it became possible to obtain data on the radiation belt of the globe, and other valuable information was obtained.  The world press gave the name Luna-1 to the Luna-1 spacecraft. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  AMC "Luna-2" repeated its predecessor almost completely.  The instruments and equipment used made it possible to monitor interplanetary space, as well as to correct the information received by Luna-1.  The launch (September 12, 1959) was also carried out using a pH 8K72. </p><p>  On September 14, Luna-2 reached the surface of the Earth‚Äôs natural satellite.  The first ever flight from our planet to the moon was made.  Onboard the AMC were three symbolic pennants bearing the inscription: "USSR, September 1959."  A metal ball was placed in the middle, which, when it hit the surface of a celestial body, scattered into dozens of small pennants. </p><p>  Tasks assigned to the automatic station: </p><ul><li>  reaching the surface of the moon; </li><li>  the development of the second cosmic velocity; </li><li>  overcoming the gravity of planet Earth; </li><li>  delivery to the lunar surface of pennants of the "USSR". </li></ul><p>  All of them were completed. </p><h2>  "East" </h2><p>  It was the very first spaceship in the world of all launched into the orbit of the Earth.  Academician M.K. Tikhonravov under the guidance of the famous designer S.P. Korolev developed for many years, starting in the spring of 1957. In April 1958, approximate parameters of the future ship, as well as its general indicators, were known.  It was assumed that the first spacecraft will have a weight of about 5 tons and that upon entering the atmosphere it will require additional thermal protection weighing about 1.5.  In addition, it was provided for the bailout of the pilot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The creation of the experimental apparatus ended in April 1960.  In the summer, his trials began. </p><p>  The first Vostok spacecraft (photo below) consisted of two elements: the instrument compartment and the descent vehicle, interconnected. </p>

    <p>  The ship was equipped with manual and automatic control, orientation to the Sun and the Earth.  In addition, there was a touchdown, temperature control and power supply.  The board was designed for the flight of one pilot in a spacesuit.  The ship had two portholes. </p><p>  The first spacecraft went into space in 1961, April 12.  Now this date is celebrated as Cosmonautics Day.  On this day, Yu.A.  Gagarin put into orbit the world's first spacecraft.  He made a revolution around the Earth. </p><p>  The main task performed by the first spacecraft with a man on board was to study the well-being and performance of the astronaut outside our planet.  The successful flight of Gagarin: our compatriot, the first person to see the Earth from outer space, the development of science was taken to a new level. </p><h2>  The real flight to immortality </h2><p>  ‚ÄúThe first spacecraft with a man on board was put into orbit on April 12, 1961.  The first pilot-cosmonaut of the Vostok satellite ship was a citizen of the USSR, pilot, Major Gagarin Yu. A. ‚Äù </p>

    <p>  Words from the memorable TASS message forever remained in history, on one of its most significant and bright pages.  After decades, flights into space will turn into a common, everyday occurrence, but the flight made by a person from a small town in Russia - Gzhatsk - forever remained in the minds of many generations as a great human feat. </p><h2>  Space race </h2><p>  Between the Soviet Union and the United States in those years there was a tacit competition for the right to play a leading role in the conquest of space.  The leader of the competition was the Soviet Union.  The United States lacked powerful launch vehicles. </p><p>  Soviet astronautics already tested their work in January 1960 during tests in the Pacific.  All the major newspapers in the world published information that a man will soon be launched into space in the USSR, which will certainly leave the United States behind.  All the people of the world were waiting for the first flight of a man with great impatience. </p><p>  In April 1961, man first looked at the Earth from space.  "East" rushed towards the sun, the whole planet watched this flight at the radios.  The world was shocked and excited, everyone was inseparably watching the course of the greatest experiment in the history of mankind. </p><h2>  The minutes that shocked the world </h2><p>  "Man in space!"  With this news, the work of the radio and telegraph agencies was interrupted in mid-sentence.  ‚ÄúA man is launched by the councils!  Yuri Gagarin in space! ‚Äù </p>

    <p>  It took the ‚ÄúEast‚Äù only 108 minutes to fly around the planet.  And these minutes not only testified to the speed of the spacecraft.  These were the first minutes of the new space era, which is why they shocked the world so much. </p><p>  The race between the two superpowers for the title of winner in the struggle for space exploration ended in victory for the USSR.  In May, the United States also launched a man into space along a ballistic trajectory.  Nevertheless, the beginning of man‚Äôs exit beyond the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere was laid by Soviet people.  The first Vostok spacecraft with an astronaut aboard was sent precisely by the Land of the Soviets.  This fact was the subject of extraordinary pride of the Soviet people.  Moreover, the flight lasted longer, went much higher, went along a much more complex path.  In addition, Gagarin's first spaceship (the photo represents his appearance) cannot be compared with the capsule in which the American pilot flew. </p>

    <h2>  Space Age Morning </h2><p>  These 108 minutes have changed the life of Yuri Gagarin, our country and the whole world forever.  After the <span>first spacecraft</span> with a man on board went <span>into space</span> , people of the Earth began to consider this event in the morning of the space age.  There was no person on the planet who would enjoy such enormous love not only of his fellow citizens, but also people of the whole world, regardless of nationality, political and religious beliefs.  His feat was the personification of all the best created by the human mind. </p><h2>  "Ambassador of the world" </h2><p>  Having circled the Earth on the Vostok ship, Yuri Gagarin set off on a journey around the world.  Everyone wanted to see and hear the world's first astronaut.  It was equally warmly received by the prime ministers and presidents, grand dukes and kings.  Gagarin was also joyfully greeted by miners and dockers, military and scientists, students of the great universities of the world and the elders of abandoned villages in Africa.  The first astronaut was equally simple, friendly and welcoming with everyone.  It was a real "ambassador of peace" recognized by the peoples. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúOne big and beautiful human house‚Äù </h2><p>  Gagarin's diplomatic mission was very important for the country.  No one could succeed, as the first man who traveled to outer space, to make knots of friendship between people and nations, to connect thoughts and hearts.  He had an unforgettable, charming smile, amazing benevolence, which brought together people from different countries, different beliefs.  Extraordinarily convincing were his passionate, wholehearted speeches, calling for world peace. </p><p>  ‚ÄúI saw how beautiful the Earth is,‚Äù said Gagarin.  - From space, the borders of states are indistinguishable.  Our planet looks from space as one big and beautiful human home.  All honest people on Earth are responsible for order and peace in their home. "  He was infinitely trusted. </p><h2>  Unprecedented take-off of the country </h2><p>  At the dawn of that unforgettable day, he was familiar to a limited circle of people.  At noon, the whole planet recognized his name.  Millions reached out to him, he was fond of kindness, youth, beauty.  For mankind, he became a harbinger of the future, a scout who returned from a dangerous search and opened up new paths to knowledge. </p><p>  In the eyes of many, he personified his country, was a representative of the people, who at one time made a huge contribution to the victory over the Nazis, and now was the first to rise into space.  The name of Gagarin, who was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, became a symbol of the unprecedented rise of the country to new heights of social and economic progress. </p><h2>  The initial phase of space exploration </h2><p>  Even before the famous flight, when the first spacecraft with a man on board was launched into space, Gagarin thought about how important space exploration is for people, for which powerful ships and rockets are needed.  Why are telescopes mounted and orbits calculated?  Why do satellites take off and antennas of radio stations rise?  He very well understood the urgent need and importance of these matters and sought to contribute to the initial stage of human space exploration. </p><h2>  The first spaceship "Vostok": tasks </h2><p>  The main scientific tasks facing the Vostok ship were as follows.  Firstly, the study of the impact of flight conditions in orbit on the state of the human body and its performance.  Secondly, verification of the principles of spacecraft construction. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  In 1957, S.P.  Korolev, in the framework of the scientific design bureau, organized a special department No. 9. It provided for the work to create artificial satellites of our planet.  The department was headed by associate Korolyov M.K.  Quietly.  The issues of creating a satellite manned by a person on board were also investigated here.  The Korolevskaya R-7 was considered as a launch vehicle.  According to calculations, a rocket with a third degree of protection was able to bring a five-ton load into low Earth orbit. </p><p>  Mathematicians of the Academy of Sciences took part in the calculations at an early stage of development.  A warning was made that a tenfold overload could lead to a ballistic descent from orbit. </p><p>  The department investigated the conditions for the implementation of this task.  I had to abandon the consideration of winged options.  As the most acceptable way to return a person, the possibilities of his bailout and further descent by parachute were studied.  A separate rescue of the descent vehicle was not provided for. </p>

    <p>  In the course of medical research, it was proved that the most acceptable for the human body is the spherical shape of the descent vehicle, which can withstand significant loads without serious consequences for the health of the astronaut.  It was the spherical shape that was chosen for the production of the lander of the manned ship. </p><p>  The Vostok-1K ship was the first to be sent.  It was an automatic flight, which took place in May 1960. Later, the Vostok-3KA modification was created and worked out, which was completely ready for manned flights. </p><p>  In addition to one failed flight, which ended in a launch vehicle accident at the start, the program provided for the launch of six unmanned vehicles and six manned spacecraft. </p><p>  The program implemented: </p><ul><li>  manned space flight - the first spaceship Vostok 1 (the photo is an image of a ship); </li><li>  flight duration per day: "Vostok-2"; </li><li>  group flights: Vostok-3 and Vostok-4; </li><li>  participation in space flight of the first female astronaut: Vostok-6. </li></ul><h2>  "East": characteristics and structure of the ship </h2><p>  Specifications: </p><ul><li>  weight - 4.73 tons; </li><li>  length - 4.4 m; </li><li>  diameter - 2.43 m. </li></ul><p>  Device: </p><ul><li>  spherical descent vehicle <span>(2.46 t,</span> 2.3 m); </li><li>  orbital and conical instrument compartments (2.27 t, 2.43 m) - their mechanical connection with each other using pyrotechnic locks and metal bands is provided. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="first spaceship east 1 photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/1315431.jpg" width="494"></div></h2><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Automatic and manual control, automatic orientation to the Sun and manual orientation to the Earth. </p><p>  Life support (provided for 10 days to maintain the internal atmosphere corresponding to the parameters of the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere). </p><p>  Command-logical control, power supply, thermal control, landing. </p><h2>  For human work </h2><p>  In order to ensure the work of man in space, the board was equipped with the following equipment: </p><ul><li>  autonomous and radio telemetry devices necessary for monitoring the state of the astronaut; </li><li>  devices for radiotelephone communication with ground stations; </li><li>  command radio link; </li><li>  software-temporary devices; </li><li>  television system for monitoring the pilot from the Earth; </li><li>  a radio system for monitoring the orbit and direction finding of a ship; </li><li>  brake propulsion system and others. </li></ul><h2>  The device of the descent vehicle </h2><p>  There were two portholes in the descent vehicle.  One of them was located on the entrance hatch, slightly above the pilot's head, the other, with a special orientation system, was located in the floor at his feet.  An <span>astronaut</span> dressed in a <span>spacesuit was</span> located in an ejection chair.  It was envisaged that after braking the descent vehicle at an altitude of 7 km, the astronaut should catapult and make a landing by parachute.  In addition, there was the possibility of a pilot landing inside the device itself.  There was a parachute in the descent vehicle, but equipment for soft landing was not provided.  This threatened the man who was in him with serious bruises on landing. </p><p>  If automatic systems failed, the astronaut could use manual control. </p><p>  In the Vostok ships there were no devices for manned flights to the moon.  The flight of people without special training was unacceptable in them. </p><h2>  Who piloted the Vostok ships? </h2><p>  Yu. A. Gagarin: the first spaceship Vostok-1.  The photo below is an image of the layout of the ship.  G. S. Titov: ‚ÄúVostok-2‚Äù, A. G. Nikolaev: ‚ÄúVostok-3‚Äù, P.R.  Popovich: Vostok-4, V.F. Bykovsky: Vostok-5, V.V. Tereshkova: Vostok-6. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the first spaceship starts from the surface of the earth at a speed of 0 68" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/1315447.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  108 minutes during which the "East" made a revolution around the Earth, the life of the planet was forever changed.        .           ,     . ,        . </p><p> No matter how far humanity has advanced in its development, it will always remember this amazing day when a person first appeared alone with the cosmos.  People will always remember the immortal name of the glorious pioneer of space, which became an ordinary Russian man - Yuri Gagarin.  All today's and tomorrow's achievements of space science can be considered steps in its wake, the result of the victory won by him - the first and most important. </p>
