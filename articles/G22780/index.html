It is becoming increasingly difficult to surprise them.  That is why many once popular resorts have become forgotten.  Here, for example, Bulgaria.  Back in Soviet times, many dreamed of relaxing on the chic sandy beaches of this country.  And now this direction has lost its former relevance.  Many people have a stereotype that a vacation here a priori cannot be of high quality, interesting and worthwhile.  Admittedly, this is a misconception.  Over the past few years, many excellent hotels have appeared, the old ones have been reconstructed, repaired.  And, of course, Bulgaria is a great place for families with young children: the climate is excellent, the sea is warm, fairly shallow, well-developed infrastructure.  If you are looking for an inexpensive seaside resort with a comfortable climate, we advise you to take a closer look at Bulgaria, at least get acquainted with the reviews of real vacationers. </p>

    <p>  Sunny Beach is perhaps the most famous Bulgarian resort.  It is located just a 15-20 minute drive from Burgas on the Black Sea coast.  The visiting card of the resort was the island city or the fortress city of Nessebar - an amazing place where all lovers and connoisseurs of antiquity will like it.  Vacationers are waiting for a rich excursion program and a unique opportunity to go to Turkish Istanbul or in pursuit of ghosts in Romania.  As for hotels, there are plenty of them here.  The rating of hotels in Sunny Beach will help every tourist, even the most inexperienced, to make the right choice.  There are both modest and chic options - it remains only to decide on the most optimal one.  Hotel Aronia Beach 4 * was highly rated, therefore, it deserves attention from tourists.  Reviews of real vacationers will help to evaluate it from all sides. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  Until January 1, 2016, the hotel was called Delta Beach, so many people know it in this guise.  This is a city-style hotel located on the second coastline - the majority in Bulgaria.  In general, you should not expect something special from the option even 4 *, then you will not experience disappointment.  The hotel was redecorated, its traces are obvious.  Some tourists claim that the repair was made in haste - there are visible traces of putty, in some places it‚Äôs even scary to touch the walls.  Nevertheless, the appearance of the hotel looks good, modern. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel is located in the southern part of the resort, close to wide sandy beaches and luxurious dunes - the view is amazing.  This is noted by all tourists, without exception.  The sea from the hotel is within easy reach, in the immediate vicinity all the necessary infrastructure: shops, currency exchange, bars, restaurants.  If you prefer youth recreation, plan a rather rich entertainment program, this place is perfect for you. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  Check-in at 14:00 and check-out until 12:00.  Many tourists who prefer the Aronia Beach 4 * hotel note that you should not rely on earlier check-in: the administration will wait until the last.  All that can be offered here is to leave things at the reception, change clothes in the hotel toilet and go to the beach.  But this is, rather, the lack of a travel operator who did not take into account a possible change in flight or the formation of a time interval from the moment of arrival to check-in. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And now for the hotel administration.  Tourists complain that sometimes the administration delays check-in due to lack of rooms.  And this is very unpleasant, especially if vacationers came with small children.  From the very first minutes of rest, the impression of the hotel spoils.  That is why the administration of the Aronia Beach Hotel, at a minimum, needs to reconsider their attitude to tourists and vacationers, otherwise they risk losing them. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The room fund of the hotel Aronia Beach 4 * (Ex. Delta Beach 4 *) is represented by 233 rooms of various categories: </p><ul><li>  "Standard"; </li><li>  "Family"; </li><li>  "Apartments". </li></ul>

    <p>  Thus, each tourist will find here a suitable option.  The rooms are fairly bright and spacious.  After rebranding and repair at the Aronia Beach 4 * hotel (Bulgaria), the color scheme changed.  The hotel administration decided to make bright notes, to make the interior of the rooms even more modern: that is how the rich burgundy shade appeared, which contrasts perfectly with the azure of the Black Sea.  The rooms are equipped with comfortable modern furniture, which makes them even more comfortable.  Even those tourists who will spend only a night in the hotel, one way or another, rely on comfort in the rooms: a comfortable mattress, wide beds, good condition of equipment and plumbing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Each room is equipped with air conditioning, satellite TV, safe, minibar, refrigerator, and a private bathroom with a set of necessary bath accessories and a hairdryer. </p><h2>  Room service </h2><p>  Of course, I would like to see an awesome service in a 4 * hotel.  If we talk about the hotel Aronia Beach 4 *, many vacationers complain about cleaning.  More precisely, the rooms are not cleaned every day according to some strange schedule.  Moreover, even after being in a hotel room, the feeling of cleanliness is barely perceptible.  All the maids do is throw out the trash, sweep and sometimes make the bed.  Tourists will have to independently monitor the order in the rooms, as well as require staff to change bed linen and bath towels.  Otherwise, no one will do it.  Of course, cleaning is not the most important criterion for tourists, however, I want to live in a clean room, use fresh linen and towels. </p><h2>  Entertainment on site </h2><p>  Youth recreation is what the hotel is designed for.  Indeed, Sunny Beach is a youth resort with a lot of entertainment, including nightlife.  And the area where the Aronia Beach 4 * hotel is located suggests the presence of middle-aged vacationers, mainly young people.  Three outdoor freshwater pools are located on site.  Pools are cleaned regularly, equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas, free for all vacationers.  The indoor heated pool is designed for the cooler season - it will become a worthy alternative to cold sea water.  There is no swimming pool for children on the territory; all that the administration suggested is fencing of that section of the pool where the water is knee-deep.  It is here that the children splash. </p>

    <p>  All vacationers, including the smallest, can count on a good animation program.  Between tourists, sports are held, live music plays in the evenings and theme nights are arranged.  Of course, it‚Äôs foolish to compare the animation with what you could see in Turkey, but as entertainment and a cure for boredom - it‚Äôs quite good. </p><p>  For an additional fee on the territory of the hotel Aronia Beach 4 * (Ex. Delta Beach 4 *), you can rent sports equipment, as well as water activities. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Aronia Beach 4 * (Sunny Beach) has a good infrastructure.  On its territory there is an excellent sports complex with a gym and a room for individual and group training, a sauna, a bath and a massage room.  This is a full-fledged spa area, which is popular with many vacationers.  Her visit is made at an additional cost. </p>

    <p>  In Bulgaria, many tourists rent a car - a great opportunity to get to know the resort better and appreciate all its most famous and interesting places.  So, all vacationers will be able to use the free parking at the hotel, however, the number of places is limited. </p><p>  Each wing has an elevator that all guests can use.  But, unfortunately, quite often there are interruptions in his work, so some tourists may not be able to take advantage of them during their entire vacation. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  All vacationers of the Aronia Beach 4 * Standard hotel (Sunny Beach) or rooms of any other category can count on food in the hotel restaurant.  The restaurant is spacious, even has an outdoor terrace.  But many tourists complain about the disgusting work of the air conditioner, the aromas of culinary masterpieces come from the kitchen, you have to open the windows, which also does not always save the situation.  Moreover, many dishes, especially hot ones, are cooked by tourists on hot plates, which makes the air in the room even more choking. </p>

    <p>  That is why it is better to come for lunch, breakfast or dinner early and try to take a free spot on the terrace.  The food is organized according to the buffet system, there is enough food, no one will be left hungry.  This is the same case when you can absolutely safely acquire accommodation in a hotel with meals.  The staff works perfectly: tables are immediately cleaned after guests, dishes are replenished, everyone is smiling and quite welcoming. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Just 10-15 minutes from the hotel there is an excellent sandy beach.  This is a paradise for lovers of quality beach holidays: fine clean sand, a wide coastline, gentle entry into the water, a clean warm sea, a small depth even at a considerable distance from the coast.  Observation towers are installed along the coast, where lifeguards work, ensuring safety on the water. </p>
