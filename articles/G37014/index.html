One of them is Piazza Navona (square), known primarily for its <span>original fountains</span> and palaces that were built in the XVII century.  In their reviews, tourists often call it the best area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  How is it interesting for travelers?  We will tell you more in detail in this article. </p><h2>  History of Piazza Navona </h2><p>  The first mention of the development of the future square dates back to the 4th century BC, when sporting events took place in its place.  They were called agons, and it was from them that the piazza subsequently received its current name.  It is known that Julius Caesar ordered the construction of a temporary stadium here, which in 80 AD was significantly rebuilt and expanded by the emperor Domitian.  It accommodated almost 15,000 spectators.  There were running, throwing, fist fights, as well as major celebrations of Roman nobles.  The stadium was decorated with antique works of art, and at the entrance were numerous shops of merchants. </p><p>  After the fall of Rome, the stadium was destroyed.  The arena gradually turned into a square, and the stands began to be built up with residential buildings.  In the XII century, a Catholic church dedicated to the martyr Agnes was erected on the site of an ancient brothel.  In 1477, the city market was moved here, which was located here until the middle of the XIX century.  At all times, carnivals, tournaments, equestrian competitions and holidays were held at the piazza.  Now Navona Square, whose fountains are famous all over the world, has become a favorite place for walks of citizens and tourists.  In late December, fairs are held here for Christmas, where toys and New Year's souvenirs are sold. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to Navona? </h2><p>  Finding Navona will not be difficult, since the square is located in the central part of Rome, surrounded by many attractions.  The city has well-developed public transport, so tourists can get to Piazza by bus.  One ticket is valid for ground routes and the metro for 100 minutes.  You can walk to the square along the promenade from the famous Castel Sant'Angelo in 15 minutes.  The Pantheon is just 500 meters away.  In addition, on the streets of the city there are many signs in English, with which tourists can walk to the piazza on their own. </p><p>  How to get from Termini to Piazza Navona?  This question is asked by many travelers.  Termini is the main station of the city.  Here the 2 largest branches of the <span>Roman metro</span> intersect <span>.</span>  Once at the station of the same name, you must take the red line to the Spagna stop.  From here, you can walk to the square in a few minutes. </p><h2>  Navona (square): main buildings </h2><p>  Modern Navona, which tourists love so much, was built up in the middle of the 17th century, when Baroque was popular in architecture.  Therefore, most of the buildings adjacent to the square are made in this style.  Piazza is a rectangle stretched from south to north, along which are located the palazzo, churches, shops, cafes and museums.  Navona is a promenade square.  There are benches for visitors to relax throughout.  However, the area‚Äôs original fountains brought great popularity to the square.  In the central part of Navona, the majestic Fountain of the four rivers is installed.  It is additionally decorated with a granite obelisk.  At the beginning of the square you can see the Neptune Fountain.  The composition ends with the southern pond of the Moor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Opposite the Fontana of the four rivers is the beautiful church of Sant Agnese in Angone.  Next to it are numerous <span>palaces of Italian</span> nobles and churchmen.  The earliest of them was built at the beginning of the 15th century.  Tourists can also explore the ruins of an ancient Roman stadium.  The <span>Museum of Rome</span> is located on the square <span>,</span> whose expositions tell about the nuances of the medieval life of the city.  In it you can look at old paintings and prints, frescoes and mosaics, the first printed books, furniture, sculptures.  The museum displays real samples of medieval ceramics and clothing.  You can relax after a walk in Navona in cozy cafes, each of which is equipped with an outdoor terrace so that visitors can enjoy beautiful views of the square. </p><h2>  Fountain of the four rivers in Piazza Navona </h2><p>  The main attraction of the square is the Fountain of the Four Rivers.  Its construction was completed in 1651, and Giovanni Bernini, a leading architect and sculptor of his time, was involved in the development of the project.  Innocent X, the then pope, decided to erect an Egyptian obelisk near his family palazzo, created back in ancient Rome.  Bernini, through his patron, presented his father with a fountain project.  He was so impressed by the beauty of creation that he ordered the architect to immediately begin construction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  According to Bernini's idea, the obelisk should be surrounded by sculptures of river gods - the patrons of the great rivers Ganges (Asia), Nile (Africa), Danube (Europe) and La Plata (America).  The figures are surrounded by sculptures symbolizing the flora and fauna of each continent.  Here you can see the vine, tropical flowers, a palm tree, and from animals - a snake, a lion and a dolphin.  Water to the fountain comes from the nearest Aqua Virgo aqueduct.  Every day, local acrobats, magicians, mimes and musicians stage performances near him.  All fountain sculptures are made of white marble.  In winter, shopping malls line up around it. </p><h2>  Moor Fountain </h2><p>  In the south of the square is the fountain of the Moors.  It is not difficult to find the structure, because it is located opposite the Museum of Rome.  Its main part was built in the second half of the 16th century by the architect Giacomo della Porta, commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII.  Four <span>marble statues of</span> newts were installed on the water structure.  The figure of the Moor, which is now considered the central element of the composition, was established a century later, and the well-known Bernini was engaged in its development.  According to his project, initially another triton was supposed to be the final element, but it was replaced by the Moor fighting with the dolphin.  In 1874, the original statue was transferred to the museum, and a similar copy was put in its place.  And not in vain, because in 2011 a passerby climbed into the fountain of the Moor in Navona Square and mutilated the sculpture.  Fortunately, it was quickly restored, returning to its original form. </p>

    <h2>  Neptune Fountain </h2><p>  Navona is an area famous for its fountains.  The northernmost of them is a structure dedicated to the Roman god Neptune.  It is known for certain that its construction was completed in 1574 after the reconstruction of the Aqua Virgo aqueduct.  But then it had a completely different look: the fountain was not decorated with sculptures and was just a round bowl.  The construction performed a practical function, not an aesthetic one, supplying the residents of the city with clean water.  In the XIX century, the fountain decided to radically rebuild.  In 1878, Italian sculptors Gregorio Zappali and Antonio della Bitta erected marble figures above the bowl. </p>

    <p>  In terms of size, the fountain is significantly inferior to its neighbors.  In the center of the composition stands Neptune with a trident in his hands, which is fighting with an octopus.  Around him in a circle are small sculptures of cupid, Nereid, cherub, horse, dolphin and sea monsters. </p><h2>  Palazzo in the square </h2><p>  Navona is an area whose reviews are most often positive.  But she is famous not only for her fountains, but also for the many palazzos in which the Roman nobility once lived.  Now they host government agencies.  For example, in the palace of Braschi, built in 1792, now houses the Museum of Rome.  A "talking" statue of Paskvin is installed next to him: city residents anonymously post their opinions on the current government.  It was found in 1501, and scientists believe that the sculpture adorned the city back in ancient Rome. </p>

    <p>  Tourists can visit the Palazzo Pamphili, built in 1650, which now houses the Brazilian embassy.  Pay attention to the Palazzo de Cupis, built in 1450. </p><h2>  Church of Sant Agnese in Angone </h2><p>  Another building that attracted the attention of tourists was the church on <span>Piazza Navona in Rome,</span> dedicated to the Catholic martyr Agness.  According to legend, she died in a brothel, which was located on the piazza in Roman times.  The church was built in 1652 on the site of a medieval chapel.  Initially, the project was carried out by the architect Girolamo Rainaldi, but after it was replaced by the famous Francesco Borromini.  Now in the church there are Catholic services that can be visited by faithful tourists.  You can look at her interior every day, except Monday.  The church is open from 9:00 until noon, and then from 15:00 until 19:00. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews of tourists about the square </h2><p>  Piazza Navona impressed tourists with its Baroque architecture, so they write positive reviews.  In their opinion, the square is definitely worth a visit for all travelers who come to Rome.  Navona looks best in the late evening or winter, when the flow of visitors here is significantly reduced.  But not without flaws.  It seems to tourists that the overall picture is greatly spoiled by the malls.  Taking pictures at the fountain is also not easy, because there are always a lot of people here.  Sometimes annoying sellers of souvenirs pester visitors. </p>
