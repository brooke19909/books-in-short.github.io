More than 2/3 of customers prefer mobile applications: Mobile Bank and Sberbank Online.  To perform operations using these services, it is enough to have a Sberbank card and use a smartphone.  The client confirms all operations with codes from SMS from the bank, therefore, in order to avoid unforeseen situations, you need to know how to change the phone number in Sberbank. </p><h2>  Why change the number </h2><p>  All operations in Sberbank performed in remote service channels are protected by SMS passwords, therefore it is not recommended to share information from the phone with third parties.  If this still happened, you must block the card or use another phone. </p><p>  Locking and reissuing a card takes at least 7 days.  It‚Äôs much easier to change the current phone number.  Due to the fact that bank branches are located at every step, you can change the phone number in Sberbank during the day.  Information is transmitted to the technical department instantly, and the change of data takes no more than 24 hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kyivpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to change the phone number in Sberbank" class="if uuid-2955161" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2955161.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to attempted fraud, a credit card-linked number can be replaced simply at the initiative of the client.  For example, if a user has purchased a SIM card with a better tariff plan and wants to change a boring number. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ways to change the number in Sberbank </h2><p>  Not all customers know that there are several ways to change the phone number associated with Sberbank.  This is possible with: </p><ul><li>  visit to the bank office; </li><li>  call to the support service; </li><li>  access to the terminals. </li></ul><p>  The options involve both a complete change of information to a new number, and a temporary blocking of the old binding. </p><h2>  How to change the phone number in Sberbank: instructions </h2><p>  The easiest way to change information is to visit a bank branch.  You should have a passport with you from the documents.  You need to take a plastic card, which requires the binding of a new phone, and a mobile number. </p><p>  The operation to change the number takes no more than 15 minutes: </p><ol><li>  In Sberbank, equipped with an electronic queue, you need to take a ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù coupon and wait until the number ‚Äúlights up‚Äù in one of the operators' windows. </li><li>  After the call, you need to go to the operator, provide a passport, card and phone number to be connected.  It is advisable to name the old number, the binding to which is no longer required. </li><li>  The operator, at the request of the client, can either connect a new phone number, leaving the old information in the company's database, or completely change the binding. </li><li>  After completing the service, the client must sign in 2 copies of the application.  One copy remains with the client, another employee of the bank sends to the archive. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.atlasconcorde.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to change the phone number in sberbank mobile" class="if uuid-2955175" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2955175.jpg"></div><p>  Important information: if you disable the Mobile Bank number, the monthly payment amount will be deducted from the client if payment for the month has not yet been made. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Change of information in the Contact Center </h2><p>  The second way, how to change the data, is connected with contacting the Bank Support Service: </p><ul><li>  Calling the Contact Center is free.  To change the number, you need to call "900" and follow the instructions of the answering machine to go to the right specialist. </li><li>  When you call the number "900" you should have a passport with you - his data will be needed by a specialist to carry out identification. </li><li>  You must also name the code word - a combination of alphabetic and / or digital characters that the client used when opening a bank card account as control information. </li><li>  For operations using a bank card, you should also have this product of the bank with you.  If the card is not at hand, you need to know at least the last 4 digits of the credit card. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.vosizneias.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="change phone number in Sberbank mobile bank" class="if uuid-2955177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2955177.jpg"></div><p>  Instructions on how to change the phone number in Sberbank using the Support Service: </p><ol><li>  Call the number "900". </li><li>  Follow the answering machine command to select the desired section (bank cards, Mobile Bank). </li><li>  Name F. I. O., address, passport details and code word. </li><li>  Indicate which card you want to disconnect from and name the phone number you want to bind. </li></ol><p>  An alternative to a code word in case of loss of information can be a client code.  These are special characters that a subscriber can receive in any Sberbank terminal for contacting the number "900". </p><p>  You can change your mobile phone number in Sberbank and disable it through the Support Service within 24 hours from the moment of contact. </p><h2>  Change of number in the bank terminal </h2><p>  Using terminals and ATMs, a client can connect a new phone number to his card, but he will not be able to completely get rid of the old one. </p><p>  Tip: if the owner of the credit card does not want to pay for the service in the full package of services of the Mobile Bank, he can simply change the tariff plan to an economical one. </p><h2>  How to change the phone number through Sberbank ATM </h2><p>  Instructions for changing the number through an ATM look like this: </p><ul><li>  Insert a card, dial a PIN. </li><li>  Log in to "Information and Services". </li><li>  Click on "Mobile Bank". </li><li>  Choose a package for connection - full or economical tariff. </li><li>  Dial the phone number to bind. </li><li>  Check data.  If everything is correct, click "Confirm". </li><li>  Get a receipt for successful number attachment. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.freedomsphoenix.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to change the phone number in Sberbank" class="if uuid-2955186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2955186.jpg"></div><p>  Changing the phone number in the "Mobile Bank" of Sberbank is completely possible only after disabling the old number.  Otherwise, the client will have to pay for services on two numbers at the same time. </p><p>  If the client has already connected a new number through an ATM, he must call ‚Äú900‚Äù or come to the office to untie the card from the old phone number. </p><h2>  Is it possible to change the link through Sberbank Online? </h2><p>  Contrary to the expectations of millions of users, changing a phone number through the Internet bank in Sberbank is not yet possible.  The restriction is related to the conditions for the safe use of bank cards and Internet services. </p><p>  With full access to the functionality of a bank card via the Internet, the client risks losing all means and data if the information is in the hands of third parties.  The restriction on the connection of the Mobile Bank complicates the chances of fraudsters to steal client data via the Network. </p><div class="photo" data-original="officesnapshots.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to change the phone number through an ATM of Sberbank" class="if uuid-2955180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2955180.jpg"></div><p>  Therefore, credit card holders who have no idea how to change the phone number at Sberbank should not listen to the recommendations of fraudsters offering to conduct this procedure through the Personal Account.  Thus, they are going to connect to the information on accounts and deposits in order to use the clients' money. </p><h2>  How is the new phone number linked </h2><p>  Information on replacing the old number with a new one arrives at the technical department of Sberbank immediately after the customer submits an application.  It doesn‚Äôt matter which way the client chose to connect to the new data. </p><p>  After filling out the application in the bank, the information automatically goes into processing.  The same thing happens as soon as the client clicks the "Confirm" button on the terminal of the company. </p><p>  Sending a request to the Support Service also takes no more than 10 minutes, and after an oral statement on the binding of the new number is accepted, the client receives a notification from "900". </p><h2>  What if the old number could not be disconnected? </h2><p>  In exceptional cases, linking a new phone number and disabling the old one may fail on the first try.  This happens as a result of a technical malfunction or a change in customer data within 24 hours after submitting an application for a change in Mobile Bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bitcoinisle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="You can change the phone number in Sberbank" class="if uuid-2955183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2955183.jpg"></div><p>  If the situation is related to a technical failure, it is recommended to re-bind the new number.  If an error occurs after replacing the data of the card holder, you should contact the bank branch.  Experts will tell you how to change the phone number of Sberbank in this case.  You should have your passport, card and a new mobile phone number with you for reference. </p>
