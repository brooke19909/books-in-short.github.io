    <h2>  Go ahead for vivid impressions </h2><p>  If you want maximum comfort, you should go to Krinitsa or Betta.  There you will find clubs, restaurants, hotels, shops.  There is also beautiful nature and equipped beaches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you are used to relaxing as a savage, welcome to Praskoveevka.  This is the smallest resort of all the listed, and the infrastructure is lame there.  But if you are going for unity with nature, then Praskoveevka is a great place to hide from city noise. </p><p>  The most developed resort of Gelendzhik is Arkhipo-Osipovka.  Here you will find everything that the soul desires.  I especially want to note the park with relict trees and dolmens.  If history lovers fall into your company, you can visit the ruins of the Roman tower. </p><h2>  All to the beach! </h2><p>  When asked where to relax in Gelendzhik, the reviews are contradictory.  After all, everyone goes there for convenient beaches (always with sun loungers) and clear blue sea water. </p><p>  However, the beaches in Gelendzhik are not so simple.  The coastline is as much as 100 km.  Go and figure out where to go.  Moreover, the types of beaches also vary.  In some places, one pebble and cobblestones, and in others already yellowish sand.  And the third ones are completely surprising: pebbles on the shore are adjacent to the sand in the sea. </p><h2>  Gelendzhik Bay </h2><p>  The most controversial reviews about where it is better to relax in Gelendzhik are reviews about the <span>Gelendzhik Bay.</span>  For example, the cleanliness of the sea is not always perfect.  Although it is worth noting that the place is periodically cleaned.  There are many people there.  However, on which city beach you will not find a crowd of vacationers?  It is worth saying that if you move to the edge of the bay or to the beach "Gardens of the Seas", then you will hardly see other tourists. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the place is very safe.  The bay is reliably protected from all kinds of storms, and the water there remains warm much longer.  Why is the beach so popular?  Probably because there are many who want to provide travel services.  Only rental of water equipment several points. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  And another indisputable advantage of the bay is a sandy beach with a neat and safe entry into the water.  Therefore, the question of where you can relax in Gelendzhik disappears by itself. </p><h2>  Choose a resort by the sand </h2><p>  You can also choose a resort by the beach.  For example, Kabardinka is covered with small pebbles mixed with sand, the water there is clean, there are few people, and there is a place for children to splash around. </p><p>  The same can be said about Arkhipo-Osipovka.  Here are just a lot of people there.  However, the beach itself is surprisingly clean.  If you step aside a little, you can find not so crowded places, with excellent parking and all the infrastructure.  Also in the resort area there are several wild beaches for lovers of privacy. </p><p>  But finding an acceptable place in Janhot is quite difficult.  You can find the beach first of all by the crowd of tourists.  But if you want secluded wild places, then you have to try.  Most of the coastline abuts rocks.  They are so steep that going down to the sea can be problematic.  Sometimes the rocks go horizontally into the water, creating small pools with a perfectly smooth bottom. </p><p>  But in Krinitsa there are no problems with the beaches.  On request, where it is better to relax in Gelendzhik, reviews are given the best.  And all because the beaches there are well-groomed, clean, with all the necessary infrastructure. </p>

    <p>  If you go from Krinitsa towards Betta, you can find some cute wild places.  In Betta itself, the beaches are small, and there are not very many.  But nowhere else do you have to worry about having toilets, changing rooms or a shower.  Not far from Betta is a <span>nudist beach.</span>  True, you will have to leave your little things on the rock, and go to it for about half an hour. </p><h2>  And relax, and improve health </h2><p>  Anapa or Gelendzhik: where is better to relax?  Of course, Gelendzhik.  Why?  And there you can spend a vacation and undergo treatment.  Gelendzhik is located on the site of mineral springs.  Therefore, in the region there are about 40 different hospitals and resorts. </p><p>  Baths with a high concentration of iodine are practiced in the area.  Almost every resort offers to go through a similar procedure.  In addition, many resorts are adjacent to extensive pine forests, which also has a positive effect on health. </p><p>  There are not so famous, but no less useful procedures in Gelendzhik.  For example, mud or carbon baths.  Mud is mined nearby on the Taman Peninsula. </p>

    <h2>  Why do I need a sanatorium? </h2><p>  For many modern tourists, the word "sanatorium" is associated with the Soviet Union, prehistoric blankets and cockroaches around.  We dare to assure you that this is in the past.  Today, most resorts provide services at the level of hotels.  Gelendzhik is a big city.  If you want to stay afloat, you need to maintain the level of service at the level.  Therefore, despite the fact that sanatoriums are often surrounded by forests, you can find shops, pools, water parks, restaurants and much more. </p><p>  Not only people suffering from any diseases are sent to the sanatorium.  A week in such a place will improve the well-being of even the most healthy person.  In addition, this is a great way to relax from the urban gas pollution, enjoy the fresh air and the measured pace of life. </p><h2>  Gastronomic tour </h2><p>  Most tourists are often asked where to relax: Gelendzhik or Anapa?  These two major tourist centers are most popular with the modern traveler.  We offer not to torment ourselves with the agony of choice and visit both resorts. </p><p>  If we talk about where to relax in Gelendzhik, then it is impossible to miss the gastronomic attractions of the city.  Be sure to go to the market and try the local berries: dogwood, lingonberries, mulberries, all kinds of currants and blackberries.  Among the fruits, persimmon, cherry plum and figs should be noted.  In the city, these products are expensive.  Frankly, even in some places of Gelendzhik you can spend a lot.  Therefore, talk with the locals and find out where they are packed.  After all, saving is sometimes useful. </p>

    <h2>  Fish and mineral water are the main features of the region </h2><p>  If you are looking for a place to relax in Gelendzhik, head to Kastalskaya Kupel.  There you can go on a real fishing trip, and the caught fish will be prepared in the best traditions of this region. </p><p>  Coming to Gelendzhik and not tasting mineral water is a real crime.  We give preference to local manufacturers - Gelendzhik and Gelendzhik 117.  However, if you are traveling to any mineral spring, be sure to purchase a bottle of water from local stocks. </p><h2>  Water activities and more </h2><p>  If you do not know where to relax in Gelendzhik, then feel free to choose any city beach.  As a rule, there you can always find diving, water skiing, rafting, rental kayaks and boats.  These typical activities always leave a good impression of the rest. </p><p>  We also advise you to try diving.  Feeling better than after a parachute jump.  In addition, there is the opportunity to enjoy outlandish fish and exotic underwater plants. </p><h2>  Both at sea and on land </h2><p>  If you are not very attracted to water, then many excursions are sold in Gelendzhik.  For example, you can take a jeep trip to the mud volcanoes or ride to the nearby resort villages.  Bike tours and horseback riding are very popular with tourists.  The benefit of the many forests around allows you to enjoy nature and go in for sports. </p><p>  A lot of entertainment is provided by Olimp Park.  It is located on the outskirts of the city.  However, it is there that the main city entertainment is concentrated: a cinema, attractions, all kinds of pavilions with exhibitions.  Outdoor enthusiasts will also find something to do.  The park has camping, baths, cable cars, fishing ponds and much more. </p><h2>  Cultural program </h2><p>  If you seriously decided to arrange a cultural holiday and explore all the sights of Gelendzhik, we sympathize with you.  There are so many of them that a month may not be enough to visit everyone. </p><p>  However, pay attention to the most important: dolmens, Adyghe barrows, the famous Parus rock, waterfalls.  Gelendzhik has many museums.  In our opinion, the most interesting is the Old Park complex.  It is located in the village of Kabardinka and talks about the various architectural traditions of different peoples. </p><p>  You can not leave Gelendzhik without visiting his signature entertainment.  At night, cunning locals have parties on the decks of ships. </p><p>  And of course, one cannot fail to mention fishing.  For her you need to go to Kastalskaya Kupel.  All seasoned fishermen go there to quietly enjoy their favorite vacation in the quiet of the juniper grove.  Nearby is a small zoo, which is interesting to visit with children.  Nearby is a real Russian bathhouse. </p><p>  As you can see, finding a place to stay in Gelendzhik is very simple.  This resort place attracts thousands of tourists every year and gives an unforgettable experience to hundreds of travelers. </p>
