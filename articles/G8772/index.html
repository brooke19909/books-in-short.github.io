Holidays on the Black Sea</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the west of the Crimean peninsula there is a very unusual place that will be interesting to see for lovers of the sea and its natural monuments.  This is Bakalskaya Spit - a narrow and long strip of land that goes into the sea for several kilometers.  Getting here is not so simple, since this territory is a zone of a nature reserve.  In the park "Bakalskaya Spit" (Crimea) can get no more than fifty thousand people a year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grocery braid" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1014261.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  From the northwest to the southeast of the peninsula, the Bakalskaya spit stretches.  The map shows that it goes deep into the waters of the <span>Karkinitsky Gulf</span> in the Black Sea.  This strip of land is located between Lake Bakalsky and the bay of the same name.  In the north, it narrows and smoothly passes into Cape Peschany, where there is a lighthouse (now inactive). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spit on the map" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1014258.jpg" width="400"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The length of the spit is about 12 km, 5 km are extended into the Black Sea.  The coastline is gentle.  The highest point is about 1.3 m. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Bakalskaya Spit has the only paved road (of local importance).  It goes from the village of Stereguschiy to the narrowest site in the north. </p><p>  Currently, the spit is gradually narrowing due to hydrological processes: powerful winter storms erode the land of this natural object.  The storms that occurred here in 2005 and 2007 severely damaged the nature and infrastructure of the spit.  Due to the active illegal extraction of sand in the summer of 2013, Peschany Cape turned into a small island gradually destroyed by the waves. </p><h2>  Natural features of the braid </h2><p>  This is truly a unique place.  Bakalskaya Spit (Crimea) is washed from different directions by different currents.  Due to this, the sea can storm on its western shore, and remain calm and warm on the eastern.  Each vacationer has a unique opportunity to choose which sea he wants to swim in. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grocery spit crimea" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1014256.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The local landscapes are especially impressive: on the one hand a huge lake, on the other - the picturesque Karkinitsky Gulf and the Black Sea. </p><h2>  Nature reserve </h2><p>  ‚ÄúBakalskaya Spit‚Äù is a unique nature reserve.  It includes a spit, which gave the name of the complex, the lake of the same name with its healing mud and salt marshes, Karkinitsky Bay, known for its shallow depths and clear waters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grocery braid rest" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1014262.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This territory is a true paradise for everyone who wants to improve their health, relax by the sea, and live away from noisy cities. </p><p>  These scenic spots received the status of a reserve in 2000.  Today, the landscape park covers 1,520 hectares.  Of these, 87 hectares of land and 100 hectares of the aquatic complex are reserved for recreation.  Every summer, tent camps appear here, in which those who want to relax in such an unusual place gather. </p><h2>  Healing mud </h2><p>  Many tourists come to these places not only because of an unusual beach holiday.  People come here because of the healing mud that Lake Bakalsky is famous for.  It is the third largest on the Tarkhankut Peninsula - 7.1 square kilometers.  These are salt water, estuary, brine and mud, which have a healing effect on the human body in various diseases - infertility, joint inflammation, etc. </p><p>  The village of Steregushchiy is the nearest settlement.  Those who want to spend their holidays not in tents, but in more comfortable conditions, can stay here.  In Steregushchiy there are hotels, <span>pensions, recreation centers, a</span> small market and shops.  A little further there are larger resort villages - Razdolnoe and Black Sea.  In them, the standard of living may be higher, but from here it takes longer to get to the spit. </p><p>  This year, the youth educational All-Russian Forum "Tauris" was held here.  Bakalskaya Spit hosted youth from all over the country from July 2 to August 26.  The forum discussed the problems of youth, education, the participation of young people in the political life of the country.  The forum's guests were businessmen, politicians, scientists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tavrida" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1014263.jpg" width="550"></div>
