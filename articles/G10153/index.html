    <h2>  Main advantages </h2><p>  Sosnovka Park in St. Petersburg is a popular local attraction.  In the warm season, it turns into a favorite place for walks among the guests of the city and its residents.  In the northwestern part of the complex is the official shooting range of the Shooting Union of the country.  A small <span>children's park</span> is located in the southeast.  Here are concentrated many slides and trampolines.  Visitors can have a bite to eat at one of the restaurants or cafes located in the territory occupied by Sosnovka Park.  Bicycle and other sports equipment rental is available daily from morning until evening.  Particularly popular is the "Peppy Cow" kiosk.  Here, visitors to the park can enjoy delicious ice cream, without preservatives.  Sosnovka is a park with amazing wooden figures.  They are called "Chansyn."  These carved sculptures are made of pine by Korean craftsmen.  They presented them to the city in honor of its centenary.  Currently, Sosnovka is a park (photo is presented in the article), which is open around the clock. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Historical information </h2><p>  In the XIX century, the surrounding territory of the Forest Institute began to gradually adapt to the suburban area.  A forested area located north of it began to be called Sosnovka.  Summer residents chose this place for secluded walks.  It is known that V. G. Belinsky and I. S. Turgenev often spent time here.  They both had private property in the surrounding area.  V. G. Belinsky had a summer residence on the territory of the current Torez Avenue.  In those days, it was called the Staro-Pargolovskaya road.  At I.S. Turgenev's cottage was on Poklonnaya Gora.  Residents of the central regions of the city considered Sosnovka a wild outskirts.  She had a reputation as a place extremely convenient for dueling.  It was here in the winter of 1840 that Ernest de Barant and M. Yu. Lermontov fought.  Fortunately, no one was hurt.  The duel took place at the intersection of modern Svetlanovsky and Torez avenues.  However, as punishment, Mikhail Yurievich was sent into exile in the Caucasus. </p>

    <h2>  Landscaping and redevelopment </h2><p>  At the end of the 19th century, the territory occupied by the current Sosnovka (park) was acquired by the mayor V. A. Ratkov-Rozhnov.  After his death, the southern part of the district began to be owned by his son - Ananias.  The daughter of the deceased inherited the northern lands.  Ananias seriously engaged in redevelopment of his possessions.  New alleys were cut through.  It was assumed that over time they will turn into the streets of a suburban area.  The southern alley was called Ananyevskaya.  Currently, this place is <span>Svetlanovsky Prospekt.</span>  However, Ananias plans were not destined to come true.  He was prevented by military and revolutionary actions in the country.  Alleys located in the southeastern area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe park are a kind of monument to his efforts.  In general, they are similar to the layout of the XX century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Further functioning </h2><p>  Until the 21st century, the northern part of the park belonged to horticulture (the territory of the once existing village of Standard, founded in the 20s of the last century).  For the most part, the settlement was built up by Finnish frame-shield <span>backfill houses.</span>  A bit later, <span>sports facilities</span> appeared here, including a motorcycle track.  However, part of the land continued to be owned by gardening.  After the liquidation of the latter, construction of <span>residential complexes began.</span> </p><h2>  Functioning during the Second World War </h2><p>  During the Second World War there was a military airfield.  It was the home base of the 44th Fighter Aviation Regiment.  In 1941, a runway was built here.  A monument has been erected in the northeast of the former airfield.  Next to it is the preserved memorial cemetery, where the pilots found their last refuge.  New information on the functioning of the park was obtained several years ago.  It turned out that during the war special school No. 2 was transferred here. She was engaged in the preparation and formation of sabotage units.  It is assumed that they should have remained in the city, in case Leningrad was captured.  There were also trained groups that threw themselves behind enemy lines.  The cadets studied and lived in abandoned houses in the area where Gzhatskaya Street and Nepokorenny Avenue are now located.  This is the southern area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe park.  After the war, it was built up with residential buildings.  The school worked until the 45th year. </p>

    <h2>  Modern realities </h2><p>  In the middle of the 20th century, a forest site was located on the site of the village.  A shooting range of the military-hunting society was created here.  In 2007, the Olympian club began to function in its place.  Later, the development of the Shuvalovo-Ozerki area began.  A large section of the forest was turned into a park.  Later it was renamed.  During development in the Vyborg district, the complex received the status of a forest park.  In 1968, it was renamed the city park Sosnovka.  Currently, the territory boasts a developed network of alleys, paths and roads.  The shooting range occupies a rather large part of it.  The complex has many attractions for visitors of all ages.  Here everyone can find an interesting occupation.  Almost everywhere in the park there are restaurants and cafes.  Guests can enjoy a variety of dishes in them.  On the territory of the complex there is a rental of sports equipment and bicycles, so getting from one part of the park to another will not be difficult. </p>
