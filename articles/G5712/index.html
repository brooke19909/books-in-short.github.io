V.V. Kuybyshev was a pure business executive who spent all his strength not on becoming a favorite of the party and people, but on accelerating industrial growth in the country. </p><p>  On May 25, 1888, Kuybyshev Valerian Vladimirovich was born in Omsk, his nationality is Russian, a prominent party leader of the Soviet state.  For services to the party and the government he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. </p><h2>  Sometimes he pinched </h2>

    <p>  The case for the Stalinist Politburo is almost unique. </p><h2>  Valerian Kuibyshev: the secret of death </h2><p>  Nevertheless, for many years the name of Valerian Vladimirovich Kuybyshev (1888-1935) was completely forgotten.  Surprisingly, even the fact that his sudden death was the result of the targeted actions of a whole collective of conspirators, namely this fact was established by the court in 1938, did not add V.V. Kuybyshev fame. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kremlin funeral </h2><p>  Valerian Kuibyshev died on January 25, 1935, exactly twenty days after the murder of S. M. Kirov.  The employees of the Hall of Columns, having only a little sigh that very often the Kremlin bonzes began to die, prepared a room for a coffin with another high-ranking deceased.  Fortunately, that it was not far to carry.  Kuibyshev Valerian Vladimirovich worked, lived and died in a building adjacent to the House of Unions. </p>

    <p>  His apartment was located here.  It was enough to leave the building of the Council of People's Commissars, turn around the corner to Tverskaya and then again, right, to the arch. </p><h2>  Comrade memory </h2><p>  Numerous obituaries were printed on the pages of the newspaper Pravda and other printed publications of the Soviet Union: from the Politburo, from those with whom Kuybyshev had to work, from the people and the party as a whole. </p><p>  The <span>journalist</span> who remained unknown to anyone wrote: ‚ÄúThe country is bowing its banners over the tomb of Kuybyshev, but the power of our party, the power of the heroic working class and the collective farm peasantry are indestructible.  ‚ÄúLet the enemies not lull themselves to the fact that this great loss will violate our steel struggle for the final victory of communism even for a minute.‚Äù </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Unsullied Party </h2><p>  As follows from archival documents, Valerian Kuybyshev (biography of members of the Politburo confirms this) was not in any list that compromised his party career.  Perhaps that is why in the Stalinist Politburo Kuibyshev was not the primary value.  A day of mourning in honor of his funeral was not announced.  On the night before the party comrades prepared to take him on his last journey, the coffin with the body of Kuybyshev was delivered to the Don crematorium. </p><p>  Again, because of second-rate.  Only those who were among the highest Kremlin rulers were honored to be buried entirely in a coffin, and were not subjected to cremation. </p><p>  Valerian Kuibyshev is buried next to his great friend and associate Sergei Mironovich Kirov.

    <p>  However, the health of Valerian Kuybyshev shook even in the pre-revolutionary years.  Eight arrests, four escapes, exile, including in <span>Turukhansk region.</span>  Permanent hassle.  Living conditions are not resort at all.  Few would be able to endure this without loss of health.  Then the Civil War, in which Kuibyshev proved himself more than worthy.  He was not seen in courtless executions, did not participate in punitive operations, but showed personal courage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Little-known historical facts </h2><p>  V.V. Kuibyshev played an active role in the defense of Astrakhan, showing exceptional courage.  There were rumors that during the bombing of Astrakhan with British airplanes, Valerian Vladimirovich, being deputy commander and member of the Front Military Council, sat down as an arrow in the cockpit and took part in an air battle.  Few Kremlin bonzes, except for the dashing conic Semyon Mikhailovich Budenny, could boast of such a feat.  However, Kuibyshev did not boast, not in his nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kuibyshev Valerian Vladimirovich children" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31754/836946.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Big workaholic </h2><p>  And also, according to the memoirs of his close relatives, he really did not like to complain.  It was extremely rare to hear from him that he was feeling ill.  And it was almost impossible to send Kuibyshev to be treated.  Although by the beginning of the 30s he was already a very sick man.  The medical record says that Kuibyshev had big heart problems.  The diagnosis of angina pectoris, or in the modern medical term angina pectoris. </p><p>  Today, this disease is considered an ailment of overloaded people.  Kuibyshev was a complete workaholic and paid for it in full.  His work as chairman of the Central Control Commission was both responsible and extremely nervous.  Kuibyshev did not shine with health, but legends circulated about his performance.  His working day lasted from dawn to dusk. </p><p>  On weekends, the maximum that he allowed himself was to play volleyball for half an hour, and in the last years of his life - to play chess.  After such a discharge, Valerian Kuibyshev again sat down at his desk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kuibyshev Valerian Vladimirovich nationality" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31754/836949.jpg" width="255"></div>

    <h2>  How did V.V. Kuybyshev die? </h2><p>  On the morning of January 25, he held a series of meetings.  After that, Kuibyshev went to his apartment in order to regain some strength before the evening meeting of the Council of People's Commissars.  He was met by a housekeeper, who, seeing a pale Valerian Vladimirovich, offered to call a doctor.  Kuibyshev refused this and went to his room to lie down.  However, the woman called a doctor from the medical department of the Kremlin.  When the doctors entered Kuybyshev‚Äôs apartment, the owner was already dead. </p><h2>  The newspaper "Pravda" reports </h2><p>  The autopsy was performed by the chief Kremlin pathologist, Professor A. I. Abrikosov.  The conclusion set out by him in a medical report published on the pages of the newspaper Pravda was quite predictable: ‚ÄúThe death of comrade VV Kuybyshev occurred as a result of clogging of the coronary artery of the heart with a blood clot, a thrombus formed as a result of pronounced general arteriosclerosis, which struck especially coronary arteries of the heart. " </p><h2>  Unverified Version </h2><p>  Valerian Kuybyshev was exhausted, he was seriously ill.  Shortly before his death, while on a business trip to <span>Central Asia,</span> he caught a severe <span>follicular tonsillitis.</span>  A huge abscess formed in the throat of V. Kuibyshev.  Everything was serious to such an extent that he had to lie down on the operating table.  Without recuperation, in completely broken condition, he returned to Moscow, and instead of going to the hospital, he went to work. </p>

    <h2>  Kuibyshev Valerian Vladimirovich: a brief biography of personal life </h2><p>  It is known that Valerian Kuibyshev was married four times.  The first companion of his life was Praskovya Afanasyevna Styazhkina, a revolutionary and one-party friend of her husband.  They met in the village of Tutury in the Irkutsk province, where both were in exile.  Their marriage did not last long.  The second wife of the chairman of the Samara Provincial Committee of the RSDLP V.V. Kuybyshev was the secretary Evgenia Solomonovna Kogan.  However, officially the marriage was not registered, however, as with the first wife Praskovia.  The third wife of Valerian Kuybyshev is Galina Aleksandrovna Troyanovskaya, the daughter of a Soviet diplomat and the first ambassador of the USSR to the United States. </p><p>  The fourth marriage, and officially registered, was with Olga Andreevna Lezhava.  Their union lasted seven years, until the death of Kuibyshev.  The last wife in 1966 published a biography of Valerian Vladimirovich Kuybyshev, in which she wrote about his great musical talent, about his love for Russian classical poets (Pushkin, Lermontov, Nekrasov), as well as poems by Kuibyshev Valerian Vladimirovich were published.  His children Vladimir and Galina were from different wives.  The son was born in 1917 in the Samara prison, where Praskovya Styazhkina was after arrest, who fled after her husband.  Daughter Galina was born in 1919 from the second wife Eugenia Kogan.  Until the last days of his life, Valerian Kuibyshev spent all his free time with his children and Olga Andreevna Lezhava. </p><h2>  In memory of the great toiler </h2><p>  To perpetuate the memory of Kuybyshev, many cities, railway, canal, plants and factories, collective farms, theaters and higher educational institutions, and streets of the Soviet Union were named after him. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Valerian Kuibyshev" class="if" height="211" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31754/836948.jpg" width="600"></div>  The most beautiful city in Russia - Samara, for a very long time bore the name of Kuybyshev.
