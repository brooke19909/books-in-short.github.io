A trip to Israel should be a real adventure for those who have just read about this country, but always dreamed of visiting it. </p><p>  Israeli vacation spots </p><p>  Israeli resorts are never monotonous or boring.  Even if you plan to spend your entire vacation on the Dead Sea, rising from the <span>sunny beach</span> only to plunge into the transparent magic waves, anyway, sooner or later, you will want more.  In Israel, any rest is associated with treatment and recovery, but - this is the beauty of the sea and its microclimate - all these procedures go naturally, without the effort or expense of extra time. </p><p>  Only here you can feel what is truly clean and healthy air, saturated with oxygen and characterized by low humidity.  This climate is very useful for those who suffer from various forms of allergies or asthma.  In general, on the shores of the <span>Dead Sea, the</span> body receives all the substances necessary for healing and strengthening, and relaxing massages and cosmetic procedures can offer this effect, a wide selection of which is offered by almost all hotels in Israel. </p><p>  Staying in any of them, tourists will have access to a wide variety of pleasures - <span>mud wraps</span> and procedures with the addition of various aromatic oils and plant extracts.  The greatest number of such procedures is performed in the cosmetic rooms of the Royal Hotel 5 * Deluxe hotel, located in the Israeli tourist center Ein Bokek.  At this place, tourists will find spacious rooms and a marvelous view from the windows on any floor, showing an unusual panorama of the coast.  The hotel provides everything that a guest needs - cosmetics and bathrobes, bathrooms and saunas, swimming pools and solariums, as well as a clean private beach and a modern spa complex.  Of the shortcomings of the hotel can only be called the fact that every year it opens the door for hundreds of tourists from around the globe, so you will have to take care of booking rooms in advance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Popular among tourists enjoy such hotels in Israel as "Crowne Plaza 5 *" and "Daniel 5 *".  The first is prestigious, which guarantees the constant presence on the territory of many famous guests, favorably located on the shores of the Dead Sea, but quite expensive.  Many people can‚Äôt afford it because of popularity among celebrities, but if you have enough money, Crowne Plaza 5 * has an excellent pool system that simulates the movement of the surf and waves.  In addition, massage rooms, gyms, baths, a jacuzzi and saunas are provided here.  Hotel "Daniel 5 *" - a new and ultra-modern - has an unusual atmosphere.  In it you can find all the conditions for an excellent wellness stay: pools with fresh or mineral water, spa pools with Dead Sea waters, saunas and baths, beauty salons, massage and beauty parlors, as well as gyms with exercise machines and various restaurants.  The advantage of this hotel is its rich selection of spa treatments, including mud treatments, oil wraps, mineral and <span>salt baths.</span> </p><p>  Many hotels in Israel, such as "Le Meridian 5 *" or "Leonardo Plaza 5 *", offer their visitors wonderful opportunities for healing the body and doing sports. These modern hotels have sports clubs, gyms, <span>swimming pools</span> and tennis courts. spa treatments, massage rooms and a variety of restaurants and cafes. </p><p>  For family vacations, the Isrotel Dead Sea Hotel 5 * hotel, formerly called Caesar 5 *, which location allows you to literally be on the shore of one of the bays of the Dead Sea in just a minute, is perfect.  In addition to attending numerous beauty and wellness treatments, guests at this hotel can relax with their children in special spa centers, cafes, pools and health clubs.  But you have to forget about your own vacation - some guests consider the lack of a minibar in rooms and nightly entertainment facilities to be the main drawback of the hotel. </p><p>  All hotels in Israel offer a fairly standard set of services and procedures, but staying in each of them will become unique, as this whole country is unusual, capable of impressing its guests with something original and interesting each time. </p>
