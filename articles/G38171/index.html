Relative cheapness (the cost of trips is lower only to Egypt), a high level of service and many hotels with all-inclusive services make this country very popular for beach vacations.  But lovers of excursions will also find in Turkey opportunities to get acquainted with the interesting history, natural and cultural attractions of this region.  The country is washed by four seas - Black, Marmara, Aegean and Mediterranean.  The last water area is the warmest.  The tourist coast of Turkey on the tourist slang is divided into Riviera.  They, like "Cote d'Azur" in France or Costa Moresme in Spain, have their own names - Anatolian, Alanian and so on.  This article is dedicated to the hotel Akin Paradise <span>Hotel Alanya 4 *.</span>  Judging by the name, it is located on the coast of Alanya.  Previously, until the end of 2011, the hotel was named Grand Paradise.  And to get acquainted with older reviews of tourists, you need to look for exactly this name.  The hotel proudly carries four stars on its sign.  And those who have already rested in it give him a rating of 4 with a plus and are even perplexed as to why he is worse than the untwisted ‚Äúfives‚Äù in the neighborhood.  Unless there are porters in the livery that opens the doors to the restaurant before you ... But is it worth it to pay so dearly? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akin paradise hotel 4" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/704997.jpg" width="302"></div>

However, the high star rating of a hotel is not always a guarantee of excellent service.  Very often, luxury hotels with luxury services have four stars only because they are not located on the first line, but, for example, across the road from the beach.  In defense of the 5 * class Alanya hotels, we can say that they offer lower prices for accommodation than in Turkey as a whole.  Of the hotels in this category, Pegasos Royal Resort and Beach Club Doganay have received a lot of praise from tourists.  But the vast majority of hotels on the Alanya Riviera are the ‚Äúfours‚Äù and budgetary ‚Äúthree rubles‚Äù.  Although even in the latter there is a whole range of services necessary for a full and full beach holiday.  The rooms have air conditioning so much needed in a hot climate, satellite TV.  The territory of the 3 * class hotels is small, but it sometimes accommodates several pools.  Safe underpasses lead to the sea, and there are many different services on the territory.  Tourists speak favorably of such "treshki" as Alaiye Kleopatra and <span>Eftalia Aytur Hotel.</span>  The "fours" in Alanya, to which the Akin Paradise Hotel 4 * hotel belongs, are the golden mean between the luxury of "sophisticated" five-star hotels and the cheapness of budget housing.  In their rooms, as a rule, there are such pleasant household things as a minibar, a mirror with a magnifying effect, slippers and Wi-Fi right in the room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel akin paradise hotel 4" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/704999.jpg" width="440"></div>

This means mild and very rainy winters and hot, dry summers.  Almost an annual rainfall pours on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey from November to March.  Since April, rain has become a rare guest.  But the coast of Alanya is unique in terms of climate.  The fact is that from the north it is reliably protected from the cold winds by the Taurus Mountains.  The calm sea in this region warms up quickly, and cools very slowly.  Thanks to this, the longest swimming season is here: from late April to mid November.  Although those healthy people for whom + 18 degrees seem like a comfortable temperature can plunge into the waters of the Mediterranean Sea in December and even in January.  So the rest in Alanya can be called year-round.  The peak season is traditionally in the summer months and September.  But at this time, the cost of a trip to Turkey increases.  If you want to save, it is better to choose the second half of spring for a trip.  May is especially comfortable for relaxation.  Alanya, unlike neighboring Kemer and Antalya, is the first to enter the summer.  During the day, real heat reigns here, and the nights are still fresh, not stuffy.  Cheap vouchers (this does not apply to the period of holidays in the first decade of the month), excellent shopping, a lot of various excursions - this is what Turkey in May.  Alanya, in addition to this, offers a full summer beach holiday.  In the second half of the month, the water temperature off the coast of the resort reaches + 23-24 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  Alanya </h2><p>  This city arose in the second century BC.  Its rich history has left its mark in the ancient fortress city on the cliff and many mosques.  Antique Korakesion and medieval Alaya towered on a high peninsula that stands out to sea.  This strategically important point was of considerable importance during the Ptolemaic era (Hellenistic period), the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman empires.  But Alanya experienced the greatest flowering in the Middle Ages.  It was then that the city was surrounded by a double row of walls, since a citadel castle was erected at the very top of the rocky cape.  Also at the time of the Seljuks belong the shipyards of Tersane in the grottoes and the Red Tower (Kyzyl-Kul).  Alanya - reviews of tourists do not cease to repeat about it - has many small caves.  One is called Phosphoric because its walls glow from the presence of this mineral in rock, the other is called Lovers, and the third, the most famous, is Damlatash.  There is also the "Pirate Cave", but it can be accessed only from the sea, by boat.  Other attractions worth noting are the 1230 mausoleum of Aksebe Turbesi and the Aladdin Keikubat I Mosque. Since the beginning of the 60s of the last century, the city gradually began to transform into a seaside resort.  There were beautiful embankments, boardwalks, arose chic and budget hotels.  Alanya was surrounded by satellite villages.  These are Konakli, Inzekum, Avsallar, Mahmutlar and Okurcalar.  The last of them is located Akin Paradise Hotel 4 *. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akin paradise hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/705002.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to get to Alanya </h2><p>  This large resort town is located one hundred and forty kilometers from the provincial capital - Antalya.  Most tourists arrive there.  Travel time by bus from Antalya Airport to Alanya is about one and a half hours.  But first, an independent tourist needs to get to the capital's bus station and buy a ticket (about five euros).  The station where cars arrive is located three kilometers from the center of Alanya.  Vouchers usually include the cost of transfer from the airport to the hotel, so organized tourists have nothing to worry about.  But Russians traveling on their own leave a lot of advice on the forums on how best to get to a vacation spot.  If you decide to soak up the sights of Istanbul before basking in the Anatolian Riviera, fly to Gazipasha Airport.  From there to Alanya go only half an hour.  You can arrive by bus from Adana (10 hours, 12 –Ñ) and Konya (six and a half hours, 10 –Ñ).  From the port of Alanya you can go to Northern Cyprus, to Kyrenia.  The cost of the ferry ticket is 32 –Ñ.  It must be purchased no later than the day before the trip.  City buses tirelessly run around the city itself and to all satellite villages.  They are called "dolmushi".  There is such a minibus in Okurcalar, where the Akin Paradise Hotel 4 * is located.  The fare in it is 3-8 <span>Turkish liras</span> (depending on the distance). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Akin paradise hotel 4 alanya" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/705009.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Okurcalar </h2><p>  Alanya stands out from other resorts of the Anatolian Riviera with its wonderful sandy beaches and amazingly mild and warm climate.  The sun, the sea and the ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù - is that why Turkey is attracting Russian tourists?  4 * Akin Paradise offers all this in abundance.  If they say that in Alanya the longest swimming season, then in Okurcalar it is even longer.  In May, on the coast there you can already allow kids to splash around.  Okurcalar is a relatively young, but rapidly developing resort village.  So far, he is positioning himself as a place for a relaxing family vacation away from the city bustle.  This is the most remote village to the west of the Alanya Riviera.  It is thirty-two kilometers from the main city.  In the neighborhood are located the same quiet resorts as Incekum and Avsallar.  However, do not think that for two weeks you will be bored among Western European pensioners.  In fifteen to twenty minutes, dolmush will take you to the center of Alanya.  Those who cannot live a day without shopping can also not worry: there are many shops here, and Tuesdays and Fridays are fair days.  Akin Paradise Hotel 4 * hotel is actually located on the beach.  But in Alanya and the nearest satellite villages, the coast is separated from the housing by the highway, and with heavy traffic.  Only in Okurcalar tourists can experience all the amenities of a hotel on the first line. </p><h2>  Alanya beaches </h2><p>  Without exception, tourists praise the coast of the local Riviera.  It stretches out to an almost perfect horseshoe and is cut by small capes into small cozy bays.  The gently sloping sandy bottom and very calm sea make this place ideal for relaxing with small children.  No dangerous waves, no sharp rocks, no corals.  Creamy, like sugar, sand, kids will consider the best building material for the construction of castles.  But in Okurcalar, where the Akin Paradise Hotel 4 * hotel is located, pebbles are already found.  The beaches of Alanya stretch for three kilometers to the west and eight kilometers to the east.  They share the Old City - Ich-Kale.  To the west of the fortress lies the famous ‚ÄúCleopatra's Beach‚Äù known throughout Turkey.  It is believed that the Egyptian queen took sea baths here.  Alanya Riviera has about twenty beaches.  But the most popular is not even Cleopatra, but Incekum.  This is a continuous one and a half kilometer strip of sand.  And what about the coast where Akin Paradise Hotel 4 * stands?  Reviews call it the beach is not the best in Alanya.  Here, small rolled pebbles peeps in places.  But the sea here is the warmest in Alanya.  The beach infrastructure is medium developed.  You can play volleyball, appear on a banana or a <span>water scooter.</span>  Since this is a hotel beach, there is no need to pay for sun loungers and umbrellas.  And this is a huge plus compared to hotels in Alanya, where they are all separated from the coast by a road.  And those who rested in Kemer, generally can not get enough of the beaches of Okurcalar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alanya tours" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/705018.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  This resort village is 90% hotels.  Basically, these are chic ‚Äúfives‚Äù and solid ‚Äúfours‚Äù.  Walking in their cypress and citrus parks is a pleasure.  Among these hotels there are huge buildings for several hundred rooms, and a series of small bungalows for a secluded holiday.  Akin Paradise Hotel 4 * (Turkey) also boasts a small but well-groomed territory.  In principle, this is a hotel complex consisting of two buildings.  One building is five-, and the second is two-story.  The hotel itself stands far from the highway - therefore, it is very quiet and calm.  But not so far from the stop dolmushey.  To get to Alanya, you need to go five minutes and pay the <span>bus driver</span> three dollars.  By the way, in local dolmushs, American and European currencies are accepted along with lira.  Okrujalar's biggest attraction is the water park.  It is located in the chic five-star Hotel Water Planet Resort and Waterpark.  Guests from other hotels are allowed there for an additional fee.  Also in this hotel are wonderful foamy discos.  Animators from Akin Paradise Hotel 4 * organize trips there, as well as to nightclubs in Alanya. </p><h2>  The cost of tickets to "Akin Paradise 4 *" </h2><p>  What else attracts tourists to the satellite village of Alanya Okurcalar is very affordable prices.  Why is it so on the "warmest coast of Turkey"?  Everything is explained very simply.  Alanya is considered a lower class resort than the untwisted capital of the province of Antalya.  There is less urban entertainment.  At the same time, it is a developing resort.  In order to earn a name for themselves in the hotel market, new hotels deliberately make very low prices for a season or two, so that tourists ‚Äútry out‚Äù the products.  Maybe they will come here again when prices become slightly higher?  Okurcalar is just one of these resorts.  For most of the entertainment you will have to go to Alanya.  But for those who came to simply sunbathe and swim in the warm Mediterranean Sea, without really going into details of local exotics and attractions, a village thirty kilometers from the city will be just what you need.  The cost of a trip to Turkey can not be called budget.  It is still not Egypt.  But there are places where a week of relaxation for two (along with a flight, a transfer and ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù) will cost forty thousand rubles.  In higher class hotels, tours, respectively, will cost more.  But comfort is worth it.  If you want to reduce the cost of the trip, look for a discount at travel agencies.  Many last minute packages are attractive for their low price.  So, the single number (per person) at Akin Paradise in Okurcalar can cost five hundred and fifty US dollars per week. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alanya tourist reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/705024.jpg" width="500"></div>

The available food at Akin Paradise Hotel 4 * reviews are whole odes.  Although breakfasts do not seem to sparkle with variety, there are pancakes, scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs, potatoes, many vegetables, fruits and matchless Turkish desserts.  Almost every review mentions a grandmother who bakes gozleme for guests all morning.

    <h2>  Hotel reviews and recommendations </h2><p>  Experienced travelers, who have something to compare with, say that this hotel even exceeded their expectations.  For the Quartet, the equipment of the rooms, the services on site and especially the food were simply amazing.  Those who rested in five-star hotels (including Turkey, Kemer) claim that the Akin Paradise is no worse, except that the territory of the hotel is small.  At the same time, tourists note that Alanya is very favorably different from other resorts of the Anatolian coast in terms of prices.  This allows not only to go on many excursions, but also to stuff a suitcase with souvenirs, new clothes and shoes. </p><p>  Prices in Alanya are very, very affordable.  For example, the Eye of Fatima (a souvenir amulet favorite by tourists) will cost you two or three dollars, magnets - even less.  Turkey has very high quality textiles.  T-shirts cost from five dollars, and terry robes - from ten.  Reviews urge to abandon the purchase of hookahs.  Firstly, they are souvenir (that is, not functional), and secondly, difficulties arise when transporting them on an airplane.  It is better to bring home "Kurukachev Mehmet Effendi" coffee (two dollars) and the famous Turkish sweets - halva, Turkish delight.  As for excursions, tourists are advised to book them not at the hotel.  It is enough to leave the hotel, turn right and walk five minutes, as you will see the local travel agency.  Their prices are lower, and the choice of excursions is wider.  Moreover, the attitude towards you will be no worse than that of hotel tour operators.  And the proximity to the city encourages independent excursions.  Before this, it is not so difficult to do.  To get acquainted with the sights of Alanya, you just need to get to the city by dolmush (fortunately, a minibus stop is very close to the hotel), and at the terminal, in the center, change to bus number four.  The entrance to the Alanya fortress with its museum costs fifteen lire.  Going down, you can see the remains of ancient Christian temples and even Roman gates. </p>
