Particularly interesting will be the Bulgarian resorts for families with children of preschool children and primary school children.  There are a lot of fun, but safe entertainment: playgrounds with classic swings and carousels, "paddling pools" in modern water parks.  Older children will be delighted with riding bananas, sports games and attractions, children's discos and clubs.  It seems to be nothing unusual, but rarely children remain dissatisfied with such a program.

    <p>  What are the other attractive <span>resorts in Bulgaria</span> for families with children?  The fact that many parents are willing to pay a lot of money for, but here they have it completely free of charge - this is security.  As a rule, all the resort towns of this country are relatively small in area and population, pedestrian zones are really pedestrian zones, you can move around it completely safely, there is no roadway as such near them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Bulgaria with a child" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11116/232195.jpg" width="472"></div>  In addition, the Bulgarian resorts for families with children are also suitable because they are very rich in parks, squares and kindergartens, where there are many playgrounds with swings and attractions.  There are also summer cafes where adults can relax and at the same time watch their offspring playing nearby.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is difficult to decide where it is better to spend a <span>vacation in Bulgaria</span> with a child, in a boarding house or in the private sector.  Both that and other option has the advantages first of all for adults.  If living in a boarding house provides for three meals a day, which is so necessary for any child, and adults can take a break from constant cooking, then staying in the private sector means being constantly concerned about what and where to eat, but you can save a lot of money.  Each family decides this question in its own way.  But it should be noted that the boarding houses in Bulgaria have very affordable prices, including food. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best resorts for families with children" class="if" height="228" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11116/232191.jpg" width="320"></div>  Saving in favor of the private sector may not be justifiable.  Speaking of nutrition.  It is believed that the <span>best resorts</span> for families with children are in Bulgaria, because there is a huge variety of fruits and vegetables at very affordable prices.  And traditional Bulgarian sour-milk products will benefit not only children, but also adults.  In addition, most local restaurants and cafes have a special children's menu.  Don‚Äôt worry about baby food!

    <p>  If you still decide to rent an apartment or part of the house with the owners, be calm, because your children will like the hospitable owners.  Bulgarians are generally very welcoming people, as a rule, they are not at all confused by guests with noisy and restless offspring.  Usually private houses in which guest rooms are rented have children's pools and swings in their courtyards so that children can frolic in plenty. </p>
