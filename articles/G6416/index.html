Literally, it means "Dead Sea."  Locals can tell an <span>interesting legend</span> related to the name of the bay.  Even in distant times, ships came to the shores of this city, which replenished fresh water and went on a journey again.  And one fine day the son of one of the captains went ashore, there he saw a beautiful girl.  The beauty bore the name Belchegiz.  Since then, she has been waiting for a new meeting with her lover. </p><p>  One of these days, a storm broke out at sea, a strong wind blew and waves appeared.  The young man suggested that the captain moor to a quiet bay.  But the attentive father thought that the young guy only wants to see his beloved girl.  Thus, the request was not heard, and the captain continued sailing.  Such thoughts very angered him, because he decided that his son does not care at all about the fate of the ship.  It got to the point that the father stabbed his son, the young man was overboard.  Due to high waves, he could not be saved.  In the end, the father was in a quiet bay and realized that in fact the son was right, and he should listen to him.  After the girl found out about the death of a loved one, she could not bear this pain and rushed off a cliff.  Places where the young drowned were named after them.  Such an interesting and touching story goes about these places, and the locals tell it with great pleasure. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2>

    <p>  Tourism in these places was founded in the 60s.  The history of this city goes into the distant past and has more than five thousand years.  According to historical sources, its foundation was associated with the Lycian state.  Initially, there were about 70 cities, but after certain events only 23 survived. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As early as the 1st century BC, Oludeniz was a small autonomous state that was part of the Roman Empire.  And already in the year 43, one of the emperors founded a small provincial town here, where only the elite could rest.  Over the years, it has developed. </p><p>  At the moment, near Oludeniz is one of the famous paths, which is called the "Lycian Trail".  It is she who is among the ten longest routes.  Its length is 509 kilometers.  The track has a rich infrastructure.  Each tourist will be incredibly interesting to go this way. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  If you like to rest in comfort, surrounded by beautiful nature, cozy houses and the gentle sun, you should definitely book a tour to Fethiye or Oludeniz.  Most southern cities have one peculiarity: active life here begins only in the tourist arrival season.  There are few houses here, and all the free space was occupied by chic hotels and resorts.  Placements attract travelers even with their appearance.  Here they resemble small houses that have no more than 3 floors.  All these buildings are drowning in greenery and flowers, it looks incredibly beautiful.  It is interesting that all hotels work only in season, at other times they are closed.  Therefore, in this situation, tourists should be very careful.  Visiting Oludeniz out of season, you can simply be left without housing, so everything needs to be well thought out.  There are only three main streets in the village, so it is almost impossible to get lost here.  So, let's look at the infrastructure in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Streets of Oludeniz </h2>
