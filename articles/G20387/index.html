How many hearts she won, how many legends go about her!  Fairytale corner of amazing nature, which could not spoil the man.  Elite resorts in the Soviet years after the armed conflict with Georgia fell into decay.  But, finally, the Land of Souls again occupies a worthy place in the tourist routes.  Vacation with children in Abkhazia is becoming popular again.  And this is not surprising.  Where, if not here, you can enjoy the amazing climate, marvel at the wonders of the magical nature, enjoy breathtakingly clean air, plunge into the mysterious history and get rid of the burden of daily problems? </p>

    <h2>  Soul Country </h2><p>  In the south-eastern part of the Black Sea coast, in the north-west of the majestic Caucasus, Abkhazia is located.  Rest for children here is good because its resorts are ideal in terms of healing effects on a fragile body.  It would seem that the Black Sea resorts of the Russian south are very close by.  But the difference between these two corners of the planet is huge.  A completely different nature, a different climate, an absolutely unique atmosphere.  Each city of this amazing country is good in its own way and absolutely not like the others - bright youth Gagra, warm religious New Athos, quiet and cozy Pitsunda, ancient Sukhum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Pitsunda is an ideal place for family holidays </h2><p>  Perhaps the most successful holiday with children in Abkhazia will be in Pitsunda.  After all, it is so important for babies to be useful.  More precisely, it is important for parents.  And it is here that this condition is met as well as possible.  In this resort there is a whole grove where a relic tree grows - Pitsunda pine.  The age of some giants is approaching 500 years.  And next - a boxwood array with its giants up to 12 meters high, which, by the way, have also exchanged a couple of centuries.  Is it any wonder that the air in this place is truly healing? </p><p>  And the guys need the sea.  And the most suitable place that Abkhazia can offer is Pitsunda.  Rest with children here will be calm and measured.  The sea at this resort is considered the cleanest on the coast.  The resort is located on the shore of the bay, and therefore there are no storms, and the waves are small and gentle, just right for the first acquaintance with the sea.  The climate in Pitsunda is mild.  Even in the hot summer season it‚Äôs not stuffy, and winters are warm and welcoming. </p>

    <h2>  Touch the ancient origins </h2><p>  Holidays with children in Abkhazia should be diversified with interesting excursions.  There are also many opportunities for this in Pitsunda.  The grove of Pitsunda pine has already been mentioned.  A walk along it will be very exciting even for restless children, if you make it on horseback.  It will be interesting for both children and their parents to plunge into the secrets of history and touch the life of the peoples living in Abkhazia.  To do this, it is worth visiting the Khetsuriani museum complex, where you can not only get acquainted with ethnographic household items, tools, but also live a bit in the atmosphere of ancient Abkhazia.  And if this is not enough, go to the ruins of the ancient city of Pitiunt.  It was this locality that became the ancestor of today's Pitsunda.  A journey through the ruins, which are about two millennia, is not the dream of the most restless little boy?  And then you should go to <span>Pitsunda temple.</span>  In addition to the religious building, it is also a historical monument, originally designed as a defensive structure.  And why not continue your acquaintance with the amazing region during the equally amazing fishing on Lake Inquit, once a former part of the sea?  There is still a legend that once upon a time there was a Greek temple on the shore of this lake, which once went under water.  Desperate tourists from time to time dive with scuba gear, find ancient artifacts.  Fish obtained by fishing rods will be prepared for you by the cooks of the cafe located here.  And if you are not lucky with the catch, then these same chefs will please you with traditional Abkhaz dishes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  New Athos - an ancient fairy tale </h2><p>  In fairness, it is worth noting that when planning a vacation with children in Abkhazia, it is worth paying attention to such a place as New Athos.  It will be especially interesting for students who are passionate about history.  On a small area there is a huge number of antiquities left by many peoples who have lived here for centuries.  The most impressive, of course, is the ancient Anacopia on <span>Iversky Mountain.</span>  Even after centuries, these ruins make reverence for the skill of the builders of those times.  And literally under your feet is the entrance to the fairy tale.  New Athos cave.  She has been known to people for only some fifty years, although her age is approaching two million.  Mysterious and magnificent arches, tons of stone overhead ... An unusual and slightly frightening world with underground lakes, nature-created monuments from stalactites and stalagmites, stone waterfalls.  What is not a fairy tale? </p>

    <h2>  Combination of incongruous </h2><p>  Another attraction of this city is the <span>New Athos Monastery.</span>  Of course, a religious building in itself is unlikely to be interesting for children, but the park around it will become a wonderful place for a family vacation.  Citrus fruits, cypresses, oaks, eucalyptus, oleanders, magnolias, hornbeams and beeches coexist in it.  It would seem an impossible combination.  And inside the amazing garden is the real swan lake.  Isn't it magical? </p><p>  Naturally, the sea will not disappoint.  Warm and clear water, sandy bottom, gentle slopes, a small number of vacationers, breakwaters along the entire coastline - all this will make relaxing on the beach carefree and delightful. </p><h2>  Boarding houses in Abkhazia </h2><p>  Amazing and incredible will give you Abkhazia a vacation with children.  Pensions in this region are ready to accept both wealthy vacationers and tourists with a wallet that is not too tight.  It is worth mentioning separately about institutions of this type in Pitsunda.  Once this city was very popular among Soviet citizens.  Especially often, vacationers turned their attention to the resort and health complex, which consists of seven buildings.  Today it represents seven separate boarding houses, united under the name "Pitsunda Resort".  It is around this complex that the whole resort life of Pitsunda revolves. </p><p>  The infrastructure of the country's boarding houses is very extensive: gyms, pools, tennis courts, animators, cinemas and much more.  Of course, you can hardly count on European service here.  But this more than compensates for the friendliness and friendliness of the staff. </p>

    <h2>  Private sector and local hospitality </h2><p>  However, not only in boarding houses Abkhazia can offer rest.  The private sector is also at the service of vacationers.  This area should include small private mini-hotels where you can rent a room or a bed.  Guests, as a rule, no more than ten.  And this means calm and the absence of excess noise during the holidays.  You can also rent a room in a private house during your vacation.  If you are lucky, then you can fully experience all the hospitality of the Caucasian people.  Very often, the hosts even prepare national dishes for their guests and allow them to use the garden, as well as provide a place for a car.  On the other hand, a family with children may well rent an apartment for use and feel free without fear of disturbing their neighbors. </p><h2>  Abkhazia, rest, prices </h2><p>  By the way, rest in the private sector has another advantage - low prices.  So, the minimum cost of rest in a boarding house is from 800 rubles per day for one person.  And this is the price during the off-season.  But you can get a place at the peak of the season in the private sector for 400 rubles per person per day.  You can find anything in the markets.  You just need to know what and where to buy.  For example, in retail outlets near hotels and resorts, prices are designed specifically for tourists and almost twice the cost of similar goods in the central market. </p>
