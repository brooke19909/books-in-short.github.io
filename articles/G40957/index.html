    <h2>  A bit of information in facts and figures </h2><p>  The Finnish metro is the only branch consisting of seventeen stations.  The branch itself is in the shape of the letter Y and is the only one in Finland.  It stretches for twenty kilometers, and you can drive from the starting station to the final one in just twenty-two minutes.  This distance seems to tourists to be insignificant, but during the trip they get an invaluable opportunity to get acquainted with the sights and enjoy the beauties of the city.  This can be done because most Helsinki metro stations are aboveground.  This fact gives trips a special flavor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The maximum speed of subway trains does not exceed eighty kilometers per hour.  However, trains usually move at an average speed of seventy kilometers per hour. </p><p>  Helsinki metro opened in early August of the eighty-second year of the last century and is still considered unfinished.  Periodically, the company responsible for its operation resumes construction work on the creation of two new branches.  They should connect the capital with the suburbs and cover most of the city. </p><h2>  From the history of the subway </h2><p>  The city administration thought about building its own metro in the middle of the last century.  It was at this time that the idea began to be supplemented by various calculations and schemes.  The Finns took about eight years to develop the project.  It provided for several branches eighty kilometers long.  There were one hundred and eight stations along the way.  However, it was not possible to bring this project to life.  It turned out to be too large and expensive to execute.  For some reason, it was decided to begin the construction of one metro line and six stations. </p><p>  It took another six years to prepare for the construction, and in May of the sixty-ninth year, workers began the first stage of construction.  This process was not without problems and incidents.  The fact is that the project budget was partially stolen.  Therefore, it took thirteen years from the moment the first tunnel was laid to the start of the first train. </p><p>  Over the following years, another eleven stations were built, with only eight of them being underground and hollowed directly into the rock. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Motion pattern </h2><p>  While traveling on the Helsinki metro, it‚Äôs quite difficult to get lost; tourists don‚Äôt even need a scheme - everything here is arranged very simply and clearly. </p><p>  A straight stretch of the Ruoholahti-It√§keskus road to the fork can be reached on average in ten to thirteen minutes.  Trains run in this direction every five minutes.  The trains are never filled to capacity.  Even at rush hour, there are always empty seats. </p><p>  At the fork, the train leaves for either the northern or eastern part of the city.  In the first case, you can get to the terminal station ‚ÄúMellunmyaki‚Äù, in the second you will find yourself in five minutes on the way to ‚ÄúVuosaari‚Äù. Keep in mind that the trains run at the fork with a large traffic interval.  Usually it is about eight minutes.  Very rarely, the wait is delayed for ten minutes. </p><h2>  Subway mode </h2><p>  Metro is the most popular transport in the city.  Therefore, the operating mode of the metro is adjusted to the life schedule of most residents of the capital.  Train traffic starts at five thirty in the morning and ends at eleven in the evening.  On weekends and holidays, work is extended for another thirty minutes. </p>

    <h2>  Convenience and functionality </h2><p>  Helsinki Metro is not very convenient, but it is equipped with everything that should be on such transport hubs.  Each station has escalators, some equipped with elevators.  They run diagonally and are very popular with people with disabilities.  If desired, ordinary passengers can use them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The stations are devoid of turnstiles, which avoids crowds at peak hours.  To control the passenger flow, there is a group of metro workers, they also check tickets and issue a fine to ‚Äúrabbits‚Äù.  Keep in mind that checking is extremely rare, but you should not risk it - fare-free travel will cost at least eighty euros. </p><p>  Tourists note that the subway is quite safe.  Here you will not find criminal elements and persons with low social status.  But the guidebooks advise to keep the bag closer to the body, because cases of theft in the subway, despite the efforts of the authorities, periodically take place. </p>

    <h2>  Helsinki Metro: rolling stock </h2><p>  It is noteworthy that all subway trains are identical to those that run on suburban railway routes.  Therefore, the gauge and the voltage are the same. </p><p>  Finns use two types of compounds: </p><ul><li>  M100.  This type of train has been in operation since the opening of the subway.  They correspond to the climatic features of the country and allow you to form a composition that is a multiple of two.  The average train capacity is four hundred people.  Currently in operation are forty-two trains of this model. </li><li>  M200.  In the early 2000s, a new type of composition was released.  It has three doors and passages, allowing you to switch from one car to another.  This train can reach speeds of up to one hundred and twenty kilometers per hour, but the working speed is limited to eighty kilometers per hour. </li></ul><p>  In recent years, work is underway to create a new model of M300 trains.  It should be fully automated and exclude human control. </p>

    <h2>  Station Description </h2><p>  Metro stations do not have distinctive features that would turn them into a work of art of architectural thought.  They are made in a minimalist style, which is so close to the Finnish soul.  Some tourists note that pieces of rock that look well in some places look a bit archaic.  Given that the underground stations were hollowed out in the rock, then this is quite natural. </p><p>  Keep in mind that the announcement of the stations is in Finnish and Swedish.  Only the junction station associated with the railway station is also announced in English. </p><p>  In the M200 type cars digital displays are installed, on them you can see how the train is moving and determine the next stop. </p><p>  Four metro stations are connected to major <span>shopping centers in Helsinki</span> : </p><ul><li>  Kamppi </li><li>  Rautatientori </li><li>  Itachaskus; </li><li>  "Vuosaari." </li></ul><p>  In addition, Kamppi has direct exits to the bus station.  Rautatientori will delight you with exits to the train station and several large malls. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that metro stations have very poetic names.  For example, ‚ÄúKamppi‚Äù means ‚Äúbattlefield,‚Äù and ‚ÄúKalasatama‚Äù translates as ‚Äúfish harbor‚Äù. </p><h2>  Ticket price </h2><p>  Helsinki metro tickets cost vary.  It depends on many factors: place of purchase, time of action, and so on.  To guide the reader in prices, we give a few real numbers. </p><p>  A single ticket, which is valid from one to two hours on any transport in the city, costs around four euros.  The cheapest will cost tourists two euros. </p><p>  If you plan to travel around the capital often, then purchase a <span>single</span> ticket.  It is valid from one day to seven.  Depending on this, its value will change.  For one day you need to pay eight euros, each next day will cost four euros more.  The most expensive ticket for seven days will cost thirty-two euros. </p><p>  Also, tourists often purchase a Helsinki Card.  This card allows you to not only travel on any transport an unlimited number of times a day, but also to visit museums at a discount.  A day of use costs forty-four euros, for two days you need to pay fifty-six euros, and three days will cost sixty-six euros. </p><h2>  Fare options </h2><p>  How to pay in Helsinki metro?  This question always worries tourists.  However, there are a lot of options to become the owner of a ticket and everyone can choose the one that suits him more than others: </p><ul><li>  If you plan to stay in the capital of Finland for several days, then download the convenient mobile application to your phone.  Through it, you can easily purchase any transport tickets.  The cost of a one-time pass is equal to three euros and twenty cents. </li><li>  For those who want to save money, the option with SMS messages is suitable.  In this case, you only have to pay two euros and sixty cents. </li><li>  Tickets can be purchased without problems in vending machines installed in the metro, shopping centers and other public places. </li></ul><p>  Automatic tickets cost a little over two euros. </p>

    <h2>  Features of buying tickets through vending machines </h2><p>  Most often, tourists buy tickets at metro stations in Helsinki.  How to use automatic machines is pretty easy to figure out.  Usually, several machines are installed at the station.  They differ in the type of payment means accepted and in the types of travel documents issued by them. </p><p>  The hardware interface is not too complicated.  You just need to click on the button where the type of ticket is indicated, and pay it with certain notes.  The machine will immediately give you the ordered travel card. </p>

    <h2>  Underground Trends </h2><p>  Currently, the only Finnish metro has great prospects.  The Helsinki Metro is expanding, and there is hope that after some time the initial project will be fully completed. </p><p>  Not so long ago, workers completed the construction of another station - Kalasatama.  It is located in the port area, traffic on it is still running in test mode.  In parallel, work is underway on the construction of another station, which will connect the center of Helsinki with new residential neighborhoods on the outskirts. </p><p>  Eleven years ago, city authorities decided to expand the metro line to the west.  Eight years ago, construction began on the first site.  It has a length of almost fourteen kilometers, which should accommodate eight stations. </p><p>  For two years now, movement has been carried out on a new branch in test mode.  However, the results so far are hardly satisfactory, therefore, the opening of this direction is postponed indefinitely. </p><p>  It is also planned to extend the line to the airport and lay it further west.  Construction has already cost almost one billion euros, it is planned to finish it in three years.  However, the city authorities do not exclude that the construction will not be completed on time. </p><p>  From the immediate prospects for the development of the metro is the replacement of conventional trains with automatic trains.  This is due to happen next year. </p><p>  If you find yourself in Helsinki, then be sure to take a ride on the subway.  This trip will bring you many positive emotions and will be another useful experience. </p>
