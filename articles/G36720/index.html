  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Turkic Kaganate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Turkic Kaganate existed from 552 to 745.  <span>This state</span> was founded on the territory of Central Asia.  The ancient Turks united in a tribe in 460.  Ashina, one of the Hun tribes, came under the rule of the Juan tribe and was resettled to Altai from East Turkestan.  In Altai, a union of local peoples was formed, which took the name "Turk".  In 545, <span>this nation</span> defeated the Uyghur tribes, in 551 - the Jujans themselves.  Bumyn (Turkic leader) proclaimed himself a kagan. </p><p>  By 555, all the peoples settled on the territory of Central Asia, including the Yenisei Kirghiz and Khitan in Western Manchuria, were conquered by the Altai tribal union.  The Hagan‚Äôs headquarters was moved to the headwaters of Orkhon, where an association of Orkhon Turks was formed. </p><p>  In the 560s, the state of the Ephtalites was defeated.  And at the beginning of the second half of the 6th century, the Turkic Kaganate conquered the North Chinese states of Qi and Zhou, after which it began a war with Iran for control of the Silk Road.  A successful campaign against the Iranians allowed in 571 to expand the borders of the state.  Thus, the Turkic Kaganate began to occupy the territory up to <span>the Amu Darya River,</span> and in 588-589.  separate territories on its western coast joined the state.  By 576, the Turkic Khaganate took possession of the Bosporus, and in 581 led a siege of Chersonesos. </p><p>  The growth of wealth and power of the aristocracy, the desire of this class to manage the occupied territories autonomously, provoked an internecine political struggle.  It continued in the state from 582 to 603.  The situation was aggravated by interference in the internal affairs of the emperors of China (from the Sui dynasty).  As a result, the state split into two parts: East (Central Asian) and West Turkic Kaganate (Central Asian). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The eastern part of the state has strengthened its influence in Central Asia.  At that time, Shibi Kagan ruled.  In wars with China, this ruler defended and maintained the independence of the state. </p><p>  The next kagan - Heli - made sixty-seven campaigns on the territory of China.  Due to the uprisings of subservient tribes, dissatisfied with the despotism of state rule, the East Turkic Kaganate was defeated in the war with China in 630.  As a result, the Eastern Turks came under the rule of the <span>Chinese emperors.</span>  The uprising in 681 contributed to a new revival of the state. </p><p>  Kapagan was able to expand the <span>state borders of the</span> Eastern Kaganate.  The territory of the state began to stretch from Manchuria to the Syr Darya.  Hikes were also made to Samarkand.  However, the Turks were defeated in the wars with the Arabs in 712-713. </p><p>  Kagan Bilge and his brother Kultegin defended the independence of their state in battles with the Tang empire and its allied states.  After the death of Bilge, civil strife began in the state.  Internal confrontations led to the collapse of the East Turkic Kaganate, on the site of which the Uyghur state arose.  It lasted from 745 to 840 g. </p><p>  The western part of the kaganate under the rulers of Shegue and Ton-yabgu extended over a vast territory in <span>Central Asia.</span>  The state was limited to the Amu Darya and Tarim rivers.  The headquarters of the Khagans of the western state was located in Suyab.  In 630, the struggle for the throne began.  This struggle turned into a protracted war.  Two tribal associations participated in this confrontation - Nushibi and Dulu. </p><p>  Kagan Yshbar Khilash divided the state into ten "arrows".  With this reform, the ruler tried to stop the internecine struggle.  However, the struggle continued. </p><p>  In 658-569, Chinese troops invaded the territory of the Western Haganate.  By 704, the state managed to free itself from the power of China.  But the invasions of the northern tribes, as well as internal confrontations, led to the death of the state in 740. </p><p>  The Turkic Kaganate was of great importance in the consolidation of the Turkic tribes that settled Eurasia. </p>
