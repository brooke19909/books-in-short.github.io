A scoop laid out from grains with an image of an invigorating drink today can decorate rooms, items of clothing, accessories, souvenirs and much more.  Owl is a bird of youth trend. </p><h2>  Modern bird </h2><p>  An owl is a symbol of wisdom and knowledge.  The mysterious night bird looks mysterious and attractive.  The coffee owl has become a sought-after image on T-shirts, hoodies and sweatshirts.  Teenagers like stuffed animals and souvenirs symbolizing a night bird. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rageon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jacket with an owl" class="if uuid-3104704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3104704.jpg"></div><h2>  For clothes, home and games </h2><p>  A coffee owl is successfully demonstrated on the paintings and walls of tea houses, the kitchen, and the dining room.  With her image, they buy and make fridge magnets.  Such a gray beauty can be made by yourself.  A wise bird will fit perfectly into the interior of the room or come in handy as a cute present for a girlfriend or sister.  Creating a masterpiece with a coffee owl is not difficult, you just need to make a little zeal and effort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wall-art.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Owl in a cafe" class="if uuid-3104700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3104700.jpg"></div><h2>  Owl pendant </h2><p>  A coffee owl can be made in many ways.  It can be sewn, knitted, made in the form of an application. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first option is quite simple, following the instructions, you can quickly cook up a night bird. </p><p>  It will be a small coffee owl pendant.  To create it will need such materials: </p><ul><li>  White paper; </li><li>  dense fabric of white color; </li><li>  needle, thread, sewing machine; </li><li>  a simple pencil; </li><li>  cotton wool; </li><li>  coffee beans; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  black marker; </li><li>  cord and ring for suspension; </li><li>  coffee, black tea, vanillin; </li><li>  hot glue; </li><li>  acrylic paints and brushes; </li><li>  black helium pen; </li><li>  a glass of warm water. </li></ul><p>  Following a detailed workshop, you will make a coffee owl quick and easy: </p><ol><li>  On white paper, draw a simple owl pattern.  You can draw it yourself or download it from the Internet.  With a black pen we carefully draw the eyes, feathers, beak of the bird. </li><li>  Transfer the pattern to the fabric.  Cut two parts. </li><li>  We put paper templates under the fabric and draw all the details of the picture: wings, beak, eyes, feathers.  Below we make a tuck in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe legs. </li><li>  We lay the parts with the image of a coffee owl inside.  Gently sew along the edge or sew by hand, without touching the bottom. </li><li>  We sew the tuck, we turn the workpiece out, the front part should be on top.  Before us will be a small owl with traced elements.  We fill the inside of the toy with cotton, but not too tightly. </li><li>  Sew an unstitched incision.  On top of the bird‚Äôs head we fasten a lace with a ring. </li><li>  The next step is coloring the fake.  In warm water we breed a bag of black tea and one teaspoon of instant coffee.  Add vanillin.  Cool the mixture and apply with a brush to the product.  This must be done carefully and evenly, trying not to wet the workpiece very much. </li><li>  After applying the dark ‚Äúpaint‚Äù we circle the drawings on the owl: eyes, wings, and so on.  This is best done with a black gel pen. </li><li>  The final step will be coloring the coffee owl.  Using paints, pencils or felt-tip pens, you need to colorize all parts and images of the bird.  It is better to draw all the parts in brown, highlight big eyes with yellow paint.  In the middle glued coffee beans, emphasizing the languor and mystery of the nocturnal bird. </li><li>  From the pieces of thread, fur and a fluffy rope, draw the tips of the ears, wings and tail of an owl.  To give the owl a unique charm with the help of coffee beans, we draw feathers on small wings.  It will be enough to glue six grains on each side.  They need to be fixed in the following order: 3, 2, 1. A little bit of grains can be glued to the drawn tail of the bird. </li></ol><p>  A wonderful souvenir pendant-owl is ready. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coffee owl" class="if uuid-3104698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3104698.jpg"></div><h2>  Jar of Owl coffee </h2><p>  DIY coffee owls will help you prepare an original birthday present for friends and relatives.  For example, a jar made in the shape of an owl will benefit and decorate the interior. </p><p>  To create such a present you need to prepare the following materials: </p><ul><li>  a glass jar with a lid that twists; </li><li>  a piece of burlap; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  hot glue; </li><li>  Scotch; </li><li>  tight cord, rope; </li><li>  thin cardboard; </li><li>  ribbons and lace; </li><li>  shreds of burlap color; </li><li>  coffee beans; </li><li>  Buttons on the legs or eyes; </li><li>  gray knitted threads; </li><li>  acrylic paints, varnish. </li></ul><p>  Getting started creating a coffee owl: </p><ol><li>  From the burlap we cut out a rectangle corresponding to the size of the can.  In the middle of the jar, mark the center, cut the oval from the tape and glue it on the marking site.  From the middle rectangle we cut out a similar geometric figure. </li><li>  Gently cover the jar with glue so as not to touch the oval "window".  Paste over the prepared burlap jar.  The fabric below should be 10 centimeters oversize. These are the future paws. </li><li>  Glue a thin ribbon along the neck of the can (along the edge of the burlap). </li><li>  We turn to the limbs of an owl.  From an extra piece of fabric hanging from a can, we make incisions: for two legs and a tail. </li><li>  We twist the legs and hem, trying to give them the appropriate shape.  We perform the same procedure with the tail.  Fold the base with a triangle and carefully flash it. </li><li>  We cut out the wings of paper and transfer the pattern to a fabric of a similar color to burlap.  Do not forget about the necessary clearance on the fabric to gently glue the edges on the wings.  We glue the cardboard base to the fabric pattern and attach it to the "can" owl. </li><li>  We glue coffee beans on the edge of the window with hot glue, on the "belly" of the owl, glue three grains to the legs. </li><li>  We glue the edges of the legs and wings of the coffee owl with a thin wool rope. </li><li>  Wings are decorated with circular patterns of knitting threads or rope.  We carry out a number of patterns, combining with a number of coffee beans.  The wings will turn out beautiful and voluminous. </li><li>  We make out the tail with grains of coffee and a woolen edging. </li><li>  We pass to the head.  Cut a rectangle half smaller than it was on the jar.  Glue the edges of the burlap to the edges of the lid. </li><li>  From thick cardboard we cut circles in descending order, at least 6 parts.  We stick on each other and on the cover.  We fasten the lid to the jar and paste over with burlap.  We form the upper edges with pointed ears, we tie them with lace and fluff up the tips of the ears. </li><li>  From knitting threads we make two pompoms and sew them in place of the eye sockets.  Sew buttons instead of eyes, color with yellow, black and white paint.  Instead of a nose fasten an oval button. </li><li>  We decorate the owl with ribbons and beads, fill it with a jar of coffee and the original gift is ready. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.fanpop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hairy Owls" class="if uuid-3104702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3104702.jpg"></div><h2>  Interesting picture </h2><p>  A coffee owl in the form of a picture is very simple.  On a thick white cardboard, you need to draw an image of an owl.  In place of the eyes, they draw large circles with dark eye sockets or beautiful large eyes (how much fiction and skills are enough).  Next, it is necessary to coat the workpiece with glue throughout the figure and put it with coffee beans.  Top with varnish.  The order of work is not complicated, but interesting.  The finished picture should dry, placed in the original frame, it will serve as a creative piece of kitchen decor or a great gift for friends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coffee owl" class="if uuid-3104701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/113702/3104701.jpg"></div><h2>  For yourself and friends </h2><p>  A coffee owl toy is a very interesting and fashionable gift.  Create a night beauty yourself is not difficult.  And you will certainly get pleasure from work and the result obtained.  In the photo, coffee owls look stylish and interesting.  Night birds are worthy of general attention. </p>
