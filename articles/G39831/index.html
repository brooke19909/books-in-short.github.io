  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Historical center - Samara Khlebnaya square</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Samara, built as a fortress to protect the Volga region from the invasion of nomads, gradually became a rear city.  The borders of the empire went further south and east.  The surrounding steppes were plowed up by peasants, and bread was grown.  The old marinas proved to be very convenient for sending bread further north.  The city gradually became a merchant center.  Grain trade flourished on the banks of the Samara River. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-zoom="16" data-type="roadmap" data-lng="50.081354199999964" data-lat="53.1780081"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/0/9/6/3096.png"></div><h2>  History of the square </h2><p>  The end of the XIX century - the whole life of the city is concentrated around Khlebnaya <span>Square.</span>  <span>Samara</span> traded grain with almost the whole world, it was the largest Russian wheat center.  Then this part of the old fortress was one of the best places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oldsamara.samgtu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="old cathedral" class="if uuid-2457300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2457300.jpg"></div><p>  Next to the magnificent Cathedral of Our Lady of Kazan, the most beautiful Transfiguration Church was located.  The building of the late XVII century confidently stood on the ancient stone blocks.  Next to it in 1873 a church was built in the name of the icon of the Mother of God of Smolensk, especially for the list of icons brought from Persia.  Three temples in one place say how many people were here.  Life was in full swing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The center of social life was the building of the bread exchange.  The building, built in 1898 by the architect A. Shcherbochev, is today declared a cultural heritage site.  But Orthodox churches, unfortunately, were not preserved.  Soviet power destroyed the best works of architecture. </p><h2>  Today </h2><p>  However, the Khlebnaya Square itself was not preserved.  The history of Samara has lost its best heritage.  In place of the towers of the old fortress and the magnificent square, Samara received a new factory and a bridge over the river.  All three temples were demolished.  Only the exchange building and the old elevator, which was the largest in Europe, remind of its former glory.  The former stock exchange has become one of the medical institutions, and the elevator building is used for the sale of spare parts for cars.  From the west along the street of Stepan Razin, the facades of the Samara Electromechanical Plant go out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="samara-ru.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the Bread Exchange" class="if uuid-2457297" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2457297.jpg"></div><p>  But the memory did not sink into eternity, it was decided to keep the name.  Rename the nearby old Police Square.  So Samara regained Khlebnaya Square.  True, today the main role on it is played by the building of the former fire and police unit.  Heavily mutilated by the extensions, but still retaining the memory of past greatness. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="samara-ru.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fire Department" class="if uuid-2457298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2457298.jpg"></div><p>  The square plunged into a lethargic dream for many years. </p><h2>  What happened to the bread exchange </h2><p>  At the end of the XIX century, Samara was rightfully considered the breadbasket of the Volga.  Caravans of bread flocked here from all around.  If someone believes that traffic jams are a product of the 20th century, then he is cruelly mistaken.  On some days, it was impossible to leave Samara, people stood in traffic jams for 2-3 hours, waiting for passing carts with bread.  Huge barns on the banks of the river never fell asleep. </p><div class="photo" data-original="savin-andrey.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bread elevator" class="if uuid-2457301" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81643/2457301.jpg"></div><p>  All winter they were loaded with grain, and as soon as the navigation opened, a feverish shipment of wheat to the ships began.  All operations for processing transactions took place in a specially constructed building of the exchange.  Brokers worked without stopping.  Among notable buyers, not only the Romanovs reigning in Russia were listed, but the English queen could not do without Samara wheat. </p><p>  The beginning of Stalin's industrialization gave the city an incentive for industrial development, but, unfortunately, it destroyed the grain trade.  The exchange has become unnecessary.  The building began to grow older and older. </p><h2>  Look to the future </h2><p>  Fortunately, the beginning of the 21st century brought a wind of hope for change.  As the first sprout of life, a small wooden church appeared.  What can change the temple with a small bell tower, standing next to the trams of Samara?  The grain square seemed to have drunk a sip of living water.  Everything began to come to life.  The chief architect of the city has been fighting for every historical building for many years.  The works of Alexei Samartsev are not in vain.  The options for reconstructing the historic city center are being considered.  Lengiprogor developed a general concept for the reconstruction of the historical appearance.  80 objects of cultural heritage are allocated.  Planned objects to be removed outside the historic center, and buildings - for demolition.  There are routes that do not violate the architectural ensemble and allow tourists to get to Khlebnaya Square.  Samara as a phoenix is ‚Äã‚Äãreborn from the flame of the 1917 revolution.  It is planned to build: </p><ol><li>  The cultural and entertainment center, called the "Samara Forum". </li><li>  Pedestrian zone "Cent Strelka". </li><li>  The sculptural ‚ÄúHeroes' Square‚Äù. </li><li>  Temple of Alexy the Second. </li><li>  Performance object, recreating the life of the "old Samara street." </li><li>  Retro hotel in the style of Khrushchev. </li><li>  Theater "At the Mill". </li><li>  Complex of hotels "Brickstone". </li><li>  Art Center "Wedge". </li><li>  Museum of the history of fire protection. </li><li>  Bread exchange. </li><li>  "Subbotina-Martison House." </li><li>  Children's Center "Hasek" and much more. </li></ol>
