Knitting is a rather fascinating, interesting process, but it requires perseverance and patience.  Few women are able to spend so much time knitting out loops.  But what a joy then to put on a sweater, knitted with your own hands, and get compliments!  Such things have the following advantages over purchased ones: </p><ul><li>  The opportunity to save on the purchase of designer clothes.  You won‚Äôt have to doubt the exclusivity of the received thing, since no one in the world will have this.  A similar thing in the store will be very expensive, and hand-made execution will require only time, costs for yarn and knitting needles. </li><li>  You can make the thing fit perfectly on the figure, even if it is not perfect.  If it did not immediately work out to get the required fit, you can dissolve the part and relate it according to the corrected parameters. </li><li>  An opportunity to use already existing threads if they suddenly lie in a box from time immemorial. </li><li>  An opportunity to get a thing of such composition that you want, but not which is affordable at the store. </li></ul>

    <h2>  What you need to start knitting </h2><p>  Before starting knitting, you need to know general concepts.  It is not necessary to study textbooks or books on knitting, in which everything is very difficult to describe.  Often it is the complexity of the process description that repels novice craftswomen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to knit a <span>female pullover with knitting needles and needles are</span> required.  If you want to knit a <span>sweater warm</span> and thick, then appropriate threads will be required.  For knitting an elegant openwork pullover, the necessary thin threads. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fashion pullovers" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44266/1644057.jpg" width="585"></div></h2><h2>  Yarn calculation </h2><p>  Perhaps, for some, the calculation process will seem complicated, but this is far from the case.  The simplest calculation that many knitters use is based on the length of the thread.  This indicator is indicated on each glomerulus.  For example, in order to knit a female pullover with knitting needles of average size 46, you will need a kilometer of yarn.  That is, if it is indicated on the skein that it is 250 meters, then 4 such skeins will be required.  To increase the size or depending on the characteristics of the model, one additional skein of yarn is added.  The same goes for decrease.  For example, if the model involves a short sleeve, then you can buy yarn one skein less. </p><p>  And you can do the tricky thing in the calculation: take your sweater, which used similar threads, and weigh it on the scales.  The resulting weight is the required amount of yarn.  It is better to stock up on an extra ball when buying, because the colors in batches may vary, and if there is not enough yarn, the new ball may differ in shade. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Knitting needles </h2><p>  Knitting needles are selected depending on the yarn.  Usually, on glomeruli, manufacturers indicate which number should be taken in order to use this yarn.  If you take the knitting needles of the smallest indicated number, then the knitting will turn out more dense.  If you use large knitting needles, you will get a more friable and elastic fabric. </p><p>  Many knitters use this technique: you need to put a piece of yarn and a knitting needle on the table.  Their thickness should approximately coincide. </p>

    <h2>  Sample </h2><p>  Before knitting a female pullover with knitting needles, you will need to knit a sample.  Tying the sample is necessary to calculate the required number of loops and evaluate the behavior of the yarn after washing.  A set of an arbitrary number of loops is made on the knitting needles.  Approximately, the width of the sample should be at least 10 cm, so that it is convenient to calculate how many loops in this width are contained.  Knit a sample you need the same viscous, which is planned to knit the future pullover.  If the <span>front surface</span> is used <span>,</span> then the sample is knitted with it.  If openwork or arana will be used, then it is enough to use one pattern repeat in the sample.  After receiving the square-shaped sample, measurements are taken.  The number of loops contained in 10 cm of knitting is calculated, excluding edge loops.  Next, the sample is washed and dried.  After drying, calculations and measurements are performed again.  This is necessary in order to find out if the yarn does not sit after washing, otherwise after the finished product is tied and washed, it may not be enough for its owner. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Now you need to take your measurements and determine the size.  After this, the manufacture of a pattern or its schematic representation will be required.  You can find a pullover pattern in the magazine.  Now you can start knitting. </p><p>  Inexperienced knitters were lucky, since fashionable pullovers presented on the catwalks and in famous stores are knitted with a very simple knit.  The most fashionable models at the moment are a pullover with braids (the knitting pattern can be seen below) or connected with front stitch, as well as models with the simplest openwork pattern. </p>

    <p>  The width of the product is calculated by measuring the line of the hips, dividing it in half and adding a couple of centimeters to allowances and a couple to free fit.  Now, based on the density of knitting, which is determined by knitting the sample, the required number of loops is recruited.  Usually, gum is knitted at the bottom of the product by knitting alternately the front and back loops.  It is needed so that the edge of the product does not stretch and does not twist up.  Sectional dyeing yarn is suitable for such a product, since it itself creates a picturesque pattern on the product and does not need to be supplemented with additional details.  Pullover melange female (knitting with knitting needles is not too difficult) is at the peak of fashion and is simple to perform.

    <p>  The advantage of this method is that the process of forming a pullover is under constant control.  If other models, for example, with knotting armholes, require accuracy, then the process of knotting raglan can be adjusted at your discretion.  Raglan line decreases are made in every second row.

There are a lot of options.  After closing the neckline, seams are sewn together - sleeves and side. </p>

    <p>  Pullovers with braids are warm and comfortable.  So usually decorate winter models. </p><h2>  Product Finishing </h2><p>  Finishing is very important when knitting, because the final result depends on it.  The product, when properly selected, is neat and tidy.  The quality of its implementation depends on the time that the product will be operated. </p><p>  Product seams can be joined with a needle or crochet.  Needle connection involves laying the seam "back with a needle" along the edges of the product.  And you can make hook connections by knitting a seam from half columns along the edges of the connected parts.  You will get a neat pigtail that will provide a reliable connection of parts.  Ponytails remaining after a set of loops are crocheted into the seams of the product. </p>

    <p>  After knitting is completed, the product must be moistened and laid on a flat surface for complete drying.  As a rule, after washing, the loops straighten and become more even and accurate.  This is especially noticeable on smooth plain yarn.  Please note that yarn made from natural fibers can sit if it is washed in too hot water.  Usually, yarn producers point to the clew of the particular care of it.  It is best to wash knitted items with hands in warm, soapy water. </p><p>  Finished knitted product can be decorated at will.  For example, beads, beads, rhinestones look very impressive.  You can patch decorative elements around the edges, collar or cuffs.  Whatever decor was chosen, independent knitting implies complete freedom of choice, since this process is creative.  The main thing is not to overdo it with decorations so that the pullover does not look like a Christmas tree. </p><p>  Some knitters think knitting is very difficult, and it takes too much time.  Yes, it takes a lot of time.  Sometimes you have to mess with a pullover for several weeks, or even months.  The more complex the process and the longer the work, the greater the joy when the finished thing is obtained. </p>

    <p>  But about the complexity of knitting - the process is quite controversial.  Many knitters strive to commercialize their skills and deliberately complicate the process so that frightened beginners must buy a book.  In fact, knitting is not a complicated process at all.  If you really wanted a new thing, there is no need to doubt that you will succeed.  It is better to try, and even if not the first, but the second time, a masterpiece will definitely come out from under the spokes.  Self-doubt can stop from the very beginning of action.  But if a person does not try to do something, then he cannot know whether it is difficult or not. </p>
