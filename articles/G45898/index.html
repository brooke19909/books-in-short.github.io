    <h2>  Prices </h2><p>  All the necessary equipment can be rented, or you can bring it with you.  The cost of renting a ski kit is 500 rubles.  Those who are just starting to practice this sport may ask the help of an instructor.  The cost of the lesson is from 700 rubles. </p><h2>  Comparison with other ski resorts in the country </h2><p>  Photos of the Hedgehog Mountain confirm that the landscape here is bewitching.  Very close to Yezhova is Mount Belaya, on which the resort with the same name is based.  However, these are not the only places beyond the Urals where winter holidays can be spent.  In the Novosibirsk region there is also a popular ski resort - "Jurmanka".  We will talk about him a little lower. </p><h2>  "Mount Belaya" - ski resort </h2><p>  In the Sverdlovsk region there are at least two popular resorts.  It‚Äôs only 10 kilometers from Ezhova Mountain to Belaya, so in one winter you can visit these two wonderful places at once.  The main feature of this resort is the ability to ride on unprepared tracks.  The lift takes tourists to the right height, and there everyone is free to choose: go down one of the prepared tracks or go for a walk in the forest, enjoy the fresh high-altitude air.  A positive feature of the resort is that there is always a lot of snow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="White ski resort" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/593354.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The height of Belaya Mountain above sea level reaches 715 meters.  There are only three slopes and three lifts.  Thus, there are not so many people here as on Mount Ezhova.  One track is training, the second for skiers and the third for snowboarders.  There are many bumps and elevations.  The first two tracks are illuminated, the third, unfortunately, no. </p><p>  It is worth saying that Mount Belaya is one of the most beautiful places in the Sverdlovsk region, and throughout the Northern Urals.  In the near future, the development of the complex, the construction of new routes.  If everything that is planned succeeds, then soon there will be 8 sports tracks, several more lifts, and the total capacity of the complex will be 2,000 people.  In the future, it is planned to add another 15-20 tracks, respectively, the number of tourists will increase almost threefold. </p><p>  The route for off-piste skiing is called ‚ÄúCheget‚Äù.  To protect yourself while walking on the slopes of the mountain, you can also ask the help of instructors. </p><h2>  Accommodation  Prices.  Infrastructure </h2><p>  So far, White is not as popular as Ezhovaya.  There is only one hotel, there are no special entertainments.  But the cost of renting sports equipment, classes with an instructor and accommodation is quite low.  You can rent skis for an hour for 100 rubles (depending on the quality of the equipment), a snowboard for 250. Classes with an instructor - from 450 rubles.  The cost increases depending on the number of people. </p><h2>  About the recreation center "Jurmanka" </h2><p>  "Jurmanka" is located in the Novosibirsk region.  The complex offers all types of winter extreme sports: skiing, snowboarding, jumping in a snow park.  You can also go horseback riding or snowboarding here. </p><p>  Where does the mountain come from in the Novosibirsk Region?  Ski complex "Jurmanka" chose one of the most picturesque places in Western Siberia - <span>Salair Ridge.</span>  Altitude, of course, is not so great, but this is enough to organize an active winter holiday.  Small mountain rivers flow into spacious valleys, cutting them and forming rocky shores. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski complex Jurmanka" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/593359.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews of tourists about the complex "Mountain Ezhovaya" </h2><p>  Thus, <span>skiing in Russia</span> is a very popular type of recreation.  Resorts are provided with everything necessary, most importantly, they are safe.  Another advantage is the relatively low prices.  Among the reviews of tourists who have already visited the Urals, there are very few negative ones.  The main thing that people note is soulfulness and hospitality.  Particular attention is paid to the Seventh Heaven Hotel. </p><p>  Of course, winter vacations are useful in every sense.  Fresh clean air, movement, calm and solitude - this is what you need to restore the nervous system after long working days. </p>
