  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reference group: characteristics, classifications and typology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The reference group is a <span>social community that</span> serves as a kind of reporting system for a person, a standard for others and themselves.  This is the source of the formation of value beliefs, orientations and <span>social norms.</span> </p><p>  Their <em><strong>classification</strong></em> is carried out on several grounds: </p><ul><li>  according to the functions performed, comparative and normative are distinguished; </li><li>  on the basis of membership - ideal and presence groups; </li><li>  subject to the consent or denial of the individual values ‚Äã‚Äãand norms, there are negative and positive. </li></ul><p>  Consider the selected phenomena in more detail. </p><p>  The normative reference group is a source of norms that regulate human behavior, being a guideline for significant problems.  Comparative is the standard for evaluating others and oneself. </p><p>  The presence reference group is the community of which the individual will be a member.  It is significantly different from ideal.  Within its framework, the individual wants to be guided by its norms and values ‚Äã‚Äãin behavior, in assessments of events, in relation to people.  But for some reason a person is not included in it, although it is attractive to him.  Moreover, the ideal community can be both real and fictional.  In this case, heroes of <span>literary works</span> and historical characters are an example for assessments, life beliefs and ideals. </p><p>  In a positive reference <span>group, social</span> values ‚Äã‚Äãand norms fully correspond to the ideas of each individual.  In the negative, the significance and importance of evaluations and opinions, which are propagated in generality, are alien and opposite to the beliefs of the individual.  Therefore, in his behavior he tries to get negative assessments, "disapproval" of his position on her part. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em><strong>Typology</strong></em> </p><p> <em><strong> </strong></em>  1).  The reference reference can be really existing, as well as imaginary, which is the result of construction.  Its members often do not even suspect that they are one united community. </p><p>  2).  An information reference group is a group of people whose information we trust.  It stands out: </p><ul><li>  knowledge and experience holders who have used this service or group; </li><li>  experts are usually assessed as the most knowledgeable in this field, whose judgment can accurately reflect the existing qualities of a product, phenomenon, service, and so on. </li></ul><p>  3).  A community of self-identification is a group to which a person is forced to belong, being constantly under the pressure of her values ‚Äã‚Äãand norms.  In such a situation, the individual would like to avoid outside influence, but he does not succeed. </p><p>  4).  The most common is the value reference group.  Sociology was able to form rich theoretical and empirical material in its study.  Value community is a real or imaginary group of people, which is considered by the individual as a bright carrier, the exponent of those beliefs, which he shares.  But, since she actively confesses them with the help of her lifestyle, a person seeks to constantly imitate her, following the accepted method of behavior.  As a rule, an individual does not belong to this group, being far from it both in social and physical spaces.  In this role are the "stars" of cinema, sports, heroes, pop musicians, as well as prominent figures in the sphere that is significant for humans. </p><p>  5).  A utilitarian group is a community with an arsenal of negative and positive sanctions.  She is able to both punish and reward the individual.  Usually imaginary and real people come into it, sharing her beliefs. </p><p>  But you need to keep in mind the following.  One and the same reference group may act in a different capacity, since this will largely depend on the specific situation and the conditions of its functioning. </p>
