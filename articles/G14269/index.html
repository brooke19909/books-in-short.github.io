The building is made of burnt bricks and finished with terracotta tiles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kazakhstan.travel" data-author=": " data-source="https://kazakhstan.travel/tourist-spot/en/62/%20Mausoleums%20%22Aisha%20Bibi%22%20and%20%22Babaji%20Khatun%22"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mausoleum Aisha Bibi" class="if uuid-3250161" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3250161.jpg"></div><p>  This attraction of Taraz is located (photo is presented in the article) in the village of Aisha-Bibi, 18 kilometers from the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Monument to the "gentlemen of fortune" </h2><p>  The fact that in Taraz to the heroes of the famous Soviet comedy is a monument, few people know.

The inscription on the tablet is the words of one of the main characters that were remembered by many: ‚ÄúDzhambul - it's warm there, there is mom ...‚Äù </p><p>  It is surprising that the monument, located on the market square and being the creation of the sculptor Temirkhan Kolzhigit, represents the figures of only four heroes, including the camel Vasya.  It remains a mystery why there is no hero on this monument played by G. M. Vitsin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fishki.net" data-author=": " data-source="https://fishki.net/1259242-ljubimye-filmydzhentlmeny-udachi.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the Gentlemen of Fortune" class="if uuid-3250165" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3250165.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of the Assumption of the Mother of God </h2><p>  This landmark of the city of Taraz was built in 1998.
