Resort Hotel in Moscow Region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The development of the hotel business in Russia does not stand still.  Only ten years ago, few hotels could offer first-class service, both on the Mediterranean coast or in Europe.  Today the situation has changed dramatically, and even in small cities of our country they are ready to provide you with clean and comfortable rooms, food and quality service. </p><h2>  Escape from the metropolis </h2><p>  To restore strength and peace of mind, psychologists advise a change of scenery.  In anticipation of a great vacation, you can arrange a little respite for yourself - for this it is not necessary to go far from the capital.  In the <span>Moscow region</span> there are great options for the weekend.  One of the best, according to traveler reviews, is the Tsargrad Hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tsargrad reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/996090.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This is a real resort, which is located on the banks of the Oka.  Comfortable rooms, a cultural program, sports facilities and entertainment for every taste - lonely travelers, noisy companies and families with children will like it here. </p><h2>  Residence </h2><p>  On the territory of the complex there are several residential buildings decorated in the theme of folk crafts: “Gzhel”, “Gorodets” and “Khokhloma”.  The number of rooms consists of 108 rooms of four categories: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - Double standard. </p><p>  - Junior Suite. </p><p>  - Romantic Suite. </p><p>  - Lux. </p><p>  The rooms have everything you need: climate control system, toiletries, Internet access, minibar, satellite TV, hairdryer and safe.

The presence of an elevator in the buildings is another plus.  Of the comments - complaints about the quality of cleaning, as well as the condition of individual rooms.

All dishes for young guests are prepared only from environmentally friendly products from their own farm. </p><p>  In addition to meals in the main restaurant, guests can try excellent grilled meat in the colorful restaurant "Druzhina" or have a cup of coffee with dessert in the lobby bar.

    <h2>  Guest opinions </h2><p>  Traveler reviews tell about the variety of dishes at the buffet, but many do not recommend paying extra for the set menu at dinner.  The presence of a children's menu is a huge plus, because some kids are really difficult to feed. </p><p>  Reviews are not advised to be very late for breakfasts and dinners, because there may not be enough dishes or even clean dishes, but it depends on the number of guests.  Would you like to have dinner at the Tsargrad Hotel?  Moscow, of course, is far away, and there are enough wonderful cafes and restaurants in the district - you definitely won’t stay hungry.  Some guests even use pizza and sushi delivery services from Pushchino. </p><h2>  Aquapark </h2><p>  The main advantage of the countryside resort “Tsargrad” is the aquazone, which consists of three pools: </p><ol><li>  The main pool with built-in hot tub - 220 sq.  meters. </li><li>  Children's pool with the attraction "Fungus" - 113 square meters.  meters. </li><li>  Water splash pool - 54 sq.  meter. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tsargrad prices" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/996084.jpg" width="550"></div></li></ol><p>  The water park is two small slides for children, as well as two attractions - “Eight” and “Free fall”.  Visitors over ten years old can ride a roller coaster, the minimum height is 120 cm, weight is 30 kg. </p><p>  In summer, guests enjoy sunbathing on the terrace, which offers magnificent views of the forest and the river. </p><h2>  Wellness &amp; spa </h2><p>  The thermal complex is the pride of the Tsargrad Hotel.  Traveler reviews note that not all suburban hotels in the Moscow Region can boast of such a set of relaxing procedures: </p><p>  - Fir sauna.  The branches of conifers and essential oils help to open the airways, and a temperature of 45 degrees is suitable for the first heating. </p><p>  - Roman bath.  Cleansing of the skin and pores is due to the soft steam that literally envelops you.  Muscle and nervous tension are relieved, working capacity is restored and skin condition improves. </p><p>  - Turkish hammam.  100% humidity and a temperature of 45 degrees complete the deep cleansing procedure.  Not advisable to be in the hammam for more than 15 minutes. </p><p>  - <span>Finnish sauna.</span>  A temperature of 90 degrees and dry steam help to relax and improve blood circulation throughout the body. </p><p>  - The salt room.  <span>Himalayan salt was</span> used to decorate the walls <span>,</span> while guests sit in comfortable pine armchairs during the session.  The salt room is indicated for skin diseases and for the prevention of respiratory pathologies. </p><p>  - “Trail of impressions.”  Three types of programs with different colors, sounds, water flow intensity and temperature. </p><p>  - Relax.  The relaxation room with comfortable sun loungers, subdued light and ideal air temperature is suitable for a relaxing holiday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is Constantinople" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/996083.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  According to reviews, the thermal complex is one of the best in the Moscow region.  The fair sex will certainly appreciate a set of spa treatments, as well as the opportunity to visit a beautician, do massage, manicure or pedicure. </p><h2>  For the whole family </h2><p>  Hotel “Tsargrad” (Serpukhov district) is focused on family vacations.  A contact zoo, an equestrian club, a games room and the Star Factory children's club - for young travelers, it may be even more interesting here than for adults. </p><p>  Most guests praise the animators and educators in the children's room, located on the fifth floor of the Tsargrad main building.  Reviews say that the kids really do not want to leave there.  A labyrinth with a ball pool, a trampoline, a variety of toys, a living area and everything necessary for children's creativity - parents can be calm, because the child is under the supervision of experienced teachers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsargrad Moscow" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/996086.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is Tsargrad located? </h2><p>  The country hotel is easiest to reach by car - 95 kilometers from the MKAD along Simferopol highway.  The highway is fast, so the road does not take much time. </p><p>  In addition, by train or bus - to the station “Serpukhov”, and then by route number 33 to the stop “Tsargrad”. </p><p>  The Moscow office of the suburban complex is located at Varshavskoye Shosse, house 47, building 4, floor 12. Here you can clarify all information about the reservation and pay for the order. </p><h2>  How to save? </h2><p>  One of the main disadvantages of the suburban resort "Tsargrad" - prices.  For this reason, most guests try to “catch” discounts on well-known reservation resources or purchase coupons.  The most expensive way to book and pay for your vacation is through the hotel’s official website. </p><p>  Travelers who are not resting for the first time in “Tsargrad” tell about their ambiguous impressions.  On the one hand, management is trying to develop infrastructure: three years ago, guests did not have the opportunity to visit Wellness &amp; SPA, a contact zoo or an aqua park.  On the other hand, regular guests note a deterioration in service and against the backdrop of this - an unjustified increase in prices for accommodation.  Check-in and check-out take a very long time - you have to wait 30-40 minutes, which indicates the ineffective work of the reception staff.  The territory is very large and well-groomed, but in the autumn-winter period lighting is not provided, and <span>evening walks</span> have to be canceled. </p><p>  Reviews about the rest at the Hotel Tsargrad are presented in large numbers, and the administration of the complex answers them at many tourist portals.  It is hoped that all comments and shortcomings will be taken into account. </p>
