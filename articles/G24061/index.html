  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Features of columned air conditioners</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Columned air conditioners are also called cupboard.  They are usually installed in places where a large number of people are constantly present: in large shops and offices, restaurants, theaters, etc.  In its design <noindex>  <span>column air conditioners</span> </noindex>  belong to the so-called "split systems" (in English, the verb "to split" means "to separate") and consist of several blocks. </p><p><br>  The advantages of columned air conditioners <br><br>  The multi-unit design allows such air conditioners to provide minimal temperature differences in the room, and regardless of external conditions.  This is explained by the fact that during the operation of the air conditioner a powerful stream of chilled air is generated, and this air is sent to the ceiling of the room.  In addition, the large weight of the columned air conditioner greatly simplifies and reduces the cost of installation, since it does not require special fastening to the surface.  For the same reason, the type of air conditioner in question is simple and convenient to maintain, as it facilitates the implementation of a variety of routine maintenance.  Manufacturers of modern models of columned air conditioners equip them with additional units that increase the comfort of the air, for example, with ionizers.  The power of the working units of such air conditioners reaches 50 kW. <br><br>  Installation and maintenance of columned air conditioners <br><br>  The main feature of the installation of such units is the need to have significant space in front of you, because otherwise the free upward direction of the conditioned air is not ensured.  This circumstance is decisive when choosing a place for installing split systems, since the possible risk of colds of people who are or work nearby should be minimized.  Therefore, it is not necessary to hide such air conditioners behind the elements of the decor: moreover, they can be a good addition to the overall design of the room.  Columned air conditioners allow the installation of supply ducts, which allows their more efficient operation. <br><br>  How do column air conditioners work? <br><br>  Air conditioning occurs due to the operation of a powerful compressor. Depending on the specified operating conditions, the microprocessor built into the column split system automatically sets the best air flow rates.  Most models are equipped with an indication of the filter cleaning system, as well as a self-diagnostic function of the system if it starts to work in an emergency mode.  The swing angle of the blinds in the columned air conditioners is adjustable, which allows you to change the direction of the air flow.  A characteristic feature of such split systems is the presence of dust-collecting air filters.  Air conditioners are controlled both from the panel of the internal side of the unit, and using the remote control. </p></div></article>
