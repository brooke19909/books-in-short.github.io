Riu Varadero Hotel 5 * (Cuba / Varadero)</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Cuban Hotel “Grand Memoris” (formerly Riu Varadero) reviews are deservedly called the best on the island.  It is located on the beach, which seemed to have arisen from a tale of paradise life.  Snow-white sand, azure ocean waters - everything here is simply created in order to forget about everyday life.  This new five-star resort complex, built five years ago, lulls you to the sound of waves, makes you feel like a gourmet god, keeps you fit with your fitness equipment and sports equipment, and also relaxes with a wellness center.  The all-inclusive system operates around the clock in this hotel.  Staying away from all the fuss, you will undoubtedly spend the best days of your life here and will dream of getting here again. </p><h2>  Location of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Hotel Riu Varadero 5 * is located quite far from the center of the resort of the same name.  Before him as many as fourteen kilometers.  It takes about two hours to get from here to Havana by bus.  But the airport is relatively close.  Forty-five kilometers of transfer - and you can already begin to "blissfully do nothing."  This is almost the very end of the Ikakos Peninsula, where the ocean and sea merge, and therefore nothing can stop your vacation.  A ride to Varadero from the hotel can be on a special <span>double-decker bus.</span>  It costs about five euros per person for the whole day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rii varadero reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/781347.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Sea and pools </h2><p>  The beach of Riu Varadero Hotel 5 * hotel reviews are described in such a way that you can immediately see that it is better than any praise, and the ocean is simply bewitching.  The water is clean, the sand sparkles, and fish are snooping right at the feet.  In the morning, as a rule, calm, and after lunch, lovers can ride the waves.  Entering the water is comfortable, gentle.  There are a lot of umbrellas and sunbeds, although, of course, if you arrive late, you can not "stake out" a site near the sea.  Catamarans and kayaks on the beach are free of charge, as in all <span>Varadero hotels.</span>  In the evenings, the Special Minister collects sunbeds and arranges them in the mornings according to the wishes of the tourists.  There is a special fenced VIP area for the inhabitants of the suites.  There are no children there, as in this entire hotel section.  The Riu Varadero 5 * hotel has two "common" pools and one for the inhabitants of the suites.  The latter with various “bonuses” - a jacuzzi and waterfalls.  The pools themselves are huge, warm, clean. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  About various trips from Riu Varadero 5 * reviews are only positive.  Tourists are mostly very satisfied.  Local guides speak Russian well, they are responsive and sociable.  Excursions to the cave of Bellamar, to the nearest town of Matanzas, are popular.  They are inexpensive and last only four hours.  From longer trips, the cities of Trinidad, Cienfuegos and El Nicho Waterfall are advised.  During this tour, you will get acquainted with the local flavor, visit the mountains, and also visit places where it is much cheaper than in Varadero, you can buy rum and cigars.  They also praise the trip to the six-meter-long Rocio Falls and to the town of Santa Clara.  However, the most exclusive and causing a lot of emotions is a tour of Cayo Largo.  This is an island resort in the Caribbean in southern Cuba.  It takes about half an hour to fly there by local airlines, and then sail on a catamaran.  But the impressions are worth the time and effort.  Reefs, <span>starfish,</span> iguanas, dolphins, turtle nursery ... By the way, regarding excursions to Riu Varadero 5 *, reviews of tourists mention one important thing.

You can go to the round-the-clock snack bar at any time and collect everything you wish for yourself. </p><h2>  Riu Varadero 5 *: reviews and photos </h2><p>  Tourists post a lot on the forums and social networks about their unforgettable holidays in this hotel in Cuba.  And, of course, they are accompanied by photographs.  Indeed, compared with other hotels on the island, which are somewhat reminiscent of Soviet pensions, there is a very high level of service. </p>

    <p>  Amazingly colored ocean, palm trees, pools - all this you can see in their reports as if with your own eyes.  And many write that they would like to return to Cuba, and this particular hotel, more than once.  Food and drink twenty four hours a day, amazing beach, excellent service.  People here rested for eleven days and two weeks, and complained all the time that this was not enough for Cuba.  Only in the Dominican Republic can be better, but on the island of Freedom it is cheaper, and people are more sincere. </p>
