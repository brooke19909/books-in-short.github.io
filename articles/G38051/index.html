    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Aerotel (hotel, Domodedovo) has received a number of negative reviews from its guests: </p><ul><li>  in the rooms of the category "Economy" and "Standard" there are no air conditioners, and therefore it can be very stuffy in them; </li><li>  breakfast prices are high, but there are no alternatives; </li><li>  due to the proximity to the airport the rooms are very noisy; </li><li>  the rooms are very cramped, and if you install cots or cots, then they do not turn around; </li><li>  despite the fact that the official website states that the hotel is non-smoking, everything in the rooms smelled of tobacco smoke; </li><li>  old and shabby furniture in the rooms; </li><li>  the bathroom has a clogged drain and plumbing is leaking; </li><li>  the room has only one outlet, and therefore you have to choose between household appliances and chargers; </li><li>  accommodation prices are too high and do not match the quality of the services provided; </li><li>  in coolers that are installed on each floor, glasses are not provided; </li><li>  cosmetic sets are not placed in the bathroom - you have to go to the reception on your own; </li><li>  do not count on the service "alarm clock" - hotel employees forget to wake guests; </li><li>  It‚Äôs hard enough to get a cashier's check upon check-out </li><li>  for a double room there is only one blanket; </li><li>  The essence of the superior room is only that slippers, a kettle and air conditioning are provided (in all other respects it is no different from "Economy"); </li><li>  interruptions in the supply of hot water; </li><li>  due to poor ventilation in the rooms and the corridor there is a very unpleasant smell; </li><li>  rudeness of the staff in the restaurant. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The remote location of airports from the city is a serious problem for transit passengers.  The desire to relax between flights is overshadowed by the fact that it takes a very long time to get to the hotel.  As for a place like Aerotel, it is located directly on the territory of Domodedovo Airport.  There is everything you need to have a good rest before the flight, to restore strength after it. <br><br>  As for the number of rooms, there are some flaws.  So, in the rooms of the class "Economy" there are no air conditioners, and it is impossible to open the windows because of the noise of the take-off planes.  Fans are available on request, but in a very limited number (they are not enough for all rooms).  That is why it is better to choose an improved standard room with a climate control system.  As for the "Suite", then there are quite comfortable living conditions, and most importantly - a free minibar.  Many guests are satisfied with such conditions, and they choose such rooms, despite the somewhat overpriced. </p><p>  This hotel provides all the necessary infrastructure for a comfortable stay and relaxation.  Thanks to this convenient schedule, you can satisfy your hunger or have fun at any time.  As for breakfast, they are quite expensive, but tasty and satisfying.  The portions are rather big.  Despite the fact that guests have no alternatives, this state of affairs suits them well.  Please note that breakfast can be included in the room rate only if you make a reservation through the official website.  If you use the services of intermediaries, then do not forget to pre-order this option during registration.  As for the √† la carte service, guests note the high quality of food and reasonable prices, compared to catering points located on the territory of the airport. </p><p>  Travelers who have already had to stay at the Aerotel note that every year the living conditions in it, unfortunately, are getting worse.  At the same time, prices are getting higher.  Nevertheless, for transit passengers this is the only option for relaxation, because it is very convenient that you do not need to leave the airport anywhere.  Even despite the cramped rooms, the poor quality of cleaning and other shortcomings that we talked about, hotel reservations are booked several weeks in advance. </p>
