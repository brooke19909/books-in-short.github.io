And one who always watches his figure can lose extra pounds in the gym. </p><p>  After twenty hours, the hotel organizes discos, shows and theme nights. </p><p>  The pride of the hotel are its three pools, the cleanliness of the water in which the staff carefully monitors.  There are always a lot of sunbeds and umbrellas. </p><h2>  Sightseeing Tours </h2><p>  Residents of Continental Garden Reef 5 *, reviews of which are mostly positive, can book interesting trips to local attractions with the administration.  One of the most interesting places is the hot springs located on the west coast, not far from the tunnel leading to Sharm El Sheikh.  First you must visit Aiun Moussa or ‚ÄúThe Sources of Moses,‚Äù where, according to biblical tradition, the righteous hit the ground five times with a staff, and springs appeared there. </p><p>  An hour's drive from the hotel is the Hamam Pharaoh, or Pharaoh's Baths.  Here, springs are beating everywhere - from under the cliff, from the bottom of the sea. </p><p>  There are three reserves on the <span>Sinai Peninsula at</span> once - Ras Mohammed, Nabq and Ras Abu Galum.  All of them are protected by the Egyptian state.

    <p>  The rooms are carefully cleaned, bed linen is clean.  The only barrier to communication with staff for some is lack of knowledge of the English language.  However, the administration solved this problem by hiring two Russian-speaking workers. </p><p>  The abundance of places where you can eat at the hotel, too, many liked it.  And although the ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù system could only be eaten in the main restaurant, the menu presented as a buffet had a lot of meat dishes, chicken and fish.  In the evenings, something was grilled on the grill on the restaurant terrace.  Many vacationers liked the opportunity to make and season salads from the proposed ingredients themselves. </p><p>  The menu offers a large assortment of pastries.  Judging by the reviews, inadequate quantities of fruits and vegetables were served, which is surprising for an Egyptian hotel.  In addition, some were surprised that with the all-inclusive power system, three dollars had to be paid separately for the espresso. </p>
