In the surrounding lands, people have settled since ancient times.  This territory in the Middle Ages was part of the Kholm principality, which was an integral part of the principality of Tver, the path to which was blocked by the Nikolsky monastery, located in the village of Nikolo-Pustyn.  This settlement in the XIII-XIV centuries was more significant than now. </p><p>  The article provides information about the village of Princely Mountains, located in the Tver region. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.0789068" data-lng="35.231346099999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/4/9/3/9493.png"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The village is located in the Zubtsovsky district.  Here passes the Moscow-Rzhev-Riga railway line, which is the historical Moscow-Vindava railway.  The distance from this settlement to the Moscow-Riga station is about 173 kilometers. </p><p>  The village of Knyazhye Gory is the administrative center of the Knyazhyegorsky settlement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="arnyfrazer.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The surroundings of the Princely Mountains" class="if uuid-2861150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2861150.jpg"></div><h2>  Description, characteristics </h2><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe settlement is 25 210 hectares.  At the beginning of the 20th century, the village belonged to the volost of the Krasnokholmsky Zubtsovsky district.  Cargo turnover  The station in the years 1902-1903 amounted to more than 1 million pounds per year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1918-1921, the village was the center of the Krasnokholmsky volost of the Zubtsovsky district, and then from 1922 to 1925 it began to belong to the Rzhevsky district. </p><p>  In the village of Knyazhye Gory, there is now an administration of the rural district, a kindergarten, a school, a library, a culture center, an outpatient clinic, a hospital and 6 shops.  There is also a fraternal cemetery of soldiers who died in the Second World War. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the soldiers" class="if uuid-2861197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2861197.jpg"></div><p>  The main enterprise in the village is the Knyazhegorsky timber industry enterprise, which manages the railway.  By 2009, narrow-gauge railway traffic was discontinued.  Previously, the UZhD exported the extracted forests and production waste.  Today, almost the entire highway has been dismantled, and as of 2013, the narrow gauge railway remained only on the territory of the enterprise for domestic transportation. </p><p>  In 1997, the population of the village was 1,250; by 1999, it was 1,500.  In 2008, the population decreased to 1,089 people, and according to the 2010 census, it amounted to 989 people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kn-shkola.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rural school" class="if uuid-2861170" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2861170.jpg"></div><h2>  How it all started </h2><p>  More than a century ago, there was neither a station nor a village on geographical maps.  At that time, only the village known as the Princely Mountains was known, which was the estate <span>of the Shakhovsky princes.</span>  By the name of this small settlement, the Moscow-Vindavskaya railway station was named.  village, built 12 kilometers from the settlement. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the period of construction work, the well-known Ulyanovsk merchants began to move to these places with their farm: Ryabov, Krylov and Zhelezkin.  In September 1901, the movement of trains was opened.  At that time, the station had a fairly large cargo turnover. </p><div class="photo" data-original="railwayz.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Princes' Mountains Station Building" class="if uuid-2861195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2861195.jpg"></div><h2>  The history of the development of the village </h2><p>  The pristine settlement of Knyazhy Gory began to develop rapidly.  Residential buildings and trading shops were built.  In a two-story brick building there is a tavern with rooms for rest of passing passengers.  Inns appeared for the poorer.  The main street was well equipped. </p><div class="photo" data-original="liberties.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shop in Prince's Mountains" class="if uuid-2861157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2861157.jpg"></div><p>  Unfortunately, all this was doomed to destruction.  The fact is that the station was built on the watershed of two rivers - Shosha and Derzh, and 2 streams flowed through the village: the small river Chubeyevka flowed into Shosha, and Kishkinka - into Derzh.  At the last, a dam was erected, which contributed to a rise in the water level by 3 meters.  And the reservoir was intended for refueling passing locomotives.  All this led to catastrophic consequences: the groundwater level rose so much that the soils everywhere began to become waterlogged, and the terrain became very swampy.  Around the once prosperous village of Princely Mountains, the number of swamps increased. </p><p>  And the Second World War left a tangible mark in this village.  The population remained under occupation for 99 days.  In January 1941, the village was liberated, and its restoration began.  The very current Knyazhegorsky timber industry enterprise was created in 1954. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shosha River" class="if uuid-2861161" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2861161.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The climate of the entire Tver region as a whole is temperate continental, transitional from continental in the eastern to more humid regions of the north-western regions. </p><p>  March, all summer months and September are the best for a trip to the Tver region (Princes' Mountains).  The weather as a whole is comfortable for relaxation and life.  The average daily summer temperatures are plus 15-20 ¬∞ , winter - minus 5-15 ¬∞ .  Annual precipitation is from 550 to 750 mm. </p><p>  The beginning of the winter period with frost falls in November, and its duration is 5-6 months.  The main feature of the summer period, the duration of which is 3 months, is the establishment of warm and humid, but rather variable weather. </p>
