  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Winter Fun - Snow Sculptures</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The winter season is not only frost, a piercing icy wind and impassable snowdrifts, but also a huge amount of snow.  Adults may be indifferent to this phenomenon or even negatively, but children are always delighted with the first snow.  And the point here is not only in the upcoming New Year holidays and vacations, but also in the fact that snow is a wonderful material for all kinds of sculptures. </p><h2>  How to make a snowman? </h2><p>  The first image that appears in my head at the mention of snow sculptures is a snowman.  It is ideal as a child sculpture made of snow.  Surely there will not be a single adult who would not make snowmen at a young age.  Making such a <span>sculpture of snow</span> with your own hands is very simple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.istockphoto.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.istockphoto.com/ru/%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%B8/snowman"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY snow sculptures" class="if uuid-2314647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2314647.jpg"></div><h2>  Step by Step </h2><p>  So let's get started: </p><ol><li>  It is necessary to make three balls, the sizes of which will differ from each other.  One is large, the second is medium, the third is small. </li><li>  The hands of a snowman are also made of snow, their shape and dimensions depend solely on the imagination of the author. </li><li>  For the manufacture of the nose, the most ordinary carrot is suitable. </li><li>  Eyes can be made from unnecessary buttons. </li><li>  For the mouth, a small hole is formed in the ball, which serves as the head. </li><li>  As a hat, you can put an unnecessary bucket or an old hat on a snowman. </li></ol><p>  The most common snow sculpture is ready. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What else can be blinded? </h2><p>  The simplest crafts made of snow include animals.  If we talk about snowmen, then they are classics, but such are in almost every yard and near any playground.  And if you want to create something unusual and memorable?  So why not consider creating a snow sculpture of some beast or bird? </p><p>  In winter, some people decorate their windowsills with small sculptures of snow in the form of blue or bullfinches.  Others go even further and decorate their yard with the characters of various cartoon characters.  It‚Äôs all a matter of man‚Äôs imagination, and if it‚Äôs not enough, you can look at the photo of the snow sculptures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.boredpanda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="snow sculptures" class="if uuid-2314642" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2314642.jpg"></div><h2>  How to blind a penguin? </h2><p>  The base will also be a large snowball that needs to be rolled up.  Do not despair, if you do not get a perfectly smooth lump, then you can get rid of the shortcomings. </p><p>  For the body of this bird, you will need to make a couple more snow balls, but smaller than the base.  After the blanks are made, they are set one on top of the other from larger to smaller.  At first glance, it seems that work is underway on a simple snowman, but this is not so. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.frikkinawesome.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.frikkinawesome.com/images/funny-and-crazy-snowmen/"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY snow sculptures" class="if uuid-2314650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2314650.jpg"></div><h2>  The formation of the trunk and legs </h2><p>  For the penguin to be a penguin, you will need more snow, with which the joints between the balls are smoothed so that the body becomes pear-shaped. </p><p>  The bird has paws, which means that they should be in the snow sculpture.  There is nothing complicated here.  Small amounts of snow are collected near the bottom of the craft and oblong clumps are fashioned.  With the help of a scapula or stick, it is necessary to form membranes. </p><h2>  Wings and tail </h2><p>  In nature, penguins in most of their lives keep their wings tightly pressed to the body.  This feature greatly facilitates the work on the snow sculpture.  To make these parts of the craft smooth, it is recommended on each side to make marks where the wings will be. </p><p>  Again, snow will be needed, which sticks directly to the body of the bird in such quantity until both wings begin to stand out against the background of the body. </p><p>  The tail is the easiest part of an entire penguin.  A little snow should be compacted tightly in the place where the tail is planned.  All that is needed is to make it of the necessary form. </p><h2>  Beak Work </h2><p>  Now the snow bird lacks only one finishing touch, namely, the beak.  Perhaps this element is the hardest to do, but nothing is impossible.  Not everyone from the first attempt turns out to make a snowball in the form of a cone, as soon as it is ready, it must be rammed to a solid state. </p><p>  Size is important.  A very large beak just does not last long on a penguin and falls off.  To prevent this from happening, you need to form a medium-sized cone.  This element is attached to the head ball with snow, but this must be done carefully so as not to damage the penguin's head. </p><p>  For reliability, the beak can be attached using a twig.  She sticks into the head and already in the right amount of snow is sticking to her. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tipsntidbits.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="snow sculptures in kindergarten" class="if uuid-2314652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2314652.jpg"></div><p>  So, the penguin from the snow is ready.  If desired, it can be painted to match the natural color of the bird, using spray cans with coloring liquid.  Or just put on a snow bird a scarf with a hat to make it unusual and recognizable.  The snow sculptures listed in the article in the kindergarten will be an excellent entertainment for kids. </p>
