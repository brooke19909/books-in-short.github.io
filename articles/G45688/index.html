  <section class="page js-page"><h1>General characteristics and use of oxygen</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The most common element on our planet is oxygen: in water it is 89%, in air about 21%, in the human body - 65%.  It is synthesized artificially and widely used in medicine in the treatment of various forms of oxygen starvation, as well as in poisoning with <span>bertholite salt,</span> nitrites, and CO (displaces <span>carbon monoxide</span> from its bio compounds with blood hemoglobin).  <span>Oxygen therapy is</span> indicated for large blood loss, tuberculosis, shallow breathing, pulmonary edema, prolonged exposure to <span>thin air</span> , etc. </p><p>  What is the composition of oxygen?  Its molecule (O2) consists of two atoms linked together by a covalent bond.  To date, many laboratory methods for the synthesis of this gas are known.  Innovative technologies allow it to be produced on an industrial scale.  The main raw materials for the industrial synthesis of oxygen are water and air.  To obtain O2 from air, it is first liquefied under high pressure and quenched, after which rectification is carried out in distillation columns in which air is repeatedly evaporated and condensed.  The specified method allows to obtain oxygen with an admixture of inert gases (xenon, krypton) and nitrogen (about 1.5%).  When using the electrolytic method, O2 is obtained from water without the above gas impurities. </p><p>  <strong>Oxygen properties</strong> </p><p>  O2 - a gas that has neither taste nor smell, supports combustion well, but does not burn itself.  The specified substance reacts with almost any elements except inert gases.  Oxygen is highly soluble in water and 95-degree ethanol. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Authentication Test</strong> </p><p>  To identify O2, it is necessary to collect the gas in a test tube and bring a smoldering bore to it.  In the presence of oxygen, the flare will flash and burn with a bright flame.  How to differentiate oxygen from <span>nitrous oxide?</span>  Its impurities together with O2 form nitrogen oxides, which are released in the form of orange smoke. </p><p>  <strong>The mechanism of action and the use of oxygen</strong> </p><p>  With a deficiency of this gas, <span>oxygen starvation</span> occurs in the body <span>.</span>  Due to this pathology, the functional activity of the nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular systems is disturbed, shortness of breath, cyanosis appears, blood pressure decreases, asphyxia sets in.  With the introduction of oxygen into the body, these phenomena disappear. </p><p>  <strong>The use of oxygen mixed with CO2.</strong>  <strong>Methods of its introduction into the body</strong> </p><p>  There are several ways to introduce oxygen into the body: by inhalation through the nose (using a catheter), through the mouth (inhalation through the mouthpiece from the pillow), under the skin.  Subcutaneous administration is practiced, for example, in the treatment of elephantiasis, gangrene, trophic ulcers.  So-called oxygen cocktails are widely used - oxygen-enriched drinks in the form of foam.  This use of oxygen is recommended in the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.  Prolonged inhalation of pure O2 is irritating to the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract. </p><p>  In medical practice, a mixture of oxygen with CO2, carbon dioxide, is often used, which has an exciting effect on the respiratory center.  Today, a variety of mixtures of oxygen with CO2 are used (most often with a carbon dioxide content of up to 10 percent).  These drugs include carbogen (not to be confused with carbolen - activated carbon).  It is stored in special containers under pressure.  The use of oxygen in a mixture with carbolene is indicated in the treatment of glaucoma, as well as in carbon monoxide poisoning. </p><p>  <strong>Oxygen Storage Methods</strong> </p><p>  Oxygen is stored in special seamless steel cylinders, which are painted in blue.  The specified containers are manufactured only at specialized factories and enterprises.  It should be remembered that in order to avoid fire or explosion, cranes, as well as cutting <span>oxygen cylinders</span> , must not be oiled. </p>
