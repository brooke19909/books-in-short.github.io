    <h2>  Wellness programs and caring procedures </h2><p>  Of course, everyone who comes to rest would like to relax both in body and soul.  If you are going to attend an event at a hotel or outside, for example, going to a disco, a bar, a party or a restaurant, it is important to look well-groomed and attractive.  In Ambassador Plaza Hotel 4 * in Kemer, wellness activities are provided.  They include spa programs, water massages, skin and nail care, various types of showers and baths, a sauna and a bath.  The hotel also offers the services of a gym (where there is a treadmill, a bicycle trainer, step aerobics facilities) and a fitness center (where you can train under the guidance of an instructor). </p><h2>  Advantages of the hotel </h2><p>  Ambassador Plaza Hotel 4 * in Turkey is very popular among tourists, including citizens of our country.

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Not all guests can say that they are completely satisfied with the service and infrastructure of the Turkish hotel.  Some note the disadvantages of the institution.  The negative location of the Ambassador Plaza Hotel 4 * in Kemer is the remote location of the hotel from the sea coast (you have to go around the building and cross the road to reach the beach).  Pebbles instead of sand are not too familiar and convenient for tourists.  Some vacationers do not like the fact that towels on the beach are not given out for free, if they do not want to spend extra money, they are forced to take a towel from their room. </p><p>  Also, according to tourists, the hotel is not too developed a system of recreational activities.  To visit them, you need to go to the city center.  Not everyone can do this, because they care about their safety.  However, if you are looking for a calm and measured rest, the question of animation is most likely not too important. </p>
