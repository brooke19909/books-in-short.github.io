This article will talk about wifi technology, and without further details about how the home wifi network should be configured. </p><p>  Creating a wifi network </p><p>  For example, you can take this set of devices: a personal computer, printer, laptop, ADSL access to the Internet, a PDA, and set the task - to connect all these devices to the home network.  What are the benefits?  Using wifi technology, you can exchange files, use Internet access on your home network, use a shared printer, and all this will be done practically without using wires. </p><p>  Let's figure out what wifi technology is.  It assumes the possibility of <span>transmitting data</span> using radio waves, and this is where the main disadvantages and advantages of wifi are.  The advantage is that wires are not used, which so often are an obstacle that you can trip over, or an object of interest to the pet.  However, the radius of the network is noticeably reduced due to the presence of walls and foliage of trees.  Of course, you can increase the range of your wireless network if you use more powerful transmit antennas or include several routers in a chain. </p><p>  Is your home wifi network safe? </p><p>  For a long time in <span>the media</span> they say that prolonged use of the wireless network negatively affects human health.  However, at the moment there is no accurate data that would confirm the presence of a negative impact. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What devices are needed if you need a home wifi network? </p><p>  For each of the devices participating in the wireless home network, you must install a wireless network adapter, that is, a wireless <span>network card.</span>  All models of modern laptops, some personal computers, smartphones and communicators already contain such devices in their equipment.  But very often to create a wireless network you need to purchase network adapters yourself.  You can consider the case when, with the above set of devices, all devices except the personal computer and printer already have wireless adapters. </p><p>  You will need a router, which will be entrusted with the functions of controlling the operation of devices among themselves.  The router acts as a gateway between the Internet and your computer.  Communication between all devices will be carried out through high-frequency radio waves.  For a small apartment, one router is enough, its average range is 30-40 meters. </p><p>  Home wifi network: connection </p><p>  The router must be combined with the modem, and a personal computer must be connected to the router via a <span>network cable</span> .  The task of the router is to distribute the Internet to all devices of the organized network, as well as provide access to the printer.  If you want the printer to be accessible to all network devices at any time, you must connect it directly to the router using the print server function.  It is important to remember that not every printer can be compatible with your router, so it‚Äôs worthwhile to clarify such details when buying.  And if we are talking about an MFP, then it may not be correctly determined by the router, so its functions will not be available.  An MFP is best connected directly to a desktop computer. </p><p>  <span>The wifi network settings</span> should be detailed in the instructions for the router, but there are certain points that are worth paying attention to.  For example, a question: how to protect a wifi network?  First of all, you need to enable network encryption.  It is also important to update antivirus software in time.  And it is absolutely necessary to set a complex password for the network.  So that no one can harm your network, it is necessary to use cryptographic passwords. </p>
