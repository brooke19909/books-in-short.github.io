  <section class="page js-page"><h1>If you do not turn off the iron, what will happen, what are the consequences?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The question of what will happen if you do not turn off the iron arose at least once in everyone‚Äôs life.  The device performs a useful function, but it is fraught with many dangers.  Often, reading news chronicles, you can find articles that talk about fires that arose because of the iron, or more precisely, the problem lay in the forgetful owner. </p><p>  Specialists and engineers of manufacturers are constantly studying this problem.  It all depends on various factors, ranging from the age of the model and its technical characteristics to the environment around the heating element.  In any case, the owners and owners of irons should be extremely careful to avoid disastrous consequences, up to the complete loss of real estate. </p><h2>  Features of the heating element of the iron </h2><p>  What will happen if you do not turn off the iron for an entire day in an upright position, it is better not to check it in practice.  From the stories of the owners of household appliances, some models behaved quite normally.  Arriving home, forgetful owners discovered a red-hot iron, but there were no serious consequences. </p><p>  Other users note that they left the household appliance on for just an hour.  He began to melt strongly and set on fire.  It all depends not only on the specific brand or model of the iron, but also on its technical characteristics. </p><p>  Owners understand that the heating element is power-dependent.  Many remember the old models, which are more than 10-15 years old.  In them, heating occurred to a specified degree and did not decrease.  Such irons were heated for a long time.  It was in them that there was a problem, since the heating element did not stop receiving power from the mains.  As a result, all the plastic elements located around began to melt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.weranda.pl" data-author=": Weranda, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old iron" class="if uuid-2948782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2948782.jpg"></div><p>  Then models with fast heating appeared on the markets.  Their distinctive feature was that when the power mode was activated, the sole of the iron heated up to the set temperature, and after that the sensor immediately turned off the heating until the device started to cool.  This allowed not only to save energy well, but also to avoid the defect described in older models. </p><p>  Modern irons are completely devoid of such risks of overheating or ignition.  For this, not only temperature sensors are installed inside, but also the position of the sole relative to the plane.  The iron in a vertical position cuts off the power supply. </p><h2>  Nuances of use </h2><p>  If you did not turn off the iron in the upright position of the new model, then nothing bad will happen.  However, there are many different factors that may violate this definition.  It all depends not only on the device itself, but also on the power supply. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.independent.co.uk" data-author=": Laura Brickman, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Iron while ironing" class="if uuid-2948755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2948755.jpg"></div><p>  When buying, you should not save and purchase an old model or already used before by someone.  It is not known whether the appliance was damaged or if a relay is in normal condition, which heats the sole. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is not recommended to use irons that have been physically damaged.  In the event of a fall, any contact on the microcircuit may close, which can lead to the closure of elements and their subsequent ignition.  In case of damage, it is better to take the device to a service center for inspection. </p><h2>  Overheat Protection Systems </h2><p>  What will happen if you do not turn off the iron, many understand it.  Almost everyone has a story in store as a monitored household appliance made a lot of problems for forgetful owners.  To do this, to reduce the risk of fire and damage to property, manufacturers have introduced new protection technologies. </p><p>  Fuses installed in all modern models and versions save the device from a sudden power surge.  Additionally, sensors are placed to control the location of the sole relative to the plane.  The set and set temperature conditions in the iron allow avoiding high and continuous heating. </p><p>  If the sole is very hot, the iron will turn off until the temperature drops.  However, when choosing an iron, it is worthwhile to clarify information about the protection systems either from a consultant, or independently search them on the box of the device. </p><h2>  Tripping in vertical and horizontal position </h2><p>  If we consider the question of what will happen if you do not turn off the iron in a vertical or horizontal position, it is important to find the ratio of conditions and a specific model.  There are no identical parameters of devices from different manufacturers of household appliances.  All information about the shutdown conditions can be found only in the technical description or instructions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.greenprophet.com" data-author=": Hannah Katsman, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hot sole of the iron" class="if uuid-2948778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2948778.jpg"></div><p>  The question of what will happen if you do not turn off the iron at home has many features due to the difference in the characteristics of the models.  Many manufacturers make advertising of new product models from this, showing in a video that a household appliance left even for a day in a horizontal position does not harm the surface. </p><p>  If you forgot to turn off the iron in an upright position, in the presence of the fact that this is a new model, with a greater degree of probability nothing will happen to it.  Many owners share stories about how the abandoned model lasted a day and did no harm.  But it‚Äôs better not to check these stories. </p><h2>  Precautionary measures </h2><p>  To avoid fire and property loss, it‚Äôs important to remember a few simple rules: </p><ol><li>  Use only high-quality boards to iron clothes.  Modern models have special compartments for irons.  In this case, the connection goes specifically to the board, on which a surge protector is also installed.  The fabric itself is fireproof, which avoids a fire even when the iron is left in a horizontal position. </li><li>  The socket into which the iron is connected must be in good condition.  Any heating elements in household appliances are vulnerable to strong power surges.  Therefore, in a fire, it often turns out that at first it was not the iron itself that started to burn, but the outlet. </li><li>  Buy models only from well-known brands and with a guarantee.  The household appliance market is growing every day.  Even in specialized stores there are previously unfamiliar brands and models.  No matter how interesting they are, it is better to abandon experiments and testing, even if the price is two to three times lower than already known brands. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.californiainspector.com" data-author=": Home Inspectors, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cause of fire" class="if uuid-2948788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2948788.jpg"></div><p>  If you have pets or small children, it is necessary to limit their access to the iron when ironing. </p><h2>  Possible consequences </h2><p>  If you do not turn off the iron for a day, there will be trouble.  It is about old or damaged models.  Even if 10 years ago the device was bought for a lot of money, today it will work at best at best.  The wear of the heating elements is high, which is why they often fail. </p><p>  The minimum loss that may occur when leaving the iron is its complete failure.  In this case, it is enough just to purchase a new one.  It is important to observe safety precautions, and when it detects that the iron is turned on, it must first be de-energized, and only then try to touch so as not to cause burns. </p><h2>  How to avoid fire </h2><p>  The answer to the question of whether the irons themselves are turned off, if you forgot to turn it off, will depend on the specific device model.  In order to avoid fire due to their confusion, it is important to secure the space where ironing takes place. </p><p>  The best example is the bathroom.  It is usually completely insulated and has no free ventilation.  In addition, most bathrooms are tiled and porcelain.  Materials have a fireproof effect.  Even if the iron ignites, the flame cannot spread far. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goodhousekeeping.com" data-author=": Carolyn Forte, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flat iron" class="if uuid-2948787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2948787.jpg"></div><p>  It is strictly forbidden to iron clothes near open windows where there are curtains.  Basically, curtains and other paintings are made of light and fire hazardous material.  One touch of a hot sole is enough for a tulle or curtain to start burning. </p><h2>  What model of iron to choose </h2><p>  What will happen if you do not turn off the iron for the whole day, having an expensive and high-quality model, the question is also interesting.  Basically, as practice and user reviews on various thematic resources show, expensive models are much less likely to fail in such an incident. </p><p>  The price of products in this case is formed not only from the value of the brand itself, but also the prices of component parts inside the household appliance.  The more expensive the installed modules, the better and more reliable the iron works. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mrright.in" data-author=": SHIPRA MANGLA, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Abandoned iron" class="if uuid-2948791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2948791.jpg"></div><p>  High build quality are models from German and Polish manufacturers.  They are often pioneers in the home appliance world and introduce new security systems to reduce the risk of potential overheating or fire. </p><h2>  How not to forget to turn off the iron </h2><p>  Having dealt with the question, what will happen if you do not turn off the iron, you should talk about how to remember to turn off household appliances.  It is important to make notes for yourself that are noticeable.  Many owners go to the trick and do electrical wiring in the bathroom, which is turned off on the counter.  Leaving the house, they simply de-energize all rooms in which electricity is not needed. </p><p>  You can also make reminders on your phone.  Knowing your schedule and the days when ironing takes place, it‚Äôs simple enough to turn on the notification for 15-20 minutes before that. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cleaning.lovetoknow.com" data-author=": Michele Wanke, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Damaged Iron" class="if uuid-2948761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/106747/2948761.jpg"></div><p>  The last and so far the most expensive method is the use of "smart home" technologies.  They consist in the fact that various sensors and devices are installed in the room, which can be controlled through the application in the phone.  Thanks to this, the power regulators on the outlets will signal the abandoned iron.  All that the user needs is to disconnect it remotely through the smartphone. </p>
