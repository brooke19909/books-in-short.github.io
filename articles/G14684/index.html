Taiwanese and Chinese iPhone 5s</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Some time ago, they almost stopped buying Chinese copies.  They were frankly of poor quality, manufacturers tried to come up with more and more applications for a standard smartphone and added extra SIM cards, a TV tuner, and retractable antennas to it.  Not so long ago, a copy of the iPhone 5S became popular.  Reviews on the network for her are quite flattering. </p><h2>  Where copies of smartphones of famous brands are made </h2>

In most cases, copies are made from spare parts that were produced in additional batches at these plants.  Now you can buy copies that are made most often in Taiwan. <br>  Any copy of the <span>iPhone 5S</span> customer <span>reviews</span> is quite good.  On the one hand, this is surprising (if you remember the bad experience in producing Nokia replicas), and on the other, it makes you think about buying. <br>  There are several ways to get a copy of your iPhone: <br>  ‚Ä¢ through the Internet; <br>  ‚Ä¢ in small communication salons; <br>  ‚Ä¢ on radio markets or in transitions. <br>  It‚Äôs best to refrain from the last place to shop.  Chinese copies of the iPhone 5S purchased this way usually fail quite quickly.  In stores, including those working via the Internet, you can even be given a guarantee on distributed products.

At the moment, a copy made in factories in China and Taiwan cannot be distinguished in appearance.  The case material, like the original, is aluminum.  It is made in the same colors as the real one. <br>  If we look at the smartphone from the side of the screen, then there are also no deviations from the design of the usual "apple" gadget.  The screen is covered by a sufficiently thick glass (it does not give glare and is resistant to scratches), the Home button is in its place.

Android is installed on the copies, but at first glance it is impossible to notice.  It is completely stylized under iOS 7. You can see the difference if you click on the AppStore icon.  You will be automatically redirected to the Google app store. <br>  Despite this, a copy of the iPhone 5S, which we reviewed for writing this review, is very popular, and the build of the operating system is quite high quality.  Translation is also not satisfactory.  Unlike copies that were made earlier, Russification is complete.  The font is also indistinguishable from the original.  All names and words fully convey the purpose of the application.  If you click on the calendar icon, then you‚Äôll go to the right application, and don‚Äôt get into the player or alarm menu. <br>  The reviews confirm that you can install any application from Android on such a gadget.  At the same time, it will also be stylized as an IOS design.  If someone sees the desktop of your smartphone from the side, then there will be absolutely no differences at first glance.  You can only find inconsistencies if you use the gadget.

In a high-quality copy, it is installed on the side of the phone in a special tray.  A part of the users‚Äôs copy of the iPhone 5S receives negative reviews precisely because of this, since it is necessary to trim the existing card to nano-SIM cards, and many users would like to avoid this.  However, without this, a copy cannot be considered absolutely accurate.  The replica cannot be distinguished by this feature of the iPhone.  In the kit you will find a key with which you can pry the SIM card tray.

Among the offers of online stores there are powerful models with a processor for two or four cores.  They are quite productive and will be able to pull even the most demanding applications and games. <br>  Memory can also be found in several versions.  A copy of the iPhone 5S (Taiwan) receives the best reviews if the amount of memory in it is equal to the original.  Firstly, these are the most accurate replicas, and secondly, they have enough space for applications, as well as other characteristics, which are usually higher than those that have the standard for smartphones with Android 4 or 8 gigabytes of memory. <br>  The displays on the copies of the famous gadget are also put closest to the original.  First of all, there are no differences in size.  They perfectly reproduce colors and support the work with five-point multi-touch.  The only difference may be the inability to use the gadget with gloves, after all, the touch recognition system remains thermal. <br>  Enough powerful batteries are put on the copy, which they hide under the cover of the case and make, as in the original, inaccessible without disassembly.  On average, you can find <span>battery capacity</span> from 1500 mAh.  In standby mode, the gadget can spend up to 300 hours, you can talk without connecting to the mains for about 5 hours, listen to music for about 10 hours without stopping, and play or watch a video in just 3 hours.  These parameters are enough for comfortable use of the gadget.

It is best to also pay attention to this symptom when choosing.  If you are offered to buy a smartphone with a front camera of 0.3 megapixels, and with a rear camera of 2.3 megapixels, then it is better to refuse to purchase.  This is a crude fake, and it is likely that the manufacturer saved on other spare parts. <br>  In a better copy, you can use a 5MP camera for video calls, and take pictures with a rear camera of 8MP.  In addition, there must be an LED flash and autofocus.  Note whether the replica has the following features: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Record video in HD. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to use color effects. <br>  ‚Ä¢ White balance. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Panoramic shooting. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Self-timer. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Face recognition. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Burst shooting. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Image Stabilizer. <br>  ‚Ä¢ ZOOM. <br>  A phone that has good features is capable of replacing a conventional digital camera.  He is able to save you from having to take two gadgets with you to the event.

    <h2>  Does the replica work well as a phone </h2><p>  If you want to buy iPhone 5S (Taiwanese copy), feedback about the quality of communication should be of interest to you.  Could not find negative words about the speakers or microphone of the phone.  The interlocutor is well audible, and the sound is clear, without creaking and wheezing.  Users recommend that the description pay attention to the manufacturer of the sound filling.  Best if the speakers are from a Yamaha manufacturer.  This company is famous for its high performance sound equipment. <br>  If you like to take voice notes, then there is no need to shout loudly into the microphone.  When testing the Voice Recorder application, there were no problems with microphone sensitivity. </p><h2>  How to distinguish a good copy in packaging and packaging </h2><p>  First of all, pay attention to the headphone jack and USB cable, they should not differ from the standard ones.  The audio output should be 3.5 mm and no other.  Now a good smartphone comes with a <span>pair of vacuum headphones,</span> and you should find just those in your bundled iPhone copy.  The USB cable should also be no different.  You should see a standard connector on the phone‚Äôs body itself, and the cable itself in high-quality replicas is made in white and the design completely repeats Apple products. <br>  Boxes are usually absolutely identical to those in which the original gadgets are placed.  Inside, in addition to the phone, charger, USB cable and headphones, there should be instructions, advertising inserts and a <span>warranty card.</span>  If the manufacturer is ready to bear responsibility for his goods, then this is credible. </p><h2>  Should I buy a non-original phone </h2>

On average, prices for copies are 5 times less than for original gadgets.  You should not choose a smartphone at a <span>bargain price,</span> because for 3-4 thousand you will receive a phone that is no different from the budget. <br>  When buying online, pay attention to the method of payment for the parcel.  If the seller is ready to send the goods by <span>cash on delivery,</span> then there is usually nothing to fear.  Upon receipt by mail, you can check the goods, and only then pay.  If you are asked to deposit the full amount at once, then the acquisition is very risky.  The case may turn out to be plastic, the characteristics are basic, and the camera may be weak.
