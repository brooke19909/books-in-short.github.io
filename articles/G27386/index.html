    <p>  It is often set as an example for the younger generation.  Several streets in the post-Soviet space are named after the Hero of the Soviet Union. </p><h2>  Khanpasha Nuradilov: biography </h2><p>  Khanpasha was born in the territory of modern Dagestan in 1924.  Since childhood, he worked hard with his family.  In the village of Minai-Togai, he was educated in elementary school.  He worked for some time in oil wells.  He worked as a butterman.  At the age of nineteen, he was drafted into the Red Army.  Almost from the first days of the beginning of World War II, he fought at the front. </p><h2>  Baptism of fire </h2><p>  After the invasion of German troops on the territory of the Soviet Union, the Red Army continuously retreated. </p>

    <p>  At this time, urgently formed combat units from the mobilized population and soldiers of military service.  Khanpasha Nuradilov barely reached nineteen years old when he was sent to the front line.  He commanded a machine gun crew in the cavalry division.  Under normal conditions, mounted troops should not take part in containing the breakthrough of mechanized formations.  However, due to the difficult situation on all fronts, the command sent all available reserves to the defense of Soviet land.  Khanpasha Nuradilov took the first battle with the invaders in the Donetsk steppes.  In the coastal village of Zakharovka, his unit received orders to keep the defense.  After some time, a massive shelling of the Red Army positions began.  After him, the enemy infantry went on the offensive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In battle, all of Khanpasha‚Äôs comrades died.  He was left alone and injured.  Confident that no one would resist them, the Germans went to seize the position.  But the young man decided to continue the fight.  Alone, he fired at the advancing infantry.  A few hours later, the German offensive was choking.  The wounded Khanpasha killed one hundred and twenty Nazis and returned alive.  The command was struck by the staunchness and skill of the fighter.  After all, machine guns of that time were a rather complicated mechanism.  Changing the tape alone, cooling and cleaning them was extremely inconvenient, and the Red Army was still injured ... </p><h2>  Soviet counterattack </h2><p>  Nuradilov Khanpasha Nuradilovich made a new feat a year later.  In the harsh winter of the forty-second, Soviet troops in many sectors of the front went on the counterattack. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nuradilov khanpasha nuradilovich" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1326682.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Nuradilov‚Äôs unit is located near the village of Tolstoy.  It was necessary to step in conditions of extremely low temperature and high snow.  At the same time, the Germans managed to dig in quite seriously and held the defense well.  During a raid on Hitler‚Äôs trenches Khanpasha rushed ahead of the attackers with a machine gun and cleared the way for the infantry.  Again, alone, he destroyed fifty Germans.  In addition, he managed to destroy four German machine-gun crews, which was extremely difficult.  After a successful offensive, the command introduced Nuradilov to the military order and promoted. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the same winter, the forty-second division was sent to Kursk.  In a small settlement of Shchigry, Nuradilov takes a tough battle with the Nazi fighters of the Wehrmacht and the SS.  During the battle, he is injured, and the gun fails.  Despite this, he again accomplishes the feat, killing two hundred Germans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khanpasha Nuradilov biography" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1326683.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  And less than two months later, at the hands of the Soviet machine gunner, another three hundred Nazis die near the village of Bayrak.  For these services, he is awarded another battle order. </p><h2>  Stalingrad </h2><p>  In the fall of forty-second, one of the most bloody battles in the history of mankind is played.  German troops break through to the east, reaching the Volga.  The last city on their way stops the advance - Stalingrad.  The best units from all theaters of operations are sent here. </p>

    <p>  In September, Nuradilov Khanpasha Nuradilovich arrives in the city on the Volga.  The fighting in this sector of the front is very different.  Classic tactical schemes do not work here.  It is necessary to advance and defend in the conditions of city ruins and continuous dense enemy fire.  Before the famous battles in Stalingrad itself, no less bloody clashes took place in the vicinity. </p><h2>  Hero's death </h2><p>  At the city of Serafimovich Khanpasha Nuradilov took his last battle.  Arriving in early autumn with the rank of commander of a machine-gun platoon, he dug in the suburbs.  The Nazis went into battle in the middle of the day with the support of aviation and artillery.  Khanpasha was seriously injured.  But again he remained to fight to the end.  To get to the Red Army, the Germans gave two hundred and fifty lives of their soldiers.  The wounded commander also destroyed two machine guns, after which he fell.  For this and other deeds, Nuradilov was posthumously awarded the Star of a Hero of the Soviet Union. </p><h2>  Memory of a fighter </h2><p>  About Khanpash several articles were published in the army newspaper.  After the war ended, several streets were named after him in his native Dagestan, as well as in Chechnya.  In the sixties, several poems were published that described how Hanpasha Nuradilov lived and fought.  <span>The hero of the Soviet Union</span> is depicted on a forty-fourth year postage stamp.  In 2015, a public foundation was named after him.  On the avenue of heroes of the Battle of Stalingrad there is a Khanpasha plate. </p>
