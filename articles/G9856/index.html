For those who want to visit Paris, nothing is impossible, it is enough to choose a direction: the village of Paris, the Chelyabinsk region.  Why not?  After all, there are other settlements in the Russian outback with no less sonorous names: London, Berlin, Leipzig, Kassel.  So, Paris is an ordinary village, of which there are thousands on the map of Russia.  But only in this there is a "real" Eiffel Tower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The village of Paris, Chelyabinsk region" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13387/279977.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Village history</strong> </p><p>  This is an ancient village in the south-east of the Chelyabinsk region, half an hour from the district center Fershampenuaz (another European name!) And a hundred kilometers from Magnitogorsk.  Indigenous people inhabit it - the small Nagaybaki people, which many have not even heard of.  The settlement was founded by Nagaybak Cossacks.  They were forcibly relocated beyond the Urals.  Prior to that, Orthodox nagaybaki-Kryashen (baptized) lived in what is now Bashkiria.  By decree of Nicholas I, along the perimeter of the southeastern borders of the Russian Empire, new-line Cossack fortresses were founded as barrage points.  Refusing to relocate was punishable - peoples and nationalities in Russia have always been an instrument of state policy, but voluntarily resettled people cut good tracts of land and helped with the construction of houses.  In the spring of 1842, the village of Paris was formed.  The Chelyabinsk region today represents this settlement among its attractions.  After all, he received his name in commemoration of the great victories of the Russian troops in the Patriotic War of 1812.  The Cossack regiment of the Nagaybaks met the victory over the Napoleonic army on the <span>streets of Paris.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paris village Chelyabinsk region" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13387/279978.jpg" width="317"></div>

Life is the most ordinary, rustic.  The population is not large, but not small for a modern village - two thousand people.  800 houses on 11 streets, almost all buildings are single-story, with the exception of several two-story buildings of the "Khrushchev" layout.  And everything else, as elsewhere: there is a school named after Vasily Blucher, the House of Culture, a local hospital, a kindergarten.  People are mainly engaged in agriculture, horses are bred, rye is bred - she will be born well here.  Young people, as elsewhere, do not really want to stay in their native village, go to study and work in the cities. </p><p>  <strong>And what is interesting about the village, besides history?</strong> </p><p>  What is the main attraction here - you can guess. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paris Chelyabinsk region map" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13387/281039.jpg" width="324"></div><br>  Of course, this is the Eiffel Tower, only its address is not France, but the village of Paris, the Chelyabinsk region.  It was built recently - in 2006 the grand opening took place.  Dimensions - 5: 1 relative to the original.  And here the tower fulfills its working function - it serves as the tower of the Uralsvyazinform mobile communications operator.  The construction was completed in record time ‚Äî three months ‚Äî at the Zlatoust Steel Plant.  However, it would be wrong to call this tower the only feature of Paris.  The villagers are fond and proud of their past; they also have their own Museum of the History of the Village, opened in a strong Cossack house, which once belonged to the wealthy merchant Tinibayev.
