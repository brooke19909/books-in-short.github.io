Whatever you like.  But most travelers are trying to find out before departure what is the best option?  Well, everyone has their own answer to this question.  Honestly, both in one place and in another place there is something to see and how to be inspired.  People who have been there and there often think about which place is more interesting - Sochi or Crimea.  Where better to relax, everyone decides for himself.  Looking at the reviews, you can understand that in both places it‚Äôs good in its own way.  However, first things first. </p>

    <h2>  Service maintenance </h2><p>  The first thing worth noting is the attention to this aspect.  The vast majority of tourists stay in hotels and guest houses.  People who prefer the more budget option decide to rent an apartment or a house.  But still, if we consider the options of hotels, the Crimea is clearly losing. </p><p>  To begin with, I must say that the peninsula is large, but they go on vacation mainly to its South Coast (South Coast) and to Sevastopol.  A smaller part stops in Koktebel, Kerch, Sudak, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, in the Crimea there are not many good and famous hotels.  Travel sites give out 434 accommodation options in Sevastopol, while Sochi offers 750 different hotels.  And this is only official.  There are about 370 registered accommodation options in Yalta.  What is the point then, if the amount is almost the same?  As a service.  Sochi is a modern and actively visited city that has received a new round of popularity during the Olympics.  There was a considerable influx of foreigners - it is not surprising why all the hotels reached the highest level of service.  In addition, the competition present in the hotel business contributed to this. </p><p>  In Crimea, worthy options include the Yalta complexes Intourist, Oreanda Premier, Mriya, as well as Sevastopol in the city of the same name, the relatively new Aquamarine and Sand Bay. </p>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Well, who wins in terms of service - Crimea or Sochi - and so it is clear.  What in terms of climate?  In Sochi, it is humid, subtropical.  <span>It‚Äôs hot in summer and warm</span> in winter, you can walk in a <span>leather jacket.</span>  But in Crimea, about 20 (!) Climatic subregions are distinguished.  Despite its area of ‚Äã‚Äã27,000 km¬≤.  This is explained by the influence of several seas, altitudinal zonation of mountains and landforms.  In summer, it is just as hot here as in Sochi (it can even get worse), and in summer it is quite cold, often there is a kind of snow that melts quickly, because the cold does not last long here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, the question of where it is warmer - in the Crimea or in Sochi - cannot be answered.  Because the climate is about the same.  True, Sochi is more unique in terms of weather.  In winter, tourists can walk along the promenade along the sea, enjoying moderate coolness, after which they arrive at Krasnaya Polyana in ~ 1.5 hours and ski there, admiring the snowdrifts. </p>

    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  Perhaps the financial issue travelers are most interested in.  Cheaper Sochi or Crimea?  Many are surprised, but if you want to save money, it is better not to go to the peninsula.  Food, alcohol, accommodation - in Crimea for all of the above prices are 1.5-2 times higher.  You can verify this by strolling through the shops.  Why is that?  Crimeans themselves do not know.  This is explained by the fact that everything is delivered to the peninsula through the crossing, and this is an extra waste.  Perhaps, but Crimea has its own production of many products.  However, you can argue for a long time, but the fact remains that you can save in Sochi.  Although, if you go not to the resort epicenter (Yalta or Sevastopol), but somewhere to the picturesque Simeiz, you will be able to relax even more budgetally. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  So, a good example.  7 days of relaxation in the notorious ‚ÄúAquamarine‚Äù (with breakfast) will cost two for 100 000 rubles.  In the Grand Hotel Zhemchuzhina, the conditions are far from worse, you will have to pay 65,000 r for your vacation - and this is with half board.  In "Mriya" a week of rest will cost 140 000 r (breakfast only).  And even in the fashionable Sochi resort complex, known as the ‚ÄúRadisson Lazurnaya‚Äù (in terms of superior to the Yalta option), rest will cost 40 thousand cheaper. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  In short, it is worth noting the attention and comments left by tourists who visited the notorious resorts.  Many say about Sochi that this is a fairy tale city.  Attention is attracted by palm trees growing everywhere, modern architecture, good and comfortable beaches, souvenirs and all sorts of interesting things at symbolic prices.  The only negative noticed by tourists is the very hot temperature during the day.  At this time, spa guests are advised to stay at the hotel, and if you want to go to the sea, it is better to completely swim in a sunblock before this. </p><p>  In Crimea, although there are no palm trees, many people like the rest on the peninsula.  Attention is noted to the beautiful nature, a lot of quiet and secluded places that can be found even in big cities, as well as historical sights. </p>

    <h2>  Sights of Crimea </h2><p>  People go to resort towns not only to enjoy the sea and beach vacations.  Many are also interested in attractions.  What place does the plan win - Crimea or Sochi?  Well, in this case, the peninsula comes first. </p><p>  Firstly, there are two hero cities on its territory.  This is Kerch and Sevastopol.  In the second, there is also the main base of the Russian Navy.  But this is not the main thing.  In Sevastopol, you can go to Sapun-Hora, where during the war there were fierce defensive battles;  visit the "piece of Greece" - Chersonesos;  to go on an excursion to the Inkerman Vintage Wine Factory, where 1,050,000 decaliters of wine are stored;  as well as get acquainted with the panorama, diorama, go down to the defensive complex on the 35th battery and try to count the monuments, which are unmeasured here. </p><p>  Be sure to visit the famous Yalta Swallow's Nest and the Livadia Palace in Yalta (the former residence of Russian emperors), Chekhov's house (also on the South Coast) and Massandra Palace.  And this is only a small part of the interesting places that the peninsula boasts.  So it is not surprising why lovers of attractions, choosing Crimea or Sochi to relax, stop at the first option. </p>

    <h2>  Attractions Olympic </h2><p>  But still it cannot be said that in Sochi there is nothing to look at.  It's just that there are few historical sights.  But there is a large amusement park, arboretum, oceanarium, <span>Mount Akhun</span> (from the top of which you can see the coast of Turkey in good weather), Orekhovsky Falls, Navalishinsky Gorge and, of course, the modern AJ Hackett Sochi Skypark.  A place where everyone goes, even local ones.  Which is not surprising, because it is an adventure park at the height and the longest pedestrian suspension bridge in the world.  Its length is 439 meters.  And the height is 207 m. It seems that a little?  Then it‚Äôs enough to imagine a 69-story house.  It will be approximately equal to that height. </p><p>  In general, Sochi will not be bored either.  But not to history buffs - they‚Äôd better go to the peninsula. </p>

    <h2>  Living conditions </h2><p>  This is another point that should be noted by attention, talking about which resort is better to choose for a vacation - Crimea or Sochi.  Which is better in terms of conditions?  Of course, the second option.  And you don‚Äôt even have to explain why.  Sochi has been a part of Russia since 1838.  Actually, from the moment it was founded.  Crimea, if you do not take into account the situation in 1954 (when Khrushchev gave the peninsula to Ukraine) - almost three years. </p><p>  Accordingly, on its territory there is not everything that the Russian is used to.  ‚ÄúMagnets‚Äù, ‚ÄúFix-Prices‚Äù, Sberbanks, ‚ÄúVTB 24‚Äù, even ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù communication salons are all absent.  And the vast majority of people resting here complain about it.  As well as the quality of communication / mobile Internet (there is no question of the presence of towers).  And it really causes some inconvenience.  If you need to withdraw money from the card, you will have to pay some amount as a commission, since there are only ATMs of the RNKB and Genbank on the peninsula.  Not that these are bad organizations.  It's just that they are commercial ‚Äî there are no state in Crimea.  A network of more or less budgetary grocery supermarkets replaces ‚ÄúPUD‚Äù (formerly ‚ÄúATB‚Äù), ‚ÄúNovus‚Äù, ‚ÄúFourchette‚Äù, etc. </p><p>  So, where is it better - in Sochi or Crimea?  If a person is not led into a stupor by the lack of certain familiar amenities listed above, then, in principle, you can go to the peninsula. </p>

    <h2>  Nature </h2><p>  It is impossible not to ignore this topic, talking about where it is better - in the Crimea or in Sochi.  Nature is unique both in one and in another place.  In Sochi, this is the Boxwood and Crab Gorges, the ‚ÄúWonderful Beauty‚Äù waterfall, the so-called Dagomys troughs, the Vorontsov and <span>Akhshtyrskaya caves, and the</span> Matsesta waterfall.  And of course, the <span>Caucasian State Natural Biosphere Reserve.</span>  By size - the second largest in all of Europe.  Its area is 280 335 hectares!  And its highlight is the lakes, of which there are 120 pieces.  Is it worth talking about the richness of flora and fauna?  Here you can find different birds (248 species in total), amphibians, fish, mollusks, reptiles and mammals - cat, hedgehog, mole, jerboa, canine, bear, etc. And the flora is even more amazing: 900 species of plants and 720 mushrooms . </p><p>  Crimea is no less surprising.  What is only Ai-Petri Mountain, from the top of which the entire South Coast is in full view.  An absolutely stunning sight is the Grand Canyon, the Silver Jets Falls, Skelskaya Cave, the Ghost Valley at the foot of Demerdzhi, the Gorge of a thousand waterfalls, the Baydar Valley ... You can list endlessly.  It is insanely beautiful here - this will be the only correct conclusion, which is supported by numerous reviews of tourists. </p><p>  So - Sochi or Crimea?  Where better to relax?  There is still no answer to the question.  You can tell a lot of interesting facts - be the subject of discussion in Crimea or Sochi.  Which is better - everyone will decide for himself.  But you definitely won‚Äôt have to regret the trip to one place or another. </p>
