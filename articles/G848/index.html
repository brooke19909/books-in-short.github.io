The device was conditionally assigned to the economy class.  Against the background of its competitors, which work on the basis of the pre-installed Android OS, the device stands out in a good sense of the word.  The main advantage here was, of course, the presence of a quad-core processor.  At the time of release, the cost of the smartphone was about $ 60, so many people immediately had a question about how the Windows Phone operating system got accustomed to the device at that price.  What is the catch?  Perhaps we will talk more about this, but we will start with the prerequisites for the creation of Highscreen WinJoy, reviews of which instantly spread around all the forums. </p><h2>  Creation and positioning </h2>

    <p>  Of course, it has already become clear to everyone that the progress of flagship smartphones is starting to lose momentum.  As soon as the developers of mobile devices are not sophisticated, what kind of sensors they do not implement in their devices!  Often, many gadgets are equipped with a whole list of useless chips that perform useless functions.  At the same time, there is very fierce competition between budget mobile phones.  It turns out a sort of battlefield.  So far, the leading positions in a kind of race belong to Chinese brands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How and why? </h2>

    <p>  The Chinese have adopted low-quality components.  These are some devices from the MediaTek family, as well as Spreadtrum.  In addition, many Chinese phones are delivered to the market with the pre-installed Android operating system version 4.2 (or 4.4).  A significant role is played by the factor of luck.  If the buyer of such a device is lucky, then for absolutely ridiculous money he will receive a device that he can use for many years, and he will be very, very pleased with it.  Often, such smartphones are called ‚Äúimmortal,‚Äù because their useful life is impressive, and the device simply ignores threats of a mechanical and thermal nature (in acceptable intensity ranges). </p><h2>  Why did Hyskrin use a different OS? </h2>

    <p>  Now a tendency has been seen to increase sales of devices running the Windows Phone operating system.  More and more people who pay attention to budget-class devices are voting in favor of such smartphones.  So what?  Practical, cute, often equipped with a good filling device.  What else is needed for happiness?  In addition, even in cases where the installation scope of potential iron is very limited, Microsoft was able to create very good multimedia devices.  As an example, we can cite two ‚ÄúLumiaes‚Äù at once: 520 and 620. So it turned out that Chinese brands had to gradually give their positions in favor of the Finns.  The Russian brand played all-in, deciding to release its own device running Windows Phone in order to further push the Chinese from a leading position.  Of course, in some ways the company succeeded.  But a coin always has two sides, so there is clearly no need to talk about a definite victory in this case.  What to expect from a smartphone on WP, the cost of which at the beginning of sales amounted to about four thousand rubles? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Highscreen WinJoy: specifications </h2>

    <p>  As the operating system on board the device installed Windows Phone version 8.1.  The screen has a diagonal of four inches.  The resolution is 800 by 480 pixels, density - 233 per inch.  The matrix of the screen is made using TFT technology, which provides good color reproduction.  The hardware is represented by Qualcomm Snapdragon processor (model 200).  The chipset has four cores, the clock frequency of which is 1.2 gigahertz.  The graphics processor is nothing but the Adreno 302. The amount of internal RAM - 512 megabytes.  Flash memory is presented in the amount of 4 GB. </p><p>  To increase this volume, you can use an external drive format MicroSD.  For him, the smartphone has a special slot.  A set of communication modules can be said to be standard.  It is represented by support for third-generation cellular networks, a Wi-Fi module (works in the b, g, and n bands), and ‚Äúbluetooth‚Äù version 4.0.  Navigation capabilities are based on the use of GPS and GLONASS satellites.  The resolution of the main camera is 5 megapixels.  It is equipped with an auto focus function and is capable of shooting video as 864 by 480 pixels.  Frontal is not impressive.  Its resolution is only 0.3 megapixels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The battery is removable type, it is designed for a capacity equal to 1700 milliamps per hour.

    <p>  The Finnish manufacturer of mobile phones (and we are talking about Nokia) is used to delighting us with the bright colors in which its devices enter the market.  The Russian developer decided to proceed with caution and try to please everyone in this regard at once.  Well, he did it quite well.  Highscreen WinJoy comes on the smartphone market, the characteristics of which were given earlier, in four colors at once.  It is classic white and black, as well as blue and red.  Although the latter is not very logical for a budget mobile phone, in practice we see very different results.  It should be noted that the thickness of the frames located around the perimeter of the display falls into the acceptable interval. </p><h2>  Materials of manufacture </h2>

    <p>  Perhaps the most applicable to this model will be the word ‚Äúminiature‚Äù.  Competition with her earlier could be the creation of a South Korean developer - Samsung Galaxy S.  Well, among the relatively modern models, the first association for some reason is linked to the iPhone 5C.  It is possible that the whole matter is precisely in the materials of manufacture.  They are similar for these two devices - plastic.  But taking the Highscreen WinJoy phone in hand, you can immediately understand that we have a device that belongs to the budget class.  Alas, plastic gives out a model, as they say, just with giblets.  If you look at the back cover, you might first think that it is a matte material.  But, unfortunately, there is nothing in common between him and the so-called ‚Äúsoft-touch‚Äù.  Highscreen WinJoy smartphone is made from its more slippery alternative.  Similar material can be seen in the computer mice of the budget segment. </p><h2>  Ease of use </h2>

    <p>  Despite the fact that the quality of materials is not at the highest level, the smartphone in the hand lies reliably and firmly.  The situation may worsen with the most active use of the model.  In this case, the processor starts to heat up, distributing heat over the entire surface of the phone.  And then, if you imitate cowboys snatching guns at speed from their holsters, the device can be trivially dropped.  And what will happen next, whether it can withstand mechanical stress, is simply impossible to predict. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2><p>  Here on this parameter, no complaints should be.  Highscreen WinJoy, the firmware of which is available on the official website of the Russian developer, is made with high quality.  The control keys barely protrude above the body.  These are the elements for adjusting the volume, as well as turning the power on and off.  In the economy class, mobile devices often suffer from backlash.  But in the case of the model being watched today, they were not noticed. </p><h2>  Touch elements </h2><p>  They are equipped with soft white backlight.  They work on touch unmistakably and lightning fast. </p><h2>  Slots </h2><p>  The device has slots for two SIM cards.  To use them, you will need to pre-process them according to the MicroSIM standard.  The advantage of this model is that it allows you to assign a mode of operation in third-generation cellular networks for any of the SIM cards.  The slot for installing an external drive in the MicroUSB format is located in such a way that replacement is possible in the ‚Äúhot‚Äù mode. </p><h2>  Conclusion and reviews </h2><p>  So far, the Russian developer has not been able to completely overcome the main supplier of devices running the Windows Phone operating system.  This, of course, is about Microsoft.  Nevertheless, certain developments by the company ‚ÄúHayskrin‚Äù in this area are already available.  The closest competitor to the model we are reviewing is the ‚ÄúLumia 530‚Äù.  In cost, they differ by only two hundred rubles.  However, taking our model in hand and looking inside, we notice that the manufacturer saved on everything that he could. </p><p>  She does not have a front camera at all.  For this reason, video calls are not possible.  There is a main camera, but it will not please phone users with high-quality images.  The thing is that with a fairly good resolution (5 megapixels) it is not equipped with an automatic focus function on the subject.  That is why the language simply does not turn out to be called quality images.  ‚ÄúVinJoy‚Äù (the best-selling variation on the international mobile arena Highscreen WinJoy Black) will lose the 530th ‚ÄúLumiya‚Äù and in terms of energy saving.  Yes, the battery in it is not very powerful.  But ‚ÄúLumiya‚Äù possess competently prescribed energy saving settings, and it pleases. </p><p>  But one cannot fail to note: the apparatus created by the Russian company coped with the task that was originally set for it.  The device has become available for every smartphone running the Windows Phone operating system.  At the same time, the device can be called truly harmonious.  The quad-core processor allows you to use the model in multitasking mode, supports the work in third-generation cellular networks, and the workmanship is at an acceptable level. </p><p>  So, what conclusion can be made based on customer reviews of this model?  More than once they noted a non-original, but nonetheless a pleasant design.  Among the positive aspects is the relatively powerful hardware filling, a good module of the main camera. </p><p>  The list of shortcomings may be a little more.  Although the color rendition is at a good level, the viewing angles are still not what I would like to see.  Autonomous work will not please people who do not have access to the mains or an external battery.  Users call a flaw and low-quality speaker.  Based on all this, we can say that for all its advantages, the phone‚Äôs capabilities are limited by its cost. </p>
