They did not change the established custom in preparation for the 2014 Games.  This coin program was designed for three years, it lasted from 2011 to 2014, and during this period 40 different options were released. </p><h2>  Investment coins </h2><p>  Back in 1992, the Bank of Russia decided to produce banknotes that can be used to invest funds.  They are also called <span>"investment coins."</span>  They are made in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  Their main difference is high decoration and impeccable coinage.  Investment coins are in excellent demand not only in Russia, but also abroad.  Demand for them is always high. </p>

    <h2>  Memorable Options </h2><p>  Coins "Sochi" were made by the Bank of Russia from precious and base metals.  If the first of them are investment and are in demand among rich people, then the second are called simply “memorable”.  Simple collectors hunt for them, because the price is affordable for most of the country's inhabitants.  Of course, they are of most interest to professional numismatists, but ordinary citizens do not mind having such a penny at home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

But the memorable options are great souvenirs, they can even become a symbol gift that will remind you of the Sochi Olympics.

    <h2>  2011 options </h2><p>  Sochi 2014 Olympic coins began to be issued three more years before the Games.  According to the established plan, only 3 non-precious coins were to be issued.  The first version of base metal was released in 2011, April 15.  It depicts the emblem of the Winter Games.  The face value of the issued Sochi coin is 25 rubles.  It is worth noting that the first option caused quite a large demand among collectors-numismatists.  At auctions, its value reached 1 thousand rubles.  But the excitement that appeared in the early days quickly subsided, and the cost fell.  Now on sale you can find a coin several times cheaper.  The circulation of this first option amounted to 9 750 thousand copies. </p><p>  In the same year, December 27, the Central Bank issued the second version of the Sochi coin of 25 rubles.  The symbol of the Olympics was also depicted on the new copy, but this time the logo was made in color.  The circulation of this option amounted to 250 thousand units.  Its cost, according to many, was overstated, when it appeared on sale, it reached 5,000 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description of the first base coin </h2><p>  The first option, issued by the Central Bank, was made of a copper-nickel alloy.  The weight of this Sochi coin is 10 grams (tolerance is 0.3 grams), thickness is 2.3 mm, diameter is 27 mm, and the edge contains 180 corrugations. </p>

The obverse of a coin of 25 rubles is as follows.  In the center is the emblem of the Federation - a two-headed eagle with spread wings spread upwards.  It is crowned with crowns that are connected by one ribbon.  In the left paw of the eagle is the power, and in the right - the scepter.  On his chest is a horseman who strikes a dragon with a spear.  The latter is already overturned backward.  On the disk in a semicircle is the inscription “RUSSIAN FEDERATION”, it is framed by an ornament of rhombs.  At the bottom of it is horizontally placed an inscription of the face value “25 rubles”, and the date 2011 is engraved below it. To the right of it you can also find the <span>trademark</span> that puts the mint of St. Petersburg.  It is worth noting that the Sochi Olympic coins of 25 rubles, which were issued in various years, differ only in the date of production.

Of course, not all Sochi 2014 investment coins are available to everyone.  The price of them for most Russians is too high.  Unlike commemorative options, investment made in the form of a rectangle, they resemble ingots of precious metals. </p>

    <p>  In addition to bullion from precious metals, the Central Bank also made coins.  In 2008, 8 different options were minted, 4 of them made of 925 sterling silver.

    <p>  But 2013 has become more interesting.  During this period, the Bank of Russia issued a coin of gold (only 999 samples were used).  Her weight was 1 kg, and the nominal value - 10 000 rubles.  Its circulation is only 250 units.  Also in 2013, two three-kilogram coins were issued.  The first of them, released in the amount of 100 pieces, is gold.  For her, this <span>precious metal of</span> 999 samples was used.  The nominal price is 25,000 rubles.  The second coin is made of <span>925 sterling silver.</span>  It was made 500 units.  The face value of a precious three-kilogram coin is 200 rubles. </p><h2>  Coin value </h2><p>  If prices for commemorative items are calculated in hundreds of rubles, then for investment they are ten times higher.  So, ordinary metal coins with engraving can be bought for 100-400 rubles.  The same options, but in color, will cost numismatists 1000-2000, depending on the number of coins purchased at one time and the image on them. </p><p>  The Bank of Russia sold silver bullion at a price in the range of 900–1300 rubles per one copy.  Gold options with a nominal value of 50 rubles were sold at the Central Bank at a price of 10,500, at times their value reached 14,000 per copy. </p><p>  Precious coins of Sochi have become more expensive.  For example, a set of four silver items of 3 rubles each can be purchased for 17-20 thousand rubles. </p>
