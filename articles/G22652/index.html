    <p>  A tour to the Nicolas Villas 3 * hotel is usually chosen by people with limited means.  The complex is considered a budget place, although travelers can find hotels cheaper if desired.  The minimum cost for a standard double room here starts at 3,500 rubles.  In July and August, prices may rise to 6,000 rubles.  The price includes not only accommodation, but also all-inclusive meals.  Thus, a week's rest here costs an average of 25,000-30,000 rubles for two. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A bit about the rooms </h2><p>  <span>The hotel cannot boast spacious rooms.</span>  <span>All apartments here have a small area.</span>  <span>Their interior is also quite simple and made in a classic style.</span>  <span>But each room is equipped with a small balcony with a beautiful view of the surroundings and the sea.</span>  <span>All apartments are cleaned daily by maids.</span>  <span>The Nicolas Villas 3 * hotel (Greece, Agia Pelagia) has an ecosystem.</span>  <span>This means that towels and bed linen change as they become dirty.</span>  <span>To inform staff that they are dirty, tourists should lay them on the floor.</span>  <span>If this is not done, then the maids will change them every 3 days.</span> </p>
