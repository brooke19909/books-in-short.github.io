Most will think for a long time, because when studying history, teachers use a modern calendar.  But he did not immediately become the way we know him. </p><h2>  Ancient Rome </h2><p>  It would be difficult to live without a clock and a calendar.  It is impossible to make plans for the long term, it is difficult to explain when an event occurred.  Therefore, the desire to somehow streamline the reckoning is quite natural.  Ancient Rome was a developed civilization.  That is why it is extremely interesting how the countdown was organized in that era.  So what system of chronology existed in ancient Rome?  What changes did it undergo during its use?  All this is extremely interesting. </p>

    <p>  In ancient times, people did not organize the calendar.  They noted the change of time of day, seasons.  The cyclical nature of what was happening was noticed, and subsequently for convenience it became logical to use certain points of reference, some significant events.  Correlating the subject of conversation with them, it was possible to navigate in time and make plans.  The problem is that each nation had its own calendar system.  In ancient Rome, the alleged year of foundation of the city of the same name was taken as a reference point.  Naturally, the exact date caused numerous disputes, which continue even now, but 753 <span>BC</span> is considered more or less generally accepted <span>.</span>  Astronomers had a hand in his calculation, who were able to set the date of the solar eclipse, which is supposed to have taken place on the birthday of the founders of the city - Romulus and Remus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But that is not all, since this system began to be used only from 16 BC.  e.  Long before this, the reckoning in ancient Rome was carried out according to the lists of consuls, that is, when asked about when he was born, a local resident would answer, for example, that "in the year when the consuls were Lucius Cornelius Tsek and Claudius Tsilnius Metellus."  This was quite convenient, because the term of office was just the right length of time.  This is what the system of chronology existed in ancient Rome.  But she allowed to be guided only by years, but what about months, weeks, days, etc.? </p><h2>  Calendar and countdown </h2><p>  In the most ancient system of the Romans, there were only 10 months, the beginning of the year was in March.  But approximately in the VII-VI century BC.  e.  a calendar was borrowed, which was already divided into 12 parts. </p><p>  The day was divided by the familiar clock, but its duration was not a constant.  Both day and night were divided into 12 parts, regardless of their duration.  For reference, a sundial was used, and later water clocks borrowed in Greece. </p>

    <h2>  Reforms and Continued Use </h2><p>  The existing calendar was not accurate enough, and the famous Julius Caesar carried out reforms that introduced the concept of a <span>leap year,</span> and also counted down from January, and not from March, as before.  It was from this day that the consuls took office and a new business cycle began.  This calendar is known to us as Julian, for a long time it was used including in Russia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But on this the influence of the Romans on the methods of counting time did not end.  Even in the Middle Ages, after the <span>Christmas of Christ was</span> used as a guide <span>,</span> historians often indicated the years from the foundation of the ‚Äúeternal city‚Äù.  This is what the system of chronology existed in Ancient Rome and what influence it had even after many years. </p><h2>  Legacy in the modern world </h2>

    <p>  <span>The Roman Empire</span> collapsed a long time ago, people only read about it in history textbooks.  But it is amazing how significant is the knowledge that has remained from it and is used to this day. </p><p>  The names of the months in Latin now sound familiar to any European, since they have remained practically unchanged.  Each day of the week in Rome was dedicated to some <span>god: Mercury,</span> Saturn, Venus and others.  Having undergone minor changes, their names also remained in European languages. </p><p>  By the way, the very word "calendar" came precisely from the Romans.  Kalendarium was a review of the year, and also called special debt books.  Interest on loans had to be paid at the beginning of each month, so in the end they began to call the whole system that way. </p><p>  Although the system has undergone yet another fundamental reform, the <span>Gregorian calendar</span> is now generally accepted <span>,</span> but the legacy of the great Roman era is not <br>  forgotten. </p>

    <h2>  Alternatives in modern times </h2><p>  Many calendars, like the Roman one, have long gone down in history; they were replaced by a more or less general universal system.  And what system existed and continues to be used, and is there such a system at all?  Of course, although it is not generally accepted.  For example, this is the Jewish calendar, according to which 2014 corresponds to 5774-5775.  The reference point is the so-called new moon of the universe, that is, the moment of creation of the world.  The countdown is also organized differently. </p><p>  The popularity of alternative systems should not be underestimated: for example, the Jewish calendar is official in Israel along with the usual Gregorian calendar. </p>
