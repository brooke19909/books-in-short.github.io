However, some of the rather old radio tape recorders still have not lost their relevance and are able to overtake most modern "Chinese" in sound quality.  This review is dedicated to just such a model, called the Pioneer 88RS.  In narrow circles of connoisseurs of high-quality car audio, it is considered a legend, because thanks to high-quality performance and powerful stuffing, it is able to surprise not only with volume, but also with clarity of reproduction.  Let's take a closer look at its features, as well as get acquainted with the opinions of users who had a lot of time to make a conclusion about its quality. </p><h2>  Briefly about the model </h2><p>  Developed in 2006, the Pioneer DEH-88RS was the last word in technology.  Its cost was quite high, and was determined by the presence of a 24-bit digital-to-analog converter, or, in simple terms, a processor.  At that time, such a sound processing technology provided almost unlimited possibilities.  That is why many fans of high-quality sound were chasing this model. </p><div class="photo" data-original="magnitola.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer 88rs" class="if uuid-2893725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2893725.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the technical component, the radio had a very peculiar design.  Unlike modern 2-din car radios, it received very minimalistic controls.  There is only one button on the front panel, and even that button was responsible for dropping the panel.  For control, two separate selectors are used, which can be used both for rotation and in the form of buttons.  To some, such a control mechanism may seem uncomfortable, but this sensation quickly passes.  It just takes time to get used to.  For initial setup, you can use the remote control that comes with the kit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Processor features </h2><p>  The sound processing processor allowed for a very fine tuning.  So, the user has the opportunity to choose from several equalizer presets, or create his own setting.  You can edit the sound power level of each of the connected speakers, as well as set the sound delay for the rear and front speakers.  Of particular note is the ability to control the output to the subwoofer, thanks to which you can set not only the volume, but also the surround sound of the additional speaker. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": answer7, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car radio 2 din" class="if uuid-2893730" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2893730.jpg"></div><p>  Do not forget that the processor cleans the noise during processing, making the same radio sound much cleaner and more pleasant, especially in areas with uncertain signal reception.  The power of the Pioneer 88RS processor is enough to make the interface work smoothly and be responsive. </p><h2>  Input sources </h2><p>  In order to listen to your favorite music, you need its source.  This radio has three options for receiving an audio signal.  The first and most common is a radio receiver.  It has the ability to automatically detect and record in memory all found radio stations.  Using the remote control, According to the instructions for the Pioneer 88RS, you can subsequently delete unnecessary ones, leaving only those whose music style is most liked in the list. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="kandratkrapiva.ru" data-author=": SergeySL, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer deh 88rs" class="if uuid-2893727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2893727.jpg"></div><p>  The second source is a drive for playing discs.  The radio can play both classic AudioCD and modern formats, including MP3 and WAV.  Unfortunately, music playback is not available from electronic media, such as USB flash drives or memory cards.  When listening to recordings from licensed CDs, you can fully feel what this radio is capable of.  The AudioCD format has a high bit rate, which allows you to fully open the 24-bit converter. </p><p>  The third option to receive an audio signal is to use a direct line input.  Since this is a compact model, and not a 2-din car radio option that occupies half of the torpedo, the AUX connector is located on the rear, and for the convenience of its use, it is recommended to make an extension cord that will be placed on the front panel. </p><h2>  Extra features </h2><p>  The radio can control devices connected to it, such as iPods.  However, this requires special adapters that connect to the classic 3.5 connector.  Thanks to them, it will be possible to switch tracks directly using the Pioneer 88RS2 selectors, without being distracted from driving. </p><p>  The second feature is the ability to make the control panel on the steering wheel of a car.  To do this, a special switching connector is provided on the rear panel.  Most of the standard remote controls already installed on cars from the factory are supported by this radio, since the data exchange is made taking into account modern standards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="izhevsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer 88rs Specifications" class="if uuid-2893728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2893728.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive model reviews </h2><p>  As already mentioned above, the radio has received many enthusiastic responses.  Analyzing reviews about the characteristics of the Pioneer 88RS, we can highlight the main points that are most often noted by drivers as positive: </p><ul><li>  High quality sound.  The presence of the processor allowed you to enjoy your favorite tunes without the slightest distortion. </li><li>  Deep and numerous settings.  With the help of a detailed and simple menu, each user could get from the radio such a sound that he personally would like. </li><li>  Powerful amplifier.  The built-in <span>Pioneer 88RS</span> amplifier is enough to swing 4 speakers of 50 watts each without any problems, without distorting the sound or adding wheezing to it at maximum volume. </li><li>  The ability to install the remote control on the steering wheel.  Many drivers appreciated such an additional option, because it became even easier to control the radio without being distracted from the road. </li><li>  Quality anti-shock.  Many recorders are unable to keep track when playing from a disc and driving on a bad road.  In this model, this problem is not observed, which allows it to be used in almost any environment. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="izhevsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer 88rs manual" class="if uuid-2893729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2893729.jpg"></div><h2>  The negative sides of the model </h2><p>  The disadvantages of this radio are not so many, but they are also worth mentioning.  The first and most important is the need for regular cleaning of the pressure rollers, which are responsible for feeding and ejecting the disc in the Pioneer 88RS2.  The problem is that over time, dust adheres to them, as a result of which they lose the ability to push the disk.  The more dust in the car, the more often it requires cleaning. </p><p>  According to modern standards, some drivers are unhappy with the lack of a slot for connecting memory cards, since this method of playing back their recordings is simpler and more convenient than storing a large number of disks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pk35.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pioneer 88rs with box" class="if uuid-2893731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2893731.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  This radio tape recorder is an excellent option for those who seek to achieve the highest quality sound.  She is quite old, so you should not expect from her the presence of modern "chips" such as playing files from flash drives or connecting via Bluetooth.  Nevertheless, at the same time, the Pioneer 88RS is able to please with a very voluminous and powerful sound, beautiful design and pleasant ergonomics.  Despite the rather high cost, it is able to fully recoup the funds invested in it by providing comfort during long trips. </p>
