    <p>  The exact address of the entertainment complex: <span>Tuapse district, Lermontovo village,</span> Lenin street, building 18. The cost of visiting the water park is 550 rubles for adults and 450 rubles for children.  A separate ticket for an evening disco usually costs 100 rubles for a child and 200-300 for an adult.  On the territory there is everything necessary to spend all day here with comfort.  This is a restaurant with cozy tables, changing rooms and showers, left-luggage offices.  Rescuers are constantly monitoring compliance with safety rules, they also monitor compliance with age restrictions when visiting attractions.  Very close to the complex is the Golden Beach - a comfortable recreation area on the coast, where you can go after visiting the water park. </p><h2>  Choose the best water park in the city of Tuapse.  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  If you relax in the Tuapse district, it makes sense to set aside a whole day for a trip to the water entertainment complex.  In fact, all three local water parks are located at a slight distance from each other.  Therefore, it makes no sense to choose a complex only because of its geographical location.  The most popular among tourists is "Dolphin" - a water park in Tuapse (Nebug) and "Dzhubga".  It makes no sense to compare them among themselves, since the rides differ too much.  As for infrastructure, cleanliness and security, judging by the feedback from visitors, the conditions are approximately the same. </p>

    <p>  The main advantage of "Dolphin" is a huge landscaped area.  It is also worth noting that the "Dzhubga" differs from it in its classic design of attractions, there are practically no interesting decorations here.  The third water park of the Tuapse district, "Chernomor", is an economical option.  For a nominal fee, you can spend all day in it, but from the entertainment here is offered only an absolute minimum.  Such slides are in almost any aquacomplex, and if you are not tired of them yet, be sure to visit this place.  But the evening program in the "Black Sea" like many guests.  Entrance tickets are inexpensive, and dancing and fooling around in the foam with groovy music can be no worse than in a more modern water park.  Not bad "Chernomor" and for families with children, there is a standard water area and a shallow pool.  If the family goes to the aquacomplex primarily for the sake of the kids, it makes no sense to go somewhere far and overpay for entering the larger water park.  Do not forget that all water entertainment complexes of the Tuapse district are open-type, which means that they are available for visiting exclusively in the summer.  Typically, open water parks in the Krasnodar Territory operate from May to September inclusive. </p>
