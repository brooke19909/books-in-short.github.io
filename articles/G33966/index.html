    <h2>  Sights of Sudak </h2><p>  Sudak is a city with a long history, so tourists have something to see. </p><p>  At the entrance to the city, the Genoese fortress, built by the Italians in the 14th century on the site of the ancient city of Sugdei, known even from ancient Russian chronicles, attracts attention. </p><p>  The nearby village Novyi Svet attracts not only with its clean beaches, but also with the world-famous New World champagne wine factory, which was founded by Prince Lev Golitsyn in the 19th century.  Tours to production facilities and tasting are very popular with tourists.  In the village, the house-museum of L. Golitsyn was preserved, where visitors are also allowed and where the wine museum is located.  It is interesting to stroll along the sea along the steep <span>Golitsyn trail,</span> which leads to the grotto where champagne bottles were previously stored and where, according to legend, the great Chaliapin sang. </p><p>  Bays and springs with spring water, the remains of ancient towers and fortresses, stairs and fortifications - all this makes Sudak attractive for tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cape Alchak is another interesting landmark of Sudak. </p><h2>  Mysterious name </h2><p>  In the Crimean Tatar, Alchak-Kaya means “low rock”, the height of the cape is actually small and is 152 m. </p>

    <h2>  Natural features </h2><p>  Cape Alchak (Sudak) is a coral sediment that rose from the depths of the ancient Tethys Ocean about 10 million years ago, when the Crimean ridge was formed. </p><p>  You can still find imprints of ancient shells, sea urchins and mollusks on the chips of stone blocks.  If you look closely, the branches of prehistoric coral and the skeletons of fish are clearly distinguishable in mountain formations.  Over the past centuries, limestone has marbled, hardened and turned from the seabed into a geological open-air museum. </p><p>  A walk along Cape Alchak will be interesting for those who are fond of minerals.  There used to be a legend that real gold can be mined on a mountain.  However, in fact, ignorant people mistook grains of golden pyrite for gold streaks.  Even 20 years ago, you could easily pick up a handful of gold crystals in half an hour. </p><p>  Iceland spar, marble-like calcite and other minerals can be found on Alchak-Kaya.  In the 1950s, these stones were mined on an industrial scale. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Cape Alchak belongs to the protected territories of Crimea, where amazing vegetation unusual for these places has been preserved.  Despite the proximity of the sea, plants here are mostly steppe.  Thickets of dogrose, barberry and hawthorn alternate with pistachio and juniper bushes.  Occasionally, luxurious oaks and <span>Crimean pines are found.</span>  The steep slopes are decorated with creeping wild roses and caper shoots, which in spring surprise with unusually beautiful snow-white flowers. </p><h2>  The main thing is not to go astray! </h2><p>  Only 2 hours will be required in order to go around Cape Alchak in a circle and return back.  What can be seen during this time, walking along the laid ecological trail 800 m long? </p><p>  At the foot of the cape there is a small beach, and if you swim, the road will seem less tiring. </p>

    <p>  A huge oak tree grows near the beginning of the path, even old-timers do not know exactly how old he is. </p><p>  A little above the path is a grotto called the Aeolian harp.  It is clearly visible from afar, because it is a huge through rock, similar to a ring.  A steep path leads to an amazing natural structure.  If you overcome it, you can listen to how the music of the Crimean wind sounds.  The Aeolian harp formed due to weathering.  The best photos on Cape Alchak are taken in the grotto, because in the frame of frozen corals, as in a frame, a beautiful view of Sudak Bay and further, to the New World, Cape Kapchik, mountains Bolvan, Koba-Kai and Krepostnaya, Sokol rock opens.  On clear days you can even see Yalta. </p>

    <p>  After admiring, it is worth going further. </p><p>  Soon, a convenient path leads to Devil's Bridge.  This is the name given to the boardwalk, thrown over the landslides and cliff.  It must be walked carefully. </p><p>  The path begins to loop under heavy overhanging cliffs along the coastline.  Pile of stone blocks sometimes looks frightening, it seems that just about - and the stones will collapse into the sea, carrying the careless traveler along. </p><p>  Down the path go numerous paths to small bays, where it is good to swim and fish and crabs, which are plentiful.  In clear water, fish are visible from afar; you don’t even have to go off the trail.  The most spacious is Kapselskaya Bay. </p><p>  If you are lucky, and the Suuk-Su river is full of water, then you can see how a fresh rivulet flows into the salty sea.  In 1914, a raging river caused a terrible disaster, destroying houses and taking people to the sea. </p><p>  At the top of Mount Alchak you can find the adit cave, where marble-like calcite was mined.  Here, archaeologists discovered the parking of ancient people of the Bronze Age and the treasure of the times of the Bosporus kingdom. </p><p>  The ecological trail leads to the eastern side of the mountain, the beach behind Cape Alchak is excellent and therefore tourists have long been chosen by him, setting up tents there every summer.  The beach is small - only half a kilometer long, but comfortable and clean. </p><p>  It should be noted that the path is not accidentally laid along the sea.  Alchak has 3 peaks, of which only the north is safe for an unprepared tourist.  There are no paved and marked roads to the southern and central peaks.  The places there are wild, rockfalls often occur, there are many crevices and faults, the slopes are steep and dangerous. </p><h2>  What is more convenient to get to? </h2><p>  Arriving in Sudak, you must definitely visit Cape Alchak.  Every resident of Sudak knows how to get there and will be happy to tell you the way. </p><p>  After walking along the main resort street of the city, <span>Kiparisova Alley,</span> and leaving the embankment, you need to turn left and reach the end.  The walk will take 20-30 minutes. </p><p>  The promenade ends with a boat station, behind which on the slope of the mountain you can see the Aeolian harp.  This is the beginning of the trail.  The trail leads along the sea, then going down to the beaches, then rising higher. </p><p>  In some places, the road along Cape Alchak has been cleared for the convenience of travelers, steps, railings and walkways have been made; </p>

    <p>  Entrance to the ecological territory is free. </p><p>  You can follow the ecological trail, starting your journey from the village of Solnechnaya Dolina. </p><h2>  Warning to tourists </h2><p>  Carried away by a walk, do not forget about time.  Although the stunning panorama of Sudak opens at night from the top of the cape, shining with many lights against the background of the dark blue sea, not everyone can go down in the dark.  At night, when the path is poorly distinguishable, various troubles await travelers: you can tear yourself into the cracks between the stones, tuck your foot on a slippery path, or stray from the road.  Another danger on Cape Alchak is stones breaking off the slopes into the deep sea, crumbling soil, as well as unexpected rockfalls. </p><p>  Every summer, rescuers of the Ministry of Emergencies take lost tourists from Alchak-Kai. </p><h2>  The right outfit for adventure </h2><p>  Going to Cape Alchak, we must remember that the Crimean mountains, low and seemingly safe, still do not forgive mistakes and neglect.  And in order for the adventure to leave only positive memories, it is necessary to prepare correctly: </p><ol><li>  Footwear.  In no case should one shoe flip flops - they glide easily along the slopes.  Heels or rag slippers do not fit.  Sneakers are the best shoes for the mountains. </li><li>  Be sure to need a hat. </li><li>  If the day is sunny, you need to stock up with sunscreen and dark glasses. </li><li>  At least 1 liter of clean water per person should be taken with you. </li><li>  For an evening walk you will need a powerful flashlight. </li></ol><p>  A suitably equipped tourist will find the road easy and will be remembered as a pleasant interesting walk. </p>
