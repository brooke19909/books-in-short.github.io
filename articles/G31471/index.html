This question is being asked by an increasing number of Russians in connection with the complex internal structure of employing companies, among which the so-called ‚Äúblack salary‚Äù is very often used.  And so many workers in any sphere of the labor market often look for the answer to the question ‚Äúhow to calculate wages‚Äù to make sure that the enterprise did not make any extra deductions.  In addition, payroll is made by people, not by machines, and at the same time, the <span>human factor</span> is quite possible <span>,</span> as a result of which the accountant may make mistakes or confuse something, therefore it is always recommended to control your monetary charges.  Only an accountant can tell how to calculate wages correctly - this is the erroneous opinion of most people.  As a rule, in order to control your income, it is not necessary to know the basics of accounting. </p><p>  If the company operates according to legal rules and regulations, then each employee should be issued a pay slip that shows all the charges and deductions made by the company, by viewing which you can compare them with your calculated result.  If, for some reason, the company does not provide a settlement slip, then you can always, after contacting the settlement department, ask for clarification.  It should be noted that, not taking into account <span>penalties,</span> only the state income tax of 13% can be deducted from the salary.  In addition to tax, all deductions are made only with the written consent of the employee. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to calculate the average wage?  Its correct calculation should be carried out in several stages: </p><ul><li>  It is necessary to summarize all payments up to copecks that were accrued and paid for the 12 months preceding the month of calculation.  This amount should include the accrual of bonuses, bonuses, one-time allowances, etc.  Sick pay and vacation pay should be excluded. </li><li>  After identifying the total amount obtained as a result of the calculations, the actual number of days worked over the past 12 months should be determined.  This calculation is necessary because official business days may coincide with holidays.  The number of days spent on sick leave or on vacation is also omitted. </li><li>  As a result, the received amount of payroll for the past period must be divided into actually worked days, and the resulting division result will be your average daily earnings. </li><li>  If you need to know your salary in a particular month, then you should multiply daily earnings by the number of working days in this month. </li></ul><p>  Currently, work time is most often recorded using a time sheet, rather than days.  In this case, the question ‚Äúhow to calculate wages‚Äù is greatly simplified in its decision.  When signing an employment contract, one copy of which must be with you with all signatures and seals, the wage point should indicate the cost of the working hour, which, multiplying by the actual hours worked in the month, you will receive the amount of your salary.  It should be noted that depending on the internal policy of your company, this amount changes monthly, taking into account the accrual of bonuses or bonuses. </p><p>  The Regulation ‚ÄúOn the Features of the Procedure for Calculating Average Wages‚Äù, which has been reviewed and approved by the Government of the Russian Federation, can suggest how to calculate <span>salaries</span> for official bodies.  This provision gives examples of calculation for all possible variations and certain nuances: average daily earnings on vacation, accounting and control of bonus payments, payment amount on holidays, etc. </p>
