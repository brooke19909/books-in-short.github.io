    <p>  The cabinet menu is very simple and intuitive even to those people who are poorly versed in computers and similar resources.  The main menu of cost control will provide information on the current balance, as well as on the status of the account for the selected period of time, showing all payments made from the number, as well as the time and amount of replenishment. </p><p>  Access to the service is provided free of charge, but the client will need to go through a quick registration, after which a password will be sent to the phone.  Having a password and login (mobile number), each user will be able to log in to the system and control their expenses. </p><h2>  Email Detailing </h2><p>  A similar method can solve the question of how to find out expenses on Beeline, but the method will not be so informative.  This method is used when there are difficulties with working in your personal account.  For information, you must send a text message in which to indicate your valid email address.  Sending is carried out by telephone 1401. Within a few minutes, the request will be processed and a counter message will be sent to the number with the text that the application has been completed and the data has already been sent by mail.  Going to the mail, you will see a document that describes the costs.  The service is free, but there are certain restrictions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  These include the fact that the order can be made no more than 10 times a day.  Customers can set a ban on this service, for this there is a special team in Beeline.  Find out the <span>current expenses</span> by mail after this will not work.  The client needs to dial * 110 * 0221 # on the phone and make a call. </p><h2>  Option "Easy control" </h2><p>  With this offer, customers will be able to receive information about their mobile spending from the operator anytime, anywhere, even when it is not possible to use the Internet.  It is convenient to use the option for those customers who have no idea how to find out the latest expenses on Beeline, since the service will only show the last 5 paid actions.  To use, you need to send a request to the network by typing * 122 # on the device.  After that, the phone will receive a message with the last five paid operations, as well as a link to the active tariff and its description. </p><h2>  Detailing through My Beeline </h2><p>  Subscribers who use the mobile Internet and modern mobile devices can install the My Beeline application.  In terms of functionality, it is an analogue of a personal account, but it works on phones.  The service is free, but the client will need to have certain traffic to access the application. </p>

    <p>  To get the necessary data, you need: </p><ul><li>  Go to the application. </li><li>  Go to the finance tab, which is on the main page. </li><li>  Go to the detail section. </li><li>  Select the necessary time frame, then select the method of displaying costs.  If you prefer the method of delivering information to the mail, you should specify its address. </li></ul><h2>  Using the help of company employees </h2><p>  If you are unable to use the above methods, then you should use the help of other people - employees of the company.  To do this, the subscriber can apply with a passport to any Beeline communication salon and ask employees to print out expenses, which will be printed on paper.  In this case, you will need to pay a certain amount for the information, which depends on the settlement system.  Details can be found on the official website of the company. </p><p>  Subscribers can also call the operator, who will tell you about the costs for the period of interest.  For this, the employee will need to say passport details so that he can confirm his identity.  The call is held at 0611, and calls are not charged. </p><h2>  Other cost verification methods </h2><p>  Network users can check costs in other ways.  For example, to receive one-time information on the balance, you need to dial * 102 #.  You can also use the "Balance on screen" service, which will display finances on the gadget's screen in real time.  To activate the service you need to enter and send a request * 110 * 901 #.  You can find out the consumption of Beeline traffic and other package services through number 06745. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Find out Beeline traffic consumption" class="if" height="485" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1818224.jpg" width="600"></div>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  There is also a special team in Beeline: you can find out current expenses by entering the code * 110 * 45 #.  All data will be displayed on screen or sent as a text message.  For more extensive control, the command * 110 * 321 # is used.  After entering, the Financial Report service will be enabled, where all information will become available. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  According to user reviews, the most inefficient method of detailing is to use the help of employees.  Dialing to the operator takes a very long time, and in the company salon you need to pay money.  According to subscribers of the network, it is best to use service requests, a personal account or a mobile application. </p>
