    <h2>  Types of TVs </h2><p>  Televisions that are installed in cars are conventionally divided into five types.

Such a device is capable of working both from 12 W and from full 220 W.  The device is connected to both special and conventional power adapters. </li><li>  Built-in TV.  As a rule, it is mounted in a headrest, a visor protecting from the sun, or in an armrest. </li><li>  Ceiling TV in the car.  Of course, it is installed on the top surface of the car.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  It is important to note that the reviews about the devices described in the article are always positive.  Even if you consider some of the disadvantages, they are either blocked by a low price or a list of advantages.  Negative reviews are written very rarely.  Often they are associated with problems that arise as a result of factory defects. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  <span>The TV navigator in the car</span> will be a great solution, if often the driver has to spend time in traffic jams.  I must say that this device is a very convenient and useful thing.  Especially such a gadget is useful on long trips. </p><p>  Those who have a child will just need a TV.
