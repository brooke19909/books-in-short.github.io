If the amounts are small, then they can still be somehow remembered.  But when money needs to be returned to several authorities at once, confusion can begin.  If you do not pay off the debt on time, then at the most unexpected moment it can come out sideways.  For example, during the registration for a flight, it turns out that the bank wrote a statement of claim against you and won the process.  How to find out debt from bailiffs? </p>

    <h2>  Who can not be allowed abroad? </h2><p>  In Art.  67 of the Law on Enforcement Proceedings, it is said that persons who have debts of alimony, loans, taxes, fines, payments for housing and communal services, who, without justifiable reasons, have delayed the repayment period, can be entered into the FSSP database.  Based on these data, they will be restricted from leaving the Russian Federation.  However, a separate court decision is not required.  For an individual entrepreneur, the decision of the tax service on <span>debt collection</span> in itself is an executive document.  On its basis, information can be entered into the FSSP database.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to know in advance the debt from the bailiffs. </p><p>  Moreover, the basis for <span>initiating enforcement proceedings</span> may be any administrative violations: non-return of money to the tax, traffic police, border, veterinary service, customs, labor inspection.  Any penalty must be paid within 30 days from the day the provision comes into force (Article 32.2 of the Code of Administrative Offenses).  Then it should be presented to the body that issued the decision, documents confirming the fact of payment.  If this was not done, then all materials will be sent to the bailiff.  Up to this point, you can safely travel outside the borders of the Russian Federation.  And in order not to worry about this at all, it is worthwhile to find out the debt from the bailiffs in advance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Limitations </h2><p>  After the decision is made, the debtor has five days to voluntarily pay off the debt.  This right is spelled out in the document itself.  If there is no answer, then the executive service may engage in compulsory collection of debts, for example, seize property.  If the debt is not repaid voluntarily, the offender does not have the right to travel outside the country.  But if measures are taken to enforce debt collection, then such a ban is not always legal. </p><p>  <em>Example</em> </p><p>  The individual entrepreneur owes the bank 5 million rubles.  The bailiff recovered the debt from the property - three cars registered on a business entity.  It was found that, say, KAMAZ IPs were not delivered due to fraudulent activities, and hatchbacks were stolen and put on the wanted list.  Then the bailiff decided to recover the debt from the income of the individual entrepreneur.  It was found that a person has a source of cash in the form of wages at the place of work of another entrepreneur.  For 6 months, you can recover 50 thousand rubles in favor of the bank.  Since the debt has not been fully repaid, the bailiffs may prohibit the offender from leaving the Russian Federation.  But in this case, you can go to court and appeal this decision.  But it is better to know the debt from the bailiffs in advance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Amount does not matter </h2><p>  The legislation on this subject does not spell any restrictions.  Even penny debts can become the basis for the inclusion of the debtor in the "black list".  But tax authorities rarely apply with a <span>writ of execution</span> if the amount does not exceed 1,500 rubles.  The cost of paperwork may not pay off.  But there were cases when the control system allowed individuals with debts of several thousand rubles to leave the country.  Failures happen, but rarely. </p><p>  The Federal Law also does not indicate the period for which the ban may apply.  Order No. 36 of the Moscow Office of the FSSP states that it cannot exceed 6 months.  And then what?  If the debt is not paid, it is possible that the relevant authority will apply for a second order.  Therefore, it is worth knowing the debt from the bailiffs in advance and paying off the debts. </p><h2>  How the ban mechanism works </h2><p>  After the execution of the decision, the bailiff must forward it to the debtor, as well as to the Migration Service.  The latter makes the data in the list of "travel abroad".  If such a person does not have a passport, then it will be impossible to obtain it until the debt is paid off.  If there is a document, then a request is sent for its seizure for the duration of the ban.  The bailiff has no right to do this on his own.  In practice, passports are extremely rare.  And if the document was not taken from the debtor, then the court may not recognize the decision on the ban as legal. </p><p>  There is a very important point in the procedure - non-receipt by the violator of the decision to impose a ban.  If the person does not live at the indicated address or avoids receiving the message, then the sending is still considered valid.  Therefore, it is worth worrying in advance about free movement around the world, especially if you know that enforcement proceedings are being conducted against you.  When to check debts?  At least one month before the expected departure date. </p>

    <h2>  How to find out if a bailiff has a debt? </h2><p>  Contact the Federal <span>Bailiff Service (FSSP).</span>  Their branches are located in almost every city of the Russian Federation.  But in order to get the necessary information, you will have to visit the office during reception hours.  At the same time, it is likely that on the day you contact you will not receive all the necessary information.  If the line is large, and you arrived at lunch, you may not have time to see a specialist.  Those who nevertheless decided to personally visit the branch of the FSSP need to remember that throughout the Russian Federation this structure accepts citizens on Tuesdays (from 8:00 to 16:00) and Thursdays (from 16:00 to 19:00). </p>

    <h2>  Alternative way </h2><p>  If there is no desire to queue, you can find out the debt from the bailiffs on the organization‚Äôs website of the same name.  He works around the clock.  The list of debtors is truncated.  There is no data on the amount and claimants in the database, but you can check the availability of the subject in the lists.  According to the bailiffs themselves, each non-payer should know about his debts.  Housing services and banks do not immediately go to court.  Tough measures are only taken against malicious defaulters. </p><p>  On the main page of the site in the lower left corner there is a button "Learn about your debts."  After clicking it, a page with information about the data bank opens.  Below is a form for filling.  At the first stage, you need to choose the direction of the search.  Only individuals can find out debts from bailiffs by last name.  For this, the site will need to indicate the place of registration, name, date of birth.  Legal entities must indicate in the form the territorial registration authority, the name of the enterprise, the state registration address.  To find out the debt from the bailiffs of the Krasnoyarsk Territory, for example, or any other region of the Russian Federation in an open case, you need to select the "Search by IP number" item.  As a result, a table with a list of debts is displayed.  Directly from the site you can pay off the debt.  To do this, in the line "Service" you need to click on the button "Pay".  The system provides several options for paying off debt: Promsvyazbank accepts Visa, Mastercard, Qiwi, Webmoney, Oplatagosuslug.ru cards.  After payment, the information in the database is updated automatically.  When you visit the site again, the page will display the inscription "Nothing was found by your request." </p>

    <h2>  Options for the development of events </h2><p>  After paying off the debt, you must present to the bailiff a package of documents confirming the fact of payment.  On their basis, a decision is made to abolish the restriction.  This document is sent to the territorial office of the FSSP.  There, these data are entered into the registry.  Copies of documents are sent to the migration service and the debtor.  All services receive notifications once a week.  Therefore, in order to exclude yourself from the ‚Äúblack list‚Äù, it‚Äôs worth doing debt repayment at least three weeks before the preliminary departure date. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  For any administrative violations, you can get into the base of ‚Äútravel abroad‚Äù.  Moreover, a person may not even be aware of this.  The writ of execution is issued by the bailiff.  You can find out the debt in two ways: visit the FSSP branch and sit in line or go to the organization‚Äôs website of the same name and view all the data there.  The second option is preferable, since you can pay off the debt directly from the page in several ways.  Yes, and submit documents to update information in the database will not have to. </p>
