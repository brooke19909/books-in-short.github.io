    <p>  Small but very beautiful Sunset Village Beach Resort is located almost on the seashore, in a quiet resort area, about 15 minutes from the vibrant center of Pattaya.  It consists of separate bungalows, which will surely appeal to fans of a relaxing holiday surrounded by nature.  All buildings are constructed from environmentally friendly materials in a traditional Thai style.  The hotel area resembles a blooming garden.  By the way, the famous Crystal Lake is located nearby.  You need to drive to the airport for about twenty minutes, so no one should worry about a long trip.  By the way, three times a day a bus runs from the hotel to the city center, which is very convenient. </p><h2>  Hotel Sunset Village Beach Resort 3: photo and description of rooms </h2>
