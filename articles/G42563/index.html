Then hippies discovered it.  Since then, a powerful resort industry has grown here (hotels, restaurants, bars, Ayurveda centers, diving schools) and daily charter flights from Germany, France, Great Britain, Sweden operate. </p><p>  Portugal, which has owned its overseas province of Goa for more than 400 years, has changed its appearance by implanting thousands and thousands of buildings of colonial architecture in the cities of the future state of India.  Here little Portugal was built with numerous administrative and other buildings: railway stations, sea villas, elevators, mills, etc. </p>

    <p>  If the south of Goa offers guests measured and sedate rest at the level of classic and premium, then the glory of Northern Goa is based on large-scale youth parties, discos accompanied by psychedelic music, and trans-party youth parties. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Mandrem Retreat Chillax Stay (ex Cuba Mandrem) is a small 2-star hotel built in the resort village of Mandrem, on the shores of the Arabian Sea.  The hotel is safe and can be recommended for families with children and the elderly.  Tours in it are in great demand, and they can really be bought only in 3-4 months. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Often, the charm of small hotels exceeds the universal comfort of huge hotel complexes - ‚Äúfive-star‚Äù.  They are intended for those tourists who want to discover the calm and beautiful corners of the Earth, where harmony and a family atmosphere reign. </p><p>  In Mandrem, vacationers do not experience a <span>cultural shock</span> from simultaneous contact with crowds of people, albeit benevolent, but of a different, unusual mentality.  There are no crowds, the hotel and the beach are out of the way, away from the main human flows.  In the village of Mandrem, European notions of cleanliness and order are honored, and the inhabitants of Mandrem, the ubiquitous and dirty holy cows in India, dare to reject these places.  The resort atmosphere of this place is determined by the proximity of the amazing Mandrem beach of the same name with the village, which is considered to be the <span>best beach of Goa</span> for a relaxing holiday <span>.</span>  To him go from the hotel in question for about 5 minutes along the path between the Osaba hotel and the wall. </p><p>  The state capital, the ancient colonial Portuguese city of Panaji (in India it is called differently - Panjim), is 36 kilometers from the hotel.  The transfer from the airport to the hotel complex is 56 km long. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  Mandrem Retreat Chillax Stay Hotel (India) provides its residents with quality economy-class spa services.  The price of the tour for 7 nights for accommodation in a double comfortable room is 65 953 rubles.  The best vacation here is from October to March (in the dry season). </p>

    <p>  This modern three-story building, built on a small green area, outwardly imitates the old colonial, secular utilitarian, Portuguese style of pombalino.  Its features: an enlarged gable roof casting a shadow;  long (on the whole floor) loggias with numerous exits to them;  straightforwardness, symmetry and harmonious repetition of straight lines of the facade. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Mandrem Retreat Chillax Stay is ideally and organically integrated into the environment, which is facilitated by the compact surroundings surrounding it with royal palm trees and decorative tropical shrubs.  Its long, spacious large loggias are ideal for evening contemplation of the surroundings and meditation. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Hotel Mandrem Retreat Chillax Stay (India) is in essence a comfortable and cozy portal to the secluded Mandrem Beach.  From the side of its facade it is decorated with an avenue of royal palm trees, while it has a convenient entrance and a small parking lot for vehicles.  From the back, the territory of the hotel complex resembles a landscaped small summer cafe.  Hotel guests in the evenings here like to while away time before going to bed. </p><p>  The reception and the hotel restaurant are excellent.  The guests are given attention, their wishes are taken into account, and the requests are fulfilled.  The nearest exchange office is located on the same street as the hotel complex considered in the article.  Near the hotel there is an inexpensive taxi rank. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  The accommodations at Mandrem Retreat Chillax Stay are positive.  On the one hand, it is predictable that the economy class hotel complex will not offer its guests apartments with a maid, helipad services, and the opportunity to become members of a golf club. </p><p>  But, on the other hand, the hotel complex has a special romantic, warm, family-friendly good-natured atmosphere inherent in good small hotels.  The efforts of conscientious staff in all 16 spacious (area - about 30 m <sup>2</sup> ) rooms maintain order and comfort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>
