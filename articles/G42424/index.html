Its founder was the <span>son of Alexander Nevsky, the</span> first Moscow <span>prince Daniil Alexandrovich.</span>  But official sources indicate that the city was founded in 1348.  This date is recorded in the <span>Nikon Chronicle.</span>  Historical treatises claim that the name of the settlement comes from the name of the son of Prince Daniel, Alexander.  So Alexin appeared.  Tula region acquired a settlement with this name in 1298.  Some believe that it was named after Metropolitan Alexei.  It was to him in 1354 that the city was given up for maintenance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alexin tula region" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/458034.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Amazing story </h2><p>  Despite its not too large size, this city has an amazing fate.  It was founded at the height of the Golden Horde yoke.  Like the state, Aleksin was prepared for many tests.  Through them, he successfully passed, repeatedly succumbing to destruction and, like a phoenix from the ashes, reborn again.  The city of Aleksin (Tula region) is the great history of a small settlement, which, despite the obstacles, has grown into a magnificent settlement with a population of more than 65 thousand people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Active development of the city falls on the XIX and XX centuries.  It was then that he took place as the center of the metallurgical and sawmill industry.  In the 20s of the last century, in Aleksin, not far from the pine forest, the first summer cottages began to settle in.  The city was a favorite vacation spot of A.P. Chekhov.  Here at different times and for various reasons, there were Pasternak, Zhukovsky, Polenov, Richter and other no less famous personalities. </p><h2>  Sights of Aleksin </h2><p>  Aleksin (Tula Oblast), whose map is replete with various sights, boasts such interesting objects as the Holy Kazan Convent, the place where the shooting of the television movie "Welcome, or No Trespassing" took place, the house of Bera.  There is also the Chertkov estate and many other cultural monuments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alexin tula region photo" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/458035.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Some of them deserve to be mentioned in at least a few words.  For example, the House of Bera, or the "lord's house", is an architectural monument that dates back to the second half of the 19th century.  Ancient legends tell that it was in this building that Chekhov stayed with his brother.  This happened when the men returned from Europe.  Or the Arctic, a children's camp.  Today it has the status of a health institution, and several decades ago it was a pioneer complex.  The film ‚ÄúWelcome, or No Trespassing‚Äù was shot in it, known to all Soviet residents.  The camp is operational, but the situation in it is completely different. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  Aleksin (Tula region) is a marvelous land surrounded by wonderful nature.

The union fell apart in the last century.  Yes, yes, everything is true, only this is not about the empire, but about the cinema.  In Soviet times, the Soyuz cinema was considered the most prestigious in the city.  The city of Aleksin has undergone changes, and the Cinema House has also changed.  The building was abandoned and it did not function for several years.  But after an expensive, grandiose repair, films are again shown here. </p><p>  Only today it is not just a cinema, but a whole cultural and entertainment center.  He immediately won the title of his favorite vacation spot among all generations of the population.  Previously, there was only one cinema hall in the Soyuz, and now there are two of them.  So far, foreign films have been shown in them, but the management hopes to soon launch domestic films as well. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cinema union city alexin" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/461793.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Famous personalities in the life of Aleksin </h2><p>  Like any other city, Aleksin (Tula region) was overgrown with legends associated with historical figures who previously lived here.  So, not far from the city itself is located the picturesque village of Kolyupanovo.  Once upon a time, blessed Euphrosyne lived here for quite some time.  People came to her from different parts of the region asking for help.  The woman was perfectly able to heal from various ailments.  The old woman loved to walk near the Proshenka river.  Here in a quiet and secluded place, not sparing her own hands, she dug a well.  The people who arrived at her, she ordered to drink water from this well. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The holy source of the holy holy fool Euphrosyne" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/461374.jpg" width="395"></div>

    <p>  Euphrosyne died, and in 1885 a small chapel of wood was erected above her pond.  And when the feast of the coming of the Holy Spirit came, the chapel was consecrated.  At the beginning of the last century, the chapel was demolished, and a new one was built instead.  Over the years, this place has deteriorated, no one was engaged in its restoration.  But people continued to believe in the power of the healing source.  They continued to come here and ask for healing from Saint Euphrosyne.  And, oddly enough, they received it.  Only after many years the chapel was reopened. </p><h2>  Live and prosper </h2>
