After all, it is on the shoulders of the parents of young children that responsibility for the preparation of a suitable costume lies.  Today we will talk about how to make a bee costume for a girl with your own hands. </p><h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  First of all, it should be understood that almost any suit does not necessarily begin to sew, as they say, from scratch.  It is quite possible to use ready-made clothes, which will not be a pity, and add some thematic elements to it. </p><p>  A bee costume is exactly the case.  Therefore, first of all, you need to get a plain black or yellow dress from the closet.  Style and material is completely unimportant.  The main thing is that the child should be free and comfortable in it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fancydressball.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bee costume for girls" class="if uuid-2433222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2433222.jpg"></div><p>  Next, you will need satin ribbons of the opposite - black or yellow - shade, depending on the color of the dress.  They should be sewn in horizontal order.  Stripes may not extend over the entire length, but only at the top of the outfit.  You can also use a skirt and embroider only it. </p><h2>  Antennae bees </h2><p>  Mustaches should be an obligatory attribute of a bee costume.  Make them quite easy.  To do this, prepare: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  threads </li><li>  yellow yarn; </li><li>  dark rim; </li><li>  black braid; </li><li>  the wire. </li></ul><p>  First you need to make two small pompons on any basis, the technique and the result will be the same.  So, for an example, we will tell you how to make pompons using an ordinary fork.  The yarn must be wrapped around the sharp part of the fork and secured so that the wound part does not become loose.  Then cut a small piece of yarn and tie in the middle of a skein on a fork.  It will turn out something like a bow.  You need to tie it very tight.  Next, remove the "bow" from the fork and with nail scissors, carefully start cutting the loops around the edges.  Having fluffed up the pompom from all sides, you should roll it in your hands a little, so that it finally takes the desired shape.  Make 2 of these pompons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.halloweencostume.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="yellow and black bee costume" class="if uuid-2433226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2433226.jpg"></div><p>  Then, wire the wire from two sides to the hair rim.  Wrap the tape around it in a circle and fasten it.  After completion, fix the pompons on the tops of the wire.  The antennae for the bee costume are ready! </p><h2>  How to make wings? </h2><p>  In order to make bee wings yourself, you will need: </p><ul><li>  wire; </li><li>  thin tights of white color; </li><li>  thick thread; </li><li>  black tape; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  First, you need to make blanks of future wings from wire.  There should be 4 pieces: 2 small and 2 large.  To do this, fold a drop-like shape from the wire and secure the ends so that it does not unfold.  Next, tie a thick thread at the bottom of the large wings to small ones.  Having made the blank, it's time to start tightening the wings.  To fit them, take the prepared pantyhose and pull on the wings, each one in turn.  After tie in the same place where 2 wings were tied. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now you need to connect 2 pairs of wings.  This can be done using the same wire, simply by winding it between two blanks.  And hide all the nodules so that they are not visible. </p><p>  Since wings should be on the back, they need to be attached there somehow.  To do this, you can take a black strong tape and, cutting off 2 pieces, tie to each of the wings.  To prevent the ends of the tapes from falling in, lightly burn them with a lighter. </p><p>  In order to put wings on a child, you can use any of the techniques.  For example, just tie them on the chest.  Or tie to the shoulders.  Or tie the ribbons with a cross.  Do as it will be more convenient for the baby. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bee girl" class="if uuid-2433251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2433251.jpg"></div><p>  Also, for a change and greater similarity to the wings of a bee costume, you can sew rhinestones or beads.  The wings painted with paints will also look interesting.  This process can be performed with the child, so the costume will become even more valuable. </p><h2>  Decorative elements </h2><p>  In addition to the main costume, you can try to decorate it with some accessories.  For example, make a bright brooch flower that will complement the image of a bee costume for a girl. </p><p>  For a decorative flower, prepare: </p><ul><li>  colored sheets of felt; </li><li>  sequins or beads; </li><li>  glue gun; </li><li>  a pin; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  Making such a flower is very, very simple.  All that is needed is to cut the core from a dark sheet of felt, as well as light or yellow petals.  And gently with a gun and glue stick the petals to the circle.  Then, with threads or glue again, decorate the core with shiny sequins or beads.  Glue the flower to a special pin and decorate a bee costume with it.  Exactly the same flowers can be glued to durable rubber bands and, after making 2 pigtails, decorate their hair with them. </p><h2>  Shoes and tights </h2><p>  If we are talking about a children's matinee, then black ballet flats or soft shoes will be most appropriate.  As for tights, the choice may fall on black, white or striped. </p><div class="photo" data-original="costumevip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="girl in a bee costume" class="if uuid-2433285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2433285.jpg"></div><p>  You can also prefer golf with lush lace at the edges. </p><p>  As you can see, there is nothing complicated in preparing for the children's party.  And to make a bee costume with your own hands is quite real and even interesting.  The main thing is enthusiasm, the right approach and a good mood! </p>
