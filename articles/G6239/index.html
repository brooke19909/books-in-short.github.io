    <h2>  How is a method from higher mathematics applied by psychologists </h2><p>  The mathematical method ‚Äúpredictor-corrector‚Äù is successfully used by psychology and psychiatry in its research on the development of children's learning abilities, in the study of human intellectual abilities. </p><p>  In the role of variables (or predictors), you can take factors such as: </p><ul><li>  accommodations; </li><li>  intelligence and parenting; </li><li>  external environment; </li><li>  other variables originally designated. </li></ul><p>  Thanks to the research, some scientists have obtained interesting results.  It became clear that to predict success in professional higher education, such usual predictors as conducting final or entrance testing and school grades are completely insufficient.  Without taking into account personality variables, for example, the desire for a given activity, forecasts may turn out to be erroneous.  Most often, the best basic predictors are the individual‚Äôs abilities for mathematical and verbal reasoning, that is, not according to general evaluation indicators, but according to the student‚Äôs individual qualities, one can predict his future success in learning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where else can you use predictors </h2><p>  The main purpose of this method is to look to the future, to receive forecasts of the results of actions taken.  Even medical science has learned to use mathematical concepts.  The main symptom leading to the onset of the disease is called so: "the main predictor."  Lack of movement will lead to obesity, frequent stresses will cause a <span>nervous breakdown.</span> </p><p>  It is worth changing the main factor (cause) and, following the mathematical algorithm, the effect (corrector) changes, the disease is cured.  If there is also a personal interest of the sufferer, a desire to recover, and not to be treated, then the forecast will necessarily coincide with the final result.  It is clear that ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù, ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing treated‚Äù are completely different processes.  And here the predictors are the desire and longing for health or treatment. </p><h2>  Math and goal setting </h2><p>  <span>The method of forecasting</span> and correction, predictions and corrections, indications and executions refers to a two-step method of solving the tasks.  How does he work? </p><ul><li>  First, the task is posed.  The task can give p <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="internal predictor" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18967/424218.jpg" width="363"></div>  leadership, then it will be a predictor.  You can be "puzzled" by yourself.  The main thing is to want something. </li><li>  To perform a specific task, performers are needed.  Each of them acts in accordance with the task set by the predictor (leadership), but using its own skills, knowledge, experience and aspirations.  The executor, following the instructions, adjusts the path of achievement in accordance with his personal characteristics. </li><li>  As a result of the interaction of these system components, the global predictor scheme brings a certain result.  If the goals of the predictor and the corrector coincide, the actions will go in the right direction. </li><li>  Replacing the predictor accordingly affects the actions of the corrector.  Movement to a changed goal can go the other way.  Replacing the corrector does not always affect the change in purpose. </li></ul><p>  Thus, the predictor is the answer to the question ‚ÄúWhat should I get?‚Äù, And the corrector is the answer to the questions ‚ÄúHow to do?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to get?‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to use the method in management </h2>

Two is two, nine is nine or three times three, and a hundred is still a hundred.  Algorithms are executed in a specific order:

In accordance with the <span>mathematical model</span> , some processes can be envisaged.  Using the theory of control in resolving conflicts, this circumstance can be completely eliminated if proactive actions are applied to the cause of this control.  The system is ready for such a turn of events and confrontation is completely ruled out. </p><p>  History knows cases when such management of society was carried out in antiquity.  Hierophants, the highest priests of Ancient Egypt, were able to foresee fate, read the future.  Mathematics calls this a matrix of possible states.  Based on the predictions received, the social system of Egypt was guided by the scenario of events selected by the high priest.  Naturally, the election of one or another option is then and then affected by the morality and arbitrariness of those or those who have risen to control and foresight, using an internal predictor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What can be the truths and causes of events in world history </h2>

    <p>  Disputes about what a person is, where we came from and why we are on this planet do not cease.  It is not a discovery that the human mind, through emotional thoughts, radiates a huge amount of energy.  Which is stronger: sorrow and suffering or joy and happiness?  Where does this tremendous amount of power go?  What happens to her in the future? </p><p>  One of the theories says that it is the World Predictor, a cruel, enormous and immoral intellect, that initially controls people and the history of the Earth.  With our anger and sorrow, fears and hatreds, emotions of grief and anger, this energetic essence is nourished like bacteria by a dead organism. </p><h2>  Energy is not only light, atom and electricity </h2><p>  Fear rules a man and love rules him.  Which emotion is stronger?  By the strength of their radiation, these two basic emotions embedded in the human soul are equal.  However, fear is the instinct of preserving one's own life, and love is the product of parenting by the family, environment, and society. </p><p>  A normal person should experience fear by nature.  This human ability is used to receive atomic explosions of emotions of grief, hatred, horror. </p><h2>  What to do to save your energy for yourself </h2><p>  Various religious teachings, science, parents and all who are trusted by the majority learn to be afraid of the situation in order to avoid or correct it.  If we recall the mathematics, then the most important predictors are the people themselves.  Mankind, which is open to self-knowledge, to love and mutual understanding, can throw only beautiful, good emotions into outer space.  The more beautiful feelings go into space, the more attracted to situations in which such emotions can be experienced and manifested. </p>
