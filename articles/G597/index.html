Methodology and theory of historical science</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Consider the nature, forms, functions of historical knowledge.  History is a colossal array of cultural, moral, spiritual experience of mankind, which has been accumulated by several generations. </p><p>  Scientific knowledge of the world is an important element in the relationship between the world and man. </p><h2>  Narrow meaning </h2><p>  Under historical knowledge is understood in science the totality of representations of social groups individually about their own past, as well as about the past of the entire human society. </p><p>  In a broad sense, this science is a past reality, an integral process of development and change of civilizations and states, which are interconnected by relations of consequence and cause. </p><p>  In a narrow understanding of history, we can consider those events that happen to specific peoples, people. </p><p>  Reflection is carried out in two dimensions: </p><ul><li>  ethnological (horizontal); </li><li>  chronological (vertical). </li></ul><h2>  Main levels </h2><p>  Analyzing the essence, forms, functions of historical knowledge, we note that there are four levels: </p><ul><li>  the first is formed on the basis of the accumulation of certain life experiences; </li><li>  the second level is associated with the influence of cinema, radio, fiction, television; </li><li>  the third is based on their own historical knowledge obtained at school; </li><li>  the fourth is formed on the basis of a theoretical comprehensive understanding of the past with the identification of trends in historical development. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="uslide.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="history features" class="if uuid-2356308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2356308.jpg"></div><h2>  Areas of activity </h2><p>  The main function of historical knowledge is to provide a number of intellectually-developing, cognitive functions: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  allows you to form a national identity; </li><li>  against the background of past images, the selection and creation of socially significant norms is carried out, certain customs and traditions are formed, the thinking and behavior of a particular people are formed; </li><li>  history allows us to realize the role of the individual, to recognize the roots of national culture, stimulates the acquisition of new knowledge, and makes it possible to analyze the past. </li></ul><h2>  The significance of the story </h2><p>  What is the essence, form, function of historical knowledge?  History is considered, from one point of view, as a process of development of mankind and nature, and from another, it can be represented as a system of sciences that study the past and present of society and nature.  Its content is a historical process, revealed in certain phenomena of human life, information about which is in ancient sources.  It is important to note that the essence, forms, functions of historical knowledge are associated with technical and natural sciences. </p><div class="photo" data-original="900igr.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="specificity of historical knowledge" class="if uuid-2356312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2356312.jpg"></div><h2>  Important facts </h2><p>  Herodotus (5th century BC) is called the ‚Äúfather‚Äù of history.  This ancient Greek scientist is the author of essays on the Greco-Persian wars, life and life of the Scythians, Egypt.  As an object of study in history, the sum of facts that characterize the life of society, not only in the past, but also in the present, is considered. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Its subject is considered the development of mankind. </p><p>  What are the hallmarks of history?  The essence, forms, functions of historical knowledge indicate that it is a diversified science, which contains several independent branches of historical knowledge: </p><ul><li>  economic; </li><li>  social; </li><li>  political; </li><li>  military. </li></ul><h2>  Compound components </h2><p>  Ethnography is considered to be a historical science, which is engaged in the study of the culture and life of peoples. </p><p>  What industries is history associated with?  The essence, forms, functions of historical knowledge is difficult to understand without archeology.  She studies history from the found monuments of antiquity. </p><p>  Among the auxiliary historical disciplines are: </p><ul><li>  source study; </li><li>  chronology; </li><li>  historiography; </li><li>  paleography; </li><li>  metrology; </li><li>  genealogy; </li><li>  heraldry. </li></ul><p>  All of them have a fairly narrow subject.  The essence, forms, functions of historical knowledge are examined in detail in order to realize the significance of each section. </p><p>  History is usually divided into several parts according to the scale of the study of the main objects: </p><ul><li>  universal (universal); </li><li>  the history of countries, continents, civilizations; </li><li>  improvement of individual peoples. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.myshared.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="history essence of the form of the function of historical knowledge" class="if uuid-2356317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2356317.jpg"></div><h2>  Purpose of historical material </h2><p>  We continue the conversation about what is the essence, forms, functions of historical knowledge.  The history, a description of individual events, contributes to the intellectual development of the younger generation, the cognitive interest of students in the past of their country, other countries and peoples. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The educational value of science consists in the formation of moral, civic values ‚Äã‚Äãand qualities on historical examples. </p><p>  What is the essence, forms and functions of historical knowledge?  The description of certain objects allows us to predict the future, that is, this science has a <span>prognostic function.</span> </p><p>  Social memory consists in the fact that with the help of historical knowledge one can identify and orient individuals and societies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.myshared.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to study history" class="if uuid-2356324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2356324.jpg"></div><h2>  Social significance </h2><p>  What is the essence, form, function of historical knowledge?  Briefly, <span>social memory</span> can be represented as the preservation and accumulation of the memory of the experience of past generations.  It has certain properties: </p><ul><li>  fragmented and selective; </li><li>  certified and organized; </li><li>  socially oriented; </li><li>  fair; </li><li>  conciliatory; </li><li>  educational; </li><li>  scientific and educational; </li><li>  ideological and political. </li></ul><p>  When historical science reaches its main goal, it forms the scientific premises for: </p><ul><li>  the formation of a positive social identity; </li><li>  thinking over the development of a particular society; </li><li>  management of processes and areas of society. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="khazin.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the essence of the form of the function of historical knowledge briefly" class="if uuid-2356329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2356329.jpg"></div><h2>  The problem of choice in Russia </h2><p>  It was recognized by the first ancient Russian princes.  Only when the people believed in one God, could the state be strengthened and the position of one ruler strengthened. </p><p>  Vladimir I decided on the choice of religion from the beliefs of neighboring states.  He opted for Byzantine Christianity, which he considered most suitable for the mentality and characteristics of the life of the Russian population.  The process of adoption of Christianity was quite difficult and slow, but this event is significant for Russia. </p><p>  In 988, the prince ordered the people of Kiev to gather at the Dnieper, enter everyone into the water, and on the shore stood the priests who performed the holy sacrament of baptism. </p><p>  In 991, the pagans rebelled in Novgorod, they could only be subdued by force of arms. </p><p>  What is the significance of the adoption of Christianity in Russia?  Gradually, the international authority of Kievan Rus began to strengthen, the way of life changed.  The church banned polygamy, sacrifice, blood feud, as well as other pagan traditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="infourok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="types of worldviews" class="if uuid-2356347" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2356347.jpg"></div><p>  Such events contributed to a change in the international situation of the Old Russian state.  It joined the ranks of Christian European countries.  Prince Vladimir Svyatoslavovich, who ruled between 978 and 1015, made Christianity of the state of Kiev an official religion. </p><p>  Vladimir, becoming the Kiev prince, faced with a serious Pecheneg threat.  To protect himself from the nomads, he built a line of fortresses on the border of the principality. </p><p>  After the death of Vladimir in Russia, there was again a serious civil strife.  Yaroslav the Wise managed to create conditions for the maximum flowering of the Russian state.  He managed to intermarry with the ruling dynasties of Europe, which became evidence of the international recognition of Russia in the Christian European world. </p><p>  This fragment of history testifies to the importance of the actions of the Russian rulers for the economic and political development of the country.  Only thanks to the wisdom and coherence of their actions, the development of our state took place, the formation of the makings of modern science, culture, education in it. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Historical science is engaged in the collection, systematization, generalization of facts, their connection and totality.  It acts as a social memory of mankind, a piggy bank of its basic social experience, transfers it from one generation to another.  History serves modernity by analyzing the present, making predictions for the future. </p><div class="photo" data-original="900igr.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="essence of the form and function of historical knowledge" class="if uuid-2356342" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2356342.jpg"></div><p>  Is it possible to talk about the planetary unity of mankind, its culture?  There are two points of view on this issue, each of which deserves attention. </p><p>  According to the concept of N. Ya. Danilevsky, O. Spengler, history is realized only with the change of cultures that live a self-sufficient, own, separate life. </p><p>  According to the second option, which historians call the concept of V. Solovyov, this science is considered universal, leading to the creation of a universal human culture. </p><p>  It is difficult to imagine an economically, politically, culturally developed state without the people's awareness of the historical past, its transfer from one generation to another. </p>
