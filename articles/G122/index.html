Active television antenna</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, one of the sources of information is television.  Of course, it is not as popular as the Internet, but many people use it.  Each house has a TV, not always one.  With it, everyone can watch news, exciting films or exciting TV shows.  To view them you should achieve a good signal.  For this, an active television antenna is suitable. </p><h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  They are divided into three types: </p><ol><li>  Radio antenna.  Designed for car receivers only. </li><li>  Television.  Use to watch analog or digital television. </li><li>  Combined.  Such models accept all types of signals, from the radio to the navigators. </li></ol><p>  There is also another type of active antenna - satellite.  This type is not very common among motorists due to the difficult setup and high cost of equipment. </p><p>  In addition, active automotive elements are divided by location. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="active antenna" class="if" height="201" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1206911.jpg" width="396"></div>  It can be both external and internal.  The first type is installed on the roof, trunk or on the side doors.  The main advantage is a high-quality signal.  However, there are also drawbacks: they are large, have a low life, as they are subject to mechanical and climatic influences.  They are also hard to install.  To do this, you need to make additional holes in the car body, which spoils its appearance.  Internal models are mounted on the rear or windshield.  They can have a different design and shape.  Antennas are characterized by small overall dimensions.  They are not exposed to external mechanical influences, as well as climatic conditions.  Therefore, the car for a long time retains its pleasant appearance.

The first type is installed on the roof of the houses so that the quality of the television picture is at the highest level.  An active indoor antenna is used in a specific range, that is, not in all places the device will work the same.  Most users note this drawback: the part unevenly picks up the signal, that is, the TV will not show outside the other room.  Before installing it, you need to make sure that the apartment is in the area where there is a good TV signal. </p><h2>  What is the difference between passive and active? </h2><p>  So, all indoor antennas are divided into two types: passive and active.  Representatives of the first species capture the signal using their design.  Their main advantage is that they do not need to be connected to the mains, as well as provide additional amplification equipment.  Many users note that when using passive elements there is no signal interference. </p><p>  But not always such models can cope with their task. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="active car antenna" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1206912.jpg" width="302"></div>  In this case, a room active antenna is installed.  Better signal reception is achieved using an additional <span>electronic amplifier.</span>  Such a device can be installed in the housing of the element or go separately.  In this case, the active antenna is powered by the mains.

One of the main negative sides is a poor-quality signal.  It arises from a poor-quality amplifier.  Such cheap Chinese models are widely distributed in the market.  The signal may also be distorted from a very sensitive amplifier.  Distortion occurs in the coverage area, where the use of an additional amplifier is not required. </p><h2>  Action range </h2><p>  An active antenna can perceive both special ranges and pick up any type of signal.  All-wave devices are widely distributed among consumers, since they are convenient and able to pick up a fairly large number of channels. </p><p>  When using a room antenna for digital television, it is necessary to purchase those models that catch special ranges.  In this case, each person will save significantly. </p><h2>  Selection Recommendations </h2><p>  When purchasing active TV antennas, you need to pay attention to the following criteria: </p><ul><li>  Before choosing a model, you should evaluate the signal level in the apartment.  You should not buy a device just because of its beautiful appearance. </li><li>  If the windows in the apartment go to the television center, then you can install the antenna on the glass.  In this case, the signal will be much better.  Although these models are mounted on glass, they perform the same work as outdoor devices. </li><li>  If the distance to the repeater is more than ten kilometers, then using active antennas is not recommended.  The signal will be weak, and the image and sound with noise.  In this case, it is better to purchase an outdoor structure. </li></ul><h2>  Active car antenna </h2><p>  Standard built-in car antennas are low sensitivity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="active antenna connection" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1206913.jpg" width="600"></div>  It decreases when exposed to mechanical damage.  Such processes can bring its antenna out of order.  At first, each driver does not pay attention to the antenna, as it listens to music that is recorded on different media.  However, she begins to get bored.  Therefore, there is a need to acquire a new part.

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  This type of part is used for those vehicles that make long trips.  In large cities, the signal is good.  It will deteriorate with distance from the radio tower.  Even if the distance is small, the signal may be distorted due to uneven terrain, that is, mountains, hills, etc. Therefore, a device such as a TV-active antenna will come in handy. </p><p>  When the vehicle is moving on rough terrain, the radio does not pick up a signal from a radio tower, but from a distorted terrain.  He is not strong enough.  To capture it, an additional amplifier is required, which is already integrated into the active part. </p><p>  To counteract interference both in the city and beyond, such antennas can operate in two modes: </p><ul><li>  for urban areas; </li><li>  for country roads. </li></ul><p>  In the first case, they can work without an amplifier, since its presence will interfere with the signal. </p><h2>  Active antenna connection </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, for the functioning of the mechanism it is necessary to connect it to the mains.  This is one of the disadvantages.  So, first you need to decide on the connection location.  Some motorists connect the device to the battery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tv active antenna" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1206914.jpg" width="600"></div>  However, this is unjustified.  In this case, the design is constantly on.  That is, when the car is idle, a certain amount of energy from the car battery will be consumed.  Accordingly, it will take longer to recharge than usual.

    <p>  How to make a connection?  For this, there is a special connector for the car radio.  This is the best option, as the antenna will work with the receiver.  In this case, the expenditure of electric current will be in moderation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="active antenna power" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1206915.jpg" width="530"></div>  There is another option.  The antenna is connected to the ignition switch.  Power is applied when the ignition key is turned.  Deactivation of the device occurs when the owner leaves his vehicle.

    <p>  It is worth noting that installation methods and procedures can be indicated in the instructions.  To ensure that the mount is reliable, it is necessary to check the structural details. </p><h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  After making the connection, it is necessary to check the operation of the antenna.  Both options are suitable for all types of devices.  The most popular manufacturers of active antennas are Alpine, Supra, and Bosch.  Due to the affordable price, any car enthusiast can purchase it.  The cost of an active antenna ranges from three hundred to one and a half thousand rubles. </p><p>  Buying this part is a rather troublesome process.  An incorrect model will not pick up the signal, and sound or image quality will suffer.  Therefore, the choice of this element should be taken responsibly. </p><p>  So, we found out what constitutes an active television antenna. </p>
