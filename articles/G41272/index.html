  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Leningrad Station Stations: Overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In trains and trains, there was always and is something romantic: to go by the window to the sound of wheels, look into the distance, at the escaping expanses of the motherland, and think, dream about something of your own ... But how cool it is to go where your eyes look, get off at unfamiliar station, see places where I have never been before!  Today we invite you to get acquainted with some stations of the Leningrad direction (not all - there are several dozen of them along the way only from Moscow to Bologoy).  Why are they interesting?  So, <span>Moscow, Leningradsky station.</span> </p><h2>  Next stop - Ostankino station </h2><p>  The first station in the Leningrad direction is Riga.  But we won‚Äôt go out there today, but we‚Äôll pass better until the next stop, not far from the famous television center.  It is there that you can get from the aforementioned station, and it is also permissible to go to the street and <span>Oak Grove</span> Avenue <span>,</span> Rustaveli Street and the Ostankino Meat Processing Plant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zelao.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ostankino Station" class="if uuid-2949222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2949222.jpg"></div><p>  Strictly speaking, Ostankino is not a station at all, but a platform, that is, this stopping point is relatively small.  It was named after the small village of Ostankino, located near Moscow in the nineteenth century.  The station itself opened more than 100 years ago, back in 1915.  There are three platforms on it - trains coming to Moscow approach one, and the two that leave the capital stop near the other two.  In the centenary year of the stopping point, all platforms were equipped with turnstiles.  Not far from the Ostankino platform there is, as already mentioned, the famous television center of the same name, a cemetery, as well as a monorail and a public transportation stop. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The next station is Khovrino </h2><p>  Thirteen kilometers from Moscow is another station of the Leningrad direction, in other words, the October Railway.  It is called Khovrino and was discovered either in 1885, or in 1893 - it has not been reliably established so far.  This stopping point is relatively larger than the previous one.  From Khovrino station you can get to several streets at once: for example, to Puteyskaya, Angarskaya, Depovskaya and so on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wp.wiki-wiki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Khovrino Station" class="if uuid-2950820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3663/2950820.jpg"></div><p>  The station is named after the village of the same name, which was included in Moscow in the middle of the last century.  In general, the station originates from a large sorting point, which was once here.  Not far from this stopping point is the final bus stop, from where you can get to different parts of the city. </p><h2>  Next stop - Podrezkovo </h2><p>  We continue our walk on the platform of the Leningrad direction Podrezkovo, which was opened in 1916.  This is a completely ordinary and unremarkable platform, of which there are thousands across the country.  There are three ways and two platforms, there was a third one before, but in the nineties of the last century it was destroyed.  From Moscow to Podrezkovo a little over twenty-seven kilometers, to St. Petersburg from here - over six hundred. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The next station is Skhodnya </h2><p>  Right next to the Podrezkovo platform is the Skhodnya station.  Let's get to know her better.  This stopping point appeared in the mid-seventies of the nineteenth century and owes its name to the former town with the same name, which fourteen years ago became part of Khimki.  It is to Khimki, by the way, that the above stopping point applies.  There are three platforms at the station, there are no turnstiles: despite the fact that it is a station, it is not considered to be particularly large.  Not far from the stopping point is the Skhodnenskaya metro station, there is also a bus stop nearby. </p><h2>  Next station - Kryukovo </h2><p>  We will get off again at a large station.  One of these, if traveling from Moscow by train to the Leningrad direction, is Kryukovo.  Operating since the mid-nineteenth century, it is the main interchange hub of the district.  From the four platforms of the station you can go to Kryukovskaya or Railway Station Square.  High-speed trains going in the Leningrad direction, to Moscow from Kryukovo take about half an hour, ordinary trains take about ten to twenty minutes longer.  For three years now, the special composition ‚ÄúSwallow‚Äù has been operating from Moscow to Kryukovo and back. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zelhome.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kryukovo Station" class="if uuid-2949242" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2949242.jpg"></div><p>  Like many other stopping points of the Leningrad direction, the Kryukovo station was named after the village of the same name.  Two wooden platforms, as well as a water tower and a mini-village for workstations arose here towards the end of the nineteenth century.  And a little earlier, in the early sixties, a pond was organized, from where water was supplied to steam locomotives.  It has been saved so far. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In those same years, the former village of Kryukovo and the workers' settlement merged into a village with the same name, the territory of which began to be located near the station.  The latter is known for the fact that in the last century, during the Great Patriotic War, battles fought for it. </p><p>  Beginning in the sixties of the twentieth century, a city Zelenograd emerged just north of the Kryukovo station, and the above stopping point is now located on its territory. </p><h2>  Next stop - Povarovo-1 </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Povarovo-1 is a station, there is nothing special to tell about it.  This stopping point, opened in the seventies of the century before last, is a junction station - in addition to the main road going to the Leningrad direction, there are two branches departing from it: in the Savelyevsky direction and to Kubinka.  At the same time, there are two stops within the borders of the aforementioned station - one with the same name, the other with a similar one: Povarovka. </p><h2>  Next stop - Radishchevo </h2><p>  If you go further from Moscow in the Leningrad direction, you can get to the platform with the beautiful name Radishchevo, which everyone who is more or less familiar with Russian literature and history will certainly remind of Alexander Radishchev, prose writer, poet, philosopher.  The village was named after him, and already by the name of the village - and the nearby platform.  By the way, Alexander Nikolayevich at one time often traveled from Moscow to the Leningrad direction (electric trains did not go then, though), and vice versa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="infojd.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Radishchevo Station" class="if uuid-2949251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2949251.jpg"></div><p>  But back to the platform.  It was opened in 1964, has two platforms and a ticket office.  Behind the railway north of the stopping point is the Moscow Small Ring.  Since the platform is very small and insignificant, only a part of the trains passing by stops at it. </p><h2>  Next stop is the Senezh platform </h2><p>  Another stop on the route of the Leningrad direction trains is a platform with the interesting name Senezh.  Unlike other stopping points, this name was not given to this platform in honor of the village, but in honor of the lake, which is located nearby.  Previously, this stop was called Lesnoye, but later it was renamed. </p><p>  This platform does not stand out from many of the same ones, the only interest, in addition to the lake, is the recreation house of the Office of the President of Russia, located nearby.  Also nearby are suburban areas. </p><h2>  Next stop - Klin station </h2><p>  The time has come to take a walk at a large station, and the next one, according to the schedule of electric train stations of the Leningrad direction, is Klin.  It is located in the town of the same name and has been functioning since the middle of the century before last.  There are four platforms and twelve tracks at the station; there is access to the bus station.  Of the attractions - the pedestrian bridge and the bust of Peter Tchaikovsky by Vera Mukhina near him. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru-railway.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Station Wedge" class="if uuid-2949258" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2949258.jpg"></div><p>  It is interesting to wander around the wedge itself, but not this time.  We are waiting for the next stop with a terribly interesting name. </p><h2>  The next station is the Moscow Sea </h2><p>  Here it is, an interesting name - and with it the Moscow Sea platform, a small stopping point among others along the Leningrad direction.  The platform got such an unusual name thanks to the Ivankovo ‚Äã‚Äãreservoir, which is located nearby.  The thing is that the second name of the Ivankovo ‚Äã‚Äãreservoir is the Moscow Sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Platform Moscow Sea" class="if uuid-2949262" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2949262.jpg"></div><p>  This platform is the closest to this reservoir, and therefore attracts a large number of avid fishermen and other lovers to enjoy the "abyss of the sea."  In addition, the Moscow Sea stopping point with two platforms and two tracks is also notable for the fact that near the railway tracks there is a mass grave of railway workers shot by fascists in the fall of 1941.  Also near the platform is the Zavidovo National Park. </p><h2>  Next stop - Chupriyanovka platform </h2><p>  There is still no exact data on when the Chupriyanovka platform was opened near the village of the same name.  Someone says that this happened in 1870, other sources report that the discovery happened four years later.  Be that as it may, the platform has been functioning - we will take it that way - from the end of the nineteenth century.  There are two platforms at the stopping point, as well as an adjustable railway crossing.  In addition, near the platform and, accordingly, the village there are a lot of different slopes, ski slopes, places for riding on buns and the like.  And since Chupriyanovka is just one stop away from Tver, it is not surprising that this place is a favorite destination for residents of this city. </p><h2>  The next station is the final </h2><p>  So our small voyage along the route Moscow - Tver came to an end.  Electric trains in the Leningrad direction, of course, go further, but this time we will not go further: our journey will be too long.  We‚Äôll take a ride in this direction one day later, but for now we‚Äôll get to know a little closer with the end point of our route - the Tver station. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russiantowns.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tver Station" class="if uuid-2949267" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59468/2949267.jpg"></div><p>  It was opened in 1850 and at one time (from 1930 to 1990) was called the same as the city itself: Kalinin.  Compared to all previous stopping points, Tver, located one hundred and sixty-odd kilometers from the Russian capital, is not just a large station - it is huge.  She has as many as fifty-two routes - this is the largest transport hub not only in Tver, but in the entire region.  In addition to the railway station, there is a repair locomotive depot, a car depot and several other enterprises of the railway network.  The station employs more than one and a half hundred people, and more than eleven thousand passengers pass through the station per day. </p><p>  It is interesting that, although the date of the beginning of the work of the Tver station is considered to be 1850, the station building was built earlier - in 1845-1848.  By the way, the exact same station - one-on-one - was erected in Klin. </p><p>  So, we met with several stations of the Leningrad direction.  We hope our virtual trip has turned out informative and interesting! </p>
