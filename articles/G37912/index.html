  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to decorate wedding wine glasses with your own hands?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The wedding is a major event.  Every bride really wants everything to be perfect on this wonderful day.  When preparing the ceremony, you need to take care of many little things and a large number of necessary accessories, most of which can be made independently.  A sewn garter of the bride or decorated <span>wedding glasses</span> with their own hands will remain in the house as a pleasant reminder of this significant event. </p><p>  Making various little things for a wedding brings a lot of pleasure and can turn from a hobby into a favorite work.  This time we will not dwell on all the necessary accessories.  Let's look at <span>how to decorate your wedding glasses with your own hands.</span>  It should be remembered that all items must be made in the same style.  The set for the wedding ceremony includes: a pillow for rings, glasses for the bride and groom, outfits for champagne bottles and a family safe and a hearth. </p><p>  <strong>How to decorate wedding wine glasses with your own hands using artificial flowers?</strong> </p><p>  There are always many different colors at a wedding.  The tradition of decorating any holiday with living plants has come to us since ancient times.  We will use this method to beautifully decorate our wedding glasses with our own hands.  We will need two large artificial flowers, glasses, thin satin or kapron ribbons, rhinestones, beads and ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù glue.  First you need to sort the flowers into separate petals.  If the flower is made of several layers of whole-cut rows of 4-5 petals, you will need to make an incision on one side. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Turn the glass upside down.  We begin to collect the flower, carefully placing the petals around the legs, fixing each row with glue.  When the flower is completely ready, we fix the end of a thin <span>satin ribbon</span> under one of the last petals <span>.</span>  We wrap it around the leg of the glass and glue the end to the bottom.  Apply a strip of glue around the bottom of the legs and sprinkle it with beads.  Glue a few beads or rhinestones on the flower petals.  The junction of the glass with the leg is closed with a small bow.  You can use all consumables of the same color to decorate or choose <span>contrasting colors.</span>  In any case, they will look great. </p><p>  <strong>How to decorate wedding wine glasses with your own hands with beads, rhinestones and lace?</strong> </p><p>  Apply glue to the glasses on the glasses and sprinkle the prepared beads on the surface.  It adheres strictly along the lines and forms a beautiful pattern.  Draw in small sections, then the pattern will turn out more openwork. </p><p>  Cover the leg and the bottom of the glass with beads, and glue the cut motif from the lace fabric onto the glass with glue, decorating it with just a few beads or rhinestones. </p><p>  Fully glue the glass with a lace cloth, departing from the upper edge of one centimeter.  Twist the leg with a thin satin ribbon.  To hide the place of fastening of the tape at the bottom, make a ring of beads and glue them.  Tie a small bow from several ribbons at the top of the leg, and glue a few small beads on the lace trim of the glass. </p><p>  From a thin ribbon, make a few small roses.  From small flowers, beads and rhinestones, lay the pattern on the surface of the glass, attaching it with glue.  Decorate the leg with a small bow. </p><p>  Fine decoration of glasses will be painted with acrylics.  You can come up with a pattern yourself or use special contour themed stickers.  An interesting option would be the image of the bride and groom on the glasses, painted with paints. </p><p>  Sew a miniature copy of the bride‚Äôs wedding garter and put it on the glasses.  Decorate the leg with a thin ribbon, glued beads or attach a line of strass along the entire length of the leg. </p><p>  It doesn't matter which way you choose.  <span>Decorating your wedding glasses with your own hands</span> will give you a lot of pleasure and give you pleasure from the look of finished products. </p>
