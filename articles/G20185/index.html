    <h2>  Is insurance required? </h2><p>  It is believed that insurance is a conditionally voluntary matter.  At present, the process of life insurance of persons involved in sports is a mandatory requirement.  And this applies not only to professional athletes, but also to amateur beginners. </p><p>  According to experts, no one will allow you or a child without a policy.  In this <span>case, accident insurance</span> (athletes <em> </em>  or lovers) allows you to protect not only the owners of the insurance themselves, but also those responsible for their training. </p><p>  For example, during a lesson in the gym, a barbell fell on your leg and injured your leg.  As a result, you have a cast and complaints to instructors or owners of the hall regarding safety measures.  If there is a policy, the insurance company will solve this problem.  By the way, this rule is valid in the framework of the Federal Law "On Compulsory Insurance". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What is the reason for the obligatory registration of the policy? </h2><p>  Compulsory insurance for athletes is a precautionary measure that can not only offset the cost of treating the injured, but even pay the cost of the recovery process.  For example, during one of the hockey matches the striker of a famous Russian team received a serious puck.  As a result of this, he was hospitalized.  But since before that he was insured against an accident, the insurance covered the costs of treatment and rehabilitation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__v8w"></div><div class="vn-player" style="box-sizing: border-box; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; z-index: 0; margin: auto;"><div style="position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; text-align: center;"><iframe height="100%" width="100%" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginleft="0" marginright="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay" sandbox="allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-pointer-lock allow-scripts allow-popups allow-top-navigation" src="about:blank" class="vn-container-iframe" style="position: relative; z-index: 1; width: 100%; height: 100%; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: none; overflow: hidden; max-width: initial; max-height: initial;"></iframe></div></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Policies that help insure athletes and amateurs during training provide an opportunity to cover their participation in sports camps and trips.

They can also provide full civil liability. </p><h2>  What are the main sports that need a policy? </h2><p>  There is a special list of sports that require compulsory insurance.

    <h2>  What should be the policy: requirements </h2><p>  In order for you, a child or a group to be allowed to study, insurance is required.  However, not everyone can come up.  It is believed that it must meet certain requirements.  For example, insurance of athletes for training is carried out on a special form of the insurer.  On it, as a rule, the details of the organization are indicated and there is a wet seal. </p><p>  Before starting classes you need to present a printed or ready-made policy.  It must contain the following data: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  detailed initials of the student (full name); </li><li>  date and year of birth; </li><li>  insurance period; </li><li>  validity; </li><li>  type of physical activity (fitness, training in the gym, boxing); </li><li>  fixed contract number; </li><li>  amount of insurance compensation. </li></ul><h2>  Coverage and Amount Details </h2><p>  Further, the insurance itself should fully cover the entire period of the proposed training.  If the final date of the training is not indicated (for example, participation in several competitions, training camps, training is supposed), then the policy should be drawn up with a margin.  In this case, it is better to do it for a year. </p><p>  If we talk about the amount of insurance, then it should be chosen according to their financial capabilities and wishes.  But here you need to understand that the greater the amount of insurance, the higher the possible compensation.  For the same reason, the athlete's life and health insurance should be carried out at the maximum amount. </p>

    <h2>  What risks can cover? </h2><p>  The issued insurance will be able to give the following types of guarantees: </p><ul><li>  upon the occurrence of temporary disability; </li><li>  from possible disability; </li><li>  in case of unexpected death. </li></ul><p>  In particular, the insurance of athletes for training and competition makes it possible to receive 1-100% of the initial amount of the policy in case of temporary disability.  Moreover, each case is considered separately.  And the amount of compensation is determined in accordance with the standard payment table. </p><p>  If an accident has occurred that has led to disability, the amount of compensation will range from 60-90% of the cost of insurance.  Moreover, the more serious the injury of the insured person will be, the higher the compensation will be. </p><p>  Upon the death of an amateur or professional athlete, the insurer is obliged to pay 100% compensation to the relatives of the deceased.  This is what athletes insurance is for <em>.</em> </p><h2>  What parameters determines the price? </h2><p>  The cost of insurance depends on the sport that the insured person is engaged in.  The second important factor affecting the price is considered age.  For example, it can range from 18 to 65 years.  And the third criterion is the amount for which the individual was insured. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that one policy may include 3-4 sports.  For example, if the health insurance of athletes combining training in swimming and freestyle wrestling is supposed.  In a word, this approach is relevant for those who plan to attend several sports sections at once.  However, it should be borne in mind that the number of sports included in the policy will in no way affect its value.  In this case, the most traumatic among them will be evaluated. </p><h2>  When is group insurance issued? </h2><p>  In many insurance companies, it is possible to draw up group policies.  This option is suitable for people who plan to engage in the same type of physical activity, for example, rowing.  A prerequisite for obtaining such insurance is the fact that amateurs or professionals belong to the same age category.  Moreover, the number of people in the group cannot exceed 30 people. </p><h2>  Within which territory does it operate? </h2><p>  The insurance policy is most often valid within the Russian Federation.  This applies to all educational institutions.  The insurance issued must be accepted by the heads of all sports sections and circles.  If you want this rule to apply to other countries, you should additionally take out insurance that covers medical expenses abroad. </p><h2>  How to make out quickly? </h2><p>  Insurance for competitions and training is possible both with a personal visit to the office of the company, and online.  It is noteworthy that in the second case, the whole process will take no more than 5-7 minutes.  To calculate the cost of the policy, as a rule, an online calculator operates on the websites of insurers.  An example of calculating the price of insurance can be seen in the picture below. </p><h2>  How to act in case of an insured event? </h2><p>  First of all, you need to calm down and not panic.  At the second stage, you should definitely call the hotline and report what happened.  If an injury has occurred that requires urgent hospitalization, you should prepare a policy (presented during the preparation of the patient‚Äôs documents) and ask the medical personnel to inform the insurance company about the incident. </p>
