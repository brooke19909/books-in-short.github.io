    <h2>  What was before </h2><p>  Several centuries ago, a city cemetery was located on this site, on which in 1701 a wooden Mironositskaya church was built.  Later, a stone temple was erected in its place.  As the city grew, its borders moved further away from this place, and over time the cemetery was demolished. </p><p>  The Mironositskaya church has since been rebuilt many times, expanded, a bell tower was erected, which was considered the second largest after the Assumption <span>Cathedral in Kharkov.</span>  However, after the revolution, when the church began to crumble, it suffered the same fate: in 1930 it was blown up. </p><p>  In those years, Kharkov was the capital of Ukraine, and at this place it was decided to create the Theater of Musical Sciences, consisting of a theater, a circus and a cinema located in the same building.  However, later the capital moved to Kiev, and the plans were not fulfilled, and therefore a trolleybus fleet was created here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  “Mirror Stream”, Kharkov: history and legends </h2><p>  The beginning of the construction of the Mirror Stream is associated with 2 legends, each of which is interesting in its own way.  According to one of the legends told by former employees of the Regional Party Committee, during the visit of the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party N. Khrushchev in the late 1940s, he had a conversation with the head of the Regional Committee V. Churaev in a building near the park.  Looking out the window at a cluster of trolleybuses, Khrushchev was surprised at such an unsightly appearance, which he told Churaev about. </p><p>  According to another legend, the reason for the construction was the love story of the secretary of the Regional Committee V. Churaev and a teacher named Valentina, who lived in Kislovodsk and loved to walk near the Altanka (Glass Jet).  The people even went by the name “Bahchichuraevsky Fountain” as a confirmation of this legend. </p><p>  As a result, it was decided to place a square and a pavilion fountain “Mirror Stream” (Kharkov) in this place.  When designing, Altanka, located in Kislovodsk, was taken as a sample.  Architect V. Korzh even went to this city to get acquainted with the plan and the object itself (see photo below). </p>

    <p>  V. Korzh studied the arrangement of the Kislovodsk Glass Jet and made some changes to the project.  So, the “Glass”, or “Mirror Stream” (Kharkov) was decorated with a chapel type turret.  And in 1947, the fountain was built by the method of national construction (and according to some information by the forces of captured Germans). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the 1950s, a pool was located nearby, originally surrounded by a conventional brick fence, and later it was made of granite.  In 1958, a square was destroyed here, later called Victory Park, in which an alley of Komsomol heroes who died during the war was opened (now it has been moved to another place). </p><h2>  Reconstruction and improvement of the “Mirror Jet” </h2><p>  In order to decorate and maintain in good condition the main symbol of the city, both the square and the fountain arbor itself were reconstructed several times.  This place has always been surrounded by the popular love of ordinary citizens and the attention of the "fathers" of the city. </p><p>  One of the reconstructions was made in 2007, when the fountain in the park was improved: new nozzles (137 pieces) and floodlights for night illumination, as well as installations for creating artificial fog were mounted.  The bowl was lined with tiles and marble. The capacity of the Mirror Stream fountain (Kharkov), the photo of which can be seen below, now amounts to 350 tons of water. </p>

    <p>  The “stream” itself was also improved, which is poured into the lower pool, located under the gazebo, with spectacular mirror paintings, and beautiful flower beds with flowers are broken under it. </p><p>  The last reconstruction of the square took place in 2015 after the completion of the construction of the new Mironositskaya church, which was erected behind the fountain and the gazebo. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  The Mirror Stream (Kharkov) has been considered the main symbol of the city for many years.  Her image was even used to create a package of sweets of the same name, which have been produced by the Kharkov biscuit factory since the 1980s. </p><p>  The symbol of Kharkov is very fond of newlyweds, who necessarily come here for a photo shoot on their wedding day.  Lovers also consider it a good omen to come here at night to make wishes, standing above the stream under the dome of the rotunda. </p>

    <p>  “Mirror Stream” (Kharkov), as for many years in a row, still serves as a resting place for Kharkiv citizens who come here with children, friends and loved ones to enjoy the play of water in colorful illumination.  The complex looks especially impressive in the evening, illuminated from several sides by spotlights that constantly change color. </p>
