For example, before booking it is important to know about the conditions of accommodation and food.  Can I bring a child with me?  Should the traveler count on additional amenities and entertainment?  How long will it take to go to the beach?  These are important questions for every person planning a vacation. </p><h2>  Location Features </h2>
