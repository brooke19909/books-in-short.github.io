Rulers of Ancient Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Kievan Rus is a medieval state that arose in the 9th century.  The first great princes placed their residence in the city of Kiev, which, according to legend, was founded in the VI century.  three brothers - Kiy, Schek and Horeb.  The state quickly entered its heyday and took an important international position.  This was facilitated by the establishment of political and commercial relations with such powerful neighbors as Byzantium and the Khazar Kaganate. </p><h2>  Board of Askold </h2><p>  The name "Russian land" was assigned to the state with its capital in Kiev during the reign of Askold (IX century).  In The Tale of Bygone Years, his name is mentioned next to Deer, the elder brother.  To date, there is no information about his rule.  This gives rise to a number of historians (for example, B. A. Rybakov) to associate the name Deer with another nickname Askold.  In addition, the question of the origin of the first Kiev rulers still remains unresolved.  Some researchers consider them to be Varangian governors, others derive the origin of <span>Askold and Dir</span> from the glades (descendants of Kiy). </p><p>  The Tale of Bygone Years provides some important insights into Askold's rule.  In 860, he made a successful trip to Byzantium, and even kept Constantinople in the gantry for about a week.  According to legend, it was he who made the Byzantine ruler recognize Russia as an independent state.  But in 882, Askold was killed by Oleg, who then sat on the Kiev throne. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="under the grand duke" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/776527.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Oleg's Board </h2><p>  Oleg - the first Grand Duke of Kiev, who ruled in 882-912.  According to legend, he received power in Novgorod from Rurik in 879 as regent of his young son, and then transferred his residence to Kiev.  In 885, Oleg annexed the lands of Radimichi, Slavs, and Kriviches to his principality, after which he made a trip to the streets and Tivertsy.  In 907, he opposed the powerful Byzantium.  Oleg's brilliant victory is described in detail by Nestor in his work.  <span>The campaign of the Grand</span> Duke not only helped strengthen the position of Russia in the international arena, but also opened access to duty-free trade with the Byzantine Empire.  Oleg‚Äôs new victory in Constantinople in 911 confirmed the privileges of the Russian merchants. </p><p>  It is with these events that the stage of the formation of a new state with a center in Kiev ends and the period of its highest prosperity begins. </p><h2>  Board of Igor and Olga </h2><p>  After Oleg‚Äôs death, Rurik‚Äôs son Igor comes to power (912‚Äì945).  Like his predecessor, Igor had to face the disobedience of the princes of subordinate tribal unions.  His reign begins with a clash with the drevlyans, streets and tivertsy, whom the Grand Duke imposed an unbearable tribute.  Such a policy determined his imminent death at the hands of rebellious Drevlyans.  According to legend, when Igor once again came to collect tribute, they tipped two birch trees, tied his legs to their tops and let them go. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Dukes" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/776528.jpg"></div>

The main goal of her policy was revenge for the death of her husband.  She suppressed all anti-Rurik sentiments of the drevlyans and finally subjugated them to her power.  In addition, the first attempt to baptize Kievan Rus, which was unsuccessful, is associated with the name of Olga the Great.  The policy aimed at the proclamation of Christianity as the state religion was continued by the following great princes. </p><h2>  Board of Svyatoslav </h2><p>  Svyatoslav - the son of Igor and Olga - ruled in 964-980.  He led an active conquering foreign policy and almost did not care about the internal problems of the state.  At first, during his absence, Olga was in charge of management, and after her death, the affairs of the three parts of the state (Kiev, Drevlyanskaya land and Novgorod) were run by the great Russian princes Yaropolk, Oleg and Vladimir. </p><p>  Svyatoslav made a successful trip to the Khazar Kaganate.  Such powerful fortresses as Semender, Sarkel, Itil could not resist his squad.  In 967, he launched the Balkan campaign.  Svyatoslav took possession of the territories in the lower reaches of the Danube, captured Pereyaslav and put his governor there.  In the next campaign in the Balkans, he managed to subjugate virtually all of Bulgaria.  But on the way home, the squad of Svyatoslav was defeated by the Pechenegs, who were in collusion with the emperor of Byzantium.  The great prince also died in the region. </p><h2>  Reign of Vladimir the Great </h2><p>  Vladimir was the illegitimate son of Svyatoslav, as he was born from Malusha, the key keeper of Princess Olga.  Father put the future great ruler on the throne in Novgorod, but during the feuds he managed to seize the throne of Kiev.  Having come to power, Vladimir streamlined the management of territories and eradicated any signs of local nobility on the lands of subordinate tribes.  It was under him that the tribal division of Kievan Rus was replaced by territorial. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Duke" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/776529.jpg" width="284"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the lands united by Vladimir, many ethnic groups and peoples lived.  In such circumstances, it was difficult for the ruler to maintain the territorial integrity of the state, even with the help of weapons.  This led to the need for an ideological justification of Vladimir‚Äôs rights to control all tribes.  Therefore, the prince decided to reform paganism, placing in Kiev, not far from the place where the palaces of the great princes, idols of the most revered Slavic gods were located. </p><h2>  Baptism of Russia </h2><p>  The attempt to reform paganism was unsuccessful.  After that, Vladimir called the rulers of various tribal unions, professing Islam, Judaism, Christianity, etc. After hearing their proposals for a new state religion, the prince went to the Byzantine Chersonesos.  After a successful campaign, Vladimir announced his intention to marry the Byzantine princess Anna, but since it was impossible while he professed paganism, the prince was baptized.  Returning to Kiev, the governor sent messengers around the city with an order to all residents to come to the Dnieper the next day.  On January 19, 988, people entered the river, where Byzantine priests baptized them.  In fact, the <span>baptism of Rus</span> was violent. </p><p>  The new faith did not immediately become nationwide.  At first, residents of large cities adjoined Christianity, and in churches until the 12th century.  there were special places for adult baptism. </p><h2>  Significance of the Proclamation of Christianity as the State Religion </h2><p>  <span>The adoption of Christianity</span> had a huge impact on the further development of the state.  Firstly, this led to the fact that the great Russian princes strengthened their power over disparate tribes and peoples.  Secondly, the role of the state in the international arena has increased.  The adoption of Christianity made it possible to establish close ties with the Byzantine Empire, the Czech Republic, Poland, the German Empire, Bulgaria and Rome.  It also contributed to the fact that the military campaigns of the Grand Dukes of Rus were no longer used as the main way to implement foreign policy plans. </p><h2>  The reign of Yaroslav the Wise </h2><p>  Yaroslav the Wise united Kievan Rus under his rule in 1036. After many years of strife, the new ruler had to re-establish himself on these lands.  He managed to return the Cherven cities, to establish the city of Yuryev in the Peipsi land, and finally defeat the Pechenegs in 1037.  In honor of the victory over this union, Yaroslav ordered the laying of the greatest temple - Sophia of Kiev. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Great Princes of Russia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/776530.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  In addition, he was the first to compile a collection of state laws - The Truth of Yaroslav.  It should be noted that before him, the rulers of ancient Russia (Grand Dukes Igor, Svyatoslav, Vladimir) asserted their power with the help of force, and not law and law.  Yaroslav was engaged in the construction of churches (St. George's Monastery, St. Sophia Cathedral, Kiev-Pechersky Monastery) and supported the authority of the princely authority with a still weak church organization.  In 1051, he appointed the first Metropolitan of the Rus - Hilarion.  The Grand Duke remained in power for 37 years and died in 1054. </p><h2>  Board of Yaroslavichi </h2><p>  After the death of Yaroslav the Wise, the most important lands were in the hands of his eldest sons - Izyaslav, Svyatoslav and Vsevolod.  Initially, the great princes ruled the state in a fairly coherent manner.  They successfully fought against the Turkic tribes of the Torques, but in 1068 they suffered a crushing defeat on the Alte River in the battle with the Polovtsy.  This led to the fact that Izyaslav was expelled from Kiev and fled to the Polish king Boleslav the Second.  In 1069, with the help of Allied forces, he again occupied the capital. </p><p>  In 1072, the Grand Dukes of Rus gathered for a veche in Vyshgorod, where the famous code of Russian laws, ‚ÄúTrue Yaroslavichi,‚Äù was approved.  After this begins a long period of internecine wars.  In 1078, the throne of Kiev was occupied by Vsevolod.  After his death in 1093, <span>Svyatopolk Izyaslavich</span> came to power <span>,</span> and the two sons of Vsevolod - Vladimir Monomakh and Rostislav - began to rule in Chernigov and Pereyaslav. </p><h2>  Board of Vladimir Monomakh </h2><p>  After the death of Svyatopolk in <span>1113, the</span> people of Kiev invited Vladimir Monomakh to the throne.  He saw the main goal of his policy in centralizing state power and in strengthening the unity of Russia.  To establish peaceful relations with different princes, he used dynastic marriages.  It was thanks to this and the far-sighted domestic policy that he was able to successfully control the vast territory of Russia for 12 years.  In addition, dynastic marriages united the Kiev state with Byzantium, Norway, England, Denmark, the German Empire, Sweden and Hungary. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Dukes of Ancient Russia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/776531.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <p>  Under the Grand Duke Vladimir Monomakh, the capital of Russia was set up, in particular, a bridge was built across the Dnieper.  The ruler died in 1125, after which a long period of fragmentation and decline of the state began. </p><h2>  Grand Dukes of Ancient Russia in the period of fragmentation </h2><p>  What happened next?  During the feudal fragmentation, the rulers of ancient Russia changed every 6-8 years.  The Grand Dukes (Kiev, Chernigov, Novgorod, Pereyaslav, Rostov-Suzdal, Smolensk) fought for the main throne with weapons in their hands.  Svyatoslav and Rurik, who belonged to the most influential family of the Olgovich and Rostislavovich, ruled the state for the longest time. </p><p>  In the Chernigov-Seversky principality, power was in the hands of the dynasty of Olegovich and Davidovich.  Since these lands were most susceptible to the expansion of the Polovtsy, the rulers were able to restrain their aggressive campaigns due to the conclusion of dynastic marriages. </p><p>  <span>The Pereyaslavl principality</span> even in the period of fragmentation was completely dependent on Kiev.  The highest flowering of these territories is associated with the name of Vladimir Glebovich. </p><h2>  Strengthening the Principality of Moscow </h2><p>  After the decline of Kiev, the main role passes to the <span>Moscow principality.</span>  Its rulers borrowed the title worn by the great princes of Russia. </p><p>  The strengthening of the Moscow principality is associated with the name of Daniel (the youngest <span>son of Alexander Nevsky).</span>  He managed to subjugate the city of Kolomna, the Pereyaslav principality and the city of Mozhaisk.  As a result of the accession of the latter, an important trade route and waterway of the river.  Moscow was within the territory of Daniel. </p><h2>  Board of Ivan Kalita </h2><p>  In 1325, Prince Ivan Danilovich Kalita came to power.  He made a trip to Tver and defeated it, thereby eliminating his strong rival.  In 1328, he received a label from the Mongol Khan on the Principality of Vladimir.  In his reign, Moscow firmly established its superiority in North-Eastern Russia.  In addition, at that time a close alliance was formed between the princely power and the church, which played a significant role in the formation of a centralized state.  Metropolitan Peter moved his residence from Vladimir to Moscow, which has become an important religious center. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Duke of All Russia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/776532.jpg" width="358"></div>

    <p>  In relations with the Mongol khans, Ivan Kalita pursued a policy of maneuvering and proper payment of tribute.  Fundraising from the population was carried out with marked rigidity, which led to the accumulation of considerable wealth in the hands of the ruler.  It was during the reign of Kalita that the foundation of the power of Moscow was laid.  His son Semyon already claimed the title ‚ÄúGrand Duke of All Russia‚Äù. </p><h2>  Association of lands around Moscow </h2><p>  During the reign of Kalita, Moscow managed to recover from a series of internecine wars and lay the foundations of an effective economic and economic system.  This power was supported by the erection of the Kremlin in 1367, which was a military defensive fortress. </p><p>  In the middle of the XIV century.  the princes of Suzdal-Nizhny Novgorod and Ryazan principalities are included in the struggle for supremacy on Russian soil.  But Tver remained the main enemy of Moscow.  Opponents of the powerful principality often sought support from the Mongol khan or from Lithuania. </p><p>  The unification of the Russian lands around Moscow is connected with the name of Dmitry Ivanovich Donskoy, who besieged Tver and gained recognition of his authority. </p><h2>  Kulikovo battle </h2><p>  In the second half of the XIV century.  the great princes of Russia direct all their forces to the struggle with the Mongol Khan Mamai.  In the summer of 1380, he and his army approached the southern borders of Ryazan.  In contrast, Dmitry Ivanovich put up a 120-thousand-strong squad, which moved in the direction of the Don. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="great Russian princes" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/776534.jpg" width="389"></div>  On September 8, 1380, the Russian army took up positions on the Kulikovo field, and on the same day a decisive battle took place - one of the largest battles in medieval history.
