This piece of clothing (originally - as a man's) has been known for three centuries, but it began to acquire special popularity in women's fashion from the middle of the last century.  Initially, it was customary to <span>knit a cardigan with</span> knitting needles made of thick wool as clothing for the winter period.  Gradually, more variety appeared in cardigan models.  They were not only knitted, but sewn.  This outfit began to be worn not only in cold weather.  Light cardigans appeared - from fine wool, cotton, silk.  Cardigan as an element of the wardrobe has become universal for any season.  Recently, at the peak of fashion, felted cardigans also appeared. </p><p>  But still, knitting a cardigan with knitting needles remains a classic.  Moreover, now it is already acceptable to deviate from the strict rule of button closure.  Often a <span>cardigan is knitted</span> without a fastener at all, but with a belt that prevents the floors from swinging open.  There are many ways to <span>knit a cardigan.</span>  Knitting needles can create a tight knit, and lace.  Depending on what season the product is intended for, it can be knitted from thick warm yarn (wool, mohair, angora) or thin and light (acrylic, cotton, blended yarn). </p><p>  Knitting a cardigan on knitting needles is not particularly difficult.  In magazines and on the Internet you can find a huge number of models with patterns and descriptions.  A cardigan usually fits directly, from the bottom up, without increases and decreases.  Options can only be in the design of the armhole.  The armhole can be classic, for a set-in sleeve, or straight - the so-called "flat shoulder". </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The product consists of a back, two shelves and two sleeves.  When calculating the total width, 3-5 cm is usually added for freedom of fit.  Knitting a cardigan with knitting needles can start from the back.  This is the easiest part.  If the cut-out of the armhole is not necessary to knit, then the back pattern is a regular rectangle.  If the sleeve is set-in, then the decrease is made from each edge, closing at the end of each row: 1 time 3p, 2 times 2p, 3 times 1p. </p><p>  The shelf should be wider than half of the back, because it is still necessary to arrange a fastener, the strap for which can be part of the shelf or tied separately and then sewn.  First you need to determine the depth of cut on the cardigan.  Having knitted a shelf to this point, on the side of the fastener, you need to start reducing the loops to make a V-shaped cut.  The frequency of loop reduction depends on how many rows remain from the bottom of the cut to the shoulder line. </p><p>  The calculation is as follows: </p><p>  Suppose the initial width of the shelf is 52p.  Shoulder Width 22p.  So, in the process of cutting out the cut, you need to evenly reduce 52 - 22 = 30p. </p><p>  Cutout depth 60r.  60/30 = 2, that is, you need to reduce 1p in every 2nd row. </p><p>  By the way, to make the reduction line beautiful and neat, it is better to knit the third and fourth loops together. </p><p>  The sleeve is knitted in the same way as for any other product.  If it is set-in, then the sleeve ridge is tied.  If the cardigan is with a lowered armhole, then the loop of the sleeve in the upper part can be closed in a straight line. </p><p>  If the fastener of a cardigan is knitted at the same time with a shelf, then it is better to make it with a denser, viscous, for example, scarf, elastic or "tangle".  So it will be better to keep the edge and not let it stretch.  If the strap for the fastener is knitted separately, its length should be equal to the total height of both shelves plus the width of the neckline on the back. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that cardigans with a vertical pattern, for example, ‚Äúbraids‚Äù, give a special harmony to the figure.  But the horizontal pattern will visually fill. </p><p>  Cardigan knitting pattern can be used for <span>knitting a vest.</span>  Just do not make sleeves, but carefully tie up the armhole line, for example with an elastic band.  Knitting a cardigan (vest) with knitting needles can be complemented by crocheted trim. </p>
