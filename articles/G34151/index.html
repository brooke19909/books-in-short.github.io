It was noticed a long time ago that the principle of one-hundred-per-one-man rule often takes society out of balance and cannot ensure its stability.  The system of checks and balances in making decisions that determine the fate of a particular community of people appeared, obviously, even before the birth of the most ancient developed civilizations. </p>

    <p>  The earliest and most primitive democratic institution was the ancient council of elders, made up of respected tribal members.  Their roles were played by wise men of experience, more successful miners and hunters, people who had authority among their fellow tribesmen for various reasons. </p><p>  Decisions regarding the movement of the tribe, the organization of clashes with competing communities, other important aspects of life were taken collectively.  Each member of the council of elders expressed his opinion, argued for it, and only after that, after hearing all the pros and cons, the head of the community made this or that decision. </p><h2>  In Hellenic civilization </h2><p>  Enough historical sources have been preserved about the activities of such a body in <span>Ancient Sparta.</span>  For the Spartans, the council of elders is the body that participated in government decisions along with the tsar.  Moreover, even in those days the opinion of the council had the same weight as the opinion of the ruler. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The Spartans' deliberative body included representatives of all administrative units in the amount of 28. Each of the elders was elected by their tribe through the general assembly of the people.  The most important decisions in the state were taken at a general meeting, but the council of elders prepared a list of issues that were put to its consideration.  This guaranteed the productive work of the meeting, directing its work and preventing it from turning into a booth. </p><p>  In addition to organizing general meetings, the council participated in diplomatic work, influenced the establishment of relations with other states, and was also involved in the investigation of crimes committed by senior state officials.  By the way, the meaning of the word ‚Äúcouncil of elders‚Äù in the case of Ancient Sparta has, we can say, the most direct meaning - only persons who have reached the age of 60 could become members of this body. </p><h2>  Council of Elders of the first republic in history </h2><p>  In France, the council of elders existed as one of the organs of government.  It was created at the very end of the 18th century, the third constitution.  Members of the body were elected from among citizens of at least 40 years old. </p>

    <p>  That was the French Council of Elders.  This, by the way, was not a legislative body.  He could only approve or reject the legislative initiatives of other higher governing bodies. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Slavs and Russian Empire </h2><p>  Our ancestors also have a council of elders - this is not only a relic of the ancient communal system.  The earliest manifestation of Slavic statehood was the power of the princes.  But the image of the kungs as cruel tyrants with unlimited power is, rather, one of the historical horror stories and fables about the Russians. </p>

    <p>  In the early stages of statehood, the princes had considerable power, but, rather, executive power.  They were invited to reign, and for the improper performance of their duties they could also ‚Äúask‚Äù, which often happened.  The prince led the squad, was responsible for protecting the principality from external threats, and adjudicated.  But the development paths were determined by the popular veche and the councils of elders. </p><p>  At a later time in Russian history, there was always a certain analogue of the deliberative body, which at different periods possessed greater or lesser powers.  This was during the reign of the first tsars (the boyar‚Äôs Duma) and even Soviet Russia was led by the Supreme Council. </p><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  The meeting of residents of a particular locality, respected, with great life experience, is a governing body that has not lost its relevance today.  Such survivability is not difficult to explain.  On the one hand, members of the council of elders are people who have seen their lives, and on the other, decisions are made collectively after discussions.  And this ensures a balanced and thoughtful fateful decisions. </p>

    <p>  Nowadays, the concept of ‚Äúcouncil of elders‚Äù is more commonly used in local government.  This is especially common among the Caucasian peoples, where the veneration of elders is elevated to the rank of a national idea.  Even in neighboring Belarus, there is an institution of local government with that name.  The tasks he solves lie in the plane of life of rural councils and districts. </p>
