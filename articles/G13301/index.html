    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Guests highlight the following negative aspects of the hotel: </p><ul><li>  breakfasts are quite expensive, and therefore it is better to eat in the cafe next door; </li><li>  disgusting soundproofing in the rooms; </li><li>  the registration procedure, as well as the eviction from the hotel, was very lengthy; </li><li>  the pedestrian approach to the hotel is almost completely blocked by a fence, which is very inconvenient; </li><li>  hard pillows on the beds; </li><li>  the staff behaves in a rather peculiar way with guests (dismissive, and sometimes even rude); </li><li>  parking near the hotel is paid, and security is not very reliable; </li><li>  get ready for the fact that you will bring your suitcases to your room on your own (although this is simply unacceptable for a five-star hotel). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the Golden Ring Hotel externally produces the most favorable impression.  Inside, everything is furnished in accordance with the classical style, and there are also luxurious decorative elements.  Also pleased with the new high-quality furniture and modern appliances.  Of the positive aspects, it is also worth noting the central location (in close proximity to the famous Arbat and other tourist sites).  Nevertheless, despite the external beauty, lack of professionalism in service.  The staff lacks basic politeness, and the reception staff sometimes behave arrogantly.  The director of the Golden Ring Hotel (Moscow) should pay attention to this.  And all this in a five-star hotel, where the cost of living is not so low.  Speaking of price, it is very overpriced in terms of nutrition.  Do not spend money on expensive breakfasts.  in neighboring cafes and restaurants you can eat deliciously, and the bill will be about half as small. </p>
