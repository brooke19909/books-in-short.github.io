    <h2>  Botanical Garden (Moscow), how to get a visitor </h2><p>  If guests of the capital are poorly oriented on the ground, especially if they decide to visit the GBS for the first time, then it will be useful for them to find out the following: the main thing is to find the route to the Vladykino metro station on subway maps.  You will have to walk about 10 minutes from the station to the main entrance to the expositions.  The main gate is located on the side of the Botanical Street.  In addition to the main entrance, there are several gates around the perimeter of the garden.  On the way from the exit from the metro you will see a small gate.  There are also inputs from the border with VDNH. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Traveling by car </h2><p>  Many nature lovers travel by personal transport, so the question arises when they want to visit the Botanical Garden (Moscow): "How to get to the place from Dmitrovsky or Altufevsky Highways, and which route is better to choose?"  <span>Altufevskoe highway</span> passes through the Otradnoye area up to the GBS territory.  If you go along Dmitrovskoe highway, you will need to get to the intersection with Bolshaya Akademicheskaya Street. </p>

    <h2>  Routes of public transport from the metro VDNH </h2><p>  Of course, the Vladykino metro station is not the only one from where you can catch a bus and go to the Botanical Garden (Moscow).  How to get to the place, leaving at the metro station "VDNH"?  Bus routes 24, 85 and 803 run to the <span>Main Botanical Gardens of the</span> country, as well as trolleybuses 9, 36 and 73. </p><h2>  How much do entrance tickets cost? </h2><p>  Children under 7 years old accompanied by adults, as well as senior citizens, can use the free entrance to the territory.  For all other categories of the population, the cost of entry is: </p><ul><li>  For adults - 50 rubles </li><li>  For students and schoolchildren - 30 rubles. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the amount for admission is purely symbolic.  Next we follow the most popular exhibits.  Entrance to the rose garden and the exposition of decorative flowers costs 100 rubles per adult.  Children and senior citizens receive discounts.  Adult tickets for visiting the unique exhibition "Japanese Garden" on weekdays cost 150 rubles (due to a shorter working hours), on weekends and holidays - 200 rubles.  Now we learned, deciding to inspect the Botanical Garden (Moscow), how to get to it, and how much the entrance tickets cost.  It remains to determine with what exposure to start the inspection. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden VDNH Moscow" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29683/701573.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Anniversary of the Botanical Garden </h2><p>  In 2015, GBS celebrates its 70th anniversary.  The opening of the huge glass building of the New Greenhouse is planned for this significant event.  The entire surrounding area is cleaned and ennobled daily.  And now we can safely say that the celebrations will be held in conditions of perfect order and beauty.  Since the opening took place at the end of World War II, much attention is paid to exhibits imported from Germany, which can be viewed in the Stock Conservatory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden Moscow how to get there" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29683/701577.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Top exposure </h2><p>  We already learned a lot about the Botanical Garden <span>(Moscow), how to get to the</span> expositions, briefly covered the history of its creation.  The real gem of the project is the rose garden.  It is also worth noting the significance of two special expositions.  It will be a collection of tropical plants and the Japanese Garden.  Not a single botanical garden throughout Europe has such an extensive collection of coastal plants.  Among them are wild, cultural and flowering specimens.  If you have a great desire to admire the blooming sakura, many years ago brought to the Botanical Garden (Moscow), reviews of which are spread everywhere, welcome to the Japanese Garden.  People who once saw this miracle will never forget it.  Delicate fragrant flowering trees create a unique atmosphere of peace and tranquility.  Orchids, bonsai, miniature trees miraculously transport visitors far to the East, to the Land of the Rising Sun. </p><h2>  Rose garden </h2><p>  If we talk about the rose garden, then it‚Äôs worth starting with the history of the exposure.  Back in the middle of the last century, the scientist breeder Ivan Shtanko brought out amazing varieties of roses that instantly became popular even abroad.  To this day, the varieties Aurora, Yasnaya Polyana and Morning of Moscow are very popular outside of Russia.  The total area occupied by the rose garden totals 2.5 hectares.  In total, more than 270 different varieties of prickly beauty grow on the territory of GBS.  If you measure the number in the bushes, then the figure will be about 6,000 units.  Over the long history of the exposition, the best varieties of roses from around the world are collected here.  Many foreign rosological firms consider it an honor to cooperate with such a well-known organization as the Botanical Garden (Moscow).  The GBS address in all the years of its existence has repeatedly become the destination for considerable gratuitous gifts from partners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden Moscow reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29683/701585.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For completeness, numerous ponds and ponds framed by centuries-old oaks are located on the territory.  There is an exposition called "Natural Flora", which includes trees and shrubs of different regions of the country.  These include: </p><ul><li>  Plantations of the <span>European part of Russia.</span> </li><li>  Types of forests in Siberia. </li><li>  Representatives of the cultures of the Far Eastern Forest. </li><li>  Seedlings imported from Central Asia. </li><li>  Caucasian plantings. </li></ul><p>  Visitors, walking around the territory, can familiarize themselves with the standard of landscape design of the 50s of the last century, which is presented in the exposition "Garden of Continuous Flowering". </p><p>  In conclusion, I would like to wish aesthetic pleasure and unforgettable minutes of unity with nature, which the Botanical Garden (Moscow) can present to its guests.  Everyone now knows how to get to the breeding paradise. </p>
