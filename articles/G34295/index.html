  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Paper swan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A paper swan is a craft that stands out among others for beauty and grace.  In particular, if it is not made in a monotonous version.  A paper swan is a wonderful decoration for the home, which can serve as a good gift.  And to make it is not so difficult, although not fast.  In order for the paper swan to be ready, you will need to collect many components. </p><p>  The technology of such an origami was developed by the Chinese, it was they who at one time began to make voluminous complex figures from the same elements of a triangular shape.  Each such module is a piece of paper folded in a specific way.  The creation of a figure is done as follows - the modules are stacked together with layers.  The result of the work will not fall apart in any case, since the modules will be held by friction.  If you work with glue, then the figure will be an excellent toy for children. </p><p>  So, to make you a paper swan, you need to put together a certain number of modules of different colors.  Call more helpers - relatives, friends, so it will be easier for you.  It is impossible to make a swan out of paper if it is thin.  As a material you need high-quality color.  In this case, the modules will be small paper rectangles - 4x6 centimeters, you will need so many of them: 1 red, 36 blue.  60 yellow, 136 pink, 39 blue, 90 orange and 19 purple. </p><p>  So, a paper swan - step by step: </p><p>  - take three pink rectangles, insert the corners of two of them into the pockets of the third.  Then we take a couple more modules and connect to the first group.  In exactly the same way, the entire main swan ring is made, which consists of two rows, numbering 30 modules each.  The last element should close the circuit. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - then you need to take 30 orange modules and make the third row, and they should go in a checkerboard pattern.  In the same way, you need to do 2 more rows. </p><p>  - After that, turn off the workpiece.  To do this, you will need to take it by the edges, and then turn it as it were - from this, its shape will change significantly, it will resemble a platform. </p><p>  - Already inverted figure will need to add six rows of yellow modules.  (the number of elements in a row is still the same.) True, in this case they will not need to be strung, but worn on top. </p><p>  - wings will be made from row 7.  However, initially you will need to choose the side on which the head and neck will be located, and then remove several modules from it.  In this place the neck will be fastened.  On both sides of the neck you will need to make rows of yellow modules, each of which has 12 pieces.  In other words, in the seventh row there will be only 24 modules. </p><p>  - We continue to work on the wings.  Rows from the eighth to the tenth will be green, and in each subsequent one there will be two less elements than in the previous one.  In the eighth there will be 22, in 9 - 20, in 10 - 18. 11 and 12 rows will be blue.  In the first - 16 elements, in the 14. - In the 13th row - 12 blue, in 14 - 10, in 15 - 8. The wings will complete the purple - in the 16th row - 6 purple, in 17 - 4, in 18 - 2. All that remains is to give them a curved shape. </p><p>  - The tail is laid out in a similar way from the elements of green and blue (5 rows, in each next less per module). </p><p>  - The neck is made a little differently.  Two corners of the element are inserted into the pockets of the other.  First red, then seven violet, six blue and green, finally 7 yellow.  During the process, it is desirable to bend the neck so that in the end it takes the necessary shape. </p><p>  - As a decoration, you can also add a swan's eyes (painted or made of plastic), and tie a bow on the neck. </p><p>  - Finally, you can make a stand for a swan, based on two rings made according to the same principle as the neck.  On them will be a completed figure.  The resulting creation of your hands will certainly be able to impress any connoisseur of origami and take its rightful place in your home. </p>
