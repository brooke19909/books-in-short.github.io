One of the driest regions in America over the centuries has been inhabited by Native American tribes.  After the war between Mexico and the United States, the future homeland of entertainment goes to the United States.  The sparsely populated area during the time of the ‚Äúgold rush‚Äù is actively developing, and at first small settlements appear, which eventually turn into megacities. </p><h2>  USA, Nevada: cities recognized as a mecca of gambling </h2><p>  This state is often called the sunniest.  In that part of the territory, which is located in the desert zone, the temperature in the summer reaches 50 degrees.  Despite such a hot climate, the number of local people is constantly growing, and millions of tourists who want to have fun come to the excitement and recreation capital Rino and Las Vegas, whose population is 210 thousand and 550 thousand people, respectively. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="zone 51 nevada usa" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1153299.jpg" width="600"></div>

Those who come to try their luck immediately go to the unofficial entertainment capital, which became famous after 1931, when gambling in America was legalized. </p><p>  Today, Las Vegas is a real desert oasis, which is visited by about 40 million people a year.  The fact that of the 15 largest hotels in the country in Las Vegas is 14, says a lot, and the total number of rented rooms has long exceeded 130 thousand. </p><h2>  Game Industry Center </h2><p>  A huge glass pyramid of Cheops rises above the main street of Las Vegas, and in front of the entrance to the casino, amazed by the scope of the city's guests, a statue of the Egyptian Sphinx, exceeding the size of the present, is met.  More than 300 entertainment centers, decorated in various subjects, are trying to surprise with external surroundings and attract tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="usa state nevada city" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1153296.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other major cities in Nevada </h2><p>  Henderson - after Las Vegas, the second largest city in this state.  Its population is about 260 thousand people. </p><p>  In Paradise and Sunrise Manor, just over 200 thousand people live each. </p><p>  North Las Vegas and Spring Valley are cities with a population of 150 thousand each.  Sparks, a community in Washo County, is home to 100,000 people.  And finally, in the capital of Nevada - Carson City - there are only 55 thousand citizens. </p><p>  The remaining settlements are small.  Their population ranges from 10 to 30 thousand people. </p><h2>  Valley of Fire </h2><p>  In the north-east of the world gambling center is an interesting park in America, which Nevada has declared a national monument.  Open in 1935, the Valley of Fire got its name because of the red-brown color of the huge rocks.  On a bright sunny day, visitors to the natural monument think that it is truly engulfed in a blazing flame. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nevada attractions" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1153292.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But the ancient valley is also unique in that during the day the rocks change their colors.  The frozen monumental formations of the most intricate forms awaken the imagination of those who came to admire the stone landscapes. </p><h2>  Zone 51, Nevada (USA) </h2><p>  All ufologists of the world consider the military base in the Mojave desert a cult.  Zone 51 is the place where, according to famous science fiction writers, <span>alien ships</span> crash <span>.</span>  The CIA ten years ago officially recognized the existence of the base and revealed the secrets of the test site associated with its development, and not aliens. </p><p>  Over the territory mentioned in the series "The X-Files", the film "Independence Day" and other films, flights were banned, which triggered rumors that the Zone would conduct 51 experiments on the bodies of aliens captured by the US military.  Many scientists believe that much remains hidden from the public eye. </p><h2>  Black desert </h2><p>  About 7 thousand years ago, the huge Lake Laontan disappeared, its dried bottom is now called Black Rock.  The dark space of the desert is dotted with geysers, which are famous throughout the world for Nevada.  The photo of the black plateau captivates with unearthly landscapes, it seems that this is a scene from a science fiction film.  Various festivals are held on this territory with colorful installations that fit into the strange desert landscape. </p><h2>  Geyser fly </h2><p>  The most famous geyser with the funny name Mucha, which has become the hallmark of the desert, was formed with the help of human hands: once upon a time drilling the surface, hot water jets were released, which turned into a huge volcano over decades.  Against the gloomy background of the black plateau, the source looks more than unusual. </p><p>  The beautiful ‚Äúfountain‚Äù is admired not only by the state of Nevada, but also by the whole world.  A geyser located on private land is of a non-natural origin.  Its incredible color and strange shape are simply amazing: for many years, stone formations have grown around the jets that hit one and a half meters, and the unusual color of the water is explained by the minerals dissolved in it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="state of nevada" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1153283.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  True, the only problem is with the owners of this unusual geyser.  The owners of the land, very negatively related to the huge influx of tourists, fenced the geothermal spring from the views of others with a high fence. </p><p>  The state of Nevada, often called the desert of entertainment, delights tourists with unique attractions.  Here everyone will find something to their liking, from playing in a casino to excursions to previously classified military facilities.  Unique natural monuments, amazing landscapes, nightlife of sleeping cities - all this will surprise and give only positive emotions that will never be forgotten. </p>
