    <p>  An excursion to the karst region with underground caves, pine forests and limestone cliffs will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><p>  That is it, Slovenia.  Portoroz is just the most characteristic example of this area. </p><p>  Of particular interest is the Postojna Cave.  It consists of corridors 20 km long.  The excursion begins with the fact that the first two kilometers deep into the cave, tourists travel by train.  And only then does the walking route begin. </p><p>  It will also add adrenaline to the blood and a tour along the Shkotsyak cave, protected by UNESCO.  In it, the natural uncouthness has been preserved to this day.  Here, courageous travelers must pass along a narrow bridge over a dark abyss with a depth of almost 80 meters.  An <span>underground river is</span> seething at the very bottom <span>,</span> and whole flocks of bats hang overhead, as in a horror movie. </p><h2>  Hiking near the city </h2>
