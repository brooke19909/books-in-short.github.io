And the fact that it‚Äôs not in close proximity to the sea is okay, 15 minutes of walking per day are not out of place.  On the contrary, the local area is very pleasant to walk. </p><p>  They also pay attention to the modern furniture with which the apartments are furnished.  The beds are very comfortable, with linen creaking from cleanliness and soft pillows. </p><p>  It‚Äôs also very quiet.  Because the hotel is close to the mountains.  Cars and motorbikes do not drive here at night.  Occasionally, discos and parties are held nearby, but the soundproofing in the rooms is excellent, so this does not interfere. </p><p>  And, because it is quiet here, the hotel is perfect for people who dream of a relaxing holiday.  Few people come here with young children, because the hotel is a resort, not entertaining, and is more focused on a comfortable stay than on fun. </p><p>  More tourists like to give tips and advice.  In the summer, in the midst of heat, it is better to take rooms with a view of the inland.  There are also apartments from the balconies of which a landscape opens onto a river.  It looks beautiful, but it does not smell very good in hot seasons, according to reviews of guests.  However, I don‚Äôt like the number - you can change it.  The staff will do everything quickly and efficiently.  Unless, of course, there will be free apartments. </p><p>  And, if possible, it is worth going here in the winter.  It is possible in January or February.  Here at this time of year the average temperature is around 28 ¬∞ C.  At night it is slightly lower - approximately 25 ¬∞ C.  Water, by the way, is the same in temperature as air.  And even in winter there is little rain.  And tourists, which is doubly pleasant. </p>
