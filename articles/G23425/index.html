    <p>  A.V. Kolchak, Admiral of the Russian Empire, was born on November 4, 1874 in St. Petersburg.  The Kolchak family comes from an ancient noble family.  Father - Vasily Kolchak, major general of naval artillery, mother - Olga Ilyinichna Posokhova, Don Cossack.  The family of the future admiral of the Russian Empire was deeply religious.  In his childhood memoirs, Admiral Kolchak Alexander Vasilievich noted: ‚ÄúI am Orthodox, until the time I entered elementary school I received <span>family education</span> under the guidance of my parents.‚Äù  After studying for three years (1885-1888) in the St. Petersburg classical male gymnasium, the young Alexander Kolchak enters the Naval School.  It was there that A.V. Kolchak, Admiral of the Russian Navy, first learned the naval sciences, which in the future would become the work of his life.  Studying at the Maritime College revealed the outstanding abilities and talent of A.V. Kolchak for marine business. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Future Admiral Kolchak, whose brief biography indicates that his main passion was travel and sea adventures.  It was in 1890 that a sixteen-year-old teenager first came to the open sea.  This happened on board the armored frigate "Prince Pozharsky."  Training swimming lasted about three months.  During this time, the junior cadet Alexander Kolchak received the first skills and practical knowledge in maritime affairs.  Later, during his training in the Naval Cadet Corps, A. V. Kolchak repeatedly went on campaigns.  His training ships were the Rurik and the Cruiser.  Thanks to study tours, A.V. Kolchak began to substantively study oceanography and hydrology, as well as navigation maps of underwater currents off the coast of Korea. </p><h2>  Polar research </h2><p>  At the end of the Naval School, the young lieutenant Alexander Kolchak submits a report on naval service in the Pacific Ocean.  The petition was approved, and he was sent to one of the naval garrisons of the Pacific Fleet.  In 1900, Admiral Kolchak, whose biography is closely connected with scientific research of the Arctic Ocean, went on the first polar expedition.  On October 10, 1900, at the invitation of the famous traveler Baron Edward Toll, the scientific group set off.  The purpose of the expedition was to establish the geographical coordinates of the mysterious island of Sannikov Land.  In February 1901, Kolchak made a big report about the Great Northern Expedition. </p><p>  In 1902, on the wooden whaling schooner Zarya, Kolchak and Toll again set sail for the north.  In the summer of that year, four polar explorers, led by the expedition chief Eduard Toll, left the schooner and went on dog teams to explore the Arctic coast.  No one came back.  A long search for the missing expedition did not bring any results.  The entire crew of the Zarya schooner was forced to return to the mainland.  After some time, A.V. Kolchak filed a petition with the Russian Academy of Sciences for a re-expedition to the Northern Islands.  The main goal of the campaign was to find the members of the team of E. Toll.  As a result of the search, traces of the missing group were discovered.  However, the living members of the team were gone.  For participation in the rescue expedition, A. V. Kolchak was awarded the Imperial Order of the <span>"Holy Equal</span> -to-the- <span>Apostles Prince Vladimir"</span> of the 4th degree.  According to the results of the research of the polar research group, Alexander Vasilievich Kolchak was elected a full member of the Russian Geographical Society. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__sdv"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__sdv"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__sdv"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__sdv"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__sdv"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Military conflict with Japan (1904-1905) </h2><p>  With the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, A. V. Kolchak asked to be transferred from a scientific academy to the Naval War Department.  Having received approval, he goes to serve in Port Arthur with Admiral S.O. Makarov, <span>commander of the Pacific Fleet.</span>  A. V. Kolchak is appointed commander of the destroyer ‚ÄúAngry‚Äù.  For six months, the future admiral valiantly fought for Port Arthur.  However, despite the heroic confrontation, the fortress fell.  The soldiers of the Russian army surrendered.  In one of the battles, Kolchak is injured and ends up in a Japanese hospital.  Thanks to American military mediators, Alexander Kolchak and other officers of the Russian army were returned to their homeland.  For his heroism and courage, Alexander Vasilievich Kolchak was awarded a nominal gold saber and a silver medal ‚ÄúIn Memory of the Russian-Japanese War‚Äù. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kolchak Admiral Supreme Ruler of Russia" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31754/717481.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Continuation of scientific activity </h2><p>  After a six-month vacation, Kolchak again begins research work.  The main theme of his scientific works was the processing of materials from polar expeditions.  Scientific works on oceanology and on the history of polar research helped the young scientist to gain honor and respect in the scientific community.  In 1907, his translation of Martin Knudsen's work ‚ÄúTables of the Freezing Points of Sea Water‚Äù was published.  In 1909, the author's monograph ‚ÄúIce of the Kara and Siberian Seas‚Äù was published.  The significance of the works of A.V. Kolchak was that he first laid the doctrine of sea ice.  The Russian Geographical Society praised the scientist's scientific work, giving him the highest award "Gold of the Constantine Medal."  A.V. Kolchak became the youngest of the polar researchers who were awarded this high award.  All predecessors were foreigners, and only he became the first in Russia to receive a high distinction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Revival of the Russian fleet </h2><p>  The loss in the Russo-Japanese war was very difficult for the Russian officers to bear.  A.V. was no exception.  Kolchak, Admiral in Spirit and Researcher by Vocation.  Continuing to study the causes of the defeat of the Russian army, Kolchak is developing a plan for the creation of the Naval General Staff.  In his scientific report, he expresses his thoughts on the reasons for the military defeat in the war, on what kind of fleet Russia needs, and also points out the shortcomings in the defensive ability of sea vessels.  The speaker‚Äôs speech in the State Duma does not find proper approval, and A. V. Kolchak (admiral) leaves the service at the Naval General Staff.  Biography and photos of that time confirm his transition to teaching at the Maritime Academy.  Despite the lack of academic education, the leadership of the Academy invited him to give lectures on the joint actions of the army and navy.  In April 1908, A.V. Kolchak was awarded the military rank of captain of the 2nd rank.  Five years later, in 1913, he was promoted to captain of the 1st rank. </p><h2>  The participation of A. V.

The bravery and resourcefulness of the commander received wide appreciation in the navy, and this reached the capital.  April 10, 1916 A.V. Kolchak was promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral of the Russian Navy.  And in June 1916, by decree of Emperor Nicholas II, Kolchak was awarded the rank of vice admiral, and he was appointed to the post of commander of the Black Sea Fleet.

    <p>  The arrival of an energetic and competent commander was received with great respect.  From the first days of work, Kolchak established strict discipline and changed the command leadership of the fleet.  The main strategic objective is to clear the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãenemy warships.  To accomplish this task, it was proposed to block the ports of Bulgaria and the Bosphorus Strait.  An operation to mine enemy coastlines began.  Admiral Kolchak's ship was often seen during combat and tactical missions.  The fleet commander personally controlled the situation at sea.  A special operation to mine the Bosphorus Strait with a quick strike on Constantinople was approved by Nicholas II.  However, a daring military operation did not happen, the February Revolution violated all plans. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Admiral Kolchak's rise to power" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31754/717475.jpg" width="438"></div></h2><h2>  1917 revolutionary rebellion </h2><p>  The events of the February 1917 coup caught Kolchak in Batumi.  It was in this Georgian city that the admiral met with Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolayevich, commander of the Caucasian Front.  The agenda was a discussion of the shipping schedule and the construction of a seaport in Trebizond (Turkey).  Having received a secret dispatch from the General Staff about a military coup in Petrograd, the admiral urgently returns to Sevastopol.  Upon returning to the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet, Admiral A.V. Kolchak orders the termination of the telegraph and postal communications of Crimea with other regions of the Russian Empire.  This prevents the spread of rumors and panic in the Navy.  All telegrams came only to the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet. </p><p>  Unlike the situation in the Baltic Fleet, the situation in the Black Sea was under the control of the admiral.  A. V. Kolchak for a long time kept the Black Sea flotilla from revolutionary collapse.  However, political events did not pass by.  In June 1917, by decision of the Sevastopol Council, Admiral Kolchak was removed from the leadership of the Black Sea Fleet.  During disarmament, Kolchak breaks a golden saber in front of his subordinates and says: ‚ÄúThe sea has awarded me, and I am returning the award to the sea.‚Äù </p><h2>  <span>Family life of the</span> Russian admiral </h2>

The rise to power of Admiral Kolchak inspired the entire eastern region of the country, hoping to establish a rigid dictatorship and order.  A strong managerial vertical and the correct organization of the state were established.  The main goal of the new military formation was to join the army of A.I. Denikin and march on Moscow.  During the reign of Kolchak, a number of orders, decrees and appointments were issued.  A.V. Kolchak was one of the first in Russia to begin an investigation into the death of the royal family.  The reward system of tsarist Russia was restored.  Kolchak‚Äôs army had at its disposal a huge gold reserve of the country, which was exported from Moscow to Kazan with a view to further moving to England and Canada.  With this money, Admiral Kolchak (whose photo can be seen above) provided his army with weapons and uniforms.

However, the numerical superiority of the Red Army did not allow a grandiose seizure of the western borders of Russia.  An important factor was the betrayal of the allies.

    <p>  January 15, 1920 Kolchak is arrested and sent to Irkutsk prison.  A few days later, the Extraordinary Commission began the process of investigative measures to interrogate the admiral.  A.V. Kolchak, admiral (the interrogation protocols testify to this), during the investigative measures he was very worthy.  Cheka investigators noted that the admiral answered all questions willingly and clearly, without giving a single name of his colleagues.  Kolchak‚Äôs arrest lasted until February 6, when the remnants of his army came close to Irkutsk.  <span>On February 7,</span> 1920, on the bank of the Ushakovka River, the admiral was shot and thrown into an ice hole.  Thus ended the great son of his Fatherland. </p><p>  On the events of hostilities in eastern Russia from autumn 1918 to the end of 1919, the book ‚ÄúThe Eastern Front of Admiral Kolchak‚Äù was written by S.V. Volkov. </p><h2>  Truth and fiction </h2><p>  To date, the fate of this man has not been fully studied.  A.V. Kolchak is an admiral, whose unknown facts from the life and death of which are still of interest to historians and people who are not indifferent to this person.  One thing is certain: the life of the admiral is a vivid example of courage, heroism and high responsibility towards his homeland. </p>
