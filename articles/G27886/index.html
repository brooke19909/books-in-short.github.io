Church on the pillar of Katskhi in Georgia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Georgia is a very beautiful state located in the western part of Transcaucasia.  There are many natural and architectural attractions that deserve a visit.  And how unique is the Georgian flavor!  One of the important places in the republic is the pillar of Katshi.  In Georgia, this place for tourists is considered relatively new, but has already managed to earn popularity.  They say that soon it will become a tourist center of Imereti. </p><h2>  Where is the attraction located? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple on the pillar of Katskhi in Georgia" class="if uuid-2265667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2265667.jpg"></div><p>  The pillar is located in Imereti - a region and a historical region in the western part of the state, near the city of Chiatura.  The village in which the attraction is located is called Katshi.  Actually, from it comes the name of the pillar.  The rock rises above the surrounding area, so it can be seen from afar.  But the impression that the pillar is close, deceptive: after the attraction falls into view, you need to go to it along the mountain road for about an hour. </p><h2>  What is the pillar of Katshi in Georgia </h2><p>  This hill is a 40-meter stone rock, consisting of a calcareous monolith, common in Imereti.  At its top is a temple, which is also clearly visible from afar.  The rock is narrow, with a metal staircase leading down from its top.  The Katskhi Pillar is a unique natural attraction.  Locals believe that the hill was created by God, and symbolizes the unity of heaven and earth, namely, the Lord and the people.  When a person climbs up the stairs, he draws near to God. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of the Imereti Pillar </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The relics of a monk who once lived near the rock of Katshi" class="if uuid-2265678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2265678.jpg"></div><p>  The first mention of the pillar dates back to the 18th century.  Then the Georgian geographer and historian Vahushti Bagrationi wrote about him.  But a relatively new attraction appeared much earlier.  Historians suggest that the church located above was built by pagans in the 6th-7th centuries as a thanks to the fertility god for his generous gifts. </p><p>  When Christianity came to the republic, the people began to perceive the pillar of Katskhi in Georgia as a religious building.  This place seems to have been specially created to lead an ascetic lifestyle.  Locals believed that when a person is above, he becomes as close as possible to God.  But during the reign of Ottoman Turkey, the temple lost its meaning.  First, they stopped holding religious ceremonies, and then completely abandoned it. </p><p>  The temple returned its fame only in the year 44 of the last century, when the famous climber Alexander Dzhaparidze and Levan Gotua decided to climb the summit.  They determined that the temple was previously located on a rock.  After the establishment of this fact, local residents began to make pilgrimages to the pillar. </p><h2>  Church on the pillar of Katskhi in Georgia (Imereti) today </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Father Maxim, living on the Katshi rock" class="if uuid-2265666" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2265666.jpg"></div><p>  The temple, built on a rock between the VI-XVII centuries, is poorly preserved.  When A. Dzhaparidze and L. Gotua managed to climb the summit, they saw that there were only ruins, several elements of the fresco and a crypt with the burial of the last monk-pillar.  A little later, local residents initiated the collection of finances for the restoration of the monastery.  Fixed assets from the state budget were allocated in 1999.  The construction of the new temple was completed 10 years later. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Even before the restoration of the temple, in 1993, Maxim the Confessor moved to the village.  For two years he lived in a grotto under a stone column, hiding almost under a tarp alone.  Actually, this prompted the people to raise funds to restore the pillar of Katskhi in Georgia. </p><p>  First, material assistance came from a friend of Maximus the Confessor.  Then he turned to the local diocese with a request to allow him to rebuild the temple.  After receiving approval, they opened a fund and began to raise funds.  The restoration was carried out on their own - this was done by local residents and monks.  A device for lifting building materials upward was also constructed independently.  The new temple was named after the hermit Maxim.  A little later, one of the locals paved the access road, then installed a staircase and led lighting. </p><h2>  The abode of one monk </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The monk who restored the temple on the pillar of Katshi" class="if uuid-2265668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2265668.jpg"></div><p>  Father Maxim is 55 years old; he was born and raised in these places.  He has been living in his monastery since 1993, and he dreamed about this since childhood. </p><blockquote><p>  ‚ÄúWhen my friends and I came here to unwind, I always looked at the pillar and envied the monk who once lived here.‚Äù  (Father Maxim). </p></blockquote><p>  The church on the pillar of Katskhi in Georgia, the photo of which clearly demonstrates the interior and exterior, is made in a rather minimalistic style: a small church hall with icons, books and other religious objects.  Father Maxim loves this place, but the Georgian patriarch in Tbilisi forbade him to settle right in the temple.  However, the monk does not lose hope that one day this will be realized. </p><p>  Father Maxim was allowed to come there, but not live there.  This was motivated by the fact that he was too young.  Now the monk, laughing, suggests he will be told that he is too old. </p><p>  Father Maxim became a monk after serving his sentence in a prison colony.  When he was freed, he decided that he needed to change, to be cleansed of his sins.  Then Maxim the Confessor decided to continue the work of the pillars who lived in the monastery in the XV century. </p><blockquote><p>  ‚ÄúIn his youth he drank a lot and sold drugs.  When it brought me to jail, I realized that it was time to change. ‚Äù  (Father Maxim). </p></blockquote><p>  The monk spends almost all his time in the fortress on the pillar of Katskhi (Georgia).  Only twice a week does he go downstairs to speak with the locals.  Father Maxim comes to people who find themselves in a difficult life situation to get comfort and advice or just to talk heart to heart.  The 55-year-old man takes about 20 minutes to descend the metal stairs, and even more to climb.  Therefore, there are weeks when he descends only once. </p><p>  Maxim the Confessor says that when he thought about rebuilding the temple, he used the Greek Meteor as a prototype.  Until 2012, only men could go upstairs with the personal blessing of a monk, which is another similarity with Meteora. </p><h2>  What else is on top of the Katskhi pillar </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rock Temple in Georgia" class="if uuid-2265669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2265669.jpg"></div><p>  Over the past few years, the territory of the temple has become larger.  In addition to the church and the hermit's cloister, two more monks, one novice and deacon, live on the territory.  But they are located downstairs in recently built houses.  A small museum is also organized here, which stores archaeological artifacts found during excavations of the ruins of the old temple, and photographs of the church. </p><h2>  Possibility of visiting the Katskhi pillar </h2><p>  For some time now, climbing uphill has been forbidden not only to women, but also to men.  If you want to go to the temple, you will have to ask for approval from the Georgian patriarch in Tbilisi, who gave instructions to ban absolutely everyone from going upstairs. </p><h2>  How to get to the pillar of Katshi </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dailymail.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pillar of Katzha" class="if uuid-2265670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61052/2265670.jpg"></div><p>  GPS coordinates for those traveling on the navigator: N42 ¬∞ 17.248;  E43 ¬∞ 12.953. </p><p>  How to get to the pillar of Katskhi in Georgia?  The village where the religious attraction is located is located 28 km from the town of Zestafoni, which you need to go along the S22 highway towards Chiatura.  If you plan a route in Georgia, it will be convenient to include this point between visiting Tbilisi and Kutaisi.  Also, the village can be reached from Tbilisi by public transport, and then ask the locals for directions.  In order to understand the location of the attraction, it is recommended to see the map. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="42.2875959" data-lng="43.21569260000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/0/1/801.png"></div><p>  In this place, being alone with the unique nature and cult architecture, you can feel spirituality, feel calm and to some extent cosiness.  Do not be afraid of the collapse of the rock - as experts say, it does not threaten her.  Moreover, those people who managed to visit the pillar of Katskhi in Georgia and at its peak say that you feel there not fear of heights, but complete safety. </p>
