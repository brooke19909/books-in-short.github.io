The first mention of it dates back to the fourteenth century.  <span>The Nikon Chronicle</span> says that in the summer of 1317, <span>Yuri Dolgoruky was</span> traveling in this city.  At that time, Klin did not belong to Moscow, but to the Tver Principality.  Only in 1409 he was annexed to the principality of Moscow. </p><h2>  Church of the Virgin </h2><p>  Klin (Moscow region) is a relatively small city.  All sights are concentrated in its central part.  Guests of the city will undoubtedly be interested in visiting one of the oldest buildings - the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  According to historians, it was built in the middle of the sixteenth century.  Prior to this, on the outskirts of Klin since 1380 there was a wooden church of the Assumption Monastery for women. </p>

The stone church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary on the banks <span>of the Sestra River</span> is a brick building.  In Soviet times, the church was waiting for the fate of most churches of that time, it was destroyed.  They restored it again in the early sixties.  Then she returned to its original appearance.  In the nineties, the church was again handed over to believers.

In different years, she was the property of different families.  The most famous, of course, are the Roman-Korsakovs.  Although in different years other famous people are associated with the estate, known both in Russia and abroad.  This, for example, such as M.E.  Saltykova-Shchedrin, and A.M.  Vasnetsov, K.A.  Timiryazev and the Gnesins family, M.N.  Zagoskin and A. Bely.  Nowadays, the estate has become a museum of Tchaikovsky. </p><p>  The estate Podzhigorodovo (Podoshegorodovo) will also be interesting to tourists.  It was built in 1770.  The manor itself is interesting, as well as the church of the Archangel Michael, which is located on the territory.  This church was also built in the seventies of the eighteenth century under the first owners - the Yuriev brothers. </p><h2>  Other estates </h2><p>  The monument of wooden architecture is the estate High.  It belonged to the Volkov family.  The estate is located in a very picturesque place. </p><p>  What other interesting sights?  The wedge is rich in various estates, museums.  Remembering them, one cannot but tell about the Zolins estate.  It was built at the turn of the eighteenth - nineteenth centuries.  The estate was located in a very picturesque place.  But, unfortunately, the building itself has not survived to our times.  There are only images that speak of the excellent work of the architect.  The first owner of the estate was General S.A.  Vsevolozhsky.  Currently, restoration and restoration work begins on the estate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Market </h2><p>  In the city center there is a shopping mall building.  They are built of red brick.  Before that, there were wooden trading shops.  It was a very lively trading place.  This is due to the fact that the city was located on the trade routes of that time. </p><h2>  Monuments </h2><p>  Well, and, of course, monuments erected in honor of the events of the Great Patriotic War are of great importance for the clinicians.  Since the city in 2016 received the honorary title "The village of military valor."  For two months in the forty-first year, he was occupied by fascist troops. </p>
