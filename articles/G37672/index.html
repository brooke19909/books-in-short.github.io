    <h2>  Yakubovsky Ivan Ignatievich: biography.  Youth </h2><p>  Yakubovsky Ivan was born in the territory of modern Belarus in 1912.  His parents were ordinary peasants.  At the time of the birth of Ivan, the family already had five children.  Therefore, since childhood, he worked hard, helping parents in daily affairs.  Immediately, in the Mogilev province, he graduated from school.  After graduation, he continues to work on the collective farm.  He takes an active citizenship.  At eighteen, he becomes secretary in the village council.  At the same time, he gets a job at a brick factory.  Two years later, among the graduates of the Orsha College was Yakubovsky Ivan Ignatievich.  The family had high hopes for him, since from childhood the guy showed extraordinary abilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Conscription </h2><p>  Immediately after graduating from college, he was drafted into the Red Army for military service.  For training, he is sent to the Minsk military school, in which he studies until 1934.  Then begins a military career.  In Vitebsk, he receives a training platoon subordinate.  In this position, he proved himself well, so the command offers him to continue his studies.  A year later, he was sent to Leningrad for further training.  There he listens to a course for the commanding staff of armored forces.  After that, Yakubovsky was assigned to command a tank platoon. </p><p>  In 1939, the situation in Europe grew tense.  The war is about to break out.  The Soviet Union is trying to push its borders as far as possible.  In mid-September begins the Polish campaign of the Red Army.  Soviet troops occupied the territory of modern Western Ukraine and Belarus.  During this campaign, Polish troops did not show resistance, and the local population massively supported the Red Army.  Nevertheless, maneuvering a few kilometers from the Wehrmacht troops, the military carried out a difficult mission.  Yakubovsky Ivan Ignatievich and the unit entrusted to him perfectly fulfilled their task and in a short time occupied all the indicated settlements. </p>

    <h2>  Finnish war </h2><p>  That same winter, a new war began, preceding World War II.  To ensure the security of the northern border and eliminate the Finnish threat, the Soviet army decides to launch an offensive on Finland.  This operation will later be called the "winter war".

Constant supply disruptions, terrible cold, the actions of Finnish saboteurs led to serious losses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The beginning of World War II </h2><p>  At the time of the Nazi Germany attack on the USSR, Ivan Ignatievich Yakubovsky was on the Western Front.

However, after 3 days the city fell.  The Red Army caught panic.  Yakubovsky‚Äôs division moved to Mogilev.  A few days later, the Nazis besieged the city.  Heroic resistance did not bring serious successes in the defense of Mogilev, but managed to thwart German plans for a quick capture of the entire BSSR. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yakubovsky Ivan Ignatievich feat" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1276249.jpg"></div>  For his courage, Yakubovsky was presented to the Order of the Red Star.
