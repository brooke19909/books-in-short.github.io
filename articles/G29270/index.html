This question has been of interest to many drivers for a long time.  Indeed, the appropriate payments sometimes make you wonder, is it profitable to own a vehicle?  In some cases, taxes are really high.  And the use of personal vehicles does not pay off for utility.  Therefore, it is important to know how you can not pay this tax.  More precisely, who is freed from him.  Fortunately, such categories of citizens are available.  They are not very many, but they are. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who is exempted from paying transport tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1192537.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What a fee </h2><p>  But first, let's talk about what you have to pay for.  What is a transport tax?  Maybe this is really something important?  In fact, this is so.  Transport tax is a regional citizen fee for registering his car.  More precisely, for giving rights to travel behind the wheel of a particular vehicle. </p><p>  As already mentioned, this is a <span>regional tax.</span>  It varies depending on your region of residence.  So it‚Äôs almost impossible to say exactly how much you need to pay.  Unless in each district to find out information.  Who is exempt from paying transport tax?  And are there such citizens in principle?  Indeed, in Russian law there are always privileges.  And with regard to transport, there should also be some exceptions to the rules. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  By region </h2><p>  It has already been said that the tax in question is regional.  And it is calculated according to the rules of a particular area.  The same applies to those who are exempted from paying transport tax.  It is impossible to answer exactly this question.  After all, the rules for providing benefits, as well as full exemption are regulated in each city separately. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="exempt from vehicle tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1192536.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Therefore, do not be surprised if you are interested in who is exempted from paying <span>transport tax</span> in St. Petersburg and Moscow, receiving different answers.  Nevertheless, panic is not worth it.  Why?  General rules are also in the legislation.  We will study them.  What categories of citizens are among the beneficiaries in general terms in Russia in relation to vehicle tax? </p><h2>  Heroes </h2><p>  The first on this list are citizens who generally rely on certain benefits in the country.  The Heroes of the Soviet Union, as well as the Russian Federation and Socialist Labor are exempted from paying the transport tax in the first place. </p><p>  This also includes citizens belonging to the number of gentlemen of the Order of Glory.  These people do not need to pay transport tax.  They are fully exempt from payments to the state.  Unfortunately, such beneficiaries are becoming less and less every year.  But nobody wants to miss the opportunity to exempt from taxes.  And it is actively used in practice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Who is exempt from paying transport tax in St. Petersburg" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1192535.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Veterans </h2><p>  What's next?  Now it is worth paying attention to another category of beneficiaries.  Who is exempt from paying transport tax in the Moscow region and not only?  According to modern laws, veterans have this opportunity.  There are not many of them left, but where they live, they have their own privileges. </p><p>  Consider here is another factor, this is the engine power of the car.  Transport taxes should not be paid by veterans operating low-power vehicles.  Depending on the region, restrictions are set at 70, 100 and 150 horsepower.  Otherwise, you will need to pay the appropriate amount of money to the state treasury.  In practice, veterans, if they drive vehicles, they really turn out to be low-power. </p><h2>  Social Support </h2><p>  Now another common case.  True, it is very rare in practice.  Who is exempted from paying transport tax (2014-2016)?  To the categories already listed, you can add people who received the vehicle with social protection. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who is exempted from paying transport tax in the Moscow region" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1192534.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Such cases in life are extremely rare.  And <span>social support</span> does not always help get rid of transport tax.  Nevertheless, if you belong to this category of citizens, you can take advantage of the proposed benefit.  It is better to find out the exact information about this in your area.  But in most cases, this kind of person is really completely exempt from paying transport tax. </p><h2>  Disabled people </h2><p>  Do not forget about people with disabilities and the people serving such citizens.  The thing is (if you are interested in who is exempted from paying the transport tax), that people with disabilities and those who transport people with disabilities have a privilege. </p><p>  This situation is often encountered in practice.  But remember, a disabled person has the right to use transport tax benefits only if he drives a motorcycle or car no more than 100 horsepower.  Otherwise, you will have to contact the tax service, but the amount of payment will decrease.  How much specifically?  This is decided within each region purely individually.  It is impossible to predict such a moment.  From year to year, these numbers are changing. </p><h2>  State </h2><p>  Who else can please <span>transport tax exemptions?</span>  For example, civil servants.  But this rule applies only to company cars.  Mainly concerns state enterprises that are engaged in the restoration of roads of municipal or regional significance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who is exempted from paying transport tax 2014" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1192533.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is another question that worries many citizens.  And it concerns the majority of the population.  It is about who is <span>exempted from the transport tax</span> in Moscow and other regions.  To be more precise, is there a similar opportunity among older people, among pensioners?  Indeed, in Russia they already have many benefits. </p><h2>  About retirees </h2><p>  Transport in this matter is no exception.  More precisely, taxes on it.  Tax authorities made concessions to pensioners and introduced certain benefits for them.  But they did not completely exempt from payment.  Pitfalls in this matter are more than enough. </p><p>  For example, only retirees who own several vehicles are entitled to rely on a kind of discount.  It doesn‚Äôt matter which ones.  Under such circumstances, only 10% of the tax amount for each transport will be charged from an elderly person.  In practice, this is not so much, if you think about it. </p><p>  In addition, a pension on transport tax can be used by a pensioner if he owns vehicles with an engine power of more than 100 horsepower.  Moreover, preferential forces are simply deducted from ordinary accruals.  This system is not clear to everyone.  But it gives a really good discount when paying transport tax for pensioners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who is exempt from paying transport tax in Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1192532.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What if an elderly person is entitled to several benefits?  You need to clearly understand that only one option is allowed - the one that the owner considers the most profitable.  Multiple tax exemptions are not allowed.  Even in old age. </p><p>  Many are interested in how not to pay the transport tax legally.  There is only one way out - to issue a vehicle for a beneficiary.  Usually this is done in the family circle, so that there is no risk either for the real owner or for a citizen who has benefits. </p><p>  We hope that after reading the article you will understand who is exempted from paying the transport tax in Moscow and other regions. </p>
