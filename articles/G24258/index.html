Incredible views at sunset and dawn on the rocky stepped shores with lovely doll-like houses, incomparable local cuisine and wine, places for filming Hollywood films, historical sights, SPA procedures, shopping and much more - all this, Greece.  Russian tourists are always welcomed here with sincere hospitality, and on the islands it manifests itself more than in the capital.  People live there simply, sincerely empathize, sincerely rejoice.  We will also go to one of the Greek islands, which in Italian sounds Corfu, and in Greek Kerkyra. </p><h2>  General information about the area </h2><p>  The country's mainland is densely framed by islands around the perimeter.  Each of them is noticeable in its own way, has its own internal traditions and features.  Corfu Island is one of the most popular among tourists, it is called emerald because of the abundance of olive groves, vineyards, orange orchards and all this against the backdrop of magical shades of the sea.  Cozy bays, the medieval Angel Castle, the Canal of Love, narrow cozy streets and the capital, similar to Venice, are just a few places that fascinate the island. </p><p>  Is the village of Liapades located on its west coast?  near which the Blue Princess <span>Beach Resort is located (the resort</span> means that there is a pool on its territory).  Here natural beauties are pleasing to the eye and the still preserved Venetian architecture is amazing.  In the village there are supermarkets with a good assortment of products and souvenirs and local cafes where you can have a tasty meal and appreciate the local cuisine.  This region of Greece is ideal for families with children, but youth who crave fun will find it easy to find outside the village. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Rooms - General Impressions </h2><p>  The rooms of the Miro Blue Princess Beach Resort 4 * hotel, as noted above, are scattered on the side of the mountain, the reception is right by the water.  According to the almost unanimous opinion of the guests, the rooms here are quite spacious, and the views from the windows the size of the wall or terraces are impressive, regardless of the sea or the surrounding area - in this place all the landscapes are beautiful with their pristine nature.  The rooms are clean, the cleaning is quality daily, the Greeks successfully combine it with a siesta, the repair is fresh, the furniture is new.  Each person settles in different ways: someone is accommodated in excellent apartments for 10-15 minutes without a single problem, while someone is forced to wait half a day and then resettled for the duration of the vacation.  Plumbing in the rooms is in good condition, but you need to wait for hot water after opening the tap for about a minute.  The category of rooms in the buildings is only one - "Standard".  They have ceiling beams in their design, adding a touch of retro exoticism.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthese rooms is from 25 m2.  There is nothing superfluous in their design - bare walls painted in blue and white tones, furniture, electrical appliances, including lamps, a mirror on the wall - that's all that awaits guests here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  "Bungalows" have an area of ‚Äã‚Äã23 m2.  Their simple design is enlivened by paintings and applications on the walls.  Their equipment is the same as in the Standard rooms. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  At the <span>Blue Princess Beach Hotel Suites 4 *</span> (Greece, Corfu) offer guests an all-inclusive power system.  Apparently, the quality of food in the hotel's dining room depends on the period, because there are directly opposite reviews from tourists.  One was tasty, varied, always fresh and with all the peculiarities of local cuisine, the other had little assortment and did not like the quality of the products.  Common food features are: </p><p>  For breakfast: </p><ul><li>  egg dishes, cheeses, sausages, granola, crepes, salads, instant cereals, fried potatoes; </li></ul><p>  For lunch and dinner: </p><ul><li>  there are always several types of meat: fried, baked, boiled; </li><li>  from side dishes - variations of potato dishes, pasta, rice; </li><li>  either fish or chicken in one meal; </li><li>  an abundance of fruits: watermelons, melons, peaches; </li><li>  ice cream; </li><li>  a variety of delicious pastries; </li><li>  drinks: juices, coffee, tea, sweet water, beer and wine.  According to tourists, alcohol is much better quality than in Turkey or Egypt. </li></ul><p>  According to vacationers, food at the hotel is no frills, with all this missing.  Analyzing this point of service, one should take into account the subjective factor - for each person the norm of assortment and taste is based on the usual food at home and experience in other hotels. </p><p>  People traveling to this hotel should be prepared that All-Inclusive in Greece and, for example, in Turkey have a big difference.  In Greece, this means three meals a day, but snacks during the day are not accepted here.  Most of the guests liked the hotel kitchen.  In the reviews, tourists claim that the food is delicious, prepared exclusively from fresh products. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  All beaches of Greece are public and do not belong to any of the hotels.  And all paid sunbeds.  Tourists come in two ways: they simply rent sunbeds daily or connect to the hotel guide question and he agrees to rent with a good discount, provided that sunbeds are paid on the first day for the entire vacation period.  The guests of the Blue Princess Beach Resort 4 * to Corfu in the reviews do not recommend swimming in the sea on the left side of the pier, because there a sewer goes into the water.  The beach is sand and pebble, so special rubber shoes will not hurt.  If you don‚Äôt have one with you, you can buy it next to the hotel at a very reasonable price.  The water on the beach is clean, clear, but cool, the sand is soft.  It should be noted that Corfu is the northernmost of the islands called the Ionian.  The water in the sea here warms up only by July, and in June swimming in the sea is still uncomfortable.  On the beach you can rent a boat and go on your own to inspect the bay, then you should stop in different places and enjoy the wild beaches. </p>

    <h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Blue Princess Beach Resort 4 * in Corfu receives positive reviews for the fact that attentive and courteous staff work here.  Especially pleasing guests are employees of restaurants and bars.
