    <h2>  Description of the Blue Dream Hotel hotel chain in Turkey </h2><p>  Some people think that all Turkish hotels are the same.  But this opinion is erroneous, since local hotels differ not only in stardom, but also in the quality of the services provided.  In addition, it all depends on the location of such institutions.  The larger the resort, the more services the hotel provides.  The same goes for the Blue Dream network.  The number of hotel chains is small, but there are still differences in service. </p><p>  In Turkey there are two such hotels - in Alanya and Bodrum.  Surely, anyone has heard of the Blue Dream Hotel 3 * (Greece) - this hotel is focused on a different circle of tourists than Turkish hotels.  The Greek hotel complex is more likely to meet Europeans, and the requirements for this hotel are completely different. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Blue Dream Hotel Beach (Bodrum) </h2><p>  As for the hotel‚Äôs own beach, it is located next to the cottages.  Lovers of pebbles and a platform beach can enjoy the sea air and the sun's rays near the hotel.  Such proximity to the coastline is an indisputable advantage when choosing a vacation destination.  In addition, the use of sun loungers, umbrellas and mattresses is absolutely free, both by the pool and by the sea. </p><h2>  Blue Dream hotel 3 * (Alanya): description </h2><p>  In the center of the famous resort of Alanya, a cozy attractive Blue Dream Hotel 3 * hotel is located.  Konakli (in Russian "Konakli") is located a few kilometers from the city center.  Some travelers put an equal sign between this small coastal town and Alanya.  This is partly true, because Konakli can be called the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe famous resort, but the Blue Dream Hotel belongs to the territory of Alanya. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Compared to the hotel complex of the same chain, a mini-hotel in Alanya is in great demand among tourists.  For most travelers from Russia, it is the size of the hotel that is very important.  Many of our compatriots value calm and silence, because this is what Blue Dream Hotel 3 * (Alanya) boasts of. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure / Entertainment </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel is designed for a small number of guests, it has everything you need for a fun holiday - a swimming pool, gym, disco.  Tourists can visit the sauna or Turkish bath, book a massage or play billiards, chess or darts.  A minimum set of entertainment is enough for a comfortable pastime.  You can play volleyball at the beach or enjoy water sports. </p><h2>  Children's holiday </h2><p>  In Blue Dream Hotel 3 * (Turkey) provides for families with children.  Like the Bodrum Hotel, there is a children's menu, a <span>sports field</span> and a pool for young tourists.  In addition, parents can always use the <span>services of a nanny,</span> who works around the clock.  The small territory of the hotel allows you to monitor the location of the child, wherever he is. </p><h2>  Reviews and recommendations </h2><p>  Reviews Blue Dream Hotel (Alanya) are somewhat different from the impressions of the guests of the "Bodrum" hotel.  A hotel in Alanya is most often chosen by those who want to live in the city center, but without overpaying.  Also, this hotel will suit students who do not have the means to stay in a youth hotel, or couples who are looking for peace for their children.  However, not everyone is ready to live in a local "treshka".  Some complain that the hairdryer did not work during the stay, the <span>toilet paper holder</span> was broken <span>,</span> or the light was off.  Someone was not satisfied with the food in the hotel, in their opinion, the dishes were from the same products, that is, they did not differ in variety.  But these minuses did not upset others at all, they rejoiced at the sea, the sun, a wonderful climate and affordable prices. </p><p>  There are always a lot of Russian tourists at this hotel, so there is always at least one Russian-speaking employee at the reception.  "Allclusive" is usually appreciated by tourists.  Most often, under the "free distribution" of alcohol to tourists, a limited number of drinks of local production fall. </p><p>  There are negative reviews, but not everything is so bad.  From the advantages of the hotel identified: </p><ul><li>  a small pool, which was always in excellent condition, and therefore swimming in crystal clear water provided tourists with maximum pleasure; </li><li>  nice furnished balconies where you could have a good time admiring the evening landscapes of the city; </li><li>  excellent location of the hotel - there are many attractions nearby: the local bazaar, fortress, supermarkets and shops where you can buy souvenirs and other Turkish products; </li><li>  proximity to the beach - tourists did not have to get to the sea for a long time. </li></ul><p>  Many note spacious and clean rooms, for some even old furniture did not become an obstacle to a comfortable stay.  The hotel staff is mostly welcoming and friendly, but, on the advice of guests, it is better to remind employees about cleaning the rooms.  All rooms have a safe, so all valuables could be stored there. </p><p>  After analyzing the impressions of the guests, we can conclude that the rest in the hotel was not always rosy for its guests.  Criticism of the hotel‚Äôs work is a necessary thing, especially since in almost all cases the comments and complaints are taken into account by the administration.  No need to be silent if something is not working or broken in the room.  Hotel staff will always meet you if you ask for another number, especially since you have every right to do so.  Sometimes you can even chat with the owner of the hotel, who visits there from time to time to check. </p><p>  As for the hotel in Bodrum (Club Blue Dream Hotel 3 *), reviews of which are somewhat better than in Alanya, the hotel received a solid four from the guests in terms of quality of service.  Russian tourists were not afraid of the lack of Russian-speaking staff at the hotel.  For some, this is a positive side - if employees do not speak Russian, it means that there are usually few Russian-speaking tourists resting there.  And, as you know, many travelers from Russia like to relax where there are no countrymen. </p><p>  Without exception, all the guests are delighted with the picturesque location of the hotel: the blue-turquoise sea and green coniferous plantings - all this pleases the eye.  The pebble beach is not to everyone's liking, but it saves a large number of free sun loungers and mattresses.  In any case, not only lovers of sandy beaches come here to relax - clear and clean water, healthy and fresh air - this is appreciated by the guests of Blue Dream Hotel 3 *.  Hotel reviews are often positive than negative.  Some were conquered by a transparent elevator that brings hotel guests to the sea.  Someone was satisfied with the local cuisine and service.  Funny animators work to their conscience - they entertain tourists to the fullest, all the guests were satisfied with the work of the staff.  Many noted interesting evening programs, shows and entertainment.  On the territory you could always have fun participating in various contests and competitions.  Some loved belly dancing classes.  The atmosphere that permeates the hotel grounds is fascinating, you want to return there again - these are the impressions of the hotel that remain with the guests. </p><p>  Two such different Blue Dream hotels have many things in common - a ban on pets, equipped playgrounds, single paid / free services, an all-inclusive system, etc. After analyzing reviews of these hotels, we can conclude that not always three stars - this is bad.  Despite the fact that the hotels are part of a single network, the opinion about the rest of tourists can be different. </p>

    <h2>  Comparison of the cost of tours </h2><p>  As you know, the cost of tours even in the same hotel chain is not the same.  You can book a double room for an amount equal to one voucher.  It all depends on the period and season of the trip, the number of days and the type of room (standard, family or apartment).  The cost is also affected by the carrier company of your choice.  Some flights are more expensive than others, so most often tourists fly on charter airplanes.  Sometimes travel companies sell tours at a reduced cost even to the most luxurious hotels, offering travelers various bonuses and discounts.  Some people prefer to fly only on burning packages, saving their budget.  Therefore, a comparison of the prices of <span>hotels in Bodrum</span> and Alanya will be approximate. </p><p>  To relax in the three-star Blue Dream Hotel 3 * (see photo in the article) Bodrum 7 days / 8 nights, for two adults you will have to pay 60-65 thousand rubles.  Accommodation in a standard room for 11 nights will cost about 90-100 thousand rubles.  As for the hotel in Alanya, the cost of the tour is much lower.  For example, for 7 nights in a room with one bedroom you will pay only 16,000 rubles.  Together there you can relax in the range of 35-40 thousand rubles per week. </p><p>  If you have planned a trip to Turkey, then it is best to prepare for it in advance.  The reviews of vacationers will help to recreate the real picture of rest, and you do not have to rely only on pictures and stories of the travel agency manager.  By <span>comparing</span> two hotels of the Blue Dream chain, we can conclude that not always the same category of hotels implies the same cost and quality of service.  Be that as it may, there are fewer tourists from Russia to Turkey, and today Turkish resorts remain the most beloved for Russians. </p>
