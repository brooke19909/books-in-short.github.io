The profession associated with digital devices is currently particularly relevant and relevant.  We need specialists who own information technology. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The system of secondary vocational education for graduates created GEF.  "Infocommunication systems and networks" - a direction whose graduates can be employed by the vacancy "technician". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.celeberity.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fgos infocommunication systems and networks" class="if uuid-2778211" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2778211.jpg"></div><h2>  Employee Responsibilities </h2><p>  What requirements does the GEF make for ICT professionals?  ‚ÄúInfocommunication networks and communication systems‚Äù is a specialty, the owners of which must provide a certain territory with high-quality communications, broadcasting, and television.  The technician works with a variety of communication channels, which is necessary for the life of transmission systems. </p><p>  Modern technologies for supporting information and communication systems and networks allow technicians to ensure high-quality information transfer to the required distances. </p><p>  The main place in the technical support is given to optical technology, due to which an increase in the speed of information transfer and improvement of communication quality is carried out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dioramatrainingsite.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="features of informatization" class="if uuid-2778216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2778216.jpg"></div><h2>  Important aspects </h2><p>  Training in the profession "multichannel telecommunication systems" involves the use of applied training disciplines.  At the lecture classes, students learn software encryption technology to protect important information.  In addition, future specialists in this field should have an understanding of the installation and operation of digital and cable information transmission systems, be familiar with the basics of building information and communication systems and networks.  Students of higher educational institutions master the curriculum of management of the organization of managerial work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lockerdome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="features of information technology" class="if uuid-2778213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/2778213.jpg"></div><h2>  What graduates can do </h2><p>  Specialists must operate telecommunication multi-channel systems.  Mandatory is the work of information security networks.  Young specialists converge the services and technologies of electrical communication systems.  Technicians are in demand in commercial and state enterprises.  They carry out maintenance and installation of communication cables, carry out system diagnostics. </p><p>  Workers deal with the consequences of defects and equipment failures, determine options for restoring their functioning.
