    <p>  Located between two large cities, the village of Novomikhailovsky combines a subtropical and hot climate, similar to the conditions on the Mediterranean Sea.  Good weather here is almost all year round, starting from the end of April, and ending with the end of October.  Rains are very rare, and their duration does not exceed several minutes.  Novomikhailovsky has a huge number of places to accommodate vacationers, however, like the entire Tuapse district.  Another point worth mentioning: the village is located between two hills that cover it from the wind, so there are never storms.  As many as 240 days a year you can enjoy the warm sun here.  This is what caused an unprecedented influx of tourists who want to improve their health and enjoy the rustle of waves and the sea breeze.  There is another trump card in the village of Novomikhailovsky.  The beach here is one of the cleanest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Novomikhailovsky is a very well-developed resort with a high level of service for tourists.

    <p>  The biggest reason for pride of the indigenous people of Novomikhailovsky resort is the beach.  Sandy beaches here are not inferior in cleanliness and comfort even to the famous Turkish with golden sand.  The central beach of the village has a width of 35 meters and a length of 800 meters, respectively.  The beach area is located at the place where the river flows into the Black Sea.  In this place, the sea has a very flat bottom, which allows even small children to swim there (naturally, under the supervision of parents!) The beach has two types of coverings - pebbles and sand, which many vacationers like.  There is everything you need for a good rest: boats, water skiing, scooters, catamarans, motor boats and other water vehicles, where you can ride and get a lot of positive emotions.  On the promenade adjacent to the beach, there are a huge number of children's attractions, restaurants, cafes, nightclubs and other institutions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
