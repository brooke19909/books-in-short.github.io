This is not surprising, because an increasing number of residents of the country, going on a trip, are choosing a car as a way to get to a vacation spot.  There are several reasons for this: </p><ul><li>  savings on fares; </li><li>  convenience of local <span>movements during the</span> holidays; </li><li>  more comfortable travel conditions compared to a bus or train. </li></ul><p>  Well, the ability to buy cars on credit makes them affordable for most.  <span>The M4</span> highway - the main road connecting the capital and the south of Russia - is one of the leaders in terms of congestion in the summer.  But this does not stop vacationers, because there are no other alternative options to get to this region by car.  The beginning of the highway is Lipetskaya street in Moscow, and the final point is Novorossiysk. </p><h4>  M4 highway - a bit of history </h4><p>  Part of the highway was laid along an existing road built in the second half of the nineteenth century.  The section from Kashira to Voronezh was reconstructed in the early 60s.  When designing, it was assumed that the congestion of the route would be low, so only two lanes were provided.  The road was called route number 5.  It began in Moscow, passed through Voronezh and ended in Rostov-on-Don.  Construction began in 1959 and was completed after only eight years. </p>

Subsequently, it was extended to the Tula region, and part of the route was moved from Starokashirskoye highway.

At the same time, she added to the list of highways of federal significance.  The first toll road section in Russia was introduced in the Lipetsk region in 1998. </p><p>  The load on the highway clearly exceeded the figures calculated in the 1950s, and in the early 2000s, global reconstruction began on the highway.  To date, work is underway to improve the illumination of the highway, sections are being laid to bypass settlements, dividing fences between lanes are being built. </p><p>  The modern M4 highway is a road with a length of more than 1,500 kilometers.  Work on its modernization is, alas, not being carried out at the same pace as its construction went in the 60s.  Some areas have a sufficiently high-quality coating.  They are allowed to reach speeds of up to 110 km / h, so driving along them is quite comfortable.  But there are also problem areas described below. </p><h4>  M4 highway - difficult and dangerous places </h4>

The most problematic places from this point of view are the sites passing through the territory of the Rostov and Voronezh regions, as well as the Krasnodar Territory.

Somewhere it passes along the plain, in the south winds and has steep descents, ascents and turns.  The highway section in the Rostov region is considered the most difficult, as it is laid in the mountains, does not have a dividing strip.  All this is combined with poor coating quality. </p><p>  In winter, problems can arise due to bad weather - strong winds and snowfalls.  An especially vulnerable stretch is the road in the mountains of the Krasnodar Territory. </p>

This can play a trick on a tired driver.  Of course, the distance from Moscow to Anapa or Gelendzhik can be covered in 14-16 hours, but it is better not to risk chasing a high speed.

    <p>  If we talk about the state of Russian roads in general, then this highway is not the worst.  It is hoped that upon completion of the reconstruction, a trip along it will carry only <span>positive emotions.</span>  Here it is - the M4 highway.  Reviews about it often scare those who are going to go on a trip for the first time.  Those who, due to life circumstances, travel here regularly, are advised to spend the night if necessary at the hotel and continue the journey with renewed vigor.  An additional advantage will be the presence of two drivers in the car, replacing each other while driving.  In this case, the trip will not be tiring at all. </p>
