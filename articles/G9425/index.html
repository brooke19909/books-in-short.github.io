If everything suits you, you can take it. </p><h2>  Chinese watch features </h2><p>  Although the differences in quality between a smart watch with Aliexpress and branded gadgets are significant, still the first have their own chips: </p><ol><li>  Counter steps and calories burned. </li><li>  Tracking sleep quality and displaying phases. </li><li>  Height meter. </li><li>  Player for listening to music. </li><li>  Common functions: calendar, stopwatch, bell. </li></ol><p>  Like branded models, Chinese devices are connected to a smartphone.  Thus, sleep mode, daily activity, and diet are monitored.

In fact, the setup is simple, since the functions of all devices are similar. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Smart watches have a main menu, as on smartphones.  There are badges with signatures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="guide.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="watch menu" class="if uuid-3205909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3205909.jpg"></div><p>  For example, a pedometer, stopwatch, barometer, messages and others.  Before setting up a smart watch with "Aliexpress", you should familiarize yourself with this menu in order to navigate it well. </p><p>  To connect a smart device to your phone, you need to run Bluetooth on your smartphone, as well as in the clock settings.

You just need to remember that control is mainly through a smartphone. </p><h2>  How to set up a children's smart watch with "Aliexpress" </h2><p>  Parents of the child want to have a relationship with him when their child walks or is not with them.  However, if the child is still small, then the phone will not suit him.  A great option would be a children's smart watch.  They can perform all the functions that parents need: tracking location, calls, monitoring activity, and so on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": Richard Lai, "><img itemprop="image" alt="kids watch" class="if uuid-3205910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3205910.jpg"></div><p>  How to set up a children's smart watch with "Aliexpress"?  You should first consider the main functions of such a device: </p><ol><li>  Phone services.

Like conventional smart devices, there are icons with corresponding signatures. </li><li>  Menu "Contacts" will display only those numbers that are already on the SIM card.  Also, incoming calls will be shown only from the recorded numbers. </li><li>  In the location settings, you can set the period after which data will be sent to the server, and then to the parent's phone. </li></ol><p>  The remaining additional features are configured from a smartphone. </p><p>  Having correctly set a children's watch, mom or dad will be able to monitor their child from a distance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thekrazycouponlady.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="child with a watch" class="if uuid-3205918" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/135216/3205918.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Setting up a Chinese gadget will not cause difficulties if the user understands his smartphone. </p><p>  If you need a smart watch, but you don‚Äôt have enough money for a good device, then it‚Äôs definitely worth trying to order it on Aliexpress, after considering all the options and choosing the best one. </p>
