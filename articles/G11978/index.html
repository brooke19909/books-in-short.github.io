    <h2>  Who are the Sami </h2><p>  The Sami are a small people belonging to the Finno-Ugric group.  Sami representatives live in four countries - Russia, Finland, Sweden and Norway.  The total number of people is about 50,000 people, but in Russia there are quite a few of them - less than two thousand.  They live mainly on the Kola Peninsula.  For the general public, the most famous is the Sami village in the Murmansk region, where the locals invite guests and where they equipped traditional dwellings for showing to tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Origin and related peoples </h2><p>  As already written, the Sami have relatives in neighboring <span>Scandinavian countries.</span>  They call themselves Sami (Sami), which has a lot in common with the Finnish designation <span>Suomi (suomi).</span>  In ancient times, the Slavs called them Lapps.  Ethnologists argue that it was from this name that Lapland came from.  What significance this word would have now, unfortunately, is not reliably known.  One version is the designation of a people who live far, since Lappe in Finnish and Estonian means ‚Äúdistant‚Äù, ‚Äúlast‚Äù. </p><p>  Mention of the inhabitants of these lands are found in the memories of travelers back in the XVI century. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, the Russian Geographical Society organized a large expedition to the Sami lands in order to study the life, culture and origins of this ethnos.  In 1927, several scientists went to find out where the Sami village is located.  In the Murmansk region, several such objects were discovered.  They subsequently published their observations.  Very valuable material was collected about this people.  In the second half of the 20th century, Sami tales were even published, recorded from the words of the Sami just during this ethnographic expedition. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The Sami village in the Murmansk region lies in the depths of the Kola Peninsula, and can only be reached by car.  First you need to fly (or take a train) to Murmansk, and from there take a bypass road towards St. Petersburg.  From the main road you need to turn towards Revda and Lovozero.  Please note: despite the fact that the road from the highway is asphalt, the quality of the coating is very mediocre, so you need to drive carefully.  Many people prefer to order a taxi, since all local drivers know where the Sami village is located.  The Murmansk region is quite large, but it‚Äôs easy to navigate in it, as there are enough signs to not get lost.  On the way to the Sami, beautiful views of the harsh but very picturesque nature open up. </p>

    <h2>  Sami history </h2><p>  Scientists are convinced that the Sami are descendants of the peoples who settled in these territories in ancient times.  There is a chronicle evidence that the harsh northern people with special customs and traditions live in Karelia.  The ancient ancestors of the locals even left drawings on the rocks.  During excavations, the remains of ancient tools were found, which were made of stone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Some researchers have suggested that the Sami are in some way relatives of the South Siberian peoples.  This is indicated by many similarities in languages ‚Äã‚Äãand in appearance.  Perhaps these tribes once lived together, but due to reasons unknown to us, they split up: some left, and the second preferred to stay.  Now only the Sami village in the Murmansk region, or rather, its inhabitants, tells the descendants of their lifestyles. </p><h2>  Religious beliefs </h2><p>  The S√°mi were originally pagans.  Their beliefs have much in common with the Sami religious beliefs in Scandinavia, but they also have their own characteristics. </p><p>  The Saami have a very strong cult cult and the cult of their ancestors.  Each type of fishing - fishing, hunting and reindeer husbandry - has its own master spirit, which protects against ailments and helps in the work.  Animal sacrifice is widespread to appease spirits and provide their favor. </p><p>  The cult of ancestors is especially notable.  It was believed that the deceased continue to help their living relatives, even affect the weather and help during hunting or fishing.  Therefore, the dead were appeased, brought sacrifices and fed. </p><p>  At the moment, almost all S√°mi are Christians.  However, the rituals persisted for quite some time.  Now they are held only for the entertainment of tourists who want to personally know what and what the Sami village lives in in the Murmansk region.  Photos of such events are always bright, original, colorful. </p>

    <h2>  National Holidays and Customs </h2><p>  One of the most amazing S√°mi national festivals is the bearish games - ‚ÄúTall Sir‚Äù in S√°mi.  In ancient times, the Sami one of the most revered animals was a bear.  He was respected, but at the same time feared.  At the end of the 20th century, by the decision of the National Cultural Center, Tall Sir was revived.  As part of the holiday <span>, bear hunting is</span> imitated <span>,</span> and sports are held between the most daring and dexterous Sami. </p><p>  The traditions of Sami summer games are also being revived.  This event includes wide festivities with performances by ethnographic groups.  You can be sure that the Sami village in the Murmansk region takes an active part in these events.  Feedback and impressions from the audience then remain only the most positive. </p><p>  Olenegorsk also hosts the annual Sami music festival.  It was first organized in 1996.  The Sami village is also actively involved in these events.  In the Murmansk region  there are all conditions in order to demonstrate in all its glory national life and customs of local Aborigines.  The Sami, like many years ago, themselves sew their costumes and outfits, only now for performances. </p>

    <h2>  Open Air Museum "Sam Syyt" </h2><p>  Recently, Sam Syyut Museum has gained great popularity, where everyone can get acquainted with the life and culture of the Sami.  An excursion to the Sami village is regularly held here.  Murmansk region is the only region where Sami are represented in Russia. </p><p>  Here, right on the street, are wooden images of Sami idols.  They say that in order to fulfill a cherished desire, it is necessary to hug the statue, whisper the desire and appease it with a yellow coin.  The Sami sincerely believe that such communication with spirits helps to solve pressing issues. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the townspeople really like the small zoo, which contains indigenous representatives of the fauna of the Kola Peninsula: northern blue foxes, foxes and rabbits.  The latter often walk around the village on their own.  Also there live real reindeer.  Guests will definitely be shown and told in detail about these amazing animals that helped a person survive in harsh environmental conditions.  You can even feed them, which leads to the constant delight of the kids.  And adults, judging by the reviews, remain impressed by communicating with noble handsome men.  The local reindeer herder is ready to talk for hours about his wards, who are completely tame and absolutely not afraid of a person. </p><p>  On the streets of the village are Kuwaxes - the national type of dwelling in which the Sami lived and took refuge from the weather.  Visitors note that they had not seen anything like it before, which, however, is quite understandable.  But this does not make it less interesting. </p>

And what a delight you experience from a <span>reindeer sleigh ride!</span>  It is impossible to describe in words, you only need to feel it. </p><p>  Near the village there is a spring lake "Seven Sami Keys".
