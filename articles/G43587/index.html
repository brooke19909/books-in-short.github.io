    <h2>  What is the principle of the cooperative? </h2><p>  The Family Capital company works according to the following principle: first, interested shareholders are attracted who make a certain monetary contribution with a further prospect of interest accumulation;  at the expense of this money a certain fund is being formed, and it helps members of the cooperative to receive loans to satisfy personal needs. </p><p>  Family Consumer Credit Cooperative ‚ÄúFamily Capital‚Äù does not provide loans to people who are not members of this organization.  Therefore, in order to obtain the loan necessary for the borrower, he must initially become a member of the cooperative. </p><h2>  Where does the money of co-op shareholders go? </h2><p>  According to the organization‚Äôs employees themselves, most of the money goes to the prospective development of the domestic agricultural industry.  This is due to the fact that most members of the cooperative are employees and owners of agricultural enterprises and organizations of various scales. </p><p>  In addition, the credit cooperative has a fairly large trading network where goods and products of all the same agricultural companies, which are shareholders of Family Capital, are sold.  In addition, the structure of the organization fully controls the entire full production cycle.  The company owns the following assets: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  several own farms; </li><li>  processing enterprises; </li><li>  grocery stores. </li></ul><p>  The organization also employs experienced specialists in the field of logistics, pricing, lending, financing, etc. </p><h2>  How to become a member of a cooperative? </h2><p>  Everyone can become a shareholder and join the Family Consumer Credit Consumer Cooperative.  To do this, do the following: </p><ul><li>  to come to any nearest office of the company with a passport; </li><li>  make a starting amount (contribution for joining the organization) in the amount of 100 rubles; </li><li>  conclude a cooperation agreement; </li><li>  make an additional amount of up to <span>500 rubles</span> (performed after signing the cooperation agreement). </li></ul>

This should be done before February 1 of next year. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúFor the Motherland!‚Äù  - cooperative income program </h2><p>  Currently, several programs are operating in the credit cooperative at once, one of which is profitable.  It has the original patriotic name "For the Motherland!"  and provides for the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  down payment of 500 rubles; </li><li>  making a monthly contribution to replenish for any amount (at least 500 rubles); </li><li>  interest rate up to 28.9% per annum; </li><li>  loan term up to 42 months; </li><li>  monthly interest payment or upon expiration of the loan agreement. </li></ul>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Income program "Rent" </h2><p>  KPK ‚ÄúFamily Capital‚Äù offers its shareholders another rental program ‚ÄúRent‚Äù.  It also involves a contribution of 500 rubles, an interest rate of 18% per annum and monthly interest.  In this case, interest can be obtained by transferring them to your bank account in a cooperative or by issuing the required amount in cash through the organization‚Äôs cash desk.  The validity period of such a loan agreement can be from 6 to 24 months. </p><h2>  Cooperative program "Income" </h2><p>  And finally, the third program for shareholders, which offers KPK "Family Capital", is "Income".  It is also valid only after the shareholder makes a down payment (500 rubles), assumes an interest rate in the range of 18-20% per annum, a loan term of 6 to 12 months and the ability to receive interest upon expiration of the contract. </p><h2>  Cumulative program "Millionaire for 500 rubles per month" </h2><p>  In addition to profitable ones, the cooperative also has funded programs.  For example, "Millionaire for 500 rubles."  Like the three previous ones, it provides for a down payment, as well as an additional monthly replenishment in the range of 500-1000 rubles.  The interest rate for such a program will be 15% per annum.  It involves a monthly <span>capitalization of interest</span> and a maturity of up to 262 months.  It is such a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù that KPK ‚ÄúFamily Capital‚Äù offers its shareholders.  You will read reviews about it below. </p>

    <p>  For example, for all 262 months a shareholder invested 500 rubles each.  Over the entire period of the contract, he transferred about 131,000 rubles, therefore, accumulated in the end 1,008,930 rubles. </p><h2>  The program "Millionaire for 1000 rubles per month" </h2><p>  Shareholders of KPK "Family Capital" can take part in an alternative program.  For this it is necessary, in addition to the desire, to make a down payment in the amount of 1000 rubles, and then be sure to pay 1000-10 000 rubles a month.  The duration of such an agreement is 229 months, and the amount of interest is 13% per annum.  Interest on this project is accrued at the end of the agreement. </p><p>  For example, in 229 months, you transferred 229,000 rubles (1,000 per month) to the members of the cooperative, therefore, as a result, the income amounted to 1,007,054 rubles. </p><h2>  Cumulative program "Millionaire" </h2><p>  Offers KPK "Family Capital" and another program of savings from the series "Millionaire".  The size of the first installment on it is only 10,000 rubles, and the mandatory contribution made by the shareholder on a monthly basis is from 10,000 rubles.  The interest rate for such a program is 11% per annum.  However, it does not provide for monthly capitalization, but involves early termination of the contract.  Validity period is 73 months. </p><p>  For example, with a monthly transfer of an organization of 10,000 rubles for 73 months, your income will amount to 1,042,193 rubles. </p><h2>  Program for your child - "Children's capital" </h2><p>  This is a unique program, since a shareholder, when participating in it, must first invest only 500 rubles and pay exactly the same amount every month, and receive 10,000 as a bonus from the cooperative.  At the same time, 15% per annum will be charged on the entire amount, including the bonus.  In turn, the program is funded and it operates until the child is 18 years old.  This is an example of a program that operates in the CPC Family Capital.  You will see reviews about this organization below. </p>

    <h2>  ‚ÄúHappy Child‚Äù and ‚ÄúYoung Millionaire‚Äù - funded programs </h2><p>  The Happy Child program is also valid until your child‚Äôs 18th birthday and involves a down payment of 1000 rubles, monthly deposits of 1000 rubles and a bonus from the company in the amount of 10 000 rubles.  The rate is 13% per annum. </p><p>  The Young Millionaire involves monthly installments and a first contribution of 10,000 rubles, as well as a bonus from the company for exactly the same amount.  The rate is 11% per annum. </p><p>  Also, members of the cooperative can easily save up for the following needs: </p><ul><li>  on training (there are programs for schoolchildren, students and adolescents); </li><li>  for the purchase of real estate and a car. </li></ul><p>  The organization also has other programs designed for young families and people of retirement age. </p><h2>  Credit cooperatives: reviews </h2><p>  Before becoming a member of one of the non-banking organizations, you should carefully study the reviews about it.  Most often this is due to an erroneous error.  For example, many users are sincerely confident in the similarity of a credit cooperative and a financial pyramid.  But it is not so. </p><p>  As a rule, such organizations have nothing to do with banks, but operate within the framework of the law and do not violate the law.  Shareholders make all contributions on a voluntary basis.  In addition, for example, in ‚ÄúFamily Capital‚Äù they can spend the interest on personal needs by purchasing products in the cooperative‚Äôs distribution networks.  Moreover, here they are waiting for the accumulative <span>system of discounts</span> and bonuses. </p>

    <p>  We open information and study credit cooperatives (reviews).  For example, the most controversial things say about the Moscow branch of the Family Capital cooperative.  So, some say that they ‚Äúbought‚Äù advertisements and promises to get easy passive income, but in the end they invested money and did not see what was promised.  For example, one of the users writes that he invested three years at 1000 rubles, received a discount on the purchase of goods in cooperative stores.  At first, I bought it there.  Later, the product quality ceased to suit, and decided to pick up his share.  As a result, some dubious additional contributions of 900 rubles were calculated from his base deposit (1000 rubles).  and returned to their hands only 100. </p><p>  Other shareholders said that they have been participating in the program for young families for four years.  So far they have not received interest, since it is designed for the age of majority of the child.  However, they are satisfied with the loyalty of employees and transparency in the execution of documents. </p><p>  Still others believe that applying to this organization is associated with certain risks: you invest a lot now, but will it be possible to return your money based on interest?  But what do the employees themselves say about this company? </p><h2>  What they say about the company in the team </h2><p>  Smart people say: "Do not be too lazy to read, referring to the CPC" Family Capital ", the reviews of employees."  What are they reporting?  For example, some ex-employees of the Moscow branch of the cooperative claim that the company operates under the license of a legal entity, therefore, it acts within the framework of the law and you should not be afraid to invest in it.  Others, on the contrary, focus on the doubtful reputation of the company and say that you should not contact it. </p><p>  In a word, think over and check everything three times before trusting your savings to Family Capital.  A consumer credit cooperative is always a certain risk. </p>
