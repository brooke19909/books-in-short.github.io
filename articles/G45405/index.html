It is located in the Tosno district, 6 km from the village of Nurma.  Marshes surround the lake from all sides: in the north and northeast - Yeryakinskoe, in the southeast - Pendikovskoye.  The area of ​​the described water area is only 2.1 km², located at an altitude of 48 m above sea level.  The reservoir is the source of the Igolinki River.  Pendikovo lake is shallow.  The average distance between the surface of the water and the bottom is 1.5–2 m, the maximum is 3 m in the center.  The Pendikovsky pond is oval in shape, elongated to the southeast for 2 km, the width of the lake is 1 km.  The bottom is silty and overgrown with algae.  The shores are high, swampy.  There is moss and <span>reed vegetation</span> along the entire length of the lake.  The southern and western shores of the reservoir are slightly higher than the northern.  Several small streams flow into it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pendikovskoe lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1363201.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fauna </h2><p>  In past years, Pendikovskoe Lake was teeming with <span>lake trout,</span> and flocks of wild boars were found on the shores.  For a long time, this area remained popular among hunters and fishermen.  However, over time, the situation has changed.  The lake has become shallow, and there are not so many fish here.  In addition, Pendikov Lake, fishing on which is prohibited for commercial purposes, loses the "extra" vacationers due to the fact that it is only allowed to fish from the shore for live bait.  And during the spawning period, catching vertebrates is generally prohibited.  Currently, roach, crucian carp, ide and burbot are found in the lake, and pike and perch are found among predatory fish.  Underwater representatives - mostly small, large specimens rarely come across. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pendikovskoe lake fishing" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1363202.jpg" width="600"></div>

The whole territory near such a reservoir as Lake Pendikovskoye (photo is in the article) is strewn with berries and mushrooms.  However, there are dangers in their collection.  Useful cranberries and blueberries prefer to grow on marshy areas.  Mushrooms are often poisonous.  As in any similar place, there are many ticks on the territory of the lake. </p><h2>  The recreation center "Pendikovskoe Lake" </h2><p>  The presence of a tourist base on the lake makes the rest more comfortable and safe.  The described water area is located in the conservation zone, and therefore hunting and fishing are carried out here with the permission of the administration.  If you want to stay on the pond for a few days, then visitors are warmly welcomed at the Pendikovsky Lake hunting and fishing base.  <span>The recreation center is</span> open all year, the territory is closed.  Here you can rent all the necessary accessories for various activities, including boats.  The base is located near the village of Shapki, on the lake.  It is worth considering that the hunting season is short-term: </p><ul><li>  In the spring (from late April to early May) - you can hunt for capercaillie, black grouse, drake. </li><li>  In summer (from August to September) - hunting for wild boar, woodcock and snipe birds. </li><li>  In winter (November to February) - on a wild boar, elk, hare, fox and wolf. </li></ul><p>  The huntsmen are engaged in taxidermy (making stuffed animals) at the base, so if you want to take the result of a successful hunt as a trophy, it becomes possible for a fee.  Rooms 1, 2, 3-seater, are in a wooden two-story house, there is a bathhouse in the base.  The cottage can accommodate 12 people at a time.  People come here to relax and hunt here both alone and with families. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pendikovskoe recreation center" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1363203.jpg" width="474"></div>

    <h2>  The recreation center "Lake Toyluk" </h2><p>  Near the base "Pendikovskoe Lake", reviews of which are satisfactory, is the tourist village "Lake Toyluk".  This is a more economical option for recreation. </p><p>  From this base is very close to seemingly endless fields, where there are often low trees and shrubs.  Judging by the reviews of people, there is someone to hunt here, so there are always a lot of tourists in this area.  For convenience, a dirt path was laid across the field. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pendikovo lake reviews" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1363205.jpg" width="519"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to the lake? </h2><p>  You can get to Lake Pendikovsky from Tosno.  10 km east of the village will be village.  Nurma.  After the latter, you need to turn right and after 6 km get along the country road to your destination.  You can get to the very shore of the lake only from the south or north side.  There are convenient beaches near the pond, which often stay overnight.  It is worth fearing a trip by car from the southeast and east because of the swamps approaching the lake. </p>
