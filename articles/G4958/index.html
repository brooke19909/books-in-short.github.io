The described device is no exception.  Many owners call it chubby brick.  Something unusual adds a gray edging.  Thanks to it, it turns out to visually reduce the thickness of the device.  In general, the external characteristics of the Doogee X5 Max Pro are pleasant to look at.  The case is folding.  Made of plastic.  There is an aluminum chassis.  On the front is tempered glass.  The cover is matte, does not slip.  Soft touch feels like a lot to many, but in fact it is not.  There are two options on the market - white and black. </p><p>  We can say that the dimensions of the device - 14.3 √ó 7.3 cm - are completely suitable for the diagonal of the phone, but the thickness is almost 2 cm and the weight is justified by a powerful battery.  It is convenient to work with the device even with such indicators.  Ergonomics are successful.  This is evidenced by the characteristics and reviews of the Doogee X5 Max Pro. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doogee x5 max pro specifications and manufacturer" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2048264.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The front end is as concise as possible.  There are no inscriptions or logos on it.  There is a speaker, sensors, a camera and touch keys without backlight.  There is also a microphone.  Near the display you can see the frame.  The edging is quite a bit above the screen level. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Even with the fact that there is a speaker on the bottom, it is alone and is on the right side.  On the upper edge, you can see the ports for headphones and a charger.  The left end is empty, on the right there is a volume rocker and a power button.  The keys fit perfectly under the user's fingers.  Their course is tight, they work quietly and quickly. </p><p>  On the back you can see the camera module, there is a flash and a fingerprint scanner.  Below is the manufacturer‚Äôs logo.  These are the characteristics of the Doogee X5 Max Pro. </p><p>  Many are surprised that the phone, which costs less than 100 bucks, has a fingerprint sensor.  At the time of the release of this device, even expensive models did not all have a similar function.  The scanner works quickly and accurately.  With it, you can not only unlock the phone, but take a photo, scroll through the pictures in the "Gallery", pause audio or video.  It can also be used to protect any application on the device. </p><p>  To remove the back cover, you should find the protrusion.  Under it is a removable battery, ports for two SIM cards and an external drive. </p><p>  The assembly of the device is good.  This is confirmed by the official characteristics of the Doogee X5 Max Pro.  The only gripe that buyers have is a slightly edged fingerprint scanner.  The case has excellent rigidity, there is no backlash, creaks, and when falling from low heights it does not break. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doogee x5 max pro feature review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2048265.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  The phone operates on a five-diagonal display with a resolution of 1280 √ó 720.  The matrix has a protective glass.  Unfortunately, its manufacturer is not disclosed.  Between them there is a layer of air, which is why in the sun the readability of the device is reduced.  However, during repair this facilitates the replacement process, if the display is damaged, it will be possible to change the glass without the entire display unit.  A film with <span>an oleophobic coating is</span> also installed at the factory <span>.</span> </p><p>  According to buyers, the impressions of the screen characteristics of the Doogee X5 Max Pro are positive.  Color reproduction is pleasant, although a deviation in cold tones is noticeable.  Contrast is also excellent.  The display resolution is enough so that the owners do not notice the pixels.  Detailing at a good level.  Smooth fonts are not distorted.  Viewing angles are not bad.  You can change the brightness both manually and set its change in automatic mode.  Its range is enough to ensure that on a sunny day everything was readable, or in a dark room did not hit the eyes.  Automatic mode is sometimes inaccurate. </p><p>  Unfortunately, multi-touch only works with two touches.  In general, it reacts instantly, but there are delays.  In normal use, this is invisible, but in games all owners immediately see the braking. </p><p>  There is a wide range of gestures.  The characteristics of the <span>Doogee X5</span> Max Pro <span>phone</span> allow you to scroll through photos, change tracks, and desktops.  You can also unlock the phone with a double touch, lock, call the camera using a swipe from the bottom up, and so on.  You can enable the options to turn off the melody when making a call when the screen is turned down, the ability to answer a call with shaking, turn off the speakerphone when the proximity sensor is triggered. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doogee x5 max pro 4g specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2048266.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Audio system </h2><p>  This phone model has one multimedia speaker.  Thanks to him, the owner gets a loud and clear sound.  The characteristics of the Doogee X5 Max Pro phone show an excellent frequency range, but it would be worth a little more work on detailing.  For games, video playback and speakerphone speaker will be enough. </p><p>  The headset will have to be purchased separately, since it is not included in the kit.  If you use gaming or intra-channel devices with an impedance of 60 ohms and 16 ohms, respectively, then the sound will be normal.  There are no excesses, but the volume margin is noticeably upset - it is small. </p><p>  When using headphones, you can turn on the radio.  It has the function of not only listening, but also recording. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Feature Overview The Doogee X5 Max Pro should also describe matrices.  The phone is equipped with two cameras.  As already mentioned, both have 5 megapixels with the possibility of increasing to 8 megapixels due to interpolation.  Autofocus is present only in the main camera.  The first is able to shoot video in good quality.  We are talking about 720. The front provides the ability to shoot video in 480 quality. Photos and videos are not very impressive in their quality.  Their capabilities are enough for ordinary everyday tasks, especially if there is good lighting.  But you should forget about quality detail.  In general, the characteristics of the Doogee X5 Max Pro cameras are normal. </p><p>  The settings menu is the simplest, familiar to any Android user.  It is possible to change shooting modes and set any options. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doogee x5 max pro specifications and reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2048267.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  User interface </h2><p>  The phone works on Android 6.0.1.  It is slightly processed by the manufacturer, so it has a different appearance.  The icons are slightly redrawn.  The application menu has received vertical scrolling, and the curtain has been finalized. </p><p>  In the factory, not many utilities are installed.  We are talking about a flashlight, a keyboard, a program for opening documents and transferring them.  All of them, as noted by users, are useful and are used even by the inactive owners themselves.  It should be noted that a special application is also installed that clones any utility, allowing you to log in to another account.  On one social.  network, etc. is allowed to have no more than 2 profiles. </p><p>  The settings menu is created in black.  The submenu is made white.  Many users notice that such a contrast hits the eyes very much.  Access is available to almost all desired parameters.  We are talking about sound, screen, control, appearance, communications.  However, some points were not Russified. </p><p>  Buyers notice an interesting option.  It consists of a turbo download, which allows you to simultaneously use mobile Internet and Wi-Fi to download files.  This complements the specifications.  Manufacturer Doogee X5 Max Pro notes this feature in the first place. </p><p>  In general, the operating system shows stable, fast and smooth operation.  There are no criticisms. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The device runs on a quad-core processor from MediaTek.  All of them have a frequency of up to 1.2 GHz.  Graphics received a power of 650 MHz.  Supports some standards required for games.  RAM - 2 GB, internal - 16 GB.  The space can be expanded by using memory cards.  The platform works with OTG mode.  This allows you to connect peripheral devices and external USB-drives. </p><p>  The processor is a modification of the MT6735 version.  Due to this, its power is a little more.  The same goes for performance.  The smartphone can not only work with calls, documents, browsing sites / videos, listening to music, but also allows you to run videos.  Unfortunately, they are available only on the minimum, sometimes - average settings, however, it still pleases buyers.  For example, the well-known Asphalt 8 can be comfortably played.  However, only minimal graphics settings are available in it.  But the game Vainglory will have a good time in the middle.  CSR Racing 2 will not even slow down.  With prolonged load, the device does not heat up and does not hang. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  The device can work with 2G, 3G, 4G networks.  The characteristics of the Doogee X5 Max Pro make it clear that only one radio module is built-in.  This does not allow the use of both SIM cards at the same time.  During the testing of the phone, many note that there were no complaints about its functionality.  The spoken speaker works well.  The microphone is also not bad.  It should be noted vibration alert, which has medium strength. </p><p>  Also built-in <span>Bluetooth</span> and Wi-Fi.  The connection is stable, it holds well, the connection is fast.  There is a navigation module.  He needs about 10 seconds to establish work. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The advantage of the model is the battery life.  The battery is designed for 4 thousand mAh.  If you load the phone medium, using only 50% of the brightness, the device can last about two days.  When activating only the basic functions, it will not require recharging for about three days. </p><p>  If you watch video in HD resolution, then the phone will need to be connected to the network in 12 hours. Games can discharge the device in five hours.  These characteristics can be called good for a budget device. </p>
