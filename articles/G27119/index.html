    <h2>  Holidays in Jordan </h2><p>  This country has recently become a popular tourist destination.  There is a rich excursion program, the magnificent coast of two seas at once - the Dead and the Red, excellent diving and snorkeling, the golden sands of the desert, etc.  Tourists with children especially like it here, the country will seem a little boring to young people in terms of entertainment and nightlife.  However, rest here can not be called cheap.  There are very few budget hotels, and staying in luxury hotels, for example in Kempinski Hotel Aqaba Red Sea 5 *, is expensive - about 250 euros per night.  However, the service provided by these hotels is well worth it.  Mostly a special category of pilgrim tourists come to Jordan, who at all costs dream of going to the city of Petra, as well as visiting other ancient monuments of architecture that are distinguished by their uniqueness.  Many are also interested in the country's major cities - Aqaba, and of course, Amman. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kempinski hotel aqaba 5" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1425985.jpg" width="600"></div>

The flight duration is about 4 hours.  There is no need to pre-apply for a visa.  You can receive it upon arrival in the country.  If you fly to this Arab country to relax on the Red Sea at the Kempinski Hotel Aqaba 5 * hotel (Jordan), then, having arrived in Amman, you can take the only domestic flight to Aqaba, where this hotel is located.  You can also go there by the comfortable JETT bus or private Trust.  The road also takes 4 hours. </p><p>  There is another great option - rent a car.  To do this, you will need international rights and a credit card, on which the amount from 150 to 500 US dollars will be blocked as a security.  If you rent a car through a travel agency - it will cost you less.  By the way, the movement in this country is right-handed.  You won‚Äôt need to do all this if you include a transfer from the airport to the hotel and back when arranging a tour at Kempinski Hotel Aqaba 5 * (Aqaba / Jordan). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kempinski hotel aqaba 5 jordan description" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1425988.jpg" width="600"></div>

Even in January, the temperature does not drop below 10 degrees.  The maximum air temperature is + 35-40 degrees.  It is best to visit Jordan in the fall and spring months.  It is quite rainy here in winter.  The exception is the same Aqaba, where the aforementioned Kempinski Hotel Aqaba 5 * hotel <span>(Jordan) is located.</span>  <span>The photos that</span> are posted in the article are gorgeous, but they cannot fully convey all the charm that reigns in this paradise.  So, in this resort city all year round you can indulge in a beach holiday.  Water even in the coldest months warms up to 21 degrees. </p><h2>  Aqaba Resort </h2><p>  It is located on the shores of the bay of the same name.  This is a fairly young resort, so the hotels here are relatively modern.  There are about 340 kilometers from Amman to it.  As already noted - 4 hours by bus, and only a few minutes if you fly by plane.  The water in the bay is just crystal.  If the country was in the EU, the beaches would be awarded the Blue Flag.  The town is surrounded by rocky mountains, which provide a comfortable microclimate.  It is often hot in the summer, so if you cannot stand the heat, then avoid coming here in late July and early August.  By the way, in the off-season prices will be noticeably reduced here, and there will not be an influx of tourists.  Further in the article we will tell you about <span>the Kempinski Hotel</span> Aqaba 5 * <span>hotel</span> .  As you know, it belongs to the world-famous luxury hotel chain.

In addition to all of the above, there is a great animation program that is provided to guests who have chosen to relax Kempinski Hotel Aqaba.  Reviews about the hotel, or rather about the entertainment that can be found here, however, are not always positive.  Of course, all the services here are at the highest level, but tourists, especially young people, complain about boredom.  Do not forget that this is an eastern country with rather strict rules, and life outside the hotel simply cannot be exciting.  When buying a tour to Jordan, you need to consider that, in addition to the ‚Äúexcursion‚Äù, everything else can be obtained only at the hotel. </p><h2>  Service for children </h2><p>  For younger tourists there is a children's pool and a club.

The hotel has a playground with slides. </p><h2>  Kempinski Hotel Aqaba 5 *: reviews and ratings of tourists </h2><p>  If you read the notes left by guests of different age categories, they will be completely opposite.  The thing is that for people who value comfort and a high level of service, the hotel likes everything without exception.  After all, the service here is impeccable.  Here you can spend your whole vacation very fruitfully, get a beautiful tan, improve your health, become slimmer, visit sights, etc. However, youth reviews contain complaints about the lack of a fun entertainment program.  Our advice: if fun is most important to you, then you better not come to this hotel, and indeed to Jordan in general.  Newlyweds also leave positive ratings, because for them there are all conditions for privacy.  The same applies to couples, especially if they choose to relax on the lower floors with verandas with access to the garden. </p>
