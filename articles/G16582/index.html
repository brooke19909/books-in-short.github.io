For a long time there was a military, then a border zone.  But after the collapse of the USSR, Kinburn turned into a kind of magnet that attracted to it with an unstoppable force those who wanted a “wild”, and at the same time exclusive vacation.  Now so called the whole peninsula, stretching from the confluence of the Dnieper and the Bug to the Black Sea.  Because this edge of the earth consists almost entirely of <span>washed sand.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kinburn Spit" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/442955.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Historical place </h2><p>  Kinburn Spit is mysterious and remarkable.  She has an amazing story.  Ancient historians wrote about this peninsula.  Local legends speak of the Amazons living here, Scythian gold, and the sacred temple of Hekate, supposedly hidden in the local tracts.  The peninsula was inhabited by Greeks, Turks and Tatars.  The latter gave him this name.  After all, the current name of the braid comes from the Turkic "Kilburun".  Here stood a Turkish fortress, taken by Suvorov in 1787, during the battle of Ochakov.  This happened due to the tricks of the <span>Zaporozhye Cossacks,</span> who, under the nose of the Turks, dug a canal through a scythe and launched their “gulls” there.  Traces of this event are still visible on the surface of the earth, and at the end of the spit - where there was a fortress - there is a monument to Suvorov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kinburn Spit Trips" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/442950.jpg" width="500"></div>

There are several villages and farms, interconnected by quicksand.  Every year, places to drive change, and only very sophisticated four-wheel drive drivers can drive here by land.  After the border detachment was removed from here, the Ural all-terrain vehicle walks between the "mainland" and the villages, which drags a bus along with it.  His path runs through the desert and the village of Golaya Pristan to Nikolaev.  He walks once a day.  But much easier than shaking through the sands for many hours in the heat of the desert, in forty minutes drive a boat to the end of the spit or to the village of Rymba.  So do many tourists.  Trips to the Kinburn Spit are organized, as a rule, from Ochakov.  There are guarded parking lots at the berths where you can park your car for several days without any problems.  These are mainly weekend excursions, but more and more people come to live a week or two on the “almost island” itself, as they say here.  And this is not without meaning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kinburn Spit recreation center" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/442940.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Where to live? </h2><p>  Kinburn offers visitors many places to relax.  There are boarding houses, and the private sector, and <span>campgrounds.</span>  It’s hard to say whether Kinburn Spit will appeal to lovers of comfort.  There is a <span>recreation center</span> here, and not one - it’s “Steep talus”, and “Elite”, and “Wonderland”.  All of them have good living conditions, good cuisine, wireless Internet.  Mostly these bases and tourist complexes are located either in the village of Pokrovka, or on the Ryba farm.  Cheaper you can stay in the private sector - and here you already choose what you like - amenities and a higher price, or hot water in a natural "boiler" in the sun and a room in a village house.  But the Kinburn Spit has one feature - practically nowhere you will not see the so-called settlements “on the first line”.  From any base or private house to the sea you need to go through the beautiful flowering steppe and pine grove from 600 to 1000 meters.  Almost no one settles on the shore.  Rather, on the beach.  All villages and farms stand on the banks of the Dnieper-Bug estuary with fresh water.  Only one of the departmental bases is located near the sea pier, and a stationary tent camp is also organized annually.  But those who do not want to go along the steppe can be comforted - several times a day, enterprising locals organize something like a "minibus" to the beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kinburn spit fishing" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/442943.jpg" width="600"></div>

The fact is that these places at the time of the Old Russian prince were close to the trading transshipment point of the famous “from the Varangians to the Greeks” route.  Spit arrow is located a few kilometers from the famous island of Berezan.  This place is with an amazing microclimate.  Sometimes it rains in Ochakovo, and floods the entire Nikolaev region, and here not a drop will fall.  The thing is that on the one hand the scythe is washed by the waters of the Dnieper-Bug estuary, and on the other - sea.  In its widest place, primitive relict forests have been preserved, pine groves are planted between the villages in the sand, and closer to the narrow end there is a wonderful steppe with healing mud lakes, where thousands of snow-white birds rise into the air.  At the end of the spit, northern eiders settled, and sometimes in the sky you can see flocks of pelicans.  Swans nest on the inland lakes, and dolphins a few meters from the coast are not a rare sight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kinburn spit reviews" class="if" height="362" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/442952.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  They are mostly natural here.  What is Kinburn Spit famous for?  Rest in these places, of course, offers a trip to the "lost world" of a fairy tale.  First of all, this is the famous Volyzhin forest - the remains of the primeval thicket of Gilea, about which Herodotus wrote.  These are oaks, birches, alder trees covered with vines.  By the way, one of such trees is shown during excursions, assuring that it is an oak tree sung by Pushkin.  The one on which the "scientist cat" walked.  So it is entirely possible that the Kinburn Peninsula is Lukomorye.  Why not?  Sandy ravines, overgrown with creeping vegetation and sometimes boggy, locals call sagas.  They themselves do not poke themselves there, and they do not advise tourists.  <span>Steppe wolves,</span> wild boars, chamois and sand jerboas resembling small kangaroos are found on the spit.  You can get acquainted with all this wildlife by visiting the forestry zoo.  And another attraction is the so-called mullet lakes - places where this fish spawns.  They are fresh and uniquely clean. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The local coast is somewhat reminiscent of the islands in Thailand.  The endless sky and sea, the finest white sand, crunching underfoot, a shallow entrance to the sea ... And the beaches are huge, endless.  The most equipped of them is located at the end of the spit - there is everything that the soul wants - restaurants and cafes, water bananas and skis, sun loungers ... This is where one of the Ochakov boats arrives.  Another beach, near which there is a bar right on the shore, is located near Rymbov.  There you will have to sunbathe on your own towel in the shade of olive trees.  A little distance away, near the pier - the beach of the departmental base, but it is crowded there, and there is no shadow at all.  But, by the way, to find an absolutely deserted place, where you can swim naked in broad daylight, and no one but numerous gulls and loons will pay attention to this, there is no problem at all in Kinburn.  Sometimes, right in the sea, a few meters from the coast, you can find valuable deposits of very useful white clay.  And what sunsets are here!  Just unearthly beauty. </p><h2>  Kinburn Spit: Fishing </h2><p>  Mostly they are caught here not on the sea - where are reserved places - but on the estuary.  In this brackish and warm water, large crucian carp and carp, as well as gobies and mullet, peck well.  <span>Sea fishing is</span> allowed away from the coast.  Experienced tourists praise spearfishing, where you can catch large fish and stingrays.  True, near the end of the spit, the water is a little muddy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kinburn Spit vacation" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/442954.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kinburn Spit: reviews </h2><p>  Those who have been here at least once are irresistibly drawn here again.  This is a place that romantic natures love, newlyweds, families with children, and just wanting to escape from civilization.  People like to go here from May to October.  Although the swimming season lasts three to four months, but fishing, amazing milk from the local cows and glade with porcini mushrooms is another highlight of the braid.  Of course, local furious mosquitoes bother, and sometimes there are jellyfish and algae in the sea.  But even this is a sign of excellent ecology and clean air.  So come, do not hesitate.  This is one of the best holiday destinations in Ukraine. </p>
