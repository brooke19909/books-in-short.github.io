    <h2>  What are </h2><p>  Before you learn how to decorate <span>a phone case with your own hands, you</span> should get acquainted with their varieties.  So, today everyone can purchase leather, silicone, knitted and fabric cases for mobile phones.  Each of them has its advantages and disadvantages. </p><p>  For example, leather cases are durable due to their quality and look great even without any jewelry, but they are quite expensive and also not very reliable in terms of protecting the gadget from mechanical damage. </p><p>  Plastic variants are the worst that can withstand impacts, which often fall apart when they fall, but they are popular due to their originality. </p><p>  Silicone cases, or, as they are also called, bumpers, are the most common model, with virtually no flaws.  The reason is the properties of silicone itself, which has such qualities as elasticity, strength and reliability. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are also knitted and fabric cases that women and girls like, but they are unlikely to protect the smartphone in the fall. </p>

    <h2>  How to decorate a silicone <span>phone case</span> with your own hands </h2><p>  Decorating the ‚Äúclothes‚Äù of your smartphone from such modern material will not be difficult.  The main thing would be desire and imagination.  Here are some interesting ideas. </p><p>  1. We decorate the accessory using colored Japanese washi tape.  This is one of the most common methods, since it does not require large expenses and has a large number of options.  For example, tape can be glued diagonally along the entire body or in horizontal lines.  Moreover, you can even cut out figures and ‚Äúassemble‚Äù an original ornament or drawing from them into a case. </p><p>  2. We use confetti.  If you do not know how to decorate <span>a phone case with your own hands,</span> then you should take advantage of the fact that silicone cases for mobile phones are usually transparent.  Just pour the shiny small multi-colored confetti into the cover and cover it with paper on top so that it does not fly out.  Voila!  The festive case is ready! </p><p>  3. Decorate with nail polish.  If you use several colors at the same time, you get a pretty and interesting case.  Those who are endowed with the talent of an artist are especially lucky, as they can draw an <span>abstract drawing,</span> creating a case design that is one of a kind. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="decorate silicone do-it-yourself phone case" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1320503.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  How to decorate a leather phone case </h2><p>  Using your hands to create something practical and beautiful is an incomparable pleasure.  The most common ways to decorate a leather case include decoupage or hand embroidery.  In addition, on the cover you can sew flowers crocheted from yarn of bright colors.  However, this is a completely ‚Äúgirlish‚Äù option, which is not suitable for everyone. </p><h2>  Add shine </h2><p>  Many girls simply adore diamonds, even if they are fake, so it is not surprising that there are many women who want to decorate their phone case with rhinestones. </p><p>  If you chose this method of decoration, you definitely need to know the main rule - everything is good in moderation, because it is easy to overdo it. </p><p>  So, remember: </p><ul><li>  Silver rhinestones do not mix with gold.  These two colors have never been combined.  You only ruin the whole picture. </li><li>  Combine the ‚Äúdiamonds‚Äù of various sizes, but of the same shape, only if you do not plan to make any particular pattern. </li><li>  Silver rhinestones look good on surfaces painted in cold shades, and gold - on a warm background. </li><li>  Before you do something on the case, first try to put the picture on the sheet, then all of a sudden you don‚Äôt want to see the same on the phone. </li></ul><p>  Following these rules, you will surely achieve an amazing result in using rhinestones for decorating a cover.  In addition, looking at the photo below, you will understand how to decorate a phone case with your own hands using glue and very small sparkles. </p>

    <h2>  Decorate the book cover </h2><p>  Such cases are quite convenient and multifunctional.  However, despite this, they can also be improved.  For example, for ease of use, it is worth fixing an elastic band on the inside or making a pocket for a headset. </p><p>  Those who work in the office, especially in a serious company, can be advised as follows: the appearance of the smartphone should not be too frivolous.  Therefore, do not be original if you want to decorate a cover-book for a phone.  With your hands, even if you are not used to fine art work, you can make a beautiful option by pasting an unusual pattern or just strips of colored tape. </p><p>  If you are a creative person, then you do not need any advice, because it will not be difficult for such people to solve the issue of decor.  However, you can take a few ideas.  For example, you can: </p><ul><li>  sew a lot of plain or multi-colored buttons and even ‚Äúlay out‚Äù a picture with them (mosaic ornament, initials, etc.); </li><li>  decorate the book cover with lace ribbons, just sticking them on top; </li><li>  apply with a color scheme and transparent nail polish. </li><li>  another option is to put on a piece of tulle with a beautiful pattern, and spray paint on top and carefully remove the textiles: the free areas will remain unpainted, and a beautiful lace ornament will appear on the cover. </li></ul><h2>  Mistaken </h2><p>  Today, everything that makes us closer to mother nature is in fashion.  That is why the covers decorated in the technique will be original and relevant.  Under such an unusual name for our ear lies the art of creating paintings from flowers and leaves, dried under the press.  To prepare the raw materials you will need 10 days or more, but the result will be unique.  To get beautiful dried flowers, they must be carefully laid out, for example, on the page of a thick encyclopedic volume, and then left for 2 weeks.  After complete drying, carefully lay out the leaves and flowers with the desired pattern on the cover and top with clear nail polish.  It remains only to wait for everything to dry properly.  Admire how this decor looks.  Wonderful, isn't it? </p>
