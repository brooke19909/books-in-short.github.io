    <h2>  Impostor Biography </h2><p>  Until now, neither the real name nor the origin of this mysterious person is known.  There are only extremely cautious and almost unfounded assumptions about who False Dmitry was actually 2. The biography of the impostor is a ‚Äúwhite spot‚Äù.  According to one version, he was the son of a priest.  Another source informs us that False Dmitry 2 had Jewish roots dating back to a seedy province, but there is no reliable information.  Speaking about such a person as False Dmitry 2 briefly, we can say with confidence: the adventurism that is inherent in any Russian person, as well as exposure to other people's influence, played a detrimental role in his fate. </p><p>  An impostor appeared in the summer of 1607 in Starodub.  All his short life passed in local skirmishes and wars.  The strategy of False Dmitry 2 was based on the version that his predecessor survived the uprising in Moscow.  Despite the trick, he was less fortunate.  The reign of False Dmitry 2 did not take place, since he could not get to the capital to be crowned.  His main hope was the troops of Ivan Bolotnikov.  The impostor believed that they would help capture Moscow, however, Bolotnikov could not provide substantial assistance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Politics </h2>

    <p>  In the piggy bank of victories of False Dmitry 2, only local short-term triumphs were listed.  It is surprising that he was able to put even minor forces under his banner.  He began his journey to his goal with a trip to the Belarusian cities of Propoisk and Starodub.  Having shown courage, the impostor introduced himself as Demetrius Ioannovich.  In a short period of time, he managed to gain the trust of a large number of people and gather warriors from the <span>Polish gentry, the</span> Treasury, as well as the rebels of Ivan Bolotnikov in his entourage.  Under the leadership of this dubious subject, the resulting group advanced towards Bryansk, and then to Tula.  The first triumphs inspired the army.  During the siege of the capital, half of the local nobility crossed over to False Dmitry 2, who claimed the Russian throne.  Having defeated Vasily Shuisky, the impostor was defeated near Khimki on Presnya.  Nevertheless, he managed to organize a camp in Tushino near Moscow.  Here the local <span>Boyar Duma was formed,</span> its own routines and orders began to operate.  False Dmitry 2 controlled the territory north of Moscow, he conquered such large cities as Vladimir, <span>Yaroslavl, Vologda,</span> Suzdal, Rostov.  After the capture of the latter, the troops brought to Tushino the captured Metropolitan Filaret Romanov, where he was proclaimed Patriarch.  Significant support was provided by popular unrest, backed by dissatisfaction with the power of the boyars and Vasily Shuisky. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Strengthening Position </h2><p>  Meanwhile, in pursuit of power and easy money, in July 1608, Marina Mnishek, the official widow of False Dmitry 1, arrived in Tushino. Under the terms of the armistice agreement with the Poles, she was set free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="False Dmitry 2 biography" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23608/616232.jpg" width="600"></div>  Taking the opportunity, in the ‚ÄúTushino thief‚Äù a woman recognized her husband, who was supposedly miraculously saved.  Of course, this fact once again confirmed the false status of an impostor in the eyes of others.  Subsequently, the couple secretly married, and they had a son.

    <h2>  The power of the Polish interventionists </h2><p>  The country was finally established the regime of anarchy.  In the Tushino court, the Poles divided and dominated.  It was in their hands control, they corrected the actions of their puppets: the policy of False Dmitry 2 was completely controlled by the Poles.  Taking advantage of this, the Poles eagerly plundered and ruined the simple peasants.  Endless robberies began to run up against the armed answers of the townspeople and peasants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="False Dmitry policy 2" class="if" height="168" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23608/616233.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Thanks to the efforts of a remarkable commander and an excellent strategist - Skopin-Shuisky M.V.  False Dmitry 2's plans were upset.  In 1609, the Tushino camp finally collapsed.  The collected rabble did not want to obey anyone, everyone just wanted easy money.  False Dmitry 2 found no other way out than to flee to Kaluga.  But even there he could not find salvation: death found an impostor in the Kaluga region, where he was shot dead by his own servant - P. Urusov </p><p>  Meanwhile, the fate of Ivan Bolotnikov, who supported False Dmitry 2, was no less sad.  He was first blinded, and then killed by a club on the head.  Bolotnikov's lifeless body was thrown into the hole. </p><h2>  Chronology </h2><p>  Thus, if we analyze the path that False Dmitry 2 passed, briefly, we can distinguish several main stages: </p><p>  -1607 - the appearance of an impostor, who introduced himself as a surviving False Dmitry 1; </p><p>  - 1608 - the formation of its own army from the remnants of troops of various stripes; </p><p>  -May 11, 1608 - the defeat of government troops under the leadership of Shuisky, the formation of the Tushino camp, the seizure of new lands; </p><p>  -1609 - the appearance of discord in the camp, the weakening of the positions of False Dmitry 2; </p><p>  -1610 year - the dissolution of the Tushino camp, the flight of False Dmitry 2 to Kaluga; </p><p>  December 11, 1610 - the murder of an impostor who betrayed him by Peter Urusov. </p><p>  The location of the remains of False Dmitry 2 is not known, but it is believed that they are in one of the Kaluga churches. </p>
