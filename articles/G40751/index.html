For example, in India, the first tourists have already arrived in the capital of Delhi for a further trip to Goa.  Ski resorts, azure shores of island countries - all this attracts travelers.  Therefore, the topic of choosing a tariff and a mobile operator may be more relevant than ever. </p><h2>  What is the "Best Profit Roaming" </h2><p>  The service of the same name was created by Beeline mobile operator for its subscribers.  The option is valid in almost all countries.  The company itself notes 3 advantages that can attract and satisfy subscribers: </p><ul><li>  does not require a connection; </li><li>  simplicity of cost calculations; </li><li>  payment upon use. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="mytariffs.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The most profitable roaming" class="if uuid-2908879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/2908879.jpg"></div><p>  3 types of services are charged: incoming and outgoing calls, short messages and Internet traffic.  At the same time, packet volumes are allocated for voice communication and data exchange. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Prices when visiting CIS countries </h2><p>  For travelers to Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and other countries that are members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the operator offers the following tariff conditions: </p><ul><li>  20 minutes, which are included in the package for 200 rubles per day.  After the end of the allotted minutes, each call will be charged at 10 rubles until the end of the day. </li><li>  40 MB for data exchange on the Internet, the cost is also 200 rubles.  If the allocated volume is over, each 1 MB until the end of the day is paid 5 rubles. </li><li>  The cost of outgoing SMS-messages is 30 rubles. </li></ul><h2>  Tariffs for trips to Europe and some countries </h2><p>  The same cost is saved if you travel to such popular destinations as Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Thailand, Germany, Greece, Italy and other European countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sravni.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Option Terms" class="if uuid-2908890" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/2908890.jpg"></div><p>  For example, how is ‚ÄúBest Profit Roaming‚Äù used in Turkey?  The cost of both incoming and outgoing calls will first be deducted from the total daily package of minutes for a monthly fee of 200 rubles.  If calls were not made, funds from the personal account are not debited. </p><h2>  How much are calls, messages and the Internet in other countries </h2><p>  When visiting states such as the Bahamas, Bolivia, Virgin Islands, Haiti, Guatemala, Honduras, Liberia, Tonga, Uganda, Chad, Ecuador and others, the conditions will change: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  outgoing short messages will be sent with subsequent write-off from the balance of 30 rubles; </li><li>  Incoming calls are paid in the amount of 25 rubles per minute; </li><li>  outgoing calls within the country, to Russia or other countries - 100 rubles with per-minute billing; </li><li>  paid per megabyte and the Internet - 90 rubles / MB. </li></ul><p>  For China, Morocco, Tanzania, Tunisia, Nepal, Uruguay, an exception was made in the method of calculating for using access to the World Wide Web - as in other cases, a daily limit of 40 MB for 200 rubles is allocated.  Write-off occurs on the first exit to the network.  The rest (cost of calls and SMS) rates are saved in the amount of 25, 100 and 30 rubles. </p><h2>  Where the service does not work </h2><p>  A number of countries are classified as exotic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vkonline.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="stay connected on vacation" class="if uuid-2908914" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/2908914.jpg"></div><p>  These include Bahrain, Bermuda, Bhutan and several others. </p><p>  When in these countries, tariffs will be very high: </p><ul><li>  incoming and outgoing calls can be made with the subsequent debiting of 200 rubles per minute of conversation; </li><li>  sending short messages - 30 rubles; </li><li>  Internet traffic is paid at the rate of 15 rubles for every 20 kb. </li></ul><p>  A full list of countries of a particular group can be found on the Beeline official website.  In any case, it is worth noting that the rest of the minutes or the amount of data is not transferred.  The days of the option expire at midnight local time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Activate and deactivate option </h2><p>  For greater comfort of its subscribers, the mobile operator has provided the inclusion and deactivation of the service in automatic mode.  There are no special actions for activation.  When a traveler arrives at the airport of the host country, upon first registration on the network, the fact of being in international roaming is determined and the service is activated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="b24.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="High Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãCommunication Services" class="if uuid-2908907" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/2908907.jpg"></div><p>  What should not be forgotten: the subscription fee in the territories where the daily limit is practiced is debited when making or receiving the first call within one day, and for the amount of traffic - the first time you connect to the network. </p><h2>  Is the service available when traveling in Russia </h2><p>  Not.  The option "The most profitable roaming" is valid only in international roaming.  If the subscriber travels through the territory of the Russian Federation, tariffing takes place on other conditions.  If you are interested in the most profitable roaming in Russia, we are glad to please you: in 2018, at the insistence of the FAS, intra-network roaming was canceled.  Tariffication should be checked with the operators. </p><h2>  Customer Reviews </h2><p>  Despite the relatively attractive conditions, many owners of Beeline mobile numbers remain unhappy.  Let's try to understand the nuances of the option. </p><p>  If a person decides to go to a resort in Turkey, the ‚ÄúBest Deal‚Äù will offer 20 minutes that apply to both incoming and outgoing calls.  When using the allocated limit, the cost of one minute will cost 10 rubles.  If the limit is exceeded, tariffing will also occur at 10 rubles.  However, if only one call lasting less than a minute was made per day, the same 200 rubles will be deducted from the balance. </p><p>  The situation is similar with the volume of traffic provided per day.  Given that the owners of gadgets prefer to set the auto-sync data settings, or the smartphone regularly checks for application updates, the probability of receiving a bill for significant amounts upon returning home is very high. </p><p>  Also, cellular users are not satisfied with the lack of the ability to disable the service. </p><p>  The fourth reason for dissatisfaction is the small amount of traffic at 40 MB.  Is it a lot or a little?  If you plan to only look at mail and communicate only through messages - this is enough.  If you want to read the news, share photos and videos - this package is enough only for breakfast. </p><h2>  Expert opinion </h2><p>  In April 2017, the information-analytical agency Content-Review, which monitors trends and events in the field of communications and telecommunications, conducted a comparative study of the tariffs of operators in the Russian Federation, the CIS and the European Union. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sravni.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline recognized as the best company" class="if uuid-2908883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/2908883.jpg"></div><p>  According to its results, the terms of the tariff "Most profitable roaming" from Beeline were recognized as the most favorable. </p><h2>  Alternatives from other cellular companies </h2><p>  To determine the preferred operator and the amount of data or minutes, a small comparative analysis of the options from Megafon and MTS can help. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Option Name </td><td>  Outgoing calls </td><td>  Incoming calls </td><td>  SMS </td><td>  the Internet </td></tr><tr><td>  The most profitable roaming from Beeline in the CIS and Europe </td><td colspan="2">  Package 20 min. / 200 rub.  per day </td><td>  30 rub </td><td>  40 MB / 200 rub.  per day </td></tr><tr><td>  The same option in Asian countries </td><td>  100 rub / min </td><td>  25 rub / min </td><td>  30 rub </td><td>  90 RUB / MB </td></tr><tr><td>  Zabugorishte from MTS </td><td colspan="2">  100 min daily  for incoming and outgoing to Russia for 320 rubles.  per day </td><td>  19 rub </td><td>  500 MB per day are included in the daily package. </td></tr><tr><td>  "Zero without borders" from MTS (the most profitable roaming for calls) </td><td colspan="2">  Daily 60 minutes for 125 rubles.  per day </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  "Bit abroad" from MTS </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  Daily 100 MBytes from 450 rubles.  per day at maximum speed (specify the cost for a specific country) </td></tr><tr><td>  "Maxi Beat Abroad" from MTS </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>  Daily from 200 MB for 700 rubles.  per day at maximum speed (cost and volume may vary depending on the host country) </td></tr><tr><td>  "Roaming, Goodbye!"  from MegaFon </td><td colspan="4">  For a daily subscription fee of 299 rubles, the subscriber gets the opportunity to receive calls and make calls to Russia under the terms of the tariff in the home region, the same conditions apply for Internet traffic with a limit of not more than 1 GB per day </td></tr><tr><td>  "The whole world" from "MegaFon" </td><td>  According to the roaming tariff of the host country </td><td>  40 min. / 99 rub.  per day </td><td colspan="2">  According to the roaming tariff of the host country </td></tr><tr><td>  "Holidays online" from "MegaFon" </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  15 rubles / MB in 26 countries within 30 days from the date of connection </td></tr><tr><td>  "World Online" from "MegaFon" </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  - </td><td>  600 rub  for daily 1 GB at maximum speed </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  How can you save on international roaming? </h2><p>  For those who do not want to pay for communication services of a domestic operator abroad at current prices, the following ways to optimize costs can be advised: </p><ol><li>  Consider connecting a local SIM card.  It is often much more profitable to purchase a mobile number of a cellular company in the host country than to pay for services at roaming tariffs.  For example, in India, the monthly fee starts from 149 rupees (1 rupee = 0.89 rubles) for unlimited calls throughout the Republic and a daily package of 1 GB or more at maximum speed.  The maximum cost can be 600-800 rupees for a daily limit of about 3 GB of data. </li><li>  If you are planning a long trip, check on the popular travel forums about the experience of connecting a local operator‚Äôs number, which documents are required and in what quantity. </li><li>  When planning a trip for 10-14 days, you can use the Internet via Wi-Fi in public places, a cafe or a hotel.  You can get information from a tour operator, hotel administration or on thematic sites. <div class="photo" data-original="www.vladimir.kp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Keep in touch with loved ones" class="if uuid-2908903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102889/2908903.jpg"></div>  Use messengers that work when connected to the global network to make calls. </li><li>  Disable the auto-sync settings on your smartphone or tablet, access to mobile data to avoid downloading data without your knowledge. </li></ol><p>  I want to be sure that now, going to overseas countries, you can act as an expert and say which tariff is the most favorable in roaming.  Or how to save a tidy sum. </p>
