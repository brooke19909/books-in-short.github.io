  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Problems of modern youth: specifics and features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern Russia is a rather specific country in which there has been a sharp change in the main vector of development.  It is no secret that most of all the changes in the political and social fields affect those who have not yet had time to decide in life, in whom there is still no solid core laid down by upbringing and education, that is, the youngest. </p><p>  The problems of modern youth are very different from those of their parents at the same age.  Moreover, they differ in all aspects - both morally, and socially, and economically.  The striking differences between their lives and those of the previous generation often made constructive dialogue impossible, and even more so the exchange of experience between generations - this experience is too different. </p><p>  The moral problems of modern youth, according to psychologists, are caused by two main difficulties: laziness and lack of purpose.  Many parents, having themselves gone through difficult times of lack of money and ‚Äúinitial accumulation of capital‚Äù, strive to make sure that their child does not need anything.  And they do it - the younger generation really does not need anything - neither money, nor family, nor love.  By the end of school, most of them have everything they can dream of (especially for children from megacities - it is more difficult to achieve financial prosperity in the province), and they can only <span>burn their lives</span> thoughtlessly <span>.</span>  Morality as such is of little interest to them - they have completely different things in their heads, they simply don‚Äôt think about it.  And parents who have dedicated their whole lives to ensuring that their child is the best, realize with horror that they missed the main thing - they did not teach him to love, respect and value friends, parents and relatives. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The social problems of</span> modern youth are caused, first of all, by the fact that the society, which today is a <span>consumer society,</span> poses one task for the guys - to have as much money as possible.  But at the same time, everything that is happening around teaches the younger generation exclusively that money does not need to be earned - there are many other ways to get it, much easier and simpler.  Therefore, in the eyes of young people, <span>social institutions</span> that were significant for their ancestors lose their value.  School, education, family and even the state are worthless, because the meaning of life is not at all in them.  Such problems of youth in modern society will inevitably lead to the gradual degradation of social and <span>moral norms, the</span> loss of the connection of generations and a primitive existence devoid of a spiritual component. </p><p>  The financial problems of modern youth are due to the lack of a clear government policy in this area.  The level of scholarships and salaries for beginner specialists today is such that there is no need to talk about any decent living.  At the same time, subsequent employment seems to be very problematic due to the fact that higher education has been graduating specialists in excess for a long time, and there are no vacancies for them in their specialty.  At the same time, in cities with developed industry, there is a clear shortage of professional workers, but there are no people willing to take these places. </p><p>  Also, many problems of modern youth are caused by the information field in which they live.  The Internet and television do not set themselves the <span>task of educating a</span> new generation, their main goal is entertainment.  Moreover, most of these entertainments are thoughtless and devoid of any meaning.  This is another factor provoking the degradation of the <span>younger generation.</span>  In other words, all the surrounding reality, under the influence of which a young personality is formed, directedly affects it not creatively, but destructively, which leads to the emergence of a number of problems and difficulties. </p>
