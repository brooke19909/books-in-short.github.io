This place is the largest park complex in Russia and on the planet, where there are memorials of the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945. </p><h2>  How to get to this place? </h2><p>  Where is the <span>Walk of</span> Fame in <span>Moscow</span> ?  To get there, you need to proceed to the Western part of the capital.  The park itself was commissioned in 1995 on May 9, celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the victory over the Nazi invaders.  On a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe park, mass events of national importance are often held. </p>

Moving west, you will go to Minskaya Street, following the east - to General Yermolov Street, and to the south - the Fonchenko brothers.  Nearby there is a <span>railway station</span> direction Kiev - Moscow-Sortirovochnaya.

    <p>  What else is in this memorial complex, where is the famous Walk of Fame in Moscow itself, how can city residents come here?  You can go to the metro station, the name of which is also dedicated to Victory Park since 2003. </p><p>  At the end of 2016, it was also planned to open another transport hub - the Minsk station.  Thus, those who travel along the Aminievskoye Highway, as well as Minsk Street, will be able to get here without difficulty.  The administration controls how the Walk of Fame works in Moscow.  Her address: 7 Fonchenko Brothers Street. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  There really are a lot of worthy objects that make sense to look at.  The most important of them is the Walk of Fame in Moscow, which is dedicated to the war years.  It can be found between the square and the museum complex.  There are five terraces, each of which symbolizes a separate year.  As many water surfaces.  More than two hundred fountains work, namely 225 - this is the number of weeks during which the war lasted and the blood of Russian soldiers was shed. </p><p>  Truly a magnificent place - the Walk of Fame in Moscow.  A photo of its center will reveal to you a huge obelisk growing from the center of the square by 141.8 meters in height.  At the top of it is a statue of Nicky - the deity of victory.  The podium is made of granite.  There is a symbol here that personifies the victory of good forces over evil ones - a statue of St. George the Victorious, striking a snake with his spear. </p>

    <h2>  Where to go </h2><p>  The Walk of Fame in Moscow will lead you to the museum in the center, where you can look at things that do not allow you to forget about the great war for the fatherland.  You can go through the memory room.  It contains 285 volumes with the names of the soldiers who fell on the battlefields.  Amaze with their beauty dioramas, of which there are only six.  They depict the main military events. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The museum has funds that preserve genuine weapons and equipment for combat, masterpieces of numismatics, philokarty, household items and things interesting from the point of view of philately.  There are many documents and photographs, paintings by which you can learn about the war itself, about the alliance of the anti-Hitler forces in the struggle for freedom. </p><p>  Also, bypassing the Walk of Fame, you can get to the exhibition of equipment with which fights were fought.  In addition, there are fortifications and engineering structures.  Of the heavy equipment you will see at least 300 samples that helped the USSR and its allies win.  You can look at the guns of Germany, which are also presented as part of the exhibition.  This helps to imagine how the forces were distributed during the battles. </p>

    <h2>  Change history </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the park has been open to visitors since 1995, when the fiftieth anniversary of the victory was celebrated.  It began to function thanks to B.N.  Yeltsin, who issued the relevant decree. </p><p>  On the opening day, a holiday was organized in the central square, to which WWII veterans were invited.  Closer to Mount Poklonnaya there was an opportunity to see the troops participating in the parade.  The metropolitan garrison demonstrated guns.  The group of fountains operating here is rightly considered the largest in the capital. </p><p>  <span>The Victory Monument,</span> in turn, has the greatest height.  In the same 1995, a temple appeared dedicated to George the Victorious, the Great Martyr.  Two monuments were opened on the territory of the memory alley: <span>missing</span> soldiers without graves, as well as a memorial dedicated to the spirit of Elba. </p>

    <h2>  All that does not allow to forget </h2><p>  Two years later, in 1997, several more objects were added here.  One of the monuments was dedicated to the defenders of the Russian lands, and the other a tragedy experienced by the peoples.  In addition, a memorial mosque appeared.  In 1998, the place was supplemented by a synagogue. </p><p>  With the advent of the new decade, in the 2000s, the administration and authorities continued to develop the park.  And in July 2001, the Poklonnaya Gora Hill was crowned with huge flower dioramas, which are unrivaled in the world.  Their diameter is 10 m. There is a watch that started and then registered in the Guinness book.  Their uniqueness lies in huge size. </p><h2>  Recent additions </h2><p>  Then they opened a chapel dedicated to the Spanish volunteers in 2003, a monument in honor of internationalists in 2004, members of the coalition against Hitler in 2005, an ensemble of commemorative arrows representing 10 fronts and 3 fleets of the USSR in 2005.  In December 2009, the <span>Eternal Flame was</span> lit on Poklonnaya Hill, because repairs were carried out near the Memorial of the Unknown Soldier. </p>

In the future, a monument dedicated to the liquidators of the Chernobyl accident will be built from it.  Prior to this, in 2014 there was a change in the departmental affiliation of the park.  Now it is in charge of the Department of Cultural Affairs of Moscow.
