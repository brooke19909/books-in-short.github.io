    <p>  To touch the history of the country, you should definitely visit Druskininkai.  Sights of its surroundings can tell a lot to an inquisitive tourist. </p><p>  During the world wars, the village of Liskyava was on Lithuanian territory.  A demarcation line ran along the river, which was considered the border between <span>the Republic of Lithuania</span> and the Vilnius Region, which belonged to Poland.  Today about this village you can read even in some works of art. <br>  Now the village is known for several archaeological monuments, presented in the form of a mound.  It was here that from the 9th to the 11th century a citadel was built from wood.  It is also worth mentioning the temple hill and the stone with the imprint of a bull’s footprint. <br><br>  In addition to all this, the village is famous for other architectural monuments.  Here is the castle and the ruins of a tower of the fifteenth century, the architectural ensemble of the world-famous Holy Trinity Cathedral, built in the 17th century and the Dominican monastery, built in the middle of the seventeenth century, which rises on the banks of the Neman River.  Here is the famous church - the pearl of baroque in southern Lithuania.  Many tourists from all over the world come to him annually. </p><p>  The fence itself and the porch of the temple belong to the buildings of the eighteenth century.  The bell tower and sculpture of St. Agatha were erected in the 19th century.  Also in the sanctuary there are many masterpieces of art of the 17-19th centuries, which are perfectly preserved. <br><br>  Today, through the hard work of the specialists of the Lishkyava Center (Lithuania, Druskininkai), many cultural heritage are being restored.  Everything here is organized for the convenience of tourists.  They restore the church from the destruction inflicted during the First World War.  In that terrible period there was a shop and a post office in the church.  Under Soviet rule, children studied in the church, and then there was sewing production.  But only in 1998, the village of Lishkyava was recognized as the country's cultural heritage site. </p><p>  Incredibly informative can be a vacation in Lithuania.  Druskininkai and other resorts immerse the tourist in a truly unique atmosphere. </p>
