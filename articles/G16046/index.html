    <h2>  Basic requirements for the borrower </h2><p>  Sberbank a cash loan is issued without reference to not everyone.  It is necessary to meet the basic requirements of the organization.  There are not many of them, but some points will have to be taken into account.  Otherwise, you will encounter a standard loan scheme. </p><p>  At the time of conclusion of the contract, the client must be at least 21 years old, and for the period of the last loan payment - no more than 65 years.  Accordingly, a pensioner will be able to use the service being studied. </p><p>  Also a huge role is played by employment.  It provides the following features: </p><ul><li>  a person has been working in last place for at least 6 months; </li><li>  over the past 5 years, experience is at least 1 year. </li></ul><p>  Unemployed and those who work informally, you can not count on a loan at Sberbank without information.  After all, they have no real profit.  So, they will not be able to fulfill their obligations if they receive the service.  Not a single bank in real life will contact the unemployed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Terms of consideration </h2><p>  Can I <span>get a loan without income statement?</span>  Sberbank offers a similar service, though not for everyone.  Its receipt will be described in more detail below. </p><p>  First, we‚Äôll try to understand how long this or that request is considered.  Loans at Sberbank are issued about 2 hours.  So much will have to wait for citizens with special status.  Other people can wait for approval of the application 2-3 days.  In any case, the process takes a minimum of time.  And this cannot but rejoice. </p><p>  The offer from Sberbank will be valid for 14 days.  It is during this period that a citizen either agrees with his decision or completely refuses a loan. </p><h2>  Amount Limits </h2><p>  You can get a loan without information on a Sberbank card in Russia.  And in cash too.  But for this you will have to meet the criteria of the bank. </p><p>  Some people wonder how much money is issued in this way.  Today you can count on a minimum of 45,000 rubles.  The maximum threshold is about 1,500,000 rubles.  But, as practice shows, without references and guarantors, Sberbank is unlikely to approve a loan.  The higher the loan amount, the less chance of success! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="take a loan without income statement Sberbank" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2037667.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  The benefits of collaboration </h2><p>  Why do many people want to take a loan from Sberbank without references and guarantors?  The service being studied has significant advantages.  We‚Äôll talk about them. </p><p>  Firstly, Sberbank has a relatively low percentage of overpayments.  Secondly, early full or partial repayment of the loan is available.  Moreover, no fines and overpayments are provided.  Thirdly, an annuity loan repayment system is applied, which eliminates unnecessary red tape and problems. </p><p>  In the end, the service is offered in all regions of the Russian Federation.  Sberbank is considered the most stable financial institution.  So you can rely on her.  It inspires confidence among customers.  The speed of service is also pleasing. </p><h2>  About the disadvantages </h2><p>  But there are enough disadvantages of lending without references and guarantors.  Some of them may refuse the service. </p><p>  For example, all information that is indicated in the contract is thoroughly checked.  In addition, you will have to prepare a certain package of documents for obtaining a loan.  The service under study is not a single passport loan at all. </p><p>  Also, when considering an application, only official income is taken into account, which must be confirmed.  Unofficial profits, as we have said, are not taken into account. </p><h2>  Main secret </h2><p>  How to get a loan from Sberbank without information?  There is one little secret.  It is thanks to him that you can get rid of the need for guarantors and the presentation of statements of income. </p><p>  The client must have a salary or <span>pension card,</span> by which the citizen‚Äôs profit will be visible.  Only in this case is it possible to issue a loan without additional paperwork.  In other situations, you have to present a full package of documents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank to take a cash loan without reference" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2037666.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Ways of registration </h2><p>  How to get a loan from Sberbank without information?  You can do this in the following ways: </p><ul><li>  personally; </li><li>  sending a request by mail (extremely rare alignment); </li><li>  by filling out an online application. </li></ul><p>  Quite often, people themselves turn to Sberbank for the mentioned service.  This technique significantly speeds up the operation.  Especially if you need to get cash.  Otherwise, it is recommended to contact the help of the Internet portal. </p><h2>  Step-by-step about submitting a personal request </h2><p>  Now is the time to learn step-by-step instructions.  They will help to request a cash loan without inquiries from Sberbank.  Not everyone is capable of taking such a loan. </p><p>  Let's start by submitting a personal request.  This is the simplest scenario.  A potential debtor will have to: </p><ol><li>  Prepare a minimum package of documents. </li><li>  Fill out a loan application. </li><li>  Contact Sberbank by registration with a request. </li><li>  Wait for a response to the application. </li><li>  Confirm your intentions. </li><li>  Get cash. </li></ol><p>  Everything is extremely simple and clear.

      <p></p>
    <p>  For the operation under study, the citizen will be asked: </p><ul><li>  passport; </li><li>  certificate of registration; </li><li>  statement; </li><li>  employment record or a copy of the employment contract. </li></ul><p>  In addition, you will have to present a statement of income.  It will not be required if the person has a salary card or plastic, which receives a pension or other profit.  In this case, income information will be checked by Sberbank employees independently.  It is enough to inform when submitting a request that the applicant has a card of one type or another from Sberbank. </p><h2>  Internet and credit </h2><p>  How to get a loan without information at Sberbank Online?

He will inform about the organization‚Äôs decision on the loan, and in case of a positive answer, he will invite him to the bank to sign the agreement.  There is nothing difficult, incomprehensible or special in this.  The package of documents requested in this case is already known to us. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  We found out <span>how to get a loan from Sberbank</span> without inquiries.  For this, a citizen must have a pension or salary card from the mentioned financial institution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank online to take a loan without reference" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2037664.jpg"></div>
