    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  In the <span>Sarov desert</span> , monastic life was actively developing.  Here she reached considerable heights, and the monastery itself is famous for its traditions.  The desert had a large number of spiritual ascetics.  Rev. Seraphim came from the Sarov monastery.  He ceased to be a recluse by the decision of the Mother of God.  After that, Father Seraphim began to communicate with people.  This happened seven years before his death.  They found out about him throughout Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="diveevo attractions map" class="if" height="475" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/467167.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical information </h2><p>  The monastery was founded in the XVIII century.  Her story began after the church of the Kazan Mother of God was built.  Alexandra Melgunova and her four novices organized a monastery in this place.  Mother herself ruled the community.  It was she who saw the future ascetic in the young monk Seraphim.  Mother Alexandra believed that he would continue her work.  After the death of the abbess, the community continued to exist in accordance with the strict charter of the monastery. </p><h2>  Further activities </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, the community was reorganized into a monastery.  Diveevo at the turn of the 20th century was a rich architectural complex.  More than a thousand sisters lived and worked here.  The complex included: cells, a hospital, a refectory and a school.  Behind the walls of the monastery are a water pump, a mill and two hotels.  The cloister was closed in 1927.  Later, those sisters who still remained on its territory were expelled from Diveevo.  The monastery (the sights near it became accessible to visitors only after the 89th year), according to the prediction of Seraphim, he was to become the first female Lavra.  Also, the monk was sure that after death his remains would rest here.  In the 20s.  his relics were lost.  In 1991, they were rediscovered.  After this, the relics of Seraphim of Sarov were transferred to Diveevo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="diveevo attractions map" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/467148.jpg" width="332"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Modern realities </h2><p>  In 2003, a special Orthodox holiday was widely celebrated.  It was a century of glorification in the face of <span>Saints Seraphim of</span> Sarov.  Thanks to the upcoming many Christian celebrations, the bulk of the buildings and temples of the monastery have been restored. </p><h2>  Relics of the saint </h2><p>  The sights of Diveevo of the Nizhny Novgorod region are not only cultural, but also of special religious significance.  The female monastery is the brainchild of Seraphim of Sarov.  In the last years of his life, he especially cared for her.  Even when Seraphim of Sarov was in the rank of hierodeacon, he accompanied Father Pachomius to the community with mother Alexandra.  The late abbot blessed him and ordered him to take care of the orphans in Diveevo.  For the sisters who turned to Seraphim of Sarov for advice in their everyday and spiritual difficulties, he was a real father. </p><h2>  Holy sources in Diveevo </h2><p>  Sights (their map is contained in many tourist guides) of the described area invariably attract a large number of tourists annually.  There is a lot of evidence about the miraculous power of the local nature.  <span>The holy sources of the</span> monastery and its environs are able to heal both bodily and spiritual ailments.  Water from the local springs is stored for a very long time.  At the same time, it remains fresh and tastes good.  Locals regularly drink this healing fluid.  They also use it for winter harvesting and pickles.  Thus, products protect against spoilage and mold. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="diveevo monastery attractions" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20016/467149.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Kazan source </h2><p>  The spring is located beyond the pigeon ravine.  This source is the oldest of all existing in Diveevo.  There are suggestions that it existed even before the organization of the settlement in this place.  Already in the XVIII century, this source was revered in the Diveevo monastery, at a time when it was led by mother Alexander. </p><p>  Equally important was the Old River.  It was from its shore that white limestone was taken, which became the main material for the construction of the Kazan Stone Church, located in Diveevo.  Attractions here are connected with Christianity.  Many of them have their own legends.  Long-standing legends have been preserved that it was in this place that the Queen of Heaven appeared three times.  <span>The icon of the Kazan Mother of God</span> was kept in the chapel of the source.  The latter has long been in Diveevo.  A large chapel above the Kazan spring is on the plan, which was drawn up in 1845.  It housed a marble iconostasis.  Also in the chapel were icons of good writing.  Two of them can now be seen in Trinity Cathedral. </p>

    <p>  In the chapel, water sanctuaries were held.  It was destroyed in the 39th year.  One of the local residents several years before these events found an icon of the Kazan Mother of God in the ice of a frozen spring.  It was a very ancient letter.  Nun Grashkina became the keeper of the icon.  She was able to witness many wonders associated with the image. </p><p>  In the year 43, the icon underwent a miraculous renewal.  Currently, the shrine is kept in the Trinity Cathedral.  In the 50s.  the chapel was restored for a while, after which it was again destroyed.  According to the recollections about her, you can approximately restore her appearance.  The chapel itself was tall.  Many icons hung on the walls.  In the center was the source.  A trickle flowed out of it with the help of a trough.  From there it was possible to take water. </p><p>  In the source it is customary to bathe sick children.  People pour this water from buckets.  In the year 91, a bathhouse and a chapel were built over the source itself.  A few years later they were reconstructed.  In this holy place, the sacrament of baptism is still being performed.  During holy holidays, this water is sanctified.  Near the Kazan source are two more.  Both were consecrated.  One of the sources is dedicated in honor of the icon of the Mother of God "Tenderness", and the other is in memory of the great martyr Panteleimon. </p><h2>  Spring of Mother Alexandra </h2><p>  This source was located on the Wichkins River until the 60s.  According to local traditions, it flowed directly from the grave of mother Alexandra.  She was buried at the altar of the Kazan Church.  Modern experts have worked on solving the riddle of this phenomenon.  They studied the soil and foundation of the Kazan temple.  It turned out that melt snow and rain water from the entire surface of the monastery‚Äôs land went into the Dolomites through the soil.  They, in turn, are in the earth's thickness, under the building.  In this case, water undergoes a purification process.  Through the consecrated ground, she goes upstairs and flows from the miraculous source of mother Alexandra. </p><p>  There are many Christian legends about this holy place.  They say so that a miraculous source flows directly from under the monastery.  In the 60s, a dam was built on the Wichkins River.  In the course of the work, the former source was flooded, and the new one appeared under the mountain by itself.  There are several opinions about this.  It is believed that the previous source again made its way up after the shift of the dolomite plates.  This was due to increased water pressure in the dam.  For all significant Christian holidays, water is sanctified here and religious processions are performed. </p><h2>  Spring of the Father Seraphim </h2><p>  This spring is located on the banks of the Satis River.  It opened in the first half of the 20th century.  At that time, the Sarov springs became inaccessible for visits.  This was due to the fact that a military facility was located on their territory.  There are also many legends about this place.  It is believed that it was here that the soldiers saw the old man.  He was dressed in a white hoodie, and in his hands was a staff.  He stood on the very site where the fence approached the river.  The old man hit the ground with his staff, and at the same moment three springs appeared from under it.  They adopted the glory and power of famous Sarov sources.  Later they wanted to fall asleep.  For this, special equipment has already arrived, but it has broken.  Workers had to wait for new parts. </p>

    <p>  Soon the same old man appeared.  He turned to one of the workers by name and asked him not to fill the source.  After that, the tractor driver did not succumb to the persuasion of other people and refused to fill the spring.  Soon, the boss who gave this order was removed from office. </p><p>  In 1994, the riverbed was allotted.  Subsequently, an artificial lake was built, in which there was holy spring water.  The chapel was consecrated in 2009. </p><h2>  Iversky spring </h2><p>  This source was built in the 70s of the XVIII century.  It is located near the village of Diveevo.  Rev. Alexandra on the banks of the Vicchinsa River was digging a spring with her own hands.  It was designed so that workers could quench their thirst.  At that time, they mined stones for the construction of the Kazan Church.  The source was called Iversky, according to the icon of the same name, which was delivered here.  In the 60s the riverbed was changed.  This affected the source: it began to overgrow.  Soon, his name passed by inheritance to other scattered keys, which were located near the old cemetery.  In the people they were called the "Kirov source".  On Iversky Key, as well as on other springs of the village of Diveeva, there are wells and baths.  On Christian holidays, water is blessed here. </p><h2>  Female monastery in Diveevo </h2><p>  What to see in the village?  Local temples and cathedrals deserve special attention.  Seraphim-Diveevo Convent belongs to the local diocese.  Trinity Cathedral went to the church community in 1989.  Later, a cross was erected here.  A rainbow shone in the sky that day.  Soon the main aisle was consecrated, and worship services resumed here.  Since 1991, services have been performed in the Diveyevo Cathedral every day.  Currently, a huge number of pilgrims annually come to this holy land.  The groove of the Mother of God is located near the monastery.  In this holy place miraculous healings are performed. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Diveevo is the fourth inheritance of the Virgin.  Here is especially revered her groove.  It is believed that the Queen of Heaven itself passed through this place.  Along the grooves, everyone who comes to Diveevo must pass.  According to the covenant of Seraphim of Sarov, a prayer to the Theotokos is read here. </p>
