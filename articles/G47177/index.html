  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY fur crafts: interesting options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It only seems that DIY craftsmanship is difficult to do.  If you know the intricacies of such work ‚Äî how to sew the elements together, how to make a fluffy pompom, how to attach the blank to the base of leather or felt, then it‚Äôs quite simple to make a soft toy or an original decoration.  You do not need to buy fur separately, there is always an old coat with a fur collar or a children's faux fur coat in the house from which the child has long grown.  They carefully cut the fur from the clothes, trying not to damage the skin, and cut out the necessary part from this material. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to make crafts from fur with your own hands, and photo samples.  These are soft toys made of natural or artificial fur, women's jewelry and key chains on a bag or purse, as well as an original heart as a gift to a loved one for Valentine's Day.  For work you will need improvised materials, necessary tools and a glue gun. </p><h2>  Chicken Keychain </h2><p>  To sew such an article of fur with your own hands, you will need two mugs of different sizes.  Cut the workpiece carefully with scissors, bending the fur hairs inward.  Sew pompons with kapron thread using a thin needle.  Prepare a sintepon or a piece of foam to fill the internal cavity of each pompom.  In small stitches, they sew a circle of fur and at the end tighten the thread tightly, having previously inserted the filler.  Two balls are formed in this way: one small - for the head, and a large - for the image of the body. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fur toy" class="if uuid-3159939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3159939.jpg"></div><p>  Next, the details of crafts from fur are sewn together with their own hands.  Chicken legs and beak are cut from orange felt and fastened with durable stitches in selected places.  It remains only to sew round black buttons-eyes.  If you made a soft toy for your child, then it is already ready.  If you want to make a key chain for a purse or a briefcase for your daughter, then a metal ring is attached to the top of your head and a carabiner or eyelet is fastened from a bright thread. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Heart beloved </h2><p>  A cute accessory will not only be pleasant as a gift for the holiday, but also warm your loved one‚Äôs hand in your pocket on cold February days.  You can sew a fur heart both from natural and from artificial material.  It is more convenient to use a template for cutting fabric.  Two identical elements are cut out and stitched together with a seam over the edge.  So that the fur does not interfere, it is carefully straightened.  If he accidentally falls between the stitches under the thread, he is pulled out with a needle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="real fur heart" class="if uuid-3159945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3159945.jpg"></div><p>  Sew two cut hearts on the wrong side, leaving a small hole for the filler.  Then they turn the blank up with the fur up and fill the inner void with a synthetic winterizer.  It remains only to sew up the hole and attach the ring for hanging the keys. </p><h2>  Toy gnome </h2><p>  You can make such a fabulous gnome as a craft from faux fur with your own hands.  The step-by-step photo shows all the necessary details of the toy, so it will be easy to complete the task.  For the body of a fairy-tale character, an old wool sock or a cut-off sleeve from an unnecessary sweater is used.  On the one hand, a durable knot is tightened, and on the other hand, any cereal is poured.  In our sample, this is rice, but you can use round peas, beans, lentils or buckwheat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="faux fur gnome toy" class="if uuid-3161794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3161794.jpg"></div><p>  After the body is full, tie the second knot on the opposite side.  A square is cut out of kapron stockings or old tights, filled with cotton and tied with a tight pompom.  This will be the character‚Äôs nose.  It is strengthened on a bag with groats.  A fur triangle is sewn from below.  This is a gnome's beard.  It remains to sew a triangular cap from felt and decorate it with beads, beads or lace inserts.  The toy gnome is ready! </p><h2>  Brooch made of fur </h2><p>  Let's look at another piece of leather and fur.  You can make a beautiful brooch with your own hands from just a few pieces of natural fur and leather-cut flowers according to the pattern.  In order for the craft to keep its shape well, a thick plastic circle can be inserted between the skin layers, for example, cut it out of an old bank card or use a children's chip.  Fasten the clasp there. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="brooch made of fur" class="if uuid-3159966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3159966.jpg"></div><p>  Bonding is done with a glue gun or thick PVA glue.  To make fur balls voluminous, they are smeared with glue and filled with pieces of finely chopped skin.  In order for them to be smooth on the back, until the filler dries, they are laid out on a flat glass surface. </p><h2>  Necklace </h2><p>  If you string together large beads with faces and fluffy pompons on a fishing line, you get an original necklace that can be worn in winter cold even on a sweater. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beads with fur pompons" class="if uuid-3159951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3159951.jpg"></div><p>  How to make fluffy pompons from natural fur, you already know, it is enough to stitch a circle of fur with stitches with strong nylon thread and tighten it on a knot.  It is interesting to make all pom-poms for a necklace of the same diameter, but the craft will look beautiful with a decrease in size as it moves away from the center point of the jewelry.  The necklace is decorated with fur only in front.  The back is a chain with a clasp. </p><h2>  Original beads </h2><p>  The main value of the following jewelry lies in the fur medallion and pendants.  It will require accessories in the form of metal cones, beads and a beautiful twisted cord.  In the center, a carved medallion with a large pebble in the center is attached to the fur.  You can diversify this craft in every possible way, depending on the materials that you can purchase at the sewing accessories store. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="original fur locket" class="if uuid-3159947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3159947.jpg"></div><p>  It is better to take natural fur, otherwise over time, artificial hairs will become disheveled and ugly. </p><p>  DIY crafts from fur, the masterclass of which is briefly described in the article, is just a fraction of what can be made from such material.  Imagine and create for your pleasure! </p>
