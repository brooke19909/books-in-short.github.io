Suddenly at the end of last year, the crisis prompted Russians to travel around their home country.  In every major city, cultural life is in full swing: local history museums, exhibitions of contemporary art and folk crafts, theaters and concert halls open their doors to all comers. </p><h2>  The capital of the Volga region </h2><p>  On the banks of the <span>Volgograd reservoir</span> is Saratov - the educational, economic and cultural center of the Volga region.  The city was founded in 1590 and at first served as a watch fortress.  In the second half of the 18th century, trade in salt and fish, and later grain, was in full swing in Saratov.  Since the twentieth century, the city is considered the largest on the Volga, although it is not a millionaire. </p><p>  A huge leap in development occurred after the opening of the railway in July 1871.  Then, thanks to the construction of several steam mills, Saratov took the first place in the flour and oil mill industry.  By the end of the 1920s, in terms of indicators, the city noticeably overtook neighboring Nizhny Novgorod, Kazan and Samara, therefore it was secretly called the capital of the Volga region. </p><h2>  Closed city and our time </h2><p>  During the war years, many factories, as well as military schools, were evacuated <span>to Saratov</span> .  Until the early 1990s, the city was closed to foreign visitors due to the presence on its territory of defense industry enterprises, in particular the Saratov Aviation Plant.  For this reason, hotels in Saratov, at low prices, were not in special demand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, Saratov is one of the most attractive cities for business.  In addition, the best personnel are delivered by the country's oldest university, SSU.  Several theaters, a circus, a conservatory and a philharmonic society, exhibition halls, galleries, museums and a huge number of architectural monuments - the cultural life of the city surprises with its diversity. </p>

    <p>  The tourism industry has changed a lot over the past twenty years.  Some hotels <span>in Saratov</span> operate according to international standards, so spoiled travelers will not even notice the difference.  If the dates of the trip are known, then it is better to book a room in advance. </p><h2>  Hotel "Mirage" </h2><p>  Saratov is a large city, which means that the problem of traffic jams is inevitable for it.  An excellent accommodation option is a cozy hotel on the outskirts, which can be easily reached by a bypass road. </p><p>  For some guests, this location is a minus.  However, such inconveniences are compensated by spacious rooms and relatively low prices.  Reviews indicate possible noise from the restaurant, but it depends on the room.  Guests also note occasional housekeeping. </p>

    <p>  Especially popular in the Mirage is the water complex, which consists of five saunas and pools.  In addition, cedar phytobarrel, a solarium, billiards, dancing, water aerobics and yoga will definitely not let you get bored. </p><h2>  Children's holiday </h2><p>  At the hotel, you can often hear children's laughter, because there is nothing easier than to arrange a fabulous birthday with an incredible master class.  First, for the kids, they will hold a lesson with the preparation of Italian pizza.  Then the whole company will go to a large pool, where, under the supervision of professional animators, it will splash and have fun in warm water. </p><p>  The cost of a three-hour holiday is 10 thousand rubles.  It is very important that the water heating and filter are constantly working in the pool, sanitization is regularly carried out, which means that you can not worry about the health of the kids. </p><h2>  Hotel chain "Mirage" </h2><p>  Sokol (Saratov) - a hotel that is part of the Mirage network, is half an hour from the city center.  The proximity to the forest promises fresh air, conducive to long walks. </p><p>  The infrastructure of the complex involves holding business meetings in one of two conference rooms.  Sokol staff can also arrange a coffee break or lunch break. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The minimum cost of accommodation is 600 rubles.  The standard quadruple room has a separate toilet and shower, TV and fridge.  Apartments will cost the most.  The cost of double accommodation in them is 4400 rubles.  The price of all options includes breakfast (buffet). </p><h2>  Holiday in nature </h2><p>  Recently, newlyweds refuse from traditional ceremonies in the registry office, preferring a beautiful exit registration.  Few <span>hotels in Saratov</span> offer such a service. </p><p>  The large territory of the Sokol hotel allows you to easily organize a celebration with a banquet.  A magnificent arch and a path strewn with rose petals - photographs on the background of a picturesque forest will for a long time remind of the happiest day in the life of the spouses. </p><p>  In summer, a city camp for children opens at the hotel and recreation complex.  Not all parents have the opportunity to take a vacation or send their child for three months out of town to their grandmother, so this offer is in constant demand. </p><p>  From early morning until evening, children have at their disposal a swimming pool, a games room, a sports ground, various activities and excursions, educational trips to the forest.  A ten-day shift with three meals a day will cost 8,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Downtown </h2><p>  The Volga Hotel is located in the very center of Saratov.  This is a definite advantage over other hotels in the city.  Seeing a beautiful historic building, guests are looking forward to the same interior decoration, but are a little disappointed. </p><p>  The fact is that the Volga has long been in need of major repairs, as many reviews of guests say about this.  A standard room will cost 2800 rubles, you will have to pay 3900 rubles for a suite. </p>

    <p>  The most expensive room is equipped with air conditioning and a flat-screen TV.  Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel. </p><p>  However, the Volga Hotel has its advantages.  As we already said, this is an ideal location in the heart of Saratov, not far from a pedestrian street with various cafes and boutiques.  Guests also note the hospitality and responsiveness of the staff. </p><h2>  "Volga" </h2><p>  There are <span>hotels in Saratov,</span> where you can’t get a <span>cheap</span> vacation.  The luxurious complex of the same name is located in the neighboring city of Engels.  Despite the modern appearance of the building and luxurious repairs, the history of the hotel with the original name "Central" dates back to 1938.  In wartime, the hospital was located here, and after the hotel again began to receive guests.  In 1954, self-government bodies decided to change the name - “Volga”. </p><p>  Today the complex offers nine accommodation options.  The cost of a single standard room is 2850 rubles.  The most expensive wedding number will cost 15 thousand rubles.  A luxurious room with a wide bed is prepared for the newlyweds.  The sleeping area is combined with a small living room, one of the two bathrooms is equipped with a large jacuzzi. </p><h2>  The pearl of Saratov </h2><p>  If you prefer comfort, then the best place to stay is the Pearl Hotel (Saratov, Cathedral Square, 12).  The modern 7-story building is located near the popular city park "Lipki". </p><p>  At the request of the guests, the hotel management organizes the order of railway and air tickets, as well as a transfer from the station to the place of residence.  Free parking is available on site for independent travelers. </p><p>  Most of all, the concept of the complex is suitable for a business trip.  In the conference room for 53 people, you can organize an important meeting, and a stable Wi-Fi signal throughout the hotel allows businessmen to always be in touch. </p><p>  Do you like Hotel Pearl?  Saratov is a wonderful city for weddings, and plan the best banquet with the help of a partner of the Grand Hotel (event &amp; wedding).  Creative managers will come up with and implement the original idea of ​​celebration.  Scenery, flower decoration, selection of a leading event and a photographer, fireworks and even small souvenirs for guests - the newlyweds can completely trust the professionals from the Grand company.  A wedding on the territory of this hotel complex will be remembered for a long time by the newlyweds and guests of the celebration. </p><h2>  Pearl Reviews </h2><p>  Despite the obvious advantages of hotel accommodation, some guests still noted the shortcomings.  So, there are problems with cleaning the rooms.  However, the advantages of the hotel completely compensate for minor flaws. </p><h2>  "Olympia" </h2><p>  Hotel "Olympia" (Saratov, st. Chernyshevsky, 61) is located in one of the central areas of the city.  Monuments and cultural sites, a sports complex and shops are within walking distance.  Most of the rooms offer beautiful views of the Volga, which many guests consider a great advantage of the hotel. </p><p>  According to a number of Olympia guests, the hotel would be nice to update a bit.  The rooms, with the exception of the categories "luxury" and "apartments", lack air conditioning.  The staff of the hotel complex is well aware of all the shortcomings and tries, as far as possible, to organize the most comfortable stay. </p><p>  Guest reviews mark the coordinated work of the Olympia hotel team, but many are still upset by the technical equipment.  Nowadays, a weak Wi-Fi signal can spoil the impression of a trip, because guests simply can not share their impressions on social networks. </p><p>  The minimum cost of a double room is 2400 rubles (breakfast is included), the suite will cost 3900 rubles. </p><p>  Hotel Olympia (Saratov) offers special conditions when placing with children.  In addition, do not rush to refuse to travel with animals - this issue can always be discussed with the hotel management. </p><h2>  Unusual hotels in Saratov </h2><p>  In addition to standard hotels, this city has unique establishments.  Do you know why many travelers like Venice (Saratov)?  The hotel is decorated in Italian style: soothing beige tones, exquisite furniture and original interior details make the rooms luxurious and at the same time cozy. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel volga" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/754171.jpg" width="600"></div>
