Increasingly, there is talk in Russian society that wealthy people should pay more to the budget of the country than others, because they have expensive apartments, planes, cars, and yachts. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The UK is considered the homeland of luxury tax.  In this country, to ensure a decent life for the royal family, <span>taxes</span> were imposed <span>on pets,</span> carriages, horses, dogs, which were paid exclusively by the rich. </p><h2>  Russia also wants to learn from the experience of the West </h2><p>  In this regard, parliamentarians have already prepared a bill that obliges our moneybags who own expensive foreign cars to contribute three times more to the state treasury than those who drive ordinary cars. </p>

    <p>  In other words, very soon a luxury car tax will start to operate in our country.  Moreover, the deputies have repeatedly prepared draft laws on this subject, but for a long time they could not agree on how the legal act will be implemented in practice. </p><p>  As a result, the Russian president had to speed up the <span>legislative process,</span> and he succeeded.  In the very near future, car owners will juggle with a new term called the luxury transport tax.  All amendments to the <span>by-laws</span> have already been made and entered into force. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In this regard, many owners of "iron horses" are interested in a list of cars that fall under the luxury tax.  Let's consider this question in more detail. </p><h2>  What factors will be taken into account when determining the amount of tax </h2><p>  How will the luxury tax be calculated?  Cars that fall under it will be determined based on cost.  Fiscal authorities will be interested only in those cars, the cost of which is at least three million rubles.  In this case, the year of manufacture of the vehicle will be taken into account. </p>

    <h2>  Calculation Method </h2><p>  So, if the price of a car whose age does not exceed twelve months varies from 3 to 5 million rubles, then in this case the coefficient is 1.5. </p><p>  In the case when one year has passed from the date of manufacture of the car, but the “iron horse” is not two years old, a coefficient of 1.3 is applied.  If the machine is in the age range of two to three years, then a coefficient of 1.1 should be taken into account. </p><p>  If the cost of a vehicle manufactured no earlier than sixty months ago is from 5 to 10 million rubles, then factor 2 must be taken into account. </p><p>  If the price of the “iron horse” is in the range from 10 to 15 million rubles, and more than 10 years have passed since its manufacture, then the tax is calculated at a coefficient of 3. They propose a similar rate for cars costing from 15 to 20 million rubles.  In this case, we are talking about those cars that are under 20 years old. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  It should be noted that although indirectly, the method of determining the size of a luxury car tax has remained dependent on such criteria as engine power (the transport tax rate calculated on the basis of the amount of horsepower is multiplied by the "luxury" coefficient). </p><h2>  Auto List </h2><p>  As already emphasized, many fans of fast driving want to see a list of cars that are subject to a luxury tax. </p><p>  It should be noted that the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Russia has already assigned the status of "luxury" to almost two hundred vehicles.  Among them were cars of the following brands: Rolls-Royce, Lamborghini, Bentley, Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz.  However, this is not a complete list of <span>cars.</span>  <span>A</span> luxury <span>tax</span> will be introduced next year.  At the same time, owners of expensive “iron horses” are glad that they have some more time left. </p>

    <p>  So, a detailed list of cars that fall under the luxury tax is published on the official Internet portal of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Russia. </p><h2>  What is the fate of hybrid models </h2><p>  It should be noted that in Russia hybrid variants of cars, for which there are tax exemptions in most European countries, will be included in the list of "luxury" cars on an equal basis with others.  Of course, we are talking about the most expensive models, such as, for example, Mercedes <span>S 400</span> Hybrid, Audi A8 2.0. </p><p>  Those who are particularly interested in the list of cars that fall under the luxury tax should know that it will be subject to annual adjustment.  Officials said they would monitor prices for basic models of vehicles at least twice a year in order to timely display the average price based on their configuration. </p><h2>  Expert opinion </h2><p>  At the same time, a significant part of experts, having studied and analyzed in detail the list of cars that are subject to a luxury tax, came to the conclusion that the introduced law is still far from perfect, and it will not be able to cope with its function.  The main problem is that the tax amount will vary from region to region.  As a result, for example, driving in an expensive Lexus car in Kabardino-Balkaria will not be unprofitable, while traveling on it along the roads of the metropolitan metropolis will be a very, well, very expensive pleasure. </p>

    <p>  Before introducing a <span>tax on luxury</span> cars, a list of which can be viewed on the website of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, officials must decide how they will calculate the cost of “iron horses”.  If the starting price is taken as the basis, then hypothetically dealers can reduce it by allocating certain functions as a separate line of expenses.  For example, a car with all accessories cost 3,100,000 rubles.  Now it can be purchased for 2,990,000 rubles, but the cost of wheels or rubber mats is not included in this amount, and they will need to be purchased separately. </p><p>  Nevertheless, officials are optimistic, and they are fully confident that they will be able to track all the gray schemes of buying and selling vehicles.  They specially developed a table of average prices. </p>
