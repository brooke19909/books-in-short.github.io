    <p>  According to legend, the village of Kolomenskoye was founded by immigrants from Kolomna in very old times.  Modern historians believe that they escaped from the army of <span>Batu Khan</span> in the 30s of the XIII century. </p><p>  The first mention of Kolomensky in written sources dates back to 1236 - Ivan Kalita ordered his estate to be transferred to the heirs of Kolomenskoye near Moscow. </p><p>  At the time of Aleksei Mikhailovich Kolomenskoye is in full bloom.  The unusually beautiful wooden palace built at that time was considered a miracle of wooden architecture.  It has not survived to our time, however, according to ancient drawings, a copy of this structure was built. </p><p>  Rising snow-white temples cannot but cause admiration.  The estate presents historical values ‚Äã‚Äãthat were brought here from different Russian regions.  For example, a Polovtsian woman.  This monument in the distant past was placed over the burial mound, where the Polovtsian warrior rested.  And today it can be seen on the estate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Borisov Stone brought here is a sign that was installed at one time on the border of Tsar Boris‚Äôs possessions. </p><p>  <strong>Section 3.

    <p>  Voices ravine in the estate - a place that is described as something mysterious.  Its length is about 1 km.  According to legend, he received his name in honor of the pagan deity Volos.  At the bottom of the ravine you can see stones that were altars.  In the vicinity, archaeologists discovered traces of ancient settlements that date back to the 1st century.  BC. </p><p>  According to one legend, in the XVI century a detachment of the Horde rescued after a defeat in the battle.  On the way they had a Kolomensky ravine.  Having descended into it, the Horde disappeared.  Once again they were seen only after 50 years! </p><p>  In the XIX century, a mystical incident happened to peasants from a neighboring village.  Deciding to shorten the path, they went down to the ravine and found themselves in clubs of dense fog.  After that, a corridor suddenly appeared before them, and before their eyes appeared people overgrown with wool.  The peasants managed to get out in a few minutes, and in real time their journey lasted 20 years!  It is believed that in these places the legendary <span>library of Ivan the Terrible</span> is hidden - Liberia.  And in the VII century.  here, a whole nation seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth. </p><p>  It should be noted that today the Kolomenskoye estate offers the most diverse excursions, however, many visitors prefer to go for a walk along the park‚Äôs alleys on their own.  Perhaps they still hope to fully solve the mystery of this place. </p>
