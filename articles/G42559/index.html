    <h2>  Compulsory insurance </h2><p>  Each owner of the car, along with the rest of the documents must have a CTP.  This is <span>compulsory motor third party liability insurance.</span>  Thanks to policies, all drivers are thus protected.  If a traffic accident occurs, then insurance of the guilty party of the accident shall be paid to the injured party to restore the vehicle.  And if harm was done to health, then for recovery. </p><p>  In this type of insurance, a system is in place to encourage drivers to crash safely.  Moreover, the measure applies specifically to the culprits of the accident.  It is implemented through KBM classes.  Let's learn what they mean and how they work. </p><h2>  KBM classes </h2><p>  MSC stands for <span>Bonus Malus</span> Ratio <span>.</span>  <span>The bonus is</span> received by the driver, who does not have an accident, the culprit of which is himself, but the malus, that is, a decrease in the coefficient, accordingly, gets the one who initiates the accident. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Trouble-free riding can last for many years.  But insurers, of course, are not interested in lowering the cost of the policy to zero.  Therefore, they provided a threshold after which the cost of insurance no longer decreases.  This is 50%. </p>

    <p>  There are drivers who follow all the rules of the road for many years and do not violate them.  It would be unfair if they had to pay as much as those motorists who almost do not recognize the rules on the road. </p><p>  So, the maximum ratio is 0.50.  To achieve this result, you do not have to get into an accident for 10 years. </p><h2>  Downgrade or loss of discounts </h2><p>  Even after receiving the maximum discount, you should not think that it is given forever without any conditions.  If the driver gets into an accident and becomes the culprit, the discount goes down to one, after which he will have to move for a long time to the coveted 50%.  But if the driver got behind the wheel recently and his discount is small, then as a result of an accident it will not only be reset to zero, but the cost of insurance will even increase. </p><p>  From the point of view of conscientious drivers, this is more than a reasonable measure: if you drive in such a way that you pose a danger to others, pay more for your insurance policy! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  A lot of accidents happen just because of the ineptitude or dishonesty of drivers.  Only such people will pay more only in those cases when they fall due to their fault in an accident.  Therefore, for minor incidents it would be much better for them to agree with the injured party and to settle the issue without calling the traffic police.  Then one will be satisfied, too (since there will be no need to spend time and nerves on interacting with the insurance company), and others (since the discount on the policy was and will remain the same). </p><p>  By the way, you need to know that CBM classes in compulsory motor liability insurance do not apply to trailers.  Also, it will not be taken into account if the policy is issued for a citizen of a foreign country or a vehicle for transit. </p><h2>  CBM Class for CTP: Table </h2><p>  So, focusing on the table below, you can calculate your KBM.  The horizontal line indicates the class of the driver at the beginning of the period of validity of the insurance policy.  Depending on the ride for the year (accident-free or with accidents, with subsequent insurance payments) for the next year, one or another class of CBM for OSAGO is assigned.  The table consists of fifteen classes, where "M", meaning "maximum", is assigned to the fines. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  What class gets the driver who first got behind the wheel? </h2><p>  In the first insurance year, the driver is assigned class 3.  Let us examine with this example how to understand the KBM classes.  The table, if you look at the first vertical row, contains a class, and if on the second - 1. This is its coefficient.  It turns out, KBM 1, class 3. What does this mean? </p><p>  If in this year of driving the driver does not get into traffic accidents (look at the third column), then in the next insurance period he will have a mb - 0.95, class - 4, respectively.  Then the discount will be equal to five percent.  However, if an accident occurs during this period, then it will be assigned class 2, where the MSC is 1.4.  Then you will have to pay 40% more for insurance. </p><p>  Beginners behind the wheel should be very careful, since with two or more accidents the KBM will become maximum and will be equal to 2.45.  But with the next year of trouble-free driving, the third class will return to the driver, and again he will not have to overpay for the insurance policy. </p><p>  A CBM of 0.5 means a maximum fifty percent discount.  But if such a driver has an accident, then he is assigned the 7th grade, which corresponds to a coefficient of 0.8. </p><h2>  A number of drivers are inscribed in OSAGO </h2><p>  If the <span>insurance policy is</span> issued for several drivers, the KBM is considered in a special way.  The largest coefficient is taken as a basis.  For example, if four drivers are included in the insurance, for three of them it is 0.7 and lower, but only one is 0.9, the insurance will be considered on the basis of the last KBM, that is, taking into account a ten percent discount. </p><h2>  KBM with unlimited insurance </h2><p>  If you intend to buy a compulsory insurance policy that can be used by an unlimited number of people, KBM is considered differently.  Based on the data of the car owner. </p><p>  It is important to keep in mind that if a policy was previously purchased for a limited number of people, and then it was decided to reissue it to an unlimited number of people, then it should be added separately to those people who were included in the policy with a limited number of people.  Otherwise, the KBM classes of the latter will be lost. </p><h2>  How to check the bonus malus coefficient? </h2><p>  Please note that KBM is not entered into a single database of the <span>Russian Union of Auto Insurers.</span>  It only contains information about previous car insurance.  But the coefficient is calculated and checked directly with the insurance company when the driver purchases the policy.  Insurance companies are required to apply the CBM classes for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, as well as enter information about accidents in which the driver in his car was a participant. </p><p>  Therefore, it is in the insurance companies where you can check the KBM and provide relevant information. </p>

    <p>  However, you can learn about this in other ways.  For example, by going to the PCA website and contacting the KBM database there.  To do this, you need to write down your VIN code or state number of the car and information about the owner. </p><p>  Rarely (as this is not an obligation), insurance companies indicate MSC in the insurance policy.  Therefore, sometimes it is sufficient to carefully study the document.  The number can be indicated opposite the name of each of the drivers or in special marks. </p><p>  On many sites today there are online calculators, with which you can easily calculate your KBM.  Thus, you can learn it yourself. </p><h2>  MSC Database </h2><p>  So, the insurance company takes the data for calculating the coefficient from the database of the <span>Russian Union of Auto Insurers.</span>  They are brought directly by insurance companies that insured drivers.  This feature should be remembered especially for those who decide to change their SC to another.  It is best for them to take a certificate from the previous insurance company where the KBM will be indicated.  The fact is that some of them may enter information at the wrong time or forget about it, problems with system loading and so on may also happen.  Therefore, it is better to play it safe and personally bring a document proving that you have a certain ratio so that you do not get it reset to "accidentally". </p><h2>  Discount Features </h2><p>  The following information should be considered in this matter. </p><p>  More recently, a discount for accident-free driving was attributed to a specific car.  When selling it and buying a new one, the driver had to re-start his insurance history.  When identifying the shortcomings of this system, it was decided to abandon it.  Now all the amount of how many KBM classes exist is directly related to the driver.  Therefore, it doesn‚Äôt matter what car he drives and in which insurance company he acquired the CTP policy.  The main thing is accident-free riding. </p>

    <h2>  Some questions that drivers often ask </h2><p>  Consider several separate situations. </p><p>  What to do, for example, to one of the drivers who is inscribed in CTP and has changed his driver‚Äôs license?  In the case of a valid contract, you should immediately contact the UK.  The policyholder shall notify the insurer in writing so that the latter makes adjustments to the information base of the Russian Union of Insurers. </p><p>  Another question for motorists is how KBM is determined if the insurance contract is not limited by the number of drivers, so that in the previous period the contract provided for restrictions on their number.  In this case, the SC assigns the class that is specified in the insurance contract.  How does the UK act if the situation is the opposite, that is, the previous insurance contract had no restrictions on the number of persons, and the new one was concluded on conditions with restrictions?  In this case, the insurance company is obliged to reduce the CBM. </p><p>  Class 3 - what does this mean for the driver?  In addition, this class is assigned to the one who first got behind the wheel, if the driver did not conclude a compulsory motor third-party liability insurance for more than a year, no matter what discount he had before, it burns out and he gets the class again, like he got behind the wheel for the first time.  That is, KBM 1, class 3. </p><p>  What does this mean for the driver if he does not provide full information about the accident at the conclusion of the contract?  Incorrect calculation will be detected by the system immediately.  Therefore, the insurance company in this case imposes penalties on the driver.  They are expressed in 1.5 KBM.  That is, next year the payment will increase by 1.5 factors. </p>
