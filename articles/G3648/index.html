    <p>  In the literature, the leader of the <span>Roman Empire is</span> almost always called the "Roman Emperor."  However, this is not entirely correct.  The fact is that the word "emperor" is a title, a very honorary title given to commanders after victories.  A title does not mean a position. </p><p>  Since the time of Gaius Julius Caesar, the head of state has always received the title of emperor.  At the same time, the title was assigned to other people.  However, the "Roman emperor" was originally a military leader, commander who celebrated a triumph over victory in the battle.  Subsequently, the title began to apply more to the ruler of the state.  In this regard, the country itself was called the empire. </p><p>  All Roman emperors were different people.  Some were wise rulers, others became famous tyrants, still others could act like real fools, and others brought in some innovations, sometimes not related to government.  So, for example, Adrian became the first emperor to grow a beard.  Up to this point, a shaved chin was considered the rule of good form. </p><p>  According to many historians, it was during the reign of emperors that the Roman state reached the heights of territorial and military power. </p><p>  Often, candidates for the throne conflicted.  Disputes were resolved, as a rule, on the battlefield.  In some cases, the Roman emperor achieved his goal.  However, not every ruler subsequently managed to maintain his position at the head of state.  So, some rulers could be on the throne for thirty years, while others could not hold out for two months. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be noted that the country did not have a clear pattern of transfer of power.  The Roman emperor appointed his son as the successor or (if there was no direct heir) selected the applicant from his immediate environment.  This imposed a rather serious responsibility on the candidate. </p><p>  <span>The first Roman emperor,</span> Gaius Julius Caesar Octavian (from 63 BC to 14 CE), was the adopted son of Gaius Julius Caesar.  "August" is a title that was assigned only to the gods.  Subsequently, the Roman emperors began to wear this title.  For the first emperor, the title "Augustus" became a middle name.  Subsequently, the descendants began to call him Augustus Octavian or simply Augustus.  It should be noted that this ruler did not want to be called a dictator.  August Octavian became a trailer (the first citizen), although the power in the state had unlimited power. </p><p>  For 400 years in the Roman Empire, there were several dynasties in power.  But only two of them, Caesar and Antonian, more than others contributed to the development and strengthening of the state. </p><p>  The "Golden Age" of the Roman Empire is considered the era of the reign of the Antonians.  In the state, power was transferred primarily to the adopted successor.  In 98, the best Roman <span>emperor Trajan</span> (Mark Ulpius) thus ascended the throne.  This ruler was famous for justice.  He strictly enforced the law in the country and helped the poor.  During the years of his reign, Italy began to provide herself with bread herself.  Thus, the country has ceased to be more dependent on supplies from Egypt. </p><p>  At the end of the 1st century, the <span>Praetorian Guard</span> began to possess great power <span>.</span>  She could overthrow or even kill at her discretion an objectionable ruler.  By the 2nd century, several armies had been formed in the Roman Empire that could choose emperors themselves. </p><p>  In the last years of its existence, the state was rapidly weakening.  In addition to the fact that the Western Roman Empire could not defend itself from external enemies, devastation reigned in the country.  Government officials, officials, emperors robbed the people.  Often, local residents, fleeing from the cruelty and injustice of their landowners, fled to the service of the barbarians. </p><p>  The last Roman Emperor, the young <span>Romulus Augustulus,</span> was deposed in 467 by the leader of the barbarian tribes.  From that moment, the Western Roman Empire fell, and the ancient era ended with it. </p>
