He served as a fortress during the Tatar-Mongol raids and wars with the Lithuanian-Polish invaders.  At all times, the Kremlin and fortified monasteries were a reliable outpost on the Oka borders of Muscovy.  It was <span>in Serpukhov</span> that Ivan IV, Boris Godunov, Vasily Shuisky and Ivan Bolotnikov gathered and based their troops.  Modern Serpukhov is a small administrative center with almost 130 thousand inhabitants.  It is located in a picturesque area on <span>the Nara River</span> , a hundred kilometers south of Moscow.  The presence of 150 enterprises and factories, more than 10 higher educational institutions, as well as a rich history and unique architecture led to the development of hotel infrastructure.  <span>Hotels in Serpukhov</span> can provide accommodation of different comforts and taking into account various financial possibilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Oka&quot; (Serpukhov)" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41210/1520019.jpg" width="600"></div>
