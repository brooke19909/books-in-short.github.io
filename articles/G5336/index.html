  <section class="page js-page"><h1>An act of acceptance of documents - an important document or formality?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The act of receiving and transmitting</span> documents is a type of official paper in which the transfer of business documents from one hand to another is recorded.  This document is an integral part of any contract concluded between contractors.  <span>The act is drawn up</span> at the request of the company, which needs such a paper. </p><p>  Like any other document, this official paper is legally binding.  So, if after the parties sign the <span>act of transfer and acceptance,</span> any disputes arise between the contractors over previously signed agreements, the court will necessarily take into account the presence of a correctly drawn up document of this format. </p><p>  It is important to note that the laws of our country do not provide for an officially established form of this paper.  Therefore, any enterprise has every right to develop a standard act of transfer and acceptance independently, while adhering to the recommendations of GOST 6.30 - 2003, which presents the positions that must be reflected in the document.  The act independently developed by the enterprise necessarily contains the following details: </p><ul><li>  name (title) of the document; </li><li>  <span>current date</span> and place of compilation; </li><li>  the full name of the enterprise that drew up the act of reception and transmission of documents; </li><li>  Name and position of the person directly involved in the preparation of this paper; </li><li>  full name of the company to which this act of acceptance has been addressed; </li><li>  Name and position of the person to whom this document is addressed; </li><li>  a list of documents that are transferred from one person to another person; </li><li>  <span>registration numbers that</span> are assigned to applications; </li><li>  signatures of responsible persons who transmitted and received paper; </li><li>  the imprint of the seal of the enterprise that drew up the act of receiving and transmitting documents. </li></ul><p>  Be sure to specify the number of copies of a document that are transmitted.  The greatest attention should be paid to papers transmitted in the original.  This is also reflected in the act in the event that the documents are lost and it is necessary to conduct proceedings in higher authorities.  Therefore, it is advisable to make copies of all transferred securities in order to avoid loss. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since this act is a bilateral document, it must be prepared in duplicate.  The first will remain with the company that prepared the document, and the second is transferred to the company for which the delivery-acceptance certificate is intended. </p><p>  <strong>Act of reception and transfer of cases</strong> </p><p>  During the audit, the employee who takes the case is not able to check the status of accounting in full.  And the retired chief accountant very often leaves behind a lot of unfinished work and mistakes made.  At the same time, the new chief accountant does not want to assume someone else's responsibility. </p><p>  The most obvious solution is inviting auditors.  On the date of the dismissal of the former chief accountant, they will conduct an audit and submit a full report on the financial condition of the company and violations identified by them.  But inviting auditors is an expensive affair; not every manager agrees to pay for their services, especially since the chief accountant may change more than once.  So most often the check is done on its own. </p><p>  For this, an act of reception and transmission is drawn up (the enterprise itself chooses the template).  The act must be signed by the head, the chief accountant transferring the cases, to those who accept the cases (the next chief accountant or the person performing his duties) and members of the commission.  Two copies of such an act are drawn up.  One is left in the accounting department of the company, the other is given to the one who transfers the cases. </p><p>  In fact, the act of acceptance of transfer of cases upon dismissal is a list of documents received and violations discovered during verification.  He reflects the state of affairs at the time of the transfer.  Typically, an act has two parts - general and basic.  Most often, such an act of reception and transfer of cases is made upon dismissal of the accountant and director. </p>
