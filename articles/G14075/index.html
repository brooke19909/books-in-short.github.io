    <h2>  Short hotel description </h2><p>  Port Eugeni 4 * (Spain) is one six-story building with a beautiful territory.  It belongs to rather large hotel complexes, as it offers to settle in one hundred rooms of three categories. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Hotel Port Eugeni 4 * in Spain was built in the second half of the eighties of the last century.  Over time, it ceased to meet modern requirements, which forced its owners to begin a long repair.  By the tourist season of 2017, <span>bars, a restaurant</span> and a reception were reconstructed.  The queue has not yet reached the number of rooms, however, most tourists believe that it is in good condition.  The design of the hotel is quite simple, but in this simplicity, many find a restrained charm, complemented by lush vegetation outside the window. </p><p>  Interestingly, in the Russian catalogs Port Eugeni 4 * (Spain) appears to be the "four".  But hotel guests say that on the signs located in the resort, it is indicated by three stars.  It is difficult to say who provides the most reliable and relevant information, but in our article we will talk about him as a four-star hotel complex. </p><h2>  Location of the hotel regarding the infrastructure facilities of the spa town </h2><p>  The hotel we are describing is located in a place called Cambrils.  Port Eugeni 4 * (Spain) was built in a former fishing village, which by the end of the twentieth century turned into a famous resort town, hosting more than several tens of thousands of tourists in a season. </p><p>  The Spanish tourist mecca is famous for its beaches and dishes of national cuisine, represented mainly by seafood.  According to the reviews of tourists, it is possible to judge that it is in Cambrils on the promenade that they serve surprisingly tasty fish prepared by the hands of local chefs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tourists will have to get to the Port Eugeni 4 * Hotel (Spain) in Cambrils from Barcelona Airport for quite a long time - more than two hours.  And this is not surprising, because you will have to overcome about one hundred and ten kilometers.  However, if you land in the city of Reus, then you will be separated from the hotel by only twenty kilometers, which can be covered in literally fifteen minutes. </p><p>  Hotel Port Eugeni 4 * in Spain is very close to other resort areas and various entertainment venues.  For example, tourists can walk to the center of Cambrils from the hotel complex on foot in five minutes.  Fifty meters from the hotel there is a bus stop, pharmacy, ATM and the like.  You need to take a taxi to the nearest nightclubs from the hotel, because these two points on the Cambrils map are separated by approximately two hundred and fifty meters.  However, many tourists claim that even night walks around the resort town are quite safe and bring a lot of positive emotions, so they advise everyone to walk on foot. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The hotel complex Port Eugeni 4 * (Spain / Costa Daurada) in Cambrils is located about two hundred meters from the city beach of Playa Regueral.  It boasts cleanliness, fine sand and an abundance of infrastructure.  Here you can have a bite to eat in several cafes, and also wash off salt in the shower. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Please note that sunbeds and umbrellas at Playa Regueral are paid, but beach towels can be taken on site without any restrictions.  Most of our compatriots who have already rested in Port Eugeni 4 * (Spain) in Costa Dorada, reviews about the beach left positive.  Everyone noted its beauty and convenience, because tourists do not spend more than five minutes of their time on the way to it. </p><h2>  The infrastructure of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Hotel Port Eugeni 4 * (Spain / Cambrils) in Costa Daurada boasts a fairly developed infrastructure located on its territory.  First of all, all guests noted a beautiful pool, which was successfully located on the top floor of the building.  Around the bowl there are many sun loungers and deck chairs, which vacationers usually occupy in the morning.  You can use them for free. </p><p>  For lovers of a beautiful tan, the hotel has an unusual terrace, which is located almost all day under the sun.  It is quite comfortable to spend time in the company of friends. </p><p>  If you plan to actively move around in the resorts of Spain on a rented car, the Port Eugeni 4 * hotel will offer you a car park for several dozen cars.  You can use it for free.  Each guest who needs a parking place receives a room that will belong to him throughout the rest of the stay in the hotel complex. </p><p>  You can rent a car or book an interesting tour for yourself at the reception.  Experienced staff will quickly pick up a good tour depending on your desires.  Please note that the luggage storage is located at the reception where guests leave bags that interfere with their room. </p><p>  If you have arrived at the hotel on business, then at your service are two conference rooms for up to two hundred people.  Here you can also rent equipment for events of varying complexity. </p><p>  The hotel has one bar and a restaurant, which we will talk about a little later.  It is interesting that guests can visit the reading room, where there are books in Russian. </p><p>  Sports lovers are a little frustrated by the lack of their own gym in the hotel complex, however, you can relax a bit while playing golf or billiards. </p>

    <h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  Each room has tiled floors, which is typical of Spanish hotels.  Apartments of any category have a TV with Russian channels, air conditioning and a refrigerator.  Guests can also use the safe at an additional cost. </p><p>  The bathroom is equipped with everything you need: bath accessories, a set of cosmetics and a hairdryer.  It is worth noting that maids change towels every other day.  Toiletries are replenished as needed. </p><p>  The number of rooms is represented by three categories of apartments: </p><ul><li>  Standard.  There are fifty-two such numbers; they do not exceed fifteen square meters in area.  They can comfortably accommodate two people. </li><li>  Superior.  Similar apartments are also designed for two, they have an area of ‚Äã‚Äãseventeen square meters and a small balcony. </li><li>  Family  These numbers are among the most luxurious, there are only eight of them in the hotel.  They consist of two rooms with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãtwenty-two squares.  Four people can live in such apartments at the same time. </li></ul><p>  I would like to note that the rooms are decorated in quite calm and restrained tones, sharply contrasting with the lush Spanish nature. </p>

    <h2>  Check In Rules </h2><p>  Please note that the hotel does not allow check-in with pets.  They must stay at home waiting for their owners. </p><p>  Guests are populated from two in the afternoon until almost twelve in the morning.  Departure is issued from ten in the morning until noon.  If desired, tourists can use the early check-in service. </p><h2>  Port Eugeni 4 *, Spain: guest reviews </h2><p>  I would like to note that reviews about the hotel on the Internet are quite controversial.  Some guests were delighted with the rest, but others did not recommend it to their compatriots.  What is the reason for such discrepancies? </p><p>  Surprisingly, most vacationers noted the same facts in their comments, but for some it was a plus, and for others a minus.  We decided to voice them in the article, and we will leave the conclusions to you: </p><ul><li>  the hotel is extremely simple; </li><li>  food does not cause either censure or enthusiasm; </li><li>  the staff is extremely friendly, but despite this, they are in no hurry to solve the problems of their guests; </li><li>  Internet works at low speed; </li><li>  many rooms overlook a quiet patio and do not have a balcony; </li><li>  there is a safe in the room, but it is locked with a key, which is very inconvenient; </li><li>  guests do not always receive new bedding (often there are holes in it); </li><li>  in some apartments there are no toiletries at all, which is unacceptable for the Quartet. </li></ul><p>  Once again, we will not draw any conclusions about the hotel, because each review is purely subjective.  On the Internet about this hotel complex there are a lot of positive reviews to consider it good and comfortable.  However, negative comments indicate certain flaws in the Port Eugeni administration.
