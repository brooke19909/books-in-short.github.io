    <h2>  How to get to the city </h2><p>  The first question that arises for those planning a trip is: "Where is Vyborg Castle (Vyborg), how to get to it?"  There are several options, each of which we will discuss separately. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first option, how to get to the city and visit the Vyborg castle, is to take an excursion.  In this case, you will not need to think about how to plan a route.  A one-day bus excursion from St. Petersburg costs about 1300-1500 rubles (for pensioners, schoolchildren and students - 1150-1350).  Buses often leave from <span>Dumskaya Street</span> ( <span>Nevsky Prospekt metro station).</span>  Excursions usually include visits to <span>Monrepos Park</span> and the castle, as well as a walk through the old town. </p><p>  The second option is to go here in your own car.  From St. Petersburg, the road will take about 1.5 hours, but there is a chance of getting into traffic jams. </p><p>  Another option is the bus.  They leave from the Parnas metro station about once every half an hour (route number 850), and from Devyatkino every 1.5 hours.  Travel time is a few hours.  A ticket will cost you a little more than 200 rubles. </p><p>  You can use the rail.  The suburban train departure interval is about two hours, and the ticket cost is about 300 rubles.  There are also fast trains, the road on which is reduced to an hour ("Swallow" and "Allegro").  They all depart from Finland Station. </p><p>  Alternatively, you can sail by boat or yacht directly to the castle.  Of course, not everyone has their own ship, but you can rent it.  There are various offers for cost, route and number of people both in Vyborg and in St. Petersburg. </p><h2>  Road to the castle </h2><p>  Now let's talk about how to get to the castle in Vyborg from the railway station (by the way, the bus station is located near it, so this route is also suitable for those who arrived by bus).  First you need to go to Leningradsky Prospekt (from the railway station to the right).  Go straight and you will find yourself on the promenade with a beautiful view.  In summer, a fountain beats directly from the water.  After a little more, you will see a large area on the left.  Various souvenirs are often sold here (in fact, its name speaks for itself - Market Square).  Here is the famous round tower, which is one of the oldest buildings in Vyborg.  However, we will not linger here for long.  The first thing to do is visit the castle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Soon you will notice its tall tower, on which you will navigate.  Notice that we need not the first, but the second bridge (Fortress), so the first one needs to be passed.  Most newlyweds pass along the Fortress Bridge, so here you will see many locks. </p><p>  From here we finally get to Castle Island, where a completely different world opens up to us.  If you do not get distracted by photographing and admiring the city, a path of 1.5 km will take about 20 minutes. </p><h2>  Castle history </h2><p>  It must be said right away that Vyborg Castle is the only monument of European medieval architecture in our country that has survived to this day.  The history of its construction begins in 1293.  It is believed that it was then that Vyborg itself was founded. </p>

    <h2>  Vyborg castle: history </h2><p>  The founding of the city took place during the Third Crusade, which the Swedes organized in order to obtain Karelian land belonging to Novgorod at that time.  During the campaign, Marshal Torgils Knutsson, the then ruler of Sweden, captured Western Karelia.  In the occupied territory, he ordered the construction of a powerful fortress, which Vyborg is still proud of.  A medieval castle arose on the site where the Karelian-Novgorod fortified point was previously located.  Marshal defeated him, after which the Swedes began the construction of the fortress. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Since then, Torgils Knutsson is considered the founder of the city of Vyborg, as well as Vyborg Castle.  No wonder not far from the latter, on the Old Town Hall Square, a monument was erected to him.  However, I must say that some historians question the fact of the personal participation of this marshal in the campaign, although it was he who organized the expedition to Karelia. </p><p>  The Swedes have chosen the place for the fortress very well: island hill, granite rock.  The island position also ensured the presence of a water barrier, so that it was possible not to dig a moat.  For the next 400 years, the castle of Vyborg became the stronghold of Swedish rule on the Karelian Isthmus.  It was inferior in strategic and military importance only to Stockholm and was on a par with Kalmar castle. </p><h2>  Etymology of the name "Vyborg" </h2><p>  It is not known exactly about the etymology of the name of the city and fortress.  "Vyborg", according to the main versions, is a "fortress by the bay" or "holy fortress".  It is the latest version that is the most common, since the letter from King Birger speaks of the construction of a temple in honor of the Most High and Most Holy Virgin. </p><h2>  First phase of construction </h2><p>  At the first stage of construction, the castle of Vyborg consisted of a fortress wall covering the entire perimeter of the island‚Äôs elevation.  In the center of the wall was a massive serrated quadrangular tower of St. Olav (pictured above).  It was named after Olaf II - one of the most revered saints in Scandinavia, the Norwegian king, baptist and fighter against paganism.  This tower was in no way connected with the walls of the fortress.  She was a dungeon, standing separately in the center.  Incidentally, <span>this dungeon</span> at that time was the highest in all of Scandinavia.  In the basement of the tower of St. Olav prisoners were kept and stored supplies, and on the second tier were the quarters of the governor with his retinue.  It was here that the Swedish king stayed during his visits to the city. </p>

    <p>  Archaeological excavations have shown that the thickness of the walls of the St. Olav‚Äôs tower was 4 meters, and the Vyborg fortress was 1.5‚Äì2 meters.  A wooden hinged gallery passed along the perimeter of the fortress wall (the so-called military course, or patrol track).  On the hill of the island, protected by these walls, the first buildings of Vyborg were formed.  The population of the city soon expanded, and the Castle Island was already small.  Vyborg stepped over to the mainland, to a cape located on the eastern shore of the strait. </p><h2>  Attempts to return the city </h2><p>  The Novgorodians tried to capture the castle and return the lost lands in 1294 and 1322, but these attempts were unsuccessful, despite the fact that in 1322 the assault was carried out using a progressive method (stone-throwing machines were used).  The border between Sweden and Novgorod land along the Orekhov peace, concluded in 1323, passed along <span>the Sestra River.</span>  The Swedish kingdom received the western part of the Karelian Isthmus. </p><h2>  Castle under Karl Knutsson and his successors </h2><p>  In the castle in the 15th century (when Karl Knutsson was governor) appeared residential buildings several stories high.  They culminated in a vaulted voyage on the sides facing the city and the bridge.  Around the same time, the Shoemaker‚Äôs tower was erected.  During the reign of Karl Knutsson, the castle acquired a special splendor and gloss.  New chambers were built, ceremonial rooms for balls and festivities, knightly halls were updated, the 3rd floor of the main building, which was previously intended only for defense, was rebuilt. </p>

    <p>  The construction did not end there.  After Karl Knutsson left the castle, work continued to be carried out by his successors - Eric Tott and Sten Sture.  At this time, the castle remained the residence of the governor, as well as the center of the administrative and political life of Vyborg.  In the southeastern corner, the Tower of Paradise was built - the first round tower in the castle (pictured above).  Tiled stoves appeared in its premises.  The walls of the St. Olav‚Äôs tower were decorated with wooden panels from the inside, and the castle‚Äôs upper courtyard was paved with stone. </p><h2>  Eric Tott's contribution </h2><p>  Eric Tott became the head of the fortress in the middle of the 15th century, and then the 4th floor of the main building was turned into a residential building.  The fifth floor appeared, intended for defense.  Tott during the reconstruction of the castle used the traditions of defensive architecture, adopted in Northern Europe.  Before the frequent fires that ruined the splendor of the castle, its layout and appearance were in the style of the early Renaissance.  Tott surrounded Vyborg with a stone wall with towers (on the peninsula in front of the fortress).  So, Vyborg Castle gradually took the rear position of the fortress.  The Town Hall Tower, as well as the later Round Tower, are the only parts that have survived to this day. </p><h2>  "Vyborg Thunder" </h2><p>  Vyborg in September 1495 was shocked by an event that went down in history as the ‚ÄúVyborg Thunder‚Äù.  The Russian-Swedish war began just this year, and Ivan III decided to send his troops to storm the Vyborg Castle.  For the first time, large-caliber guns were used to destroy walls.  Two towers collapsed, unable to withstand the attack, and another one broke.  The Swedes, led by the military commander Knut Posse, survived the siege, despite the Russian application of the latest technology and their numerical superiority.  According to one version, the military commander ordered his people to set fire to the powder mixture (maybe barrels of resin), and then to blow up some of the fortress towers.  Smoke and deafening thunder confused the besiegers, and they retreated. </p><p>  The siege of the city was lifted, military operations were soon suspended.  And legends began to circulate about the Vyborg explosion.  Knut Posse was even credited with magical abilities.  For example, it was claimed that during the siege he made a ‚Äúhellish potion‚Äù in a huge cauldron.  There was also a version that when the Swedish troops already wanted to lay down their arms, the St. Andrew Cross suddenly appeared in the sky.  The Russians were frightened at the sight of him and took to flight.  Another fantastic version says that there was a Smelenen cave in the city, which made a terrible roar as the enemy approached. </p><h2>  Construction continued </h2><p>  The main tower in 1564 became a seven-story building (previously there was only the lower square part).  The upper part now has an octagonal shape with cannon loopholes cut into the walls.  Thanks to the loopholes, it was possible to conduct circular fire.  Note that in the masonry of the dungeon at this time, brick was first used. </p><p>  According to the Stolbovsky peace, concluded in 1617, the border of the possessions of the Swedes significantly advanced deep into the Novgorod lands.  The border and military importance of the city of Vyborg decreased, so the castle began to be used as a prison.  The territory of the city until the 18th century belonged to the Swedes.  At this time, the castle was strengthened and completed. </p><h2>  Vyborg after the capture of the city by Peter I </h2><p>  Peter I, after a long siege and bombing, took Vyborg on June 3, 1710. But the Swedes were in no hurry to leave the city.  Swedish dominated Vyborg until the 19th century. </p><p>  The city and Vyborg castle after being captured by Russian troops were destroyed.  Their condition was deplorable.  Only after the <span>Nishtadt peace</span> signed in 1721, <span>which</span> finally fixed the borders, did peaceful life begin to improve in Vyborg.  Intensive restoration work began in the castle.  But in the second half of the 18th century, he found himself between the Annensky fortifications and the Horned fortress, reliable defensive structures, and therefore lost its former military significance.  The castle began to be used to house the Russian garrison. </p>

    <p>  The further history of the city was also difficult.  It went to the Finns in 1918, but during the Russo-Finnish War (1939-1940), Soviet troops took it.  But just a few years later, at the beginning of World War II, Vyborg again crossed over to Finland. </p><p>  Then, since 1944, it first belonged to the USSR, and then to Russia.  Currently, the State Museum "Vyborg Castle" is located on an island with a fortress.  It was founded on July 13, 1960. At the end of the 20th century, museum workers had to face difficulties.  The fact is that the tower, located on the edge of the cliff, began to settle.  One reason for this is seismic impacts, and the other is heavy transport.  The issue is currently resolved. </p><p>  We will now tell you that interesting things can be seen in the castle. </p><h2>  St. Olav's Tower </h2><p>  Tourists get a lot of emotions from climbing this tower.  In order to climb up, it is necessary to overcome 239 steps of a fairly steep staircase.  This requires some physical preparation, but the reward will not take long, so go ahead!  Rising, you can admire the views opening from the windows.  Upstairs you will find stunning views of the bay and the city. </p><p>  You can get around the tower from all sides.  You will see the city with its interesting architecture, unusual for Russia.  Multi-colored roofs of various shapes create the flavor of Vyborg.  From here you can see the Transfiguration Cathedral, and the clock tower, and other attractions. </p><h2>  Museum "Vyborg Castle" </h2><p>  Having visited the expositions of this museum, you will delve into the peaceful and military history of the region, in the life of the inhabitants, and also learn the details about the construction of the castle.  Here you will find a collection of customs confiscated goods, since the city has long been a border crossing point.  A separate exposition is dedicated to the nature of the Karelian Isthmus, where Vyborg is located.  The most valuable collections of the museum are paintings and sculptures by V.V. Kozlov and L.A. Dietrich, ceramics and a numismatic collection. </p>
