What it is?  These products appeared in Russia not so long ago, but many are interested in them.  What exactly?  What should I pay attention to with this phone?  How does he stand out?  Understanding all of this is very important.  Only then will it be possible to fully understand what a particular telephone is.  Accordingly, everyone will be able to decide for themselves how much this product meets expectations. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  "Land Rover A8" is a new generation smartphone.  He is much different from his "brothers."  This is a completely new word among technology.  The characteristics generally converge with most ordinary smartphones, but in appearance and shock resistance - no. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="land rover a8" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1428040.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Most often this product is used by athletes.  And there are reasons for that.  The Land Rover A8 has all the features of a modern smartphone.  You can take photos and make calls.  But what in general is it?  What should future buyers pay attention to? </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  <span>A review of the Land Rover</span> A8 <span>phone</span> should begin with a display.  It is to him that they pay attention in the first place.  After all, the breakdown of this component leads to the inability to work with the gadget. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What about the screen?  It is not too big by modern standards.  The diagonal is only 4 inches.  But as buyers say, this is enough to comfortably use all the features of the phone. </p><p>  But the display resolution does not please many.  It is small - only 800 by 600 points.  Nevertheless, taking into account the diagonal of the device, this is enough to watch videos and pictures in good quality. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of the phone is that the "Land Rover A8" uses the display protection technology "Gorilla Glass".  We can say that the screen is very problematic to damage the device.  And all this thanks to this technology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Land Rover A8 phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1428032.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Dimensions and Design </h2><p>  What's next?  The following two components are not so important, but they also pay attention.  It's about the design and size of the device.  It should be noted that the dimensions of the Land Rover A8 phone are not too different from most modern smartphones.  This gadget is smaller and thicker.  Nevertheless, reviews indicate that it is quite convenient to operate such a phone.  Even in a small hand.  The dimensions of the smartphone: in length it is 138 millimeters, in width - 69, in thickness - 21. </p><p>  The design of the device is attractive.  After all, outwardly, the Land Rover A8 smartphone looks non-standard.  One gets the impression that the phone is equipped with additional armor, which forms the design.  There are several colors: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  the black; </li><li>  green; </li><li>  Orange. </li></ul><p>  Accordingly, there is plenty to choose from.  It should be noted that in appearance the smartphone resembles not just a touch screen, but really a phone.  It is a non-standard "appearance" that often attracts potential owners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="land rover a8 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1428031.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Phone memory is another pretty important feature.  There are two of them in smartphones.  There is operational, there is built-in.  The first is responsible for the overall power and performance of the gadget.  Its very few.  Especially for a modern device.  Total RAM in the ‚ÄúLand Rover A8‚Äù 512 MB.  That is why many owners indicate that this is not about a gaming smartphone.  On it, almost no game will start.  Only outdated.  But this is not such a problem.  Especially if initially the consumer is not looking for a phone for games. </p><p>  Built-in memory is a place reserved for user documents.  Smartphone "Land Rover A8" has it not so much - only 4 GB.  But at the same time, you can increase this figure by another 32 GB by connecting an additional memory card.  Reviews indicate that this place is enough for work.  There are no memory shortages. </p><h2>  Operating system and processor </h2><p>  What else does the Land Rover A8 have?  A characteristic that, together with RAM is responsible for the power of the device, is the processor.  It is not too powerful for the studied product.  But buyers and owners do not express a clear negative.  The thing is that the processor capacity is 1.2 GHz.  This component is designed for 2 cores.  In general, the smartphone power is 2.4 GHz.  Enough for work and some games. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The operating system here, as the owners say, is quite old.  In principle, taking into account all other characteristics, it can be considered the corresponding power of the smartphone.  Mobile phone "Land Rover A8" offers to use the "Android" version 4.2.  It is easy to guess that the latest in the mobile gaming industry will not start here.  It is not recommended to reinstall and update the OS - the phone will not pull newer versions of Android.  This fact must be taken into account. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone land rover a8" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1428030.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  "Land Rover A8" is a new generation smartphone.  But judging by the characteristics, it is significantly inferior to its modern "brothers."  Nevertheless, standard functions are available in it.  For example, a camera. </p><p>  The cameras in the gadget 2 are front and rear.  As practice shows, this phenomenon pleases buyers.  The first camera does not shoot very well, but for a selfie or video call this will be enough.  It offers a resolution of 1.3 megapixels.  The rear is intended for the main shooting.  And she shoots with a resolution of 5 megapixels.  Not too much, but not enough. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of this smartphone is that the camera shoots perfectly in motion.  Capturing photos and videos is wonderful.  In capable hands, such a phone will delight you with bright, clear and high-quality images.  Standard features like flash and face recognition technology are provided. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Special attention is required to the battery of the studied phone.  He, as they say numerous reviews, only pleases buyers.  Perhaps, while a small number of smartphones can boast of their stamina.

Many owners of the device emphasize that even with long and active use, you can not worry - the gadget will still respond to the commands sent.

    <h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  From all the foregoing, we can conclude that we are talking about a sports smartphone.  This fact is confirmed not only by a good case with protection, but also by the "stuffing" of the device.  The thing is that numerous reviews indicate that additional applications for athletes are installed in the operating system.  They do not leave indifferent ordinary people. </p><p>  For example, you can find among the standard functions a flashlight, pedometer, barometer, height meter, compass.  All this, as you might guess, is useful to every athlete.  And for the average owner, these applications will be a good entertainment.  All this is installed by default in the "Land Rover A8". </p><p>  There is also Wi-Fi, GPRS, GPS.  Do not forget about the technology of wireless bluetooth data transfer.  True, the version is a bit outdated - 2.1.  This means that "heavy" files will be transferred for a long time.  Not too big a flaw, but reviews are sometimes emphasized. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  What is included in the standard package of the device?  This feature does not apply to characteristics, but potential buyers are interested in it quite often.  There are no complaints in this area. </p><p>  In general, the configuration of the Land Rover A8 can be called standard.  In the box with the phone itself, you can find a battery, a branded sticker on a smartphone, a charger and a cable for connecting the gadget to a computer.  In addition, headphones are included in the package of delivery, which is very pleasing.  By the way, the phone has a standard headset jack for 3.5 millimeters.  This allows any headphone to be used with the Land Rover. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="land rover a8 characteristic" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1428033.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost of the device is also pleasing.  On average, the Land Rover A8 will cost the buyer 8-9 thousand rubles.  This is not too much if you think about the many advantages of the phone.  There are disadvantages like power, but they are not so important.
