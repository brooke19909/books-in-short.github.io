    <p>  The back cover covers not only the back of the case, but also the side faces of the phone.  It is made of matte plastic.  As many owners of the Highscreen WinWin phone note (reviews about this device are presented in large numbers on thematic online portals) - the material of the back cover is very pleasant to the touch, the surface of the corresponding element is resistant to dirt.  The marked details determine, in fact, also the color of the device.  So, at the disposal of the user Highscreen WinWin - black and yellow elements of the corresponding type. </p><p>  The main camera is also located in the back of the case, and an LED flash is located to the right of it.  Also in the same area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe phone is the main speaker, on top of it is a grid.  The batteries of the device are removable, they are located under the plastic panels.  Under them are slots for additional microSD memory cards, as well as for 2 standard-format SIM cards. </p><p>  The power button is located on the right side of the phone, on the left is the volume control key.  At the top there is a port for connecting a USB cable, as well as a 3.5 mm audio jack.  There are no functional elements in the lower end of the case.  The microphone is located on the front panel of the device - in the corner at the bottom right. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ease of use and ergonomics: reviews </h2><p>  What do users say about the comfort of using the Highscreen WinWin smartphone?  Reviews from mobile electronics enthusiasts indicate that the device is primarily characterized by excellent ergonomics.  Its body is wonderfully placed in the hand.  The modest dimensions also contribute to the comfort of using the device: with the thumb you can easily get to any device controls or the desired section of the sensor on the display. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Now, actually, about the characteristics of the screen.  The Highscreen WinWin phone is equipped with a 4-inch display, its matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using IPS technology.  The screen resolution of the device is 800 by 480 pixels.  Pixelization on the display is minimal, it is almost invisible.  The picture is displayed perfectly.  If you tilt the device to the right or left, the image quality practically does not drop, but with similar up or down movements, the picture may slightly change color, a little inversion is added.  But this is acceptable, according to many experts, since the phone in question belongs to the budget category and is also sold in one of the lowest price segments. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Consider the characteristics of the software that is installed on the phone Highscreen WinWin.  User reviews indicate that the choice of this device by many people is due to the presence of the Windows Phone OS on it.  Its main advantage, in particular over Android, is that in many cases it does not require a high-performance processor and large amounts of RAM to achieve a high speed device.  When comparing two phones of the same class with similar characteristics of hardware, as a rule, the one that is controlled by Windows Phone is usually faster. </p>

    <p>  The interface of the corresponding operating system on all types of devices is almost the same - because Microsoft does not welcome the ‚Äúcustom‚Äù modification of OS controls by device manufacturers.  In this sense, transferring from one device running Windows Phone to another is extremely simple.  The mechanism for installing and managing applications on devices will also be almost the same. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that for users of the Highscreen WinWin smartphone (the reviews of many device owners characterize this feature exclusively on the positive side) mobile versions of popular office programs are available - Word, Excel, PowerPoint, as well as the OneNote application.  The functionality of the corresponding solutions, in general, allows you to perform all the basic operations on documents as on a computer.  In principle, the same file formats are supported as are typical for Microsoft Office programs installed on a PC. </p><h2>  Work with SIM cards </h2><p>  Like many other modern mobile phones, this device supports working with 2 SIM-cards at the same time.  Using the Windows interface, you can choose which one to call to a particular number.  This is convenient from the point of view of optimizing the cost of cellular communications: it often happens that it is cheaper to call a particular subscriber from one operator than from another.  If necessary, you can modify the elements of the corresponding interface to the personal needs of the owner of the device. </p>

    <h2>  Iron and performance </h2><p>  The processor installed in the Highscreen WinWin smartphone is the 4-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 MSM8212 chip.  It was made as part of the 28 nm process technology.  It operates at a clock frequency of 1.2 GHz.  It is equipped with a graphics module Adreno 302. The smartphone has 512 MB of RAM and 4 GB of internal flash memory. </p><p>  Such characteristics, especially in terms of RAM, would have looked very modest on devices running Android OS.  However, in this case, the smartphone runs on Windows Phone, for which the corresponding "filling" is quite acceptable.  Users do not experience significant problems with launching basic applications and games, working with key elements of the Highscreen WinWin interface.  The review of this device has been written by more than one specialized portal, and each time, experts involved in compiling relevant analytical materials say that the phone‚Äôs performance is at a good level. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The smartphone is characterized, as users note, by high quality sound reproduction - this applies to both the conversational module and the speaker, designed to work in hands-free mode or play music in the room.  The sound is quite loud and saturated.  Like many other mobile phones, the device in question has separate speakers for talking and playing multimedia. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The device is equipped with a 5-megapixel camera, equipped with autofocus and flash.  As users and experts note, the quality of the images is generally good, although not ideal in the individual components, since the phone still belongs to the budget category and the photographing technology is not implemented in it the most advanced.  At the same time, according to experts, the smartphone‚Äôs camera provides good color reproduction.  Thanks to the flash, you can take pictures under any lighting conditions.  As many users note, it‚Äôs easy enough to use the camera interface of the Highscreen WinWin smartphone.  An instruction that would explain in detail the nuances of operating this hardware component is not needed. </p>

    <p>  The quality of videos shot using the device is quite average.  But a lot, as experts say, depends on the actual shooting conditions.  If you conduct them in good light, in a calm environment, not on the run, without jerking the device - it is quite possible to achieve good video quality. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  The phone supports the main popular interfaces - Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.  The experts and the owners of the device themselves do not note any difficulties in using them, everything functions stably, data transfer is ensured in a timely manner and without significant malfunctioning of the interfaces.  Regarding standard functions - voice calls, SMS - users and experts do not reveal any flaws in the smartphone.  Connecting the device via USB-cable to other devices is also carried out without any problems. </p><h2>  Computer connection </h2><p>  It can be noted that the device implements standards by which a smartphone user can exchange data between his device and a computer on which a ‚Äúdesktop‚Äù version of Windows is installed.  Using this software, the user, while at the PC, can view files, download them to a PC or, conversely, download from a computer to a phone. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery life of the phone is 2 thousand mAh, which allows the device to work without recharging at an average operating rate of about a day.  If you use the device only in game mode, then it will last about 5 hours, with continuous video playback - for 5.5 hours.  In general, the corresponding indicators look quite worthy against the background of competitive models in the budget price segment. </p><p>  Evaluation of the autonomous operation of any mobile device in most cases will be, one way or another, subjective.  The fact is that the intensity of using smartphones and tablets for each gadget lover will be individual, as well as the type of software used.  In this sense, it is quite difficult to determine some averaged criteria.  Judging by the reviews on thematic online portals, the owners of the device in question are generally satisfied with the observed indicators of the battery life of the device. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Phone Highscreen WinWin - inexpensive (about 3800 rubles), and at the same time, a very functional and productive device that can provide the basic needs of a modern user.  Of course, in some components, such as the quality of the camera, it will be inferior to leading models from the largest world brands.  However, in terms of performance, communications, display quality, camera performance and sound reproduction, the device is quite competitive. </p>
