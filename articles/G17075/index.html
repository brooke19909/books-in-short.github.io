Which ones are worth a visit?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Denmark does not appeal to either white sand beaches or a climate suitable for sea holidays.  Prices are pretty high.  This small country will not impress you with high-tech wonders, will not please you with sales.  Nevertheless, tens of thousands of tourists from all over the world arrive in Denmark annually.  And they are attracted not by the sea or gastronomic tours, but by castles.  Denmark in its small territory has placed more than 500 fortresses and palaces.  Powerful Roman fortifications, gloomy <span>Gothic castles,</span> luxurious residences in the Renaissance style - most of these attractions of the country are accessible to tourists.  Some fortresses are in ruins, others have been carefully restored.  There are also castles that are converted into hotels.  In this article we will talk about the most interesting fortresses and palaces of the country.  Which of them belong to the category of ‚Äúmast visit‚Äù? </p><div class="photo" data-original="handluggageonly.co.uk" data-author=": " data-source="https://handluggageonly.co.uk/2016/03/02/10-fairytale-castles-you-will-want-to-visit-in-denmark/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Castles of Denmark" class="if uuid-2472426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2472426.jpg"></div><h2>  Kronborg </h2><p>  This Danish castle is a must visit for anyone who is in love with Shakespeare.  Indeed, it is in Kronsborg, which is located in Elsinore, that the drama "Hamlet" unfolds.  The gloomy and mysterious atmosphere of the castle will make you feel like a prince of Denmark or Ophelia.  But there is a local legend about this residence in the style of the Dutch Renaissance.  It is said that Ogier, an ancient warrior, who will certainly wake up when Denmark is in danger, is sleeping in a hidden dungeon.  Getting to Kronsborg is easy.  Electric trains run from Copenhagen to Helsingar (Shakespeare's Elsinore) every twenty minutes in the afternoon and once an hour in the evening.  Travel time is 45 minutes.  From the train station to the castle go with a quarter of an hour.  The walk is sure to stretch, because the beautiful city deserves to wander around it.  Entrance to the castle costs 90 crowns (about 915 rubles).  Indeed, in Kronsborg there is an exposition of the Maritime Museum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.royalhistorian.com" data-author=": CarolynHarris, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kronborg Castle Denmark" class="if uuid-2472429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2472429.jpg"></div><h2>  Egeskov </h2><p>  Of all the castles in Denmark, this one is the most beautiful.  It was as if he had left the illustration for the fairy tale of the beautiful princess.  Egeskov is surrounded on all sides by water reflecting the sky.  Once on the island of Funen, where the castle rises, there was an oak grove.  It was cut down to clear a building place, but the memory of it remained in the name.  After all, ‚ÄúEges-kov‚Äù is translated as ‚Äúoak grove‚Äù.  Rounded towers, a fuchsia castle park with a green ‚Äúmaze‚Äù, openwork cornices - it seems that this Renaissance residence was created specifically for the beautiful princess to live there.  But this impression is misleading.  And a person familiar with the defenses of antiquity will immediately understand this.  Double walls, drawbridge, narrow loopholes - the castle withstood more than one siege.  But the interiors of Egeskov are designed in the style of the Renaissance.  You can stroll through the suites of halls lined with furniture of that era, and in the former barn admire the exhibition of retro cars.  To visit the Egeskov, you need to get to Funen Island, take the train in Odense to the Kwaerndrup, and from there drive to the castle by bus number 920. The entrance ticket costs 2230 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.thousandwonders.net" data-author=": Larry Myhre, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Egesque Castle Denmark" class="if uuid-2472431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2472431.jpg"></div><h2>  Valle </h2><p>  It should immediately be warned that this castle is privately owned by the diocese, so tourists have been ordered to enter the interior.  But Valle is so beautiful that he does not lack visitors.  It is located near Koge, a city on the island of Zealand.  When the castle of Valle was founded, no one really knows.  The first written mention of it dates back to 1256.  But those buildings that you can admire today belong to the 16th century.  Then the castle was inherited by two daughters of Olof Rosencrantz, who divided it into separate parts.  Since then it was owned by women.  En-Sophie, the second wife of King Frederick IV, ordered the establishment of a boarding house for girls from noble families.  Abbess could only be a high-born aristocrat who made vows.  But now this castle is used as a place of residence for women of ordinary origin, who for some reason are not connected by family ties.  Entrance to the courtyard and the residence park is free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="da.wikipedia.org" data-author=": " data-source="https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vall√∏_Slot"><img itemprop="image" alt="Valle Castle" class="if uuid-2472447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2472447.jpg"></div><h2>  Rosenborg Castle </h2><p>  In order to admire the magnificent residences, you do not even need to travel outside the Danish capital.  At the beginning of the 17th century, King Christian IV ordered the construction of a castle on the outskirts of Copenhagen for his family to live.  Several generations of monarchs lived here.  But already in 1838, Rosenborg Castle turned into a museum accessible to mere mortals.  But the residence did not lose touch with the royal family.  All regalia of the rulers of Denmark, crowns, jewels and a collection of artifacts are exhibited here.  Entrance to Rosenborg costs about 1100 rubles.  The royal garden, which annually attracts about 2.5 million visitors, is no less interesting for tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": holeinthedonut, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rosenborg Castle" class="if uuid-2472449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2472449.jpg"></div><h2>  Dragsholm Castle (Denmark) </h2><p>  Old mansions in the Gothic style are often associated with ghosts and other incorporeal spirits.  And if you want to plunge into an atmosphere full of mysticism and secrets, go to Dragsholm.  This Danish castle is located in the west of the country.  It has been known since 1215.  True, at first it was the house of the canons.  Due to the successful strategic location, the building was taken from the church and converted into a fortress.  The name "Dragsholm" itself means "Island of Resistance."  The castle received such an honorable name after it stood in front of the army of Count Kristoffer.  Then there was a royal prison for prisoners from aristocratic families.  For a long time the residence was privately owned by the Adeler clan.  Legends circulate about the Dragsholm castle.  They say that about 300 ghosts live there - deceased in prison, immured by the ruthless fathers of their daughters, who died under strange circumstances maids. </p>
