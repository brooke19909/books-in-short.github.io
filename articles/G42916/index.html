Advice</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Apple brand products have long established themselves in the mobile device market as high-quality and high-tech electronics.  However, the lucky owners of elegant iPhone phones may be disappointed by the fact that their cellular device, in general, is practically not protected from the harmful effects of water.  <span>An oleophobic coating</span> will not save an expensive cellphone from prolonged ‚Äúrainy procedures‚Äù and the onslaught of liquid from a filled bath.  And so the question: "What if the iPhone fell into the water?"  pretty relevant.  We‚Äôll make a reservation right away: only your promptness and clear-cut actions will help to avoid the fatal outcome of unforeseen ‚Äúwet‚Äù circumstances.  Not just superfluous recommendations and sound humor of the story will magically make you, dear reader, a tech-rescuer.  So get ready for reincarnation! </p><h2>  Tip # 1: Food for Thought, or Pilaf from iPhone </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What to do if an iPhone falls into the water?" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/605393.jpg" width="450"></div></h2><p>  Various Internet resources (in global manifestation) vying to offer to try a miracle recipe for the restoration of "wet" mobile equipment.  It is worth noting that this option is not without meaning, but certainly not suitable for iPhone devices.  Since the rather hermetic case of the stipulated model will call into question the success of the enterprise, which can be briefly described with the phrase: ‚Äúdrawing moisture from the bowels of the device with the help of ... rice‚Äù.  Since the modern panacea (according to all the same sources), which solves the difficult question of "what to do if an iPhone fell into the water", is this very cereal.  It is believed that its grains have fantastic properties, "reincarnating" recessed and washed phones.  The irony is not appropriate only if the device that has undergone drowning is first disassembled and completely immersed the system board in fig.  However, processing by special equipment will also be the final part of the recovery process.  Draw your own conclusions: is it worth filling a mobile phone with rice cereal and languishing in anticipation (rice technology gives a result only after 12-48 hours), likening Pinocchio from a famous fairy tale? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tip # 2: Specifically explaining what to do </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="IPhone fell into the water" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/605396.jpg" width="507"></div></h2><p>  If an iPhone falls into the water, the first thing to do is to turn it off.  The plan for further action is as follows: </p><ul><li>  No need to shake the cellphone and try to "squeeze" out of it the remnants of the penetrated liquid. </li><li>  Wipe the device dry and, using improvised means, try to unscrew the two end screws that are located at the edges of the system connector of the device. </li><li>  After releasing the back cover of the device from the fixing elements, slide this housing part up and lift it up. </li><li>  Carefully unscrew the two mounting bolts of the frame that secures the battery connector. </li><li>  Remove the battery before disconnecting the terminal from the contact pad on the phone motherboard. </li></ul><p>  This is the main thing to do when the iPhone fell into the water.  Next, you should contact a specialist or independently take a series of actions to restore the performance of the ‚Äúdrowned man‚Äù. </p><h2>  Tip # 3: Your Technical Upgrade </h2><p>  In the previous paragraph, the phrase ‚Äúimprovised means‚Äù was mentioned, which could be a <span>penknife, a</span> fastener with sharp edges or the key to the apartment.  As you probably understood, the priority action at the time of the adverse effects of water is the promptly conducted process of powering off the phone.  Since life-giving moisture in this situation completely loses all its ‚Äúmagic‚Äù properties - this is a real death for unprotected electronics.  Therefore, in order to be fully equipped in case of an unforeseen "state of emergency", for the sake of wisdom, purchase special Apple screwdrivers, which - believe me!  - more than once needed.  After all, our life is incredibly dynamic, and the repetition of the situation ‚ÄúiPhone fell into the water‚Äù is only a matter of time ... </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tip # 4: For those who have accepted recommendation # 3 and are self-confident </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What to do if iPhone falls into water?" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17415/605394.jpg" width="570"></div></h2><p>  Decide on a self-made repair to clean the inside of the device from traces of water ingress is easiest for a man than a representative of the weaker sex.  However, a technically savvy woman will easily cope with the solution of a generally simple task - dismantling the case of a mobile device. </p><ul><li>  Before proceeding with the practical implementation of the scenario: ‚ÄúWhat should I do if an iPhone falls into the water?‚Äù, Find a video to disassemble your iPhone model specifically. </li><li>  Prepare the workplace and tool. </li><li>  You will need alcohol and a brush (of small sizes) to clean the internal case space and components on the phone board that has been exposed to water or its other derivative. </li><li>  After you disassemble the phone with due attention and accuracy, treat each component on the board with alcohol.  Using a prepared brush, thoroughly clean the device from moisture. </li><li>  Using a household hair dryer, dry all components and structural parts of the machine. </li><li>  Reassemble, making sure that at the end of the process there are no "extra" spare parts. </li></ul>

    <p>  You can be congratulated: now you know what to do if the iPhone 5 falls into the water.  However, the principle and algorithm of the recovery process remains unchanged and is literally identical for the entire line of iPhones.  Only some design features should be taken into account during the repair process, which you can easily learn about by looking through the pages of the corresponding information resources. </p><h2>  Tip # 5: Troubleshoot </h2><p>  After you have safely assembled your device, the question: ‚ÄúWhat should I do if your iPhone fell into the water?‚Äù, Most likely, it will seem simple in terms of its implementation.  However, it is too early to draw conclusions, since it is necessary to verify the operability of the device. </p>

    <ul><li>  Launch your phone. </li><li>  Connect the charger.  If it does not charge, you are unlikely to avoid a visit to the workshop.  Do not try to fix the situation yourself.  This is a troublesome business. </li><li>  Check the sound quality and functionality of the <span>touch panel.</span>  If you find any defects, consult the above advice. </li><li>  Make a test call and ask your interlocutor how you can hear.  In general, drive "risen from the abyss." </li></ul><h2>  Tip # 6: Diving Property Accessory </h2><p>  What to do if you drop your iPhone in water, you now know.  However, it will not be superfluous to purchase a special cover that prevents moisture from entering the device.  The benefit of such accessories today on sale there are many - for every taste and color.  The reliability and quality of such products often depends on the price.  Due to the fact that the iPhone is far from a cheap pleasure, you should not save on the safety of the operational moment. </p>

    <h2>  Final tip: for the ‚Äúreassured‚Äù </h2><p>  Do not be fooled if you purchased the supposedly ‚Äúwaterproof‚Äù iPhone 6 novelty. The only barrier to the liquid in the sixth model was the rubberized flippers in the form of a constructional addition to the navigation buttons of the device.  The system connector, speaker and polyphonic speaker are still open to the "water element".  Therefore, you should not be overly naive and pointless to hope that you will never have the question: "What if the iPhone fell into the water?"  Believe me, despite the real opposite, a <span>bitten apple</span> will still drown.  Take care of your iPhone, it's worth it! </p>
