It was independent of the Government, which is why it was called Freedom.  The special position and rights of the organization were confirmed by each successor of Catherine II at her accession to the throne.  And even more than that, quite often the Free Economic Society received impressive amounts from the treasury for the implementation of its ideas. </p><h2>  Purpose of the Free Economic Society </h2>

    <p>  At the source of the organization's organization was a whole group of courtiers representing the interests of liberal-minded noblemen and scientists, headed by M.V. Lomonosov.  At that time, these people put forward very revolutionary ideas: </p><ol><li>  Monetary development. </li><li>  The growth of industrial production. </li><li>  Abolition of serfdom. </li></ol><p>  True, <span>Elizaveta Petrovna,</span> who ruled then, did not support them.  And only Catherine II allowed to begin the implementation of the project and encouraged him in every way.  The Free Economic <span>Society has openly</span> declared the primacy of the interests of the state, which should be developed based on effective economic activity. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  And now in the distant 1765, finally, the <span>Charter of the organization</span> was adopted <span>.</span>  The establishment of the Free Economic Society contributed to the solution of the tasks of "increasing the national prosperity in the state by bringing the economy to a better state."  The first step was to hold a competition among 160 specialists from various countries.  The main theme was the distribution of land ownership to the owners to maximize the benefits of their country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="goal of a free economic society" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/446598.jpg" width="394"></div>

    <h2>  Publishing and educational activities </h2><p>  The members of the organization tried to convey their work on the intensification of agricultural production, increasing the industrial power of the state and many other topics to the widest possible masses of the population.  The Free Economic Society of Russia published both monographs and periodicals.  The organization‚Äôs library consisted of almost two hundred thousand monographs, and in the collection of Zemstvo publications there were more than forty thousand copies of brochures and books.  At different times, such important thinkers of the Russian Empire as <span>I.F. Kruzenshtern,</span> A.M. Butlerov, G.R. Derzhavin, D.I. Mendeleev, N.V. Vereshchagin, P.P. Semenov-Tyan were <span>members of the Society.</span> -Shansky, V.V. Dokuchaev, A. and L. Eulers, A.S. Stroganov, V.G. Korolenko, L.N. Tolstoy, A.A. Nartov, A.N. Senyavin and many others. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Contribution to the country's defense </h2><p>  The First World War forced to mobilize everything that was in the Russian Empire.  The Free Economic Society did not stand aside.  In its structure in Moscow, a special unit was created for the needs of the troops - Voentorg.  His tasks included providing officers who were directly involved in the hostilities with various goods at reduced prices. </p><h2>  Crash and rebirth </h2><p>  The activities of the IEVO structures were greatly undermined by the World War and subsequent revolutions.  And after the events of 1917, the organization of economists in Russia ceased to exist.  Work resumed only after many years.  In the seventies of the last century, the restoration of a public association of leading economists began.  At this time, the need arose to improve the economic activity of the state.  It was then that economists organized their own organization - NEO.  The newly formed Community carried out work throughout the country.  Already in the late eighties, the transformation of NEO took place.  It became known as the All-Union Economic Community. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="establishment of a free economic society" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/446601.jpg" width="320"></div>
