Biography, books</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In this article, we will present a rather controversial author, whose creations have been closed to a wide range of readers for quite some time.  One of the reasons is the marginality of his theories.  Many researchers explain the originality of the ideas put forward by him and the author‚Äôs emotional breakdown.  All this is about Plato Akimovich Lukashevich.  We will present his dossier, a brief biography, the main theories, a list of books popular today. </p><h2>  Dossier </h2><p>  Platon Akimovich Lukashevich - one of the Russian ethnographers.  In addition, he is considered in scientific circles as the author of a number of marginal theories, an amateur linguist. </p><p>  Here is the dossier of Platon Akimovich Lukashevich: </p><ul><li>  Date of birth: unknown.  Presumably, he was born in 1809. </li><li>  Citizenship: Russian Empire. </li><li>  Place of death: Poltava province, Pereyaslavsky district, Berezan. </li><li>  Year of death: 1887. </li><li>  Main activity: linguist, ethnographer. <div class="photo" data-original="www.tart-aria.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lukashevich Platon Akimovich books" class="if uuid-2871323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/2871323.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Information about the biography of Platon Akimovich Lukashevich is extremely scarce.  It is known that he studied at the Nizhyn gymnasium.  There, one of his comrades was the famous Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol. </p><p>  Later, Platon Lukashevich moved to the Richelieu Lyceum.  What is he famous for?  This is one of the most famous higher educational institutions of Odessa.  It was created in 1817 by decree of Alexander the First.  In 1865, the Richelieu Lyceum was renamed the Imperial Novorossiysk University.  Where does such an unusual name come from?  It is given by the name of the Governor of New Russia A. E. de Richelieu, whose initiative the institution owes its existence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ethnographic Studies </h2><p>  Let us return to the personality of Platon Akimovich.  His biography stands out in 1836.  Then he published the first work - a collection of songs "Little Russian and Chervonno-Russian."  The book noted that Little Russian song is in decline.  It is replaced by the Great Russian and even the soldiers. </p><p>  Another ethnographic study of Lukashevich - "Amusements and remarkable customs of Little Russians for Christmas and New Year" (1826). </p><div class="photo" data-original="narodosnova.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lukashevich Platon Akimovich writer" class="if uuid-2871318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/2871318.jpg"></div><h2>  Linguistic research </h2><p>  But the collection of songs is not the most discussed work of Platon Akimovich.  Of great interest to modern readers is his writings on the proof of marginal theory.  Namely: the linguist and ethnographer claimed that the language of the ancient Slavs was the original language of primitive people. </p><p>  10 books of Platon Akimovich Lukashevich are devoted to this topic: </p><ul><li>  "An example of the Slavic all-around enchantment in the word" husband ". </li><li>  "Charomutia or the sacred language of magicians, sorcerers and priests." </li><li>  "Korneslov Greek language authorship by Plato Lukashevich." </li><li>  "The key to cognition in the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world of direct meanings in the numerals of the first 10 according to the Slavic all-around charomutia." </li><li>  "Examples of Slavic all-around enchantment of astronomical calculations with explanations for the reverse reading of the alphabets and letters of the Coptic and Greek languages." </li><li>  "A study of the great year of the sun and its numerical representation on the basis of natural astronomy (a preliminary introduction to microscopic astronomy and the calculation of planets based on its base, as well as on the ninefold natural count)." </li><li>  "Korneslov Latin of authorship by Platon Lukashevich." </li><li>  "Explanations of the Assyrian names." </li><li>  "Korneslov Jewish language authorship of Platon Lukashevich." </li><li>  "Imaginary Indo-German world. True education and the beginning of languages: English, German, French and other Indo-European." </li><li>  "The reasons for the hatred of the British towards the Slavs." </li><li>  "The main laws of observational and natural astronomical metrology, microscopic astrology, isolated from calculations of the formulas for the light of celestial bodies, number species, their natural divisions, called" measures of time ", extensions, and also the calorific value that appears on the surface of these bodies due to a lower or higher speed their shifts based on a ninefold (differently, natural) count. " <div class="photo" data-original="www.liveinternet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian linguist" class="if uuid-2871324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/2871324.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Contemporary Reprint </h2><p>  For many years, the works of the Russian linguist were unpopular.  According to other sources, they were simply closed to the general public.  The situation changed in the 2000s - in the 2008-2009s, the publishing house "White Alves" re-released two works of Lukashevich: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  "Decoding of proto-languages. Ancient Russia and Ancient Assyria" (the author's name of the work is "Explanations of Assyrian names"). </li><li>  "Charomutia or Sacred Tongue ..." </li></ul><p>  Some of the books available today to the modern reader will be introduced later. </p><h2>  Charomutia </h2><p>  This work of the author is dedicated to the great proto-language - Slavic.  Platon Akimovich in this book tells the reader how and why the ‚Äúenchantment‚Äù occurred - the division of a single language into many existing ones.  Explains from their position their relationship with each other. </p><p>  The reader will in this book get acquainted with the phenomenon of mixing.  And find out why the world is populated by misunderstanding peoples speaking different languages.  Platon Akimovich will present here the chronicle "Bystvori" (history) of the Russian language, which will surprise many readers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="konzeptual.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a collection of songs" class="if uuid-2871322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/2871322.jpg"></div><h2>  "Explanation of Assyrian names" </h2><p>  This is already the fifth work of Platon Lukashevich.  Here, the author continues to develop the theme of enchantment.  What it is?  Separation, turbidity, distortion of the Primeval language (the author considers it to be Slavic) of the One humanity. </p><p>  As the name implies, the work is dedicated to the study of the proper names of the Assyrian peoples.  Moreover, the author takes for analysis the most ancient of them.  As he claims, 2600-4000 years ago. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The book also contains an analysis of many indigenous names of tribes of various regions of the globe, historical times.  Based on all this, Plato Lukashevich claims that the names of the British, French, Spanish, Gallic, Thracian, Germanic and other European peoples are basically Slavic.  Moreover, the author writes in his book that he managed to find Slavic roots in the names of the most ancient peoples - Egyptians and Assyrians! </p><p>  Perhaps the presentation of the views of Platon Akimovich seems rather harsh here.  But there are modern researchers who consider his arguments serious and scientifically evidence-based.  Therefore, followers of his rather one-sided view of the linguistic theory of the origin and culture of all existing peoples appear.  Thus, the followers of Lukashevich believe that the theory of the graduate of the Richelieu Lyceum ‚Äúcharomutia‚Äù seems to be evidence-based, comprehensive against the background of chaotic theories recognized by modern science. </p><h2>  "Ancient Assyria and Ancient Russia" </h2><p>  This work of Platon Akimovich is dedicated to deciphering the first language of the world with which the author sees Slavic.  In the publication, he explores three main topics - the Assyrian languages, the mysteries of ancient Babylon and the Slavic cult of the sun. </p><p>  This book substantially supplements Charomutia, and in more detail and thoroughly explains the arguments presented there.  Platon Akimovich here again convinces the reader that the Slavic language is true, first, sacred.  This is exactly the dialect spoken by the ancient magi, priests, magicians of all the peoples of the Earth. </p><p>  As for the scientific side, it is expressed in bringing a number of Babylonian-Slavic correspondences.  The book also reveals not only philological, but also philosophical, worldview features of the Aboriginal language. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian ethnography" class="if uuid-2871329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/2871329.jpg"></div><h2>  True language and enchantment </h2><p>  Platon Lukashevich‚Äôs works are usually not associated with scientific Russian ethnography and linguistics.  The fact is that the originality of his judgments, according to scientists, is based on the emotional breakdown of the author. </p><p>  So, Platon Akimovich argued that the authentic, true language of the primitive world was precisely Slavic.  Then came the era of "charomutia".  She gave birth to the "charms" languages ‚Äã‚Äãcalled by Plato Akimovich.  They divided the genuine (Slavic) into several branches: </p><ul><li>  Slavic. </li><li>  Slavic Chinese. </li><li>  Slavic-Kalmyk (or Mongolian). </li><li>  Slavic American. </li><li>  Slavic-African. <div class="photo" data-original="derzhava.today" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Richelieu Lyceum" class="if uuid-2871320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/2871320.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Features of the author's conclusions </h2><p>  In his linguistic studies, the author arbitrarily manipulated individual words in other languages, thereby trying to find Slavic roots in them.  This became the basis for unexpected and not scientifically validated conclusions.  So, in the Mongolian steppes he managed to "discover" the origins of the French people.  And the British Platon Akimovich did consider the descendants of the mixture of the same Mongol and Slav peoples to be completely descendants. </p><p>  But these are far from the most eccentric statements of the author of Charomutia, Platon Lukashevich.  Acquainted with his works, you can find out the following: </p><ul><li>  On the Sun, people and other creatures live, whose vision is arranged in such a way that they are not blinded by the bright light of a star. </li><li>  America and Africa are independent planets.  Once upon a time they "fell" to the Earth along with their reproductive and animal worlds. </li></ul><p>  Here we see a certain tragedy of the author‚Äôs personality.  Platon Lukashevich considered his discoveries to be exceptional, important for the scientific world and humanity as a whole.  But contemporaries sometimes directly pointed out to him the excessive play of imagination and the complete lack of common sense in "theories."  Science ignored all the arguments and research of an eccentric linguist. </p><p>  However, interest in his works has increased today.  Therefore, some of the author‚Äôs research was reprinted not so long ago.  Some of the readers like to follow the flight of thoughts of Platon Akimovich, others are attracted to the unusual course of presentation of their thoughts.  There are also followers who consider his works to be ‚Äútrue knowledge‚Äù, which finally came to be revealed to descendants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.litfund.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="charomutia or the sacred language of magicians of the sorcerers and priests" class="if uuid-2871326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/2871326.jpg"></div><p>  Platon Akimovich Lukashevich - who is he?  Is the author, who has a number of mental disorders that prevented him from a sober look at the world, his own research?  A man who does not see the line between the game of his own imagination and the real state of affairs?  Or, according to some modern followers, a unique scientist who discovered the "true knowledge" of the world, a new genuine history of mankind? </p>
