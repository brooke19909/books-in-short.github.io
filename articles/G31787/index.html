    <h2>  The cost of living in the hotel "Alexandros" 4 * (Corfu, Greece) </h2><p>  As for the cost of hotel accommodation, for one night, depending on the season, you will have to pay from 43 euros.  This price is consistent with the four-star level of the hotel. </p><h2>  Alexandros Hotel 4 * (Corfu): reviews </h2><p>  Since for many travelers when choosing a hotel it is very important to know the opinions of people who have already been here, we have summarized the comments of vacationers to present you with the big picture.  So, how did our compatriots rate the four-star Alexandros hotel <span>(Corfu island, Greece)</span> ? </p><p>  I must say that in general, most tourists were satisfied with their stay.  As for the hotel itself, many vacationers quite liked the rooms provided to them.  However, some guests had poor air conditioning in their rooms.  Also, many tourists pay attention that the bathrooms do not have a hairdryer.  If you need it, then you can contact the reception, where they will give it to you.  Some guests also expressed dissatisfaction with their rooms located on the ground floor near the pool, as loud music was heard in them until late.  Otherwise, there are no particular complaints about the apartments.  On the contrary, many guests noted the magnificent view from the balconies and terraces of the hotel. </p><p>  Conflicting reviews relate to food at the Alexandros Hotel 4 *.  So, people who had previously rested in hotels in Turkey and Egypt and got used to the all-inclusive system adopted there, were a little disappointed.  However, experienced travelers are skeptical of such comments, arguing that ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù in all hotels in Greece differs markedly from the above countries.  That is, it is very reckless to count on the same choice of dishes as in Turkey and Egypt.  Nevertheless, most guests noted that the food at the Alexandros Hotel is very tasty, and the portions are quite large.  In addition, there are a lot of restaurants near the hotel where you can also eat very tasty, tasting dishes of both national Greek and international cuisine. </p><p>  Extremely positive emotions were left by tourists by the hotel staff.  So, Alexandros 4 * employees are always ready to help you in solving any issue.  Also, travelers note the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff to them.  Many of our compatriots were surprised by the fact that the maids at the hotel do not tip, and the quality of cleaning is at the same time high.  The only minor drawback is the fact that the hotel staff does not speak Russian.  However, many of them are fluent in English, so you can always explain. </p><p>  As for the pools, there were no special complaints from tourists.  So, many note the fact that both the adult and the children's pool are cleaned daily.  However, some of our compatriots were saddened by the fact that having come to the sunbathing terrace after breakfast, they could not find free sunbeds.  Therefore, tourists who wanted to spend several hours near the pool had to get up, as they say, <span>no light or dawn,</span> and take a deck chair for themselves and family members. </p><p>  In general, most Russians were satisfied with their stay at the four-star Alexandros Hotel, located on the Greek island of Corfu.  They do not exclude the possibility of returning here again, and are also ready to recommend it to their friends and relatives. </p>
