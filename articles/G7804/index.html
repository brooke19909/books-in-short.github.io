Its components will be a computer, television (modern models), game console and other home electronics. </p><p>  To do this, you need to buy a special adapter.  Thanks to him, a television set-top box can be located in any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment.  After all, the adapter can achieve the highest dynamics at a distance of up to 10 m. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcworld.idg.com.au" data-author=": Thomas Ryan, "><img itemprop="image" alt="external wifi for tv" class="if uuid-2680678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2680678.jpg"></div><h2>  Questions about drivers and software </h2><p>  Wi-Fi USB adapters need to be configured correctly.  The initial stage here is always installing the necessary drivers for the specific operation of the device.  When the adapter connects to the computer, the system selects the driver. </p><p>  There is a possibility that it does not fully correspond to the purchased device.  Then the adapter will not work correctly, although a disk with a set of optimal drivers and licensed software is usually included in the kit of the purchased adapter. </p><p>  You need to install all the programs and drivers from this disk. </p><p>  If the user has a laptop without a CD-ROM, but has a network connection, you just need to visit the official resource of the device manufacturer and download the appropriate programs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The most important settings </h2><p>  When the WiFi USB adapter for the TV is connected to the computer, and the necessary software is installed, the equipment should work.  But further configuration is also needed: </p><ol><li>  The password for accessing the device settings is indicated. </li><li>  Put a check mark (in a special window) to connect to the network in an automatic manner.  Condition - the network must be within sight. </li><li>  The user determines how he will encrypt the data. </li></ol><p>  After these steps, a highly dynamic wireless data channel is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thenextweb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern TVs" class="if uuid-2681432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/2681432.jpg"></div><h2>  Modern TVs </h2><p>  Modern TV models are more reminiscent of some modifications of computers.  They have processors with powerful performance and solid integrated memory.  For a complete set, it remains to connect them to the Internet. </p><p>  Today, televisions with huge functionality are becoming more popular.  Also, people connect TV with a huge number of channels, Smart TV is installed.  This technology provides access to the network, allows you to install additional utilities and view and listen to different content. </p><p>  We can say that a modern TV is a powerful media complex.  It is only necessary to solve the basic question of how to arrange the connection of such a TV to the network. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect a Wi-Fi adapter to a TV" class="if uuid-2678753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2678753.jpg"></div><h2>  Connection Methods </h2><p>  Today there are two main methods: </p><ol><li>  Wired. </li><li>  Wireless. </li></ol><p>  The first is characterized by greater stability, but the entire <span>apartment is littered with</span> wires.  This violates the aesthetics of the interior and causes serious discomfort.  Other disadvantages of a wired connection are: </p><ol><li>  The use of a network cable for a TV makes it impossible to access the network on other devices. </li><li>  Most providers are upgrading standards.  Often, you need to manually enter data to configure the connection. </li></ol><p>  These shortcomings can be compensated by using a router.  But with him and his settings, many users also do not want to bother.  Therefore, basically, preference is given to the second method. </p><p>  There are models with an integrated adapter and modifications that provide for its connection.  Even current receivers have a network connector.  This provides connectivity by both methods. </p><p>  But if your TV is without a wifi adapter and the ability to connect it, you will only have to use the first method. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sdelaicomp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wi-Fi TV connection diagram" class="if uuid-2678762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2678762.jpg"></div><h2>  Wireless method </h2><p>  This method is implemented when the receiver has both a network jack and an integrated special module.  Often the TV does not have such a module, but you can connect an external device to it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In this situation, you should additionally buy an external WiFi adapter for the TV. </p><p>  With a built-in or external device, the connection diagram looks like the one shown in the photo below. </p><p>  External devices are very compact and resemble simple flash drives, but they can guarantee a connection speed of up to 350 Mbps. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tramstech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="external Wi-Fi adapter for TV" class="if uuid-2679050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100377/2679050.jpg"></div><h2>  Connection Procedure </h2><p>  Connecting a TV receiver to the network is not a very complicated procedure.  The device may have a built-in device.  You can use an external analogue.  In this case, the question arises, how to connect the wifi adapter to the TV.  For the correct connection and settings, go to the network settings.  Use the remote.  Visit the section on wireless options.  Then select one of the variations: </p><ul><li>  AP.  Suitable if you know the exact name of the network and the password to enter it.  Use the list of access points and select the option you need manually. </li><li>  WPS  Used when your Wi-Fi USB adapter for the TV has a button with a similar abbreviation.  Start the setup process using the remote control.  After that, hold the button on the adapter for about 4-10 seconds.  The connection is configured automatically.  A notification about joining the network appears on the screen. </li><li>  Ad hoc.  She synchronizes the TV and computer.  There is no network connection.  There are situations when you need to configure the network through a router.  This requires a flash drive with an access point sensor.  The drive is first placed in the router, then in the receiver.  The connection is configured automatically. </li></ul><p>  The products of many companies have a menu with a list of access points.  From it, the user himself selects the required network.  If necessary, a password is entered.  It and other data should be recorded in a notebook, in a text document on a computer or in a mobile phone. </p><p>  If no errors were made at these stages, and the connection is configured correctly, an alarm indicator will be displayed on the screen.  It shows the Wi-Fi level. </p><h2>  Principles for choosing an adapter </h2><p>  When you need to purchase a <span>wireless WiFi</span> adapter for your TV, it is important to follow these principles: </p><ol><li>  Buy the model of the same brand as your TV. </li><li>  The device should provide a good connection speed.  Some errors are permissible.  For example, if the documentation reflects an indicator of 400 Mbps, but in reality it turns out to be 380-390, then such a discrepancy can be allowed.  If instead of 400 you get less than 350, you need to return the goods. </li><li>  Availability of the proper <span>warranty period.</span>  Such products must be subject to a one-year warranty. </li></ol><p>  Experts recommend immediately buying a TV that already has such a device.  This eliminates the hassle of acquiring additional devices for accessing the Internet, and connecting a network is much easier.  Typically, such models have detailed step-by-step instructions on how to do this. </p><h2>  Examples of devices of famous brands </h2><p>  Today, Samsung, Sony, LG TVs are in great demand.
