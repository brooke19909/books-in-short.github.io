For foreigners, Alaska seems to be an untouched massif, where winter is fully hosted.  Travelers from all over the world come here for adventure and socializing with pristine nature, the beauty of which leaves an indelible impression. </p><h2>  Park history </h2><p>  Occupying an area of ‚Äã‚Äã25 thousand km <sup>2</sup> , Denali National Park is located in the center of Alaska.  This is the most popular and visited reserve in America, where in the wild, visitors get acquainted with its unique fauna.  More than 12 thousand years ago, ancient settlements of people lived here, and the findings of archaeologists confirm this.  And at the beginning of the 20th century, when the first gold miners appeared on the "land of the midnight sun", five groups of northern tribes lived in the territory of the modern park. </p><p>  The famous natural scientist C. Sheldon, once in Alaska, admired the amazing views of the surrounding nature.  The naturalist, who traveled around the territory adjacent to Mount McKinley, spent nine years trying to break through the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a reserve in the American Congress.  He said that wildlife needs protection, and if no measures are taken, then animals will become prey for hunters, and the unique flora will disappear forever. </p><p>  His efforts were not in vain, and in 1917 Denali National Park was founded, originally bearing the name in honor of McKinley Peak.  Only after 63 years, the authorities combined the two protected areas (the park and the highest mountain of the United States) into a single complex with a beautiful name, which translates as "great" from the language of the Atabask tribe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="denali national park" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1482015.jpg" width="600"></div>

Mary, who studied the behavior of wolves in the wild habitat, told the whole world about the importance of these animals for the natural ecosystem.  Thanks to his report, the extermination of predators at Denali was banned. </p><h2>  Developed infrastructure </h2><p>  In the 50s of the last century, the leadership of the biosphere reserve was preoccupied with the problem of providing quality guest services.  The main road was expanded, comfortable hotels and tourist centers appeared.  True, many scientists took hostility with a desire to make Denali National Park open to visitors, and Adolf Mary became the main critic, who considered the inexpediency of developing a tourist destination in the nature conservation zone. </p><h2>  Wildlife area </h2><p>  In the Denali National Park and Preserve Biosphere Reserve, which includes part of the Alaskan Range, including the Kalhiltna Glacier, and the high Mount McKinley, visitors can access a park area of ‚Äã‚Äã19 thousand km <sup>2</sup> .  More than 650 species of plants and trees, 167 species of birds and 39 species of mammals became the pride of the best nature reserve on the planet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="denali national park reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1482007.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For tourists who come to the reserve for one day, special permission is not required, but for those who want to spend several days in the park, you need to get a special pass and register with the police.  The thing is that the Denali National Park in Alaska is divided into several zones, and the number of people who can stay overnight is strictly limited. </p><h2>  Features of excursions in the reserve </h2><p>  In addition, shuttle buses passing through the park and transporting passengers on a schedule pass along the road.  According to <span>tourists, this</span> is the cheapest option to travel to a giant reserve, getting acquainted with the local flora and wild fauna.  You can go out at any moment, enjoy the wonderful nature and again go on an exciting adventure along the tundra and taiga. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="denali national park" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1482005.jpg" width="600"></div>
