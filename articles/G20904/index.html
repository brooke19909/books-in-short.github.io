It so happened that with Apple smartphones there are always much fewer problems and crashes.  The system rarely gives errors and almost always has round-the-clock support from the company's employees.  But Android can only envy it. </p><p>  Problems with this mobile operating system occur for various reasons.  Sometimes it is installed incorrectly, sometimes due to user errors, sometimes due to incomplete updates. </p><h2>  Problem </h2><p>  It so happens that Android does not install the application.  Of course, this can cause discomfort to the user, as sometimes it is urgently necessary to download a map or office program to work with software. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.xda-developers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Android does not install" class="if uuid-2787819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2787819.jpg"></div><p>  How does the crash happen?  Sometimes the Android smartphone writes: ‚ÄúThe application is not installed.‚Äù  Also, the system may not give out any notifications at all, and the user will wait a long time to receive at least some information from Google Play. </p><p>  By the way, if you install applications from an unverified source, then the failures here are not at all surprising, since many unscrupulous developers make copies of popular programs in order to make money on inexperienced users. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Is it possible to install applications on Android from unknown sites?  Of course not, because together with the software itself, you can install malicious files and ads on the device.  It is better to use to install Google Play, but at the same time check each application for positive reviews and a good average score. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobileinternist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Google Play Issues" class="if uuid-2787820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2787820.jpg"></div><h2>  First step </h2><p>  If the application is not installed by Android, what should I do?  It is immediately recommended that you reboot the system.  Sometimes the OS is overloaded and gives a similar crash.  One must be prepared for this and not immediately panic.  Usually, after rebooting the phone, Google Play starts to work correctly, and the desired application is downloaded to the device‚Äôs memory. </p><p>  But what if this option does not help in this matter?  It‚Äôs better to first deal with the possible reasons why the application is not installed on Android. </p><h2>  Causes of Google Play Crash </h2><p>  One of the main reasons is the lack of internal phone memory.  If the archive is filled with personal data, it will not allow you to install or upload new files to the system. </p><p>  It is also likely that the installation is interrupted by an unstable Internet connection.  Therefore, it is initially recommended to download programs when connected to Wi-Fi, since the mobile Internet can not always provide a stable connection. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is also worth considering the compatibility of the program with the system.  This is especially due to where the software is installed from.  If this is a normal apk extension file, there is a chance that there will be problems due to version mismatch. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="No software installed" class="if uuid-2787821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2787821.jpg"></div><p>  Lastly, even Google may experience temporary glitches.  Therefore, your account will also have to be verified. </p><h2>  Out of memory </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, lack of memory is the main reason why Android does not install applications.  But this problem is not difficult to solve.  It is enough to free memory.  There are several ways to do this. </p><p>  Firstly, you can simply get rid of applications or files that are on the phone and may be redundant.  It is also advisable to get rid of temporary files and clear the cache. </p><p>  Secondly, if a memory card is installed, you can configure the transfer of applications to microSD.  In this case, all downloaded programs will be transferred, and the internal memory will be freed.  This will make it possible to download applications. </p><p>  But before you transfer files, you need to check where the downloaded data is saved.  To do this, just go to "Settings" and find the "Memory" section.  After that, just find the ‚ÄúInstallation Location‚Äù item.  Options may be indicated there: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  "Device memory". </li><li>  "SD card." </li><li>  "The choice of system." </li></ul><p>  Here it is enough to choose a memory card, and after that all installed programs and files will be downloaded to it.  Immediately it is worth noting that it does not matter where the applications are installed specifically, they will work correctly both on the memory card and on the phone‚Äôs internal memory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidpit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Software installation" class="if uuid-2787822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2787822.jpg"></div><h2>  Internet problems </h2><p>  It often happens that you need to install the application on the go.  But mobile Internet does not always provide a stable connection.  Therefore, Google Play may fail.  Of course, with the advent of 4G, everything has changed markedly, but even in this case, not everything can go so smoothly. </p><p>  Therefore, it is best to get a stable connection.  You need to connect to a wireless network, and in this case, it is desirable to a proven one. </p><h2>  Application and System Compatibility </h2><p>  If Android <span>does not install applications, there</span> may be a compatibility issue.  Most often, such a failure can occur if you install programs from unverified sources.  If the user uses the apk file downloaded from the Internet, a compatibility conflict may occur. </p><p>  In addition, as mentioned earlier, usually third-party program files contain a lot of advertising and malicious elements.  Therefore, incompatibility is the least to be feared in this case. </p><p>  It‚Äôs better to download programs from Google Play.  Most popular applications are checked by antivirus, and also have many reviews and a good average score. </p><h2>  Account Issues </h2><p>  If the notification ‚ÄúFailed to install the application on Android‚Äù appears, you need to check your Google account.  Sometimes account errors may occur.  You may need to delete your account and add it again: </p><ul><li>  In the smartphone‚Äôs settings, find the ‚ÄúAccounts‚Äù section. </li><li>  Select Google and click on the account used for Google Play. </li><li>  In the advanced setup, it will be possible to delete the account. </li><li>  Reboot the smartphone, and then add an account. </li></ul><p>  Before that, it is advisable to backup the data, otherwise some information may be deleted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reset to factory settings" class="if uuid-2787827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2787827.jpg"></div><h2>  Correct installation </h2><p>  So that there are no problems with the fact that Android does not install applications, you need to learn how to do it correctly.  So, for the program to install correctly on your smartphone, you need: </p><ul><li>  Launch Google Play and add an account if it is not already. </li><li>  In the search you need to enter the name of the application. </li><li>  On the page of the software found, you need to check the reviews and the average score. </li><li>  Next, click on the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button and accept the permissions. </li><li>  It remains to wait for the download and installation to complete. </li></ul><p>  If everything is done correctly, a notification about installing the application will appear. </p><p>  A similar process can be carried out using a computer.  But it‚Äôs better to do the same through Google Play.  You need to open a browser, go to the app store website and enter the necessary software in the search.  After that, you will need to click on the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button and save the program to your PC. </p><p>  Next you need to transfer the file to your smartphone.  Manual installation of applications does not take much time.  It is only necessary to prepare before this for her.  In the system settings you need to find the "Security" section.  It has a setting for installing programs from an unknown source.  It is enough to check the box so that the smartphone allows you to install the necessary software. </p><p>  Now just click on the installed APK-file.  The system will automatically start the download and install the application.  This option is also possible, but more complicated, because you have to connect the phone to the computer and transfer files. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theleaker.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Proper installation of programs" class="if uuid-2787828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2787828.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Android is not the most advanced system.  Problems often occur with it, which can affect the system‚Äôs performance.  But if suddenly a similar failure occurred, and the above options do not help, you will have to reset to factory settings. </p><p>  To do this, just go to your smartphone‚Äôs settings and select the ‚ÄúMemory and backups‚Äù section.  In this menu there is a line "Reset to factory settings".  But it is important to remember that after that all data will be lost.  It‚Äôs better to transfer them to another device or to the cloud in advance. </p>
