Or at least a pasha?  To do this, you need to come to the hotel Grand Pasa Hotel 5 * (Marmaris).  You will learn reviews, prices for rooms at the Grand Pasha 5 * hotel from this article.  We built a description of this hotel on the information provided by the administration of this institution, and on the responses of tourists who visited there recently - in the summer and early fall of this year. </p><p>  To begin with, let's say that the rating of Grand Pasha is high.  According to the Triadviser polls, it is 4.5 points out of five possible.  Russian tourists who leave feedback on the site "Subtleties of Tourism", also gave this hotel a high rating - 9.8 out of ten.  The hotel owns five stars.  But we have to disappoint lovers of seal vacations near the feeding place: this hotel is not on the first line.  How far is it from the beach?  We hope that you will receive useful information about all this by reading this article. </p>

    <h2>  Where is the hotel Grand Pasa Hotel (Turkey) </h2><p>  Would you like to see the two seas merge?  You can admire this sight if you come to rest in the Turkish city of Marmaris.  The city itself is located on the Mediterranean coast.  But if you overcome a small hill on the bus, you can get out to another water area.  The Aegean Sea is slightly colder than the Mediterranean, and the breeze there is more noticeable.  You can verify this yourself by swimming in turns in both reservoirs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the hill separating the center of Marmaris from the Aegean Sea, climbs the new quarter of the city - Armutalan.  It is popular with budget tourists.  In addition, in the pine forest near Armutalan is located Jamiavlu Falls.  Grand Pasha Hotel is located in the area.  But do not think that you will need to go down from the mountain to the beach.  Armutalan is a large area.  Its right side (if facing the sea) smoothly descends to the promenade leading from the center of Marmaris to the distant seaside suburb of Icmeler.  Thus, from the hotel to the beach - five hundred meters.  This means that you will have 7-10 minutes of leisurely walking step along a beautiful street, buried in flowers. </p>

    <h2>  What is next to the hotel </h2><p>  The fact that the Grand Pasa Hotel Marmaris is not on the first line, reviews are credited to the hotel as a plus.  Marmaris, and especially the embankment of Armutalan, are very noisy.  Shops, bars and restaurants are open until late.  A little further away - in the residential neighborhoods, where, in fact, the Grand Pasha Hotel is located, calm reigns.  But if you want to find yourself at the epicenter of Marmaris's bustling spa life, you just need to go down to the promenade. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Not far from the hotel is the Marmaris Dolphinarium.  The city center is three and a half kilometers away.  On the street separating the beach from the hotels of the so-called first lane, constantly, from seven in the morning until half past one in the night, minibuses "dolmushi" run.  Such buses can leave both in the Old Town of Marmaris (where the medieval fortress, Bar Street), and in the opposite direction - to Icmeler. </p><p>  The last distant area is also worth a visit.  "Icmeler" translated from Turkish means "Lost Paradise."  And the area really looks like Eden, descended from the sky and located among the pines and green slopes.  Marmaris is the most European of all cities in Turkey.  It can be safely walked in the evenings. </p><h2>  The territory of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Grand Pasa Hotel 5 * (Marmaris) is a rather large hotel.  Its territory is eight thousand square meters.  The hotel itself consists of one five-story building.  The building was built in 2006.  And the last repair in it was made in 2012. The exterior of the building impresses guests with its style and snow-white beauty.  The hall is so huge that some reviews compare it to the opera house.  The building was built in the Art Nouveau style.  It has many elevators, and from the balconies there are amazing views of the mountains and the sea. </p><p>  In front of the Grand Pasha Hotel is a lagoon-style pool.  A pretty bridge crosses it at its narrowest point.  This is not indicated in the sign of the hotel, but the Grand Pasha is a hotel with a small water park.  It has three water slides going down to the edge of the pool.  The rest of the territory is a large green lawn, on which palm trees grow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Where do guests stay? </h2><p>  Maybe the territory at the Grand Pasa Hotel is not as big as that of the other fives on the Anatolian coast, but the building of the building is impressive in its size.  And therefore the rooms are simply huge.  Even in the standard, three people can feel at ease here.  The room has one double bed and the second a little narrower.  With the technical content of the room everything is at the level of a five-star hotel.  There is a split system, TV, safe, minibar, telephone, hairdryer.  There are also pleasant little things in the form of cosmetic and sewing kits, brushes for shoes, slippers, bathrobes, etc. </p><p>  In the bathroom there is a bidet in the standards, and in the suites there is also a jacuzzi.  Each room at the Grand Pasha Hotel has a private balcony.  It is very spacious and equipped with everything necessary to sit and enjoy the view of the sea or mountains.  Most of the 280 rooms available are standard.  There are literally several two-room suite rooms and two royal suites.  Three rooms are adapted to the needs of people with reduced mobility. </p>

    <h2>  What tourists say about guest rooms </h2><p>  Grand Pasa Hotel 5 * (Marmaris) reviews are called a great place for families.  There are many children here, but the sound insulation is so good that you will not hear crying at night or screaming in the morning.  Plumbing and household appliances are new, everything is working properly.  The air conditioner is very powerful and easily copes with heat without letting it into the room.  They clean the rooms every day, and linen is changed three times a week.  Diligence of the maids does not depend on the tip left.  The only thing that confused the guests in the Grand Pasha's rooms was the paid safe.  Wi-Fi is available only at the reception.  If you want to work on the Internet, lying on the sofa in your room, you need to pay six lire per day.  In general, the guests liked the rooms.  Everything is working properly, everywhere is clean, bright and spacious.  The spacious balcony is equipped with a tumble dryer. </p><h2>  How to feed the guests </h2><p>  What Turkish ‚Äúfive‚Äù do without the concept of ‚ÄúAll inclusive‚Äù?  And the Grand Pasa Hotel 5 * (Marmaris) is not an exception to this rule.  It has a main restaurant, which serves Turkish and pan-European cuisine in buffet style.  It is open almost around the clock.  But there is no a la carte restaurant in the hotel.  But there are plenty of bars.  In one of them, near the pool, from five to six in the afternoon they give free ice cream.  The rest of the service, like almost everywhere in Turkey: you only have to fork out for imported alcohol and freshly squeezed juices. </p>

    <h2>  What vacationers say about food </h2><p>  Tourists really liked how they feed at the Grand Pasa Hotel (Marmaris).  Reviews mention two types of fish every day, grilled meat, duck, beef stroganoff and other culinary delights.  Those who like Turkish cuisine are offered dalma, g√∂zleme, baklava.  There is also baby food.  At all meals, and especially breakfasts, there are a lot of fruits and fresh vegetables.  The bars are very friendly staff.  With late check-in, you will be sure to be fed dinner, even if it is midnight in the yard.  The waiters are quick, quickly remove the dishes from the tables, take out new dishes instead of empty trays.  There are no more than 15 percent of Russians in a hotel, so there were no lines for dishes and assaults on the restaurant.  Nobody is gaining food with kilograms, and everyone suffices it, whenever you come for a meal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Pasa Hotel 5 Marmaris reviews prices" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2052820.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Pools and beach </h2><p>  Grand Pasa Hotel is part of the hotel complex.  Nearby are two more hotels - Pasha Garden and Pasha Beach.  The latter stands on the first line has its own beach.  Guests of the hotel complex are allowed to use the entire infrastructure of the three hotels.  In particular, Grand Pasha guests can freely go to Pasa Beach, take sun loungers and umbrellas there. </p><p>  The coast there is pebble, with an admixture of sand.  Sunset at sea is average.  Since Marmaris Bay is fenced off from the sea by islands, there are practically no storms.  Guests in their reviews claim that you can comfortably swim here in early May.  You don‚Äôt need to go only to Pasha Beach.  You can choose any other coast.  Many cafes on the beaches have their sunbeds and umbrellas, and if you take something from them, you can use them for at least half a day. </p><p>  The hotel has an outdoor freshwater pool.  It is surrounded by a terrace lined with sunbeds with mattresses and umbrellas.  Three water slides descend into the pool.  According to reviews, they are not extreme, but not boring.  For children there is a private pool, not far from an adult, which is convenient: you can follow the child, without looking up from your own sunbathing. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The reception at the Grand Pasa Hotel, open 24 hours a day, offers free Wi-Fi.  The list of other "free" services includes parking, a gym, rental equipment for sports games.  There is a small spa center on site, but its services are paid.  From morning till night, guests are entertained by animators.  For children there is a mini club.  But, reviews warn, the public at the hotel consists of 75 percent of vacationers from Western Europe, mainly Germans.  And therefore, the animation will be interesting to those who know English at least at the initial level.  Vacationers from Russia mention that children quickly adapt to a foreign language, because for modeling, drawing sports, you need a minimum of communication. </p><p>  In the evenings, the administration invites professional dancers and artists for the show.  Disco parties are also held.  The hotel has all the conditions for relaxing children.  There is a playground, and in the restaurant you can use high chairs for feeding babies.  In the evenings, young people are taken to Bar Street and delivered back at two in the morning. </p>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Although the hotel provides everything you need for a good rest, tourists urge you not to sit all day at the Grand Pasa Hotel.  Marmaris is a very interesting city to neglect excursions.  You can independently go to the medieval fortress, which is located in the center, near the Street of Bars.  If on a dolmush ride in the opposite direction from the Old Town, then you can get to Icmeler.  Of the excursions, tourists recommend boat trips around the islands.  But it is better to order them directly at the marina, and not at the travel agency.  So, a tour of the islands of the Mediterranean Sea will cost you ten dollars (with lunch), and if you check into the Aegean, then at fifteen.  If you visit Marmaris in rainy weather, you can go see the Jamiavlu Falls. </p><h2>  Grand Pasa Hotel 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists were extremely pleased with their vacation at the hotel.  This Turkish ‚Äúfive‚Äù exceeded all their expectations.  Very friendly and friendly staff is trying to solve all the problems.  Russians here are treated without prejudice (if they behave appropriately).  The accuracy of cleaning does not depend on the tip.  The only negative that vacationers noted here is a paid safe.  But there were no cases of theft of things left in cabinets and bedside tables.  All vacationers are enthusiastic about the food at the Grand Pasa Hotel.  There is a lot of food, and all of it is diverse, tasty.  You won‚Äôt try everything in ten days, the responses assure.  A standard room costs from 3.5 to 7.5 thousand rubles, and package tours to the hotel will cost even cheaper.  Therefore, guests write that for this level of service this is good money.  Many tourists said they would like to return to this hotel again. </p>
