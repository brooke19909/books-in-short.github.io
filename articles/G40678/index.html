  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social institutions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The term "institute" has two meanings: technical, narrow and social, general.  Sociology borrowed its interpretation in jurisprudence, adding its own characteristic features.  Although its core remained the same: social institutions are norms that regulate some sphere of relations in society.  Animals use instincts to adapt to the environment and survive.  Man has long lost their main part.  The role of instincts in society is now played by <span>social institutions.</span>  They also allow, if possible, to survive in the <span>struggle for existence</span> in society.  Their main purpose is to satisfy the needs of not just one person, but the collective as a whole.  Each individual seems to have his own unique set of needs.  This is true, but nevertheless, five dominant ones can be distinguished from them.  The main social institutions correspond to them: </p><p>  - the need to reproduce your family (institution of marriage); </p><p>  - the need to live in such a social order that would be absolutely safe (political institutions, the state); </p><p>  - the need to ensure their existence (economic institutions, production); </p><p>  - the need to transfer their experience and knowledge to the younger generation (educational institutions); </p><p>  - the need to search for the meaning of life, spiritual development (institution of religion). </p><p>  Back in the late 19th century, social institutions were extensively described by <span>Thorstein Veblen.</span>  This information remains relevant today.  He suggested that social institutions went through an evolutionary process and formed as a result of natural selection.  In order to adapt to the environment and survive, humanity was forced to create various norms and prohibitions.  The first to emerge, most likely, was the institution of family and marriage. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, social institutions are such devices of adaptation in society that are created in order to satisfy its basic needs. </p><p>  They are regulated by a set of special norms that are passed down from generation to generation and gradually become familiar to a certain collective, and develop into a custom or tradition.  The direction of the way of thinking and life of people depended on them. </p><p>  Both Veblen, the founder of institutionalism, and Hamilton, his follower, defined social institutions as a set of customs accepted in society, as the implementation of specific habits, ways of thinking, behavior, lifestyles that are passed from one generation to another, vary depending on circumstances and at the same time serve to adapt to new prevailing conditions. </p><p>  In almost the same way, this term is also understood by lawyers (consolidation in the form of laws of customs in society). </p><p>  Institutions exist even in the most primitive society.  Otherwise, it can no longer be called society.  The state of society depends on their correct or incorrect functioning. </p><p>  So, the functions of the institution of the family are the birth and upbringing of children.  Economic institutions perform the functions of providing housing, clothing and food.  Political institutions support various standards, rules and laws.  Religious institutions contribute to the deepening of faith, build relations between faiths.  Educational institutes are engaged in the social adaptation of people in society, they are introduced to elementary values.  Each of these institutions has its own actors, its own characteristics, traits and symbols. </p><p>  In addition, these concepts are not abstract, they are quite visible, tangible.  This is not a frozen system; it is constantly evolving.  For example, the institution of the family.  He went through several stages: from <span>group marriage</span> and polygamy to monogamy.  <span>A nuclear family</span> with two generations (children and parents) has replaced the extended one in the center of attention.  The wedding has also changed, the attitude to the role of wife and husband, and views on the upbringing of the new generation. </p>
