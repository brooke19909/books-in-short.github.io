Sandwiched between the Mediterranean Sea and the Taurus Mountains, it delights the tourist with amazing landscapes.  A holy place, as they say, is never empty.  Gradually, the town of Kemer was overgrown with satellite villages.  One of them is Goynuk, whose name translates as "fertile valley in the place of heavenly radiance."  Here the glitter of the sea and the azure sky penetrated by the sun's rays really merge.  Pleasant Mediterranean climate, mountain air filled with the scent of coniferous forests and <span>pomegranate gardens, a</span> huge number of historical and natural attractions in the vicinity - what else is needed for a cloudless holiday?  Literally for every taste and wallet size, hotels are presented in Goynuk (Kemer, Turkey).  Grand Lukullus Hotel is one of them.  We will consider its advantages and possible disadvantages in this article. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand lukullus Hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/435059.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  The hotel is located in the very center of the resort village.  This means that shops, souvenir shops, as well as the main promenade - all this in five minutes.  Also near the hotel stop Dalmushi - local minibuses and intercity buses.  If you will independently get from the airport of Antalya, then the trip will take you an hour.  Eight kilometers from the village of Goynuk there is a small but ancient town of Kemer.  Grand Lukullus Hotel 4 is located on the second line.  A road separates it from the sea.  To the pebble beach - about 600 meters, to the sandy beach, where free minibuses run from the hotel, a little more.  Taking advantage of the central location in the village, the hotel administration headed for the organization of a relaxing family vacation.  Do you want a drive?  Around the corner begins the main resort boulevard with numerous entertainment venues.  On the territory of the hotel there is peace and comfort. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Grand Lukullus Hotel 4 Kemer <strong> </strong>  used to be called Lucullus.  It was built in 1996.  But do not be afraid of unrepaired walls and old furniture.  The last reconstruction took place in 2008.  The hotel belongs to the so-called "urban" type, that is, its homestead territory is quite small.  The hotel complex consists of two buildings - three and four floors (all of them have elevators).  Between them are pools.  In principle, the quiet, almost family atmosphere in the hotel allows you to create the fact that there are only 84 rooms. Two of them are fully adapted to the needs of people with disabilities.  All guest rooms are equipped with balconies.  Each of them easily accommodates a table and two chairs, so you can enjoy the views of the mountains or watch the children splashing in the pool without leaving your room. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand lukullus hotel reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/434113.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Guest Room Amenities </h2><p>  Silent air conditioning will drive out the summer heat, and satellite TV with Russian and music channels will not let you get bored in the evening.  The bathroom is equipped with a shower with liquid soap and shampoo, there is also a hairdryer.  Paid amenities include a safe.  There is also an empty minibar in the rooms, which can be used as a refrigerator.  But the reconstruction was uneven at Grand Lukullus Hotel 4. Reviews mention that in the building in which the reception is located, new generation refrigerators.  They do not turn off when you leave the room and pull out the magnetic key card.  In addition, in this building, at least on the second floor, it pulls excellent free Wi-Fi.  Other guests can also connect to the World Wide Web for free, but they will have to go with their laptops to the reception.  They clean the rooms every day and change their linen twice a week. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand lukullus Hotel Kemer" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/434114.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Like many resort hotels Turkey is proud of, Grand Lukullus Hotel 4 <strong> </strong>  Practices the all-inclusive system.  This means that you will be fed breakfast, lunch, dinner, and during the break between these meals at your service tea or coffee with cakes.  In two bars (one at the pool, and the second at the lobby) you will be poured soft drinks, cocktails or locally produced alcohol free of charge.  But here tequila, Russian vodka or French cognacs - already for a fee.  The restaurant has a closed room with three hundred seats, and a spacious veranda in the fresh air, which can accommodate up to two hundred people.  As you can see, there is more than enough space for a small hotel.  The buffet format allows you to try everything or enjoy a favorite dish.  The chef pleases everyone: both lovers of Turkish cuisine, and those who are tormented by nostalgia for their native soup and dumplings.  And, as is usual in sunny Turkey, not a single meal can do without desserts and fruits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Grand Lukullus hotel 4" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/434115.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Pools and baths </h2><p>  Hotel Grand Lukullus Hotel <strong> </strong>  - resort, receives tourists mainly in the warm season.  Pools on site will help you get a boost of freshness.  The largest of them is located next to the veranda of the restaurant.  This is very convenient: if you do not want to change clothes for lunch, you can eat your lunch right by the pool.  For younger guests there is a small "paddling pool" with a slide.  Both pools are surrounded by sun loungers with mattresses and umbrellas, which hotel guests can use absolutely free.  But beach towels are not issued here, so you need to bring your own.  If you want to swim in peace and quiet, there is an indoor pool at your disposal.  But the water in it is more invigorating, because it does not warm up in the sun.  The Turks can not imagine themselves without baths.  And for its guests, the hotel administration provides for free use a jacuzzi, a steam hammam and a Finnish sauna. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer Grand lukullus Hotel 4" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/434117.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  We have already mentioned that this four-star hotel is not located on the first line.  The sea is six hundred meters from the Grand Lukullus Hotel.  Kemer <strong> </strong>  and Goynuk in particular has pebble beaches, but there is also a 150-meter strip of sand.  There and carries its guests a free transfer from the hotel.  Minibuses depart at a time convenient for vacationers - immediately after breakfast, and return by lunch.  It should be noted that 600 meters is not such a distance that it was difficult to overcome on foot, especially since the path runs through a beautiful green area.  All beaches in Turkey are free, but this does not apply to ammunition for a comfortable sunbath.  A sunbed with a mattress and an umbrella will cost you three dollars a day.  You will be given a ticket with which you can leave the beach and return again.  Sunset at sea gentle, very comfortable.  A narrow strip of small pebbles at the very edge of the water is covered by a wooden path. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand lukullus hotel 4 kemer" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/434118.jpg" width="500"></div>
