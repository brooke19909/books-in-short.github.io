The island is located in the Ionian Sea and belongs to Greece.  Should I go here on vacation, what to do on the island and what are the reviews about Zakynthos (Greece) - read the article. </p><h2>  A bit of island history </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.beautiful-views.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zakynthos island" class="if uuid-2282118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2282118.jpg"></div><p>  Zakynthos was called the son of King Phrygia Dardan.  It was in his honor that this heavenly place was named.  According to Greek myths, the island was conquered by the grandfather of the famous Odyssey.  Since Zakynthos (Greece) kept a neutral side during a long period of Greco-Roman wars, he was given autonomy.  At the end of the XII century, this land was conquered by the Venetians, who really liked the area.  Only in 1797 their domination was interrupted by the French. </p><p>  Since 1813, Great Britain rules here.  A few decades later, the island was given to Greece.  Chanted by poets born on the island, Zakynthos passed from hand to hand, suffered from invasions of pirates and earthquakes, but did not lose its pristine beauty.  Reviews about Zakynthos Island in Greece come to one thing: the magical atmosphere of the place envelops travelers from the first second of their stay and never lets go. </p><h2>  What is the weather like on the island? </h2><p>  Most of the year the sun shines on Zakynthos, so tourists come here at any time.  In summer it is hot and dry, but the breeze from the sea gives tourists comfort.  In July, the thermometer rises to +32 ¬∞ C.  In the winter months, the daily temperature does not fall below +14 ¬∞ C, such weather is convenient for sightseeing holidays.  Rains are rare. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="37.7870331" data-lng="20.899875899999984" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/8/1/981.png"></div><p>  How to get to the wonderful Ionian island?  In the high season from May to October, charters from Moscow and St. Petersburg fly here.  At other times, they fly to Greece (Zakynthos) with a transfer in the capital of the country.  You can also get from Athens by train or bus to Kilini, and then transfer by ferry. </p><h2>  What can be seen on Zakynthos? </h2><p>  Most of the local attractions are classified as natural, but there are also interesting architectural buildings.  This includes the temple of Dionysius, built at the beginning of the XX century.  It was built with such care that it survived the 1953 earthquake, when most of the buildings were destroyed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.adventurous-travels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="temple of Dionysius" class="if uuid-2282148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2282148.jpg"></div><p>  The three-nave temple is built in the Venetian style.  Next to it is a 40-meter bell tower with an observation deck.  The relics of St. Dionysius are kept in the temple, which can be attached to. </p><p>  The Church of St. Nicholas Mola is located on Solomu Square.  This is the oldest construction site erected in 1561.  During the earthquake, she was severely damaged, but the restoration did not radically change her appearance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another ancient attraction of Zakynthos (Greece) is the Monastery of the Virgin Anaphonitria, which is currently inactive, but allows tourists into its walls.  The church is interesting in its unusual appearance for Zakynthos: three-nave basilicas and a roof made of wood.  Inside is a relic - the icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary, saved from the Turks. </p><p>  Near the monastery lies the village of Anafonitria, people come here to see the real, not tourist Zakynthos (Greece). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.greece.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Anafonitria village" class="if uuid-2282153" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2282153.jpg"></div><h2>  Zakynthos Marine Reserve </h2><p>  The national marine park on the island was opened in 1999 and is the only park of its kind in all of Greece.  The main purpose of the reserve is to protect the beaches on which the Caretta tortoise lays its eggs.  The museum at the park sets the task of environmental awareness of visitors. </p><p>  The reserve territory includes a large number of coastal lands with a developed ecosystem; populations of Mediterranean seals even live here. </p><p>  Since turtles laying eggs love peace and solitude, there are strict rules for tourists in the park.  Staying here after sunset and lit lanterns and bonfires are prohibited.  It is strictly forbidden to litter and drive to the beach by car or bicycle.  In the reserve you can not make noise, play with the ball or rackets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.villas-cavo-marathia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Caretta Turtle" class="if uuid-2282158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2282158.jpg"></div><p>  If you built sand castles on the beach while leaving, destroy them, as they can become an obstacle for turtles. </p><h2>  The beaches and bays of the island </h2><p>  The main wealth of Zakynthos (Greece) is its wonderful beaches.  The coastline stretched 123 kilometers.  The most visited beach on the island is called Shipwreck Beach or Navagio Bay.  On the soft white sand, which tourists love so much, there is a ship of smugglers, thrown here during a storm.  You can get to the beach only from the sea, it is best to rent a boat for this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moco-choco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zakynthos Bay" class="if uuid-2282137" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2282137.jpg"></div><p>  Gerakas Beach is located in the southern part of Zakynthos.  It is part of a marine reserve, which means that here you can see a carriage turtle.  The warm <span>turquoise sea</span> and magnificent views attract many travelers here. </p><p>  The beaches of the resort of Civil are surrounded by vineyards and olive gardens.  A large number of bars, clubs and shops are also concentrated here. </p><p>  There are no truly picturesque and wonderful beaches in the city.  Therefore, tourists go to the places described above.

You can find the building in the island's capital on Solomos Square. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Byzantine Muses" class="if uuid-2282161" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/2282161.jpg"></div><p>  The Solomu and Kalvu Museum is located on St. Mark's Square.  It is interesting for the manuscripts of the poets who lived here, and their portraits.  On the ground floor even the remains of the creators, whose names are called the museum, are stored. </p><p>  If you come to the village of Pigadakya, you can get acquainted with the traditional way of life of the settlement in Zakynthos and agriculture.
