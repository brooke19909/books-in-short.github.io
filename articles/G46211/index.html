    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Tourists should be prepared for a number of negative moments that they may encounter at the Blue Sea Interpalace 4 * hotel (Tenerife).  Reviews pay attention to the following facts: </p><ul><li>  old and shabby furniture in the rooms; </li><li>  Wireless Internet is intermittent (this also applies to a paid signal); </li><li>  every day the breakfast menu is repeated; </li><li>  if you are resting on an all-inclusive system, then an unpleasant surprise for you will be that drinks are not served during dinner (they can be obtained only for an additional fee); </li><li>  the adjacent territory is very small (almost absent); </li><li>  the staff does not speak Russian, which makes it difficult to resolve organizational issues; </li><li>  the hotel is far from the beach; </li><li>  paid use of the safe; </li><li>  windows of rooms located on the lower floors overlook the fence or wall of a neighboring hotel; </li><li>  old carpet, which is dotted with stains; </li><li>  poor insulation, due to which you will hear all the noise from the neighboring rooms, as well as from the corridor; </li><li>  gray, washed towels with holes; </li><li>  old small TVs that work with interference; </li><li>  on the beach - dark sand that sticks to a swimsuit and stains it; </li><li>  most plates in a restaurant with chips; </li><li>  there is no private beach, and on the municipal sunbeds and umbrellas are paid; </li><li>  hotel employees are forbidden to jump into the pool; </li><li>  through the ventilation, smells of food from the restaurant penetrate into the room (and this problem is present in all rooms, regardless of where they are located); </li><li>  uncomfortable road to the sea (you have to overcome many steps); </li><li>  elevators do not work well (it is faster and safer to climb stairs on foot); </li><li>  the hotel does not have its own gym (guests can visit the fitness centers of neighboring institutions, but this service will be paid for them). </li></ul><p>  The hotel described above provides travelers with all the opportunities for a good rest.  And the location on a hill provides beautiful views.  Nevertheless, such a dislocation has its drawbacks.  So, the road down to the beach and back to the mountain can be difficult for guests with children and the elderly. </p>
