This will require the necessary ingredients and a special form.  You can purchase components for making bombs both in the store and by ordering online.  Made at home with the help of well-known components, they will give a lot of positive emotions when taking a bath. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a bomb" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11969/158956.jpg" width="375"></div>  It should be noted that at first the manufacturing process can get out of control, and the quality of the finished product will leave much to be desired.  The bomb can crumble in your hands, not hiss in the water.  But over time, having adapted, you can easily get a product of excellent quality.

    <p>  Speaking about how to make a bomb, you should voice all the components that will be needed in its manufacture.  These are sea salt, citric acid, baking soda, base oils, dyes (optional), perfumes.  You should also prepare mixing utensils, a spoon and gloves.  To get colored bombs, soda or sea salt should be painted in the desired color in advance.  If the goal is to create a white product, this procedure can be neglected.  <span>Base oils are</span> selected according to preference.  For example, <span>shea butter</span> moisturizes the skin well, and <span>apricot</span> kernel <span>oil</span> easily copes with irritations and inflammations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY bombs" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11969/158951.jpg" width="535"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Anyone can make bombs with their own hands.  Their main difference from those bought in the store is that they add the ingredients (fragrance or oil) that you need.  They freeze in a few hours, and when they are made in the morning, by the evening you can treat yourself to a relaxing bath.  Allowed to add rose petals, calendula flowers, mint leaves.  Fragrances are allowed to be replaced with essential oils to enhance the effect and aroma. </p><p>  The classic bath bomb is made as follows: </p><p>  - 2 parts of baking soda are mixed with one part of citric acid.  This means that, for example, 5 tablespoons of the second are added to 10 tablespoons of the first ingredient.  Mix components, grind using a blender or coffee grinder. </p><p>  - Add to the mixture 1 part of the filler (for example, milk powder) and 0.25 parts of the base oil, as well as a few drops of perfume.  Mix everything, grind, fill the molds, strongly tamping the mass, leave the product for 10-12 hours. </p><p>  Remove the finished bomb, smooth the junction, removing all unnecessary. </p><p>  In order to understand how to make a bomb, it is advisable to attend master classes or ask advice from those who have long been practicing such a lesson.  Having talked with such people, you often find out a lot of little tricks.  For example, most often in recipes it is said that one part of the oil should be used for one part of salt and citric acid.  In reality, bombs made in this way tend to crumble.  Experienced craftswomen say that you should try to add less base oil, at least half.  Then less moisture is obtained, and the product retains its shape and properties.  Changes to the recipes are made empirically, so the question is: "How to make a bomb so that it does not fall apart?"  - it is advisable to ask experienced people.  Another of the little nuances is filling both halves of the mold at once and tamping the mixture.  If you first fill one half, and then perform similar manipulations with the other, there is a risk that the finished product will split into just two parts at the junction. </p><p>  If you plan to make such a thing in order to present to a friend or relative, you should take care of packaging the finished product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a paper bomb" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11969/158957.jpg" width="375"></div>  If you make a paper bomb and place a ball or heart in it for taking a bath, it will turn out very original.  Your ingenuity will certainly be appreciated.
