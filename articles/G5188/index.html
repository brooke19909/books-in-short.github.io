The same thing happens with smartphones, whose market is literally oversaturated.  Despite the existence of a huge number of gadgets, among them there is always one that stands out from the crowd and plays a special role.  Such a device is the <span>Apple iPhone</span> SE, an overview of which is described below. </p><p>  This phone is the quintessence of all the best that has been created on the laptop market.  The most powerful set of technical innovations, balancing with a compact body, which at one time became a living classic.  And despite the fact that the Apple iPhone SE, whose reviews are very controversial, does not fit the current standards, it still deserves special attention from all fans of mobile phones. </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Speaking about its configuration, it is difficult to note any innovations - everything that was bundled with the iPhone 5s lies here.  In the white box that has become familiar and familiar to many, in addition to the device itself, there are: </p><ol><li>  Brochure with instructions for using the device. </li><li>  Power supply for charging from the mains. </li><li>  USB cable on Lightning (yes, the one that breaks so often). </li><li>  <span>EarphonesPods</span> with a 3.5 mm jack. </li><li>  And as always, without changes, two company stickers with the company logo. </li></ol><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The appearance of the device is impressive.  Marked by an era of design, many users still consider it ideal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Smartphone Apple</span> iPhone SE has a body made of aluminum, with two plastic inserts for the antenna.  Most of the front panel is occupied by the display.  Below is the Home button with a first-generation Touch ID sensor, and above is a peephole of the front camera with motion and lighting sensors.  There are sound controls on the left side, on the right side is a SIM card slot, on the top side is a power button.  At the bottom of the device, as usual, there is a charging connector and a headphone port. </p>

    <p>  There are two small differences from the previous generation.  Firstly, the edges of the device are no longer polished, they are matte.  Secondly, the phone is available in the new Apple iPhone SE Rose Gold configuration.  This is a new color scheme in the manner of the iPhone 6s.  The remaining colors are also in place.  There are classic silver, gold and Apple iPhone SE Space Gray, first debuted in the iPhone 5s. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The phone has a tiny, by modern standards, display.  The diagonal of the display panel is 4 inches, and its resolution is 1136 by 640 pixels (326 dpi, Retina standard).  Moreover, according to customer reviews, it has high contrast and brightness, has excellent viewing angles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The touchscreen is capacitive, works without a single hang and is perfectly calibrated.  The glass covering the screen is protected from glare and has <span>an oleophobic coating,</span> thanks to which no fingerprints remain on the screen. </p><p>  The display of the device is its main plus and minus.  After the release of iPhone 6, many have lost the habit of compact gadgets, preferring ‚Äúphablets‚Äù.  For this reason, the output of a device with such a form factor looks strange, but it does not have a single competitor in this category. </p>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  According to experts, this unit is the most productive among competitors.  The heart of the smartphone was the chip of 2015 - Apple A9, the processor is equipped with two productive cores, the frequency of each can reach 1800 megahertz.  In addition, this chip is the most energy efficient.  Also in the smartphone Apple iPhone SE received the Apple M9 coprocessor, which is responsible for reading data on the device‚Äôs movement on an ongoing basis (even in the off state, the phone is able to count the steps taken).  Thanks to the M9, the device can turn on the display simply when lifting the device. </p><p>  According to reviews, this smartphone is able to take on absolutely any task.  There is no such game or application that would not run on the new iPhone.  The phone is equipped with the latest technology and earns the highest scores in synthetic tests.  In addition, the iPhone SE is even faster than its older brother, which is the iPhone 6s, due to a more modest resolution. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Many consumers are confused by Apple‚Äôs policy regarding the memory introduced in the described device.  It comes in two configurations.  Basic - Apple iPhone SE 16 gb - this is the minimum amount of memory.  The system takes an average of two to three gigabytes, so the user has 12 gigabytes to fit his needs.  Apple suggests using iCloud storage to store photos, music and documents. </p><p>  There is a more advanced configuration - Apple iPhone SE 64gb.  This should be enough for most admirers of these smartphones (it will contain a huge number of games, full-length films, many music albums and so on), but at the same time they will have to lay out a tidy sum on top.  And the price difference between devices with different memory sizes, by the way, reaches $ 100 (in Russian realities, these values ‚Äã‚Äãare even more frightening). </p>

    <p>  As for RAM, the situation here is a little brighter.  The phone found a place for two gigabytes of RAM.  Given the fact that the phone is based on the iOS mobile operating system, it is safe to say that there will be no sudden data loss.  Applications are kept in memory for as long as the tabs in the browser. </p><h2>  Shooting quality </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Apple is actively praising the capabilities of the camera of its creation, the photo module, judging by the reviews, has always been a weak point of the Cupertino smartphone.  On the back of the phone is a lens with a resolution of 12 megapixels, with autofocus and the ability to shoot branded ‚Äúlive photos‚Äù and slow-motion video at 60 frames per second.  In good light, the camera takes excellent photos with realistic color reproduction, but once you get into a poorly lit area, problems begin: excessive graininess, color loss.  Only faces look good thanks to a double flash. </p><p>  <span>The front camera</span> has remained the same, only 1.2 megapixels, which is unlikely to please the queens of selfies, but will more than cover all the requirements of fans to talk on Skype and FaceTime.  But the phone got a frontal flash, while pressing the shutter, the phone‚Äôs display lights up, reaching maximum brightness, and highlights the user's face. </p>

    <h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  In addition to being the leader among the most powerful smartphones, the phone also ranks first in terms of autonomy.  Indeed, despite the modest battery capacity of 1642 milliampere-hours, the iPhone SE can rightfully be considered the longest-running. </p><p>  Apple experts said that the phone is able to live 10 hours without recharging in talk mode.  And according to reviews, these 10 hours can easily turn into 12-13, which cannot but rejoice, given the modest dimensions of the case.  Also, the operating system, which actively extinguishes any activity in the background so that harmful applications do not eat up the charge, favorably affects the operating time. </p><p>  Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), the phone is not equipped with fast charging technology.  But here consumers give justice to the fact that a lot of time will not be required for it (with such and such a battery capacity).  According to reviews, the iPhone charges on average per hour. </p><h2>  Wireless interfaces </h2><p>  There is no reason to doubt that the new smartphone from Apple supports all modern communication standards.  At the same time, you should know something about the Apple iPhone SE.  User reviews unambiguously hint that not all models work in Russian LTE networks. </p><p>  This is a long-standing problem that appeared in the iPhone 5, when devices that did not pass Rostest did not support domestic networks.  For this reason, users should pay attention to the Apple iPhone SE a1723, which is an international model that works in all ranges. </p><p>  There should be no problems with other interfaces.  The phone has both the latest Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, which works at all modern frequencies. </p>

    <h2>  operating system </h2><p>  Apple has always inspired everyone with the dogma that someone who is serious about hardware development should also deal with software for it, so all Apple's mobile devices are running iOS.  The Apple iPhone SE was no exception.  An overview of all the functions of the system would take too much time, therefore in this article we will focus only on the main features of the system and the innovations of iOS 10. </p><p>  According to reviews, the main distinguishing feature of iOS has always been its stability.  The system crashes less often than any other consumer software product, which is why it gained its reputation.  And iOS 10 only confirms this fact. </p><p>  The new version of the operating system has acquired a ton of new features.  For example, a completely updated application "Music", the ability to use stickers in a standard messenger, a wide selection of widgets and a completely modified lock screen.  Also, one of the most long-awaited innovations appeared, namely the ability to delete standard applications, such as Mail, Safari, Notes, Reminders, and many others. </p><h2>  Apple iPhone SE: reviews </h2><p>  When you are a market leader, in addition to a huge base of fans, you will gain the same army of haters, so finding objective reviews about a product from California is quite difficult. </p><p>  Let's move on to the main shortcomings that Apple iPhone SE users complain about: </p><ul><li>  Price is the first on the list and perhaps the most significant drawback.  Users have always complained about the pricing offered by Apple, and the cost of a smartphone seems to many overpriced. </li><li>  The amount of base memory.  Another important drawback is the modest amount of memory and the lack of support for memory cards.  This approach of the corporation often forces users to purchase the Apple iPhone SE 64gb. </li><li>  Closed operating system.  Oddly enough, but after so many years, people still are not accustomed to Apple‚Äôs policies, stably complaining that the system cannot work with torrent clients and is closely connected with iTunes.  In general, this is a problem for all lovers of pirated content. </li></ul><p>  Of the advantages, users distinguish a compact case.  The gadget lies perfectly in the hand and is also perfectly controlled.  In addition, users have a positive opinion about the speed of the device, continuous operation on a single charge and stability of the operating system.  The multi-touch display is also impressive - not a single gadget in the world can boast such precision of clicks, which is especially noticeable with fast typing.  Among the distinguishing features of the phone, one can single out an NFC chip, with which you can pay in all trading networks where contactless payments PayPass and PayWave are supported. </p>

    <h2>  Apple iPhone SE: price </h2><p>  Prices for the device vary depending on the configuration: </p><ul><li>  iPhone SE with a basic memory capacity (16 gigabytes) - 34,990 rubles; </li><li>  iPhone SE with an increased memory capacity (64 gigabytes) - 39,990 rubles. </li></ul><p>  On the gray market, the device can be found for a much smaller amount - from 26 thousand rubles (the price may differ not only because of the difference in the amount of main memory, but also depending on the color). </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  In general, the Apple iPhone SE has become just such a fairly simple, but high-quality.  Reviews are reviews, but they do not always convey the essence, therefore you should independently study the capabilities of the device and, as they say, hold it in your hands.  In any case, the iPhone is the iPhone - with its flaws and benefits that do not change from year to year and are familiar to everyone.  The phone should be taken by all those who are bored of compact flagships that can give odds to any ‚Äúphablet‚Äù that has taken a strong position in the premium device segment. </p>
