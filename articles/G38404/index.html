    <p>  A visit to Kizhi is included in the routes of popular river cruises, invariably passing along Lake Onega.  Its area, along with islands of the most varied length and shape, is 9930 square meters.  km  The Pearl of Zaonezhye is rightfully considered the Kizhi archipelago.  This intricate and complex maze of picturesque islands of Onega skerries was called by travelers "Zaonezhskaya Hellas."  Its relatively small territory allows you to get acquainted with typical landscapes for Karelia, interesting monuments of nature, history and architecture.  In this amazing place is a real miracle of architecture - an architectural complex, known far beyond the borders of the region. </p><h2>  History of Kizhi Island </h2><p>  The island has a fairly rich history.  It was here that the first settlements on the archipelago arose.  The first mention of the Kizhi churchyard, uniting several villages, was discovered by scientists in the scribe book of 1582-1583.  In the XVI century, the island became the center of the Spassky churchyard, which included 130 villages.  The word "graveyard" in ancient Russia meant a large settlement with a temple and a cemetery.  Once it was the center of the cultural, spiritual, as well as economic life of the district.  Fairs, national gatherings and various holidays were held here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The name Kizhi comes from the Veps word kisi, which means "merrymaking."  Probably, once on the island Finno-Ugric tribes held certain pagan actions. </p><h2>  Open-air museum </h2><p>  In 1990, UNESCO replenished the World Heritage List with another valuable asset, which was the Kizhi reserve.  Karelia in the preliminary list represents another natural and cultural complex - the Valaam Archipelago.  The priceless historical objects can also be replenished with unique petroglyphs of the region. </p>

    <p>  Kizhi island is known as one of the most popular open-air museums in Russia.  Unique wooden architecture is presented here, which is the pinnacle of carpentry.  Perhaps the source of inspiration for the ancient architects was the diversity and picturesqueness of nature, extraordinary for the northern latitudes.  It is worth noting that the buildings of the Kizhi graveyard, different in shape and height, perfectly blend in with the harsh northern landscape. </p><h2>  Historical and architectural ensemble </h2>

    <p>  The ancient fence of the churchyard, erected in the middle of the XVII century, has not been preserved to this day.  On the model of the remaining wooden fortifications, a modern fence was recreated, similar to the one that surrounded the ancient fortress. </p><p>  In 1966, the unique architectural ensemble was supplemented by a unique environment and the state ethnographic and historical-architectural museum was opened.  Religious wooden buildings were transported here: chapels, churches, mills, peasant houses and other structures.  When examining the graveyard, you can get acquainted with the many household items of that time.  These are ancient handwritten books, icons, furniture, utensils, dishes, various tools. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Negative weather and climate factors adversely affect the state of the wooden relic, thereby causing concern of experts.  In order to avoid the destruction of the unique buildings of the Kizhi ensemble, a comprehensive restoration program was developed and is being successfully implemented. </p><h2>  Times of the "distant past" </h2><p>  No wonder the Russian North is called a treasury of monuments of wooden architecture.  One of the outstanding masterpieces of craftsmen is Kizhi Pogost.  Such a wealth of forms and indefatigable building imagination is rarely seen.  The fabulous temple city rises above the gray surface of the northern waters, its tall wooden buildings are visible from afar.  A unique panorama opens to the gaze of tourists aboard cruise ships regularly visiting the island of Kizhi.  How to get there <strong> </strong>  to a place fanned by the breath of "distant antiquity"? </p><h2>  The road to Kizhi </h2><p>  Kizhi is an island lost in the labyrinths of the skerries of Lake Onega.  It is protected from all sides from waves that quite often play out on the open expanses of Onego.  Water in the spring in coastal shallow water quickly warms up and is freed from the ice cover.  All this favored the arrangement of ship parking in Kizhi.  How to get to the island? </p>
