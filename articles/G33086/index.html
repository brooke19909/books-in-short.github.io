It was built at the time of the 1000th anniversary of the adoption of Islam.  Oddly enough, but it was erected during the Soviet Union, when atheism flourished throughout the country, but this corner just then became the place for the Tatars to unite. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The unique Zababannaya mosque (Kazan) stands on the site of the historically famous Kulmametov mosque, one of the first structures of this type erected in Tatarstan. </p><p>  This mosque is not only one of the places of pilgrimage for Muslims, but also an important historical site that interests many foreign tourists who come to the city of Kazan.  It was built in 1914 according to the project of the engineer-architect Pechnikov and is located on the eastern shore of Lake Kaban, from the name of which its name arose - the Zababannaya mosque. </p><p>  Address: Kazan, st.  Hadi Taktasha, 26. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Conquered Mosque" class="if" height="498" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1974458.jpg" width="481"></div>

    <h2>  Brief historical information </h2><p>  The following historical fact is interesting: it was decided to erect a Muslim temple on the right bank of the Kaban River, which at that time was Russian land.  In addition, this is the only such structure built under the Soviet government. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How was the construction going?  In 1912, representatives of religion developed a historical plan for the transition to the adoption of Islam.  The mosque was designed by Eugene Pechnikov, a well-known engineer-architect.  The three-level minaret of the Zababannaya Mosque became a reflection of 3 stages in the life of the Volga Bulgars: pre-Islamic, medieval and new. </p><p>  The construction of a Muslim temple has become one of the parts of this project.  By 1914, when only madrassas were built, the process was suspended by the events of the First World War.  The mosque only opened in 1926 after receiving permission from Joseph Stalin (in more detail below in the article).  However, after 4 years, the country's authorities issued a decision to close the temple, after which the Muslim crescent was removed from the minaret, as well as from all such religious buildings, and instead the Soviet flag was hoisted.  Such at that time was the policy of the state. </p><p>  After the Second World War, the building was set aside for school and kindergarten.  Then DOSAAF was located in it, and in 1991 the mosque was again returned to the Muslim community.  There are suggestions that this was made possible thanks to Ishak Lutfullin, a fighter for the rights of the Tatars.  After returning to the temple the old name, he reopened his doors to visitors.  There is an evening school at the mosque. </p><p>  Since then, the building has not undergone any changes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zababannaya mosque (Kazan)" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1974559.jpg"></div>

Its official name is the Mosque of the 1000th anniversary of the adoption of Islam. </p><p>  During the construction of the mosque, the style of romantic Art Nouveau interspersed with oriental Muslim motifs was used.  There is one hall in the mosque, the location of the minaret is angular.  The building is two-story: on the first floor - a prayer hall, training rooms - on the second floor. </p><p>  The high quad of the minaret has an octagonal trunk, which quietly goes into the light cylinder.  At the very top it is crowned with a lancet dome with a laced carved cornice.  The mosque is decorated with a unique minaret shape, perfectly combined with curved and step platbands, archival windows and unusual portals. </p><p>  The romantic style in combination with Muslim oriental motifs gives the Zababannaya Mosque a special national flavor.  The combination of styles adds to the architecture of the building the Arab-Moorish notes of the Middle Ages.  The walls are made of red brick with green ceramic inlays. </p><p>  Like many years ago, the main function is performed by the ground floor, where a bright and spacious prayer room is located.  On the second floor, training sessions are held. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zababannaya mosque: photos" class="if" height="430" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1974462.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  About an amazing historical fact </h2><p>  In 1922, a Muslim delegation from the city of Kazan finally achieved a meeting with Joseph Stalin (at that time the people's commissar for nationalities) and convinced him - in some strange way!  - give permission to build a mosque. </p><p>  This fact to this day is surprising, given the attitude to religion at that time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zababannaya mosque: address" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1974560.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It is known that the revival of the Zababannaya Mosque is due to Ishaq Lotfullin, a former artillery lieutenant colonel.  In the period of the 80-90s of the XX century, he took an active part in the national Tatar movement and made a lot of efforts to return to the faithful many mosques in Kazan.  After serving in the army, the energetic Hazrat Ishaq entered the Ufa Madrassah as a simple shakird, but later became the imam of the Zababannaya mosque.  He died in 2007. </p><p>  In conclusion, we note that the Muslim mosque is located almost next to the Catholic church, built to mark the 1000th anniversary of Kazan, and the Intercession Church of the Russian Old Believer Orthodox Church.  And this is pretty symbolic ... </p>
