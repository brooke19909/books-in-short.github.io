Beautiful places in <span>Moscow in winter</span> are found at every step, starting from Red Square, surrounded by unique buildings, ending with parks that are located on the outskirts.  Well, let's not hesitate and right now we will go on a virtual winter tour of the capital. </p><h2>  The most famous place - Gorky Park </h2><p>  If on the day off the question of where to go for a walk in Moscow in winter, got an edge due to the lack of ideas, go to the world famous Gorky park.  Here, in addition to attractions, a huge ice rink is functioning.  15,000 square meters are divided into different zones.  In one of them, trained instructors teach young children to stay on the ice, ride back and forth, and spin in place.  Girls most often go to the dance rink.  There is a full-fledged disco under an open winter sky, with incendiary music and light shows.  Sports enthusiasts do not miss the opportunity to visit a hockey rink.  Amateur competitions are held here constantly, and anyone can take part in them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to go in winter in Moscow" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/709065.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  On the old streets </h2><p>  When it snows, the center of Moscow is especially beautiful.  Where to take a walk in winter without traveling far beyond the Garden Ring?  There are plenty of places!  Firstly, in the city center there are countless skating rinks.  This indicator changes annually, but on average their number approaches 30. If the weather is snowy, you can get new impressions simply by walking along the city streets.  Old Arbat, Prestizhenka, Ostozhenka and many other streets, which are surrounded by ancient museum houses, will be an excellent route for walking.  Walk along the alleys and at the same time ride on skates at Chistye or Patriarchy Ponds.  It is always very beautiful here, and it is likely that it is in such places that two times combine - the past and the present. </p>
