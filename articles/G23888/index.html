It is located in the central part of the Bay of Biscay, and not far from it is the island of Re - the largest of the French islands.  It is famous for its sandy beaches and clean air. </p><h2>  A brief history of the city </h2><p>  La Rochelle in France was founded in the X century.  In the XII-XIII centuries, he became a stronghold of the Knights Templar, who organized a large port in it.  From the Templars in La Rochelle, the street of the same name remained.  Until the 15th century, the city was the largest port on the entire Atlantic coast.  Traded mainly in wine and salt. </p><p>  In France, La Rochelle was also known as the main city of the Huguenots.  Thanks to this, peace and prosperity reigned in him.  But in 1622, the <span>Duke de Guise</span> destroyed the Huguenot fleet.  In 1627, the siege of La Rochelle began, which ended in the capture of the city in 1628.  The persecution of the Huguenots began, most of which took refuge in North America.  There they founded New La Rochelle.  Later in France, La Rochelle played an important role in the development of trade relations between Africa, North America and other European countries. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.espace-investissement.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="evening city" class="if uuid-2548775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/2548775.jpg"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The climate in La Rochelle and the surrounding area is temperate.  Snow falls very rarely in these parts, but the rainy season can last up to three months.  Tourists visit this city all year round, but it is best to come to La Rochelle in the summer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thanks to the sea air, it is not hot in these parts.  In summer, the weather pleases vacationers, so most tourists try to come to La Rochelle at this time of year.  Autumn is a period of strong winds and rains, the ocean is becoming restless, and the tides are becoming more powerful.  Of course, this weather is not entirely conducive to walking, so it is best to visit museums and other sights of France in La Rochelle. </p><p>  Spring begins in March, the temperature gets higher, but the water is still cold for swimming.  However, the waves do not interfere with walking along the Old Port.  There are not many tourists, but the weather already allows you to go boating and enjoy the sights. </p><p>  Despite the fact that there is practically no snow in winter, the weather is not very comfortable this season, as strong winds blow and it rains.  Air temperature rarely drops to zero.  But not all tourists come only in the summer and spring, so in bad weather you can see the expositions of local museums, visit the magnificent gourmet restaurants or colorful establishments that serve local dishes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cars-saintlaurent.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.cars-saintlaurent.com/nos-sorties-dune-journee/11-la-rochelle.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="La Rochelle landmark" class="if uuid-2548791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54146/2548791.jpg"></div><h2>  Old port </h2><p>  What to see in La Rochelle?  Of course, the famous Old Port.  At the entrance are two towers: Saint-Nicolas and La-Chen.  There is also a third watchtower - La Lantern, but it was most often used as a lighthouse.
