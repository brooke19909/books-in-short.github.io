Barcelo Tiran Sharm 5 *: reviews and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Egypt has been and remains the most affordable <span>holiday destination abroad.</span>  Cuba and the Dominican Republic, Thailand and the Maldives are beyond the means of many.  Egypt is attractive not only for its relatively low prices.  A short flight, a visa ‚Äúupon arrival‚Äù, excellent climatic conditions (not everyone succeeds in catching rain), memorials of hoary antiquity and the wonders of the Red Sea - all these factors turn the country in North Africa into a Mecca for tourists.  But where to go on vacation in Egypt?  You should not think that you have no choice: they say that there are only two seaside resorts in the country - Hurghada and Sharm El Sheikh.  These cities stretch along the coast for hundreds of kilometers, overgrown with satellite villages.  And each of them has its own specifics of entertainment, features of the seabed and even its own microclimate.  And this must be remembered when buying permits to Egypt.  Hotels in this country are classified according to the generally accepted scale - by the number of stars.  But they also have their own national specifics.  In this article we will talk about the hotel Barcelo Tiran Sharm 5 *.  Reviews of tourists about the hotel served as an information base for us.  As the name implies, this hotel is located in Sharm El Sheikh.  Therefore, we will touch on the features of this resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Barcelo tiran sharm 5 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/735571.jpg" width="600"></div>

All Inclusive Prices </h2><p>  The main feature of this tourist country is that almost all hotels in coastal resorts practice the All Inclusive system.  This applies to both five-star hotels and lower ranking places.  It is rare to find a hotel with half board.  But with the power "Ultra all inclusive" - ‚Äã‚Äãmore than enough.  This program allows tourists to enjoy their vacation to the fullest.  Alcoholic drinks in the restaurant and bar (including imported ones) are included in the price.  Tour operators recommend that their customers choose a hotel for a trip to Egypt "5 stars".  These are real oases of luxury and bliss amidst the rather spartan life of the local population.  Sharm el Sheikh is a resort for the discerning public.  Below we will discuss why local hotels are more expensive than the same by category (and sometimes by name, if the hotel is a network) of establishments in Hurghada.  Here we only note that all the famous world chains built their representative offices in Sharm.  Fans of glamor claim that you can make amazingly pompous photos against the backdrop of Hilton, Marriott, Sofitel or Hayat.  The price pattern is amazing.  For example, in <span>Dessole Pyramisa Sharm El Sheikh</span> Resort 5 * a double room costs 4700 rubles per night, in Royal Savoy 5 * the same services are estimated at ten thousand, and in Four Seasons Resort 5 * you will have to pay 18900 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="barcelo tiran beach sharm 5" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/735818.jpg" width="600"></div>

A couple of tens of kilometers away is the border with Israel.  This gives tourists vacationing in Sharm a number of advantages.  First: the so-called <span>Sinai visa.</span>  It is free and gives the right to make excursions to Israel.  The second advantage: coral reefs off the coast of Sharma recognized as the most beautiful in the Red Sea.  In some places, a steady wind blows here, which attracts surf lovers.  True, the last two circumstances (coral and fresh breeze) do not like sybarites.  On the beaches of Sharma often need to enter the sea in special shoes, and on the beaches to sunbathe under the cover of wicker barriers.  And this must be taken into account when traveling to Egypt (Charm).  The best hotels compensate for climatic conditions for those who prefer this place to Hurghada.  There are few hotels with three stars.  The lion's share of the hotel base is made up of luxurious fives and very worthy fours.  Tourists leave enthusiastic reviews about the Iberotel Palace 5 * network, the luxurious Magic Life Imperial 5 * and praise Fanara Rosetta 4 *, Albatross Aqua Blue Sharm 4 * and Baron Palms Resort.  Another feature of the resort is that it does not say anything about Egyptian antiquity.  The pyramids, the palace in Luxor, the museum in Cairo are too far away.  But the mountain of Moses (and the whole Holy Land with the Dead Sea inclusive) is very close.  To feel the difference between the two resorts, you can go to Hurghada.  From the port of Sharm el-Sheikh ferry runs.  Travel time is about two hours, a ticket costs forty-five dollars one way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tours to Egypt 5 hotels" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/735784.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Satellites of Sharm El Sheikh </h2><p>  Like Hurghada, the former small village on the <span>Sinai Peninsula has</span> grown tens of kilometers and has acquired suburbs.  Each of them has its own specialization and takes a certain contingent of vacationers.  Those who come here for diving and admiring the underwater world of the Red Sea stop in Nabq or in the immediate vicinity of the Ras Mohammed National Park.  Sybarites, perceiving corals only as a threat to scratch their legs, choose Sharm El Maya Bay.  Its advantage is that there is natural sand everywhere, both on the beach and at the bottom.  Sites completely cleared of corals are also found in Naama Bay.  But in Sharks Bay (which means "Bay of Sharks") and in Ras Umm al-Sid, the reefs begin almost from the threshold of the hotel complex.  For lovers of nightlife coming to Egypt, Sharm, 5 * hotels offer a varied entertainment program.  But if you want to walk outside the walls of the hotels, it is best to choose the Naama Bay area for relaxation.  This is the oldest part of the resort, and the tourist infrastructure here is best developed.  But the city itself with its Arabic flavor is located in Sharm El Maya.  Well, in which village is our hotel Barcelo Tiran Sharm 5 * located?  Reviews indicate that it is located in Nabq, in the northeast of Sharm El Sheikh.  Nearby is the national reserve of the same name, and directly opposite the island of Tiran. </p><h2>  What is Nabq </h2><p>  This is the farthest satellite of Sharm El Sheikh.  It is twenty-five kilometers from the Old City (that is, from Sharm El Maya), and fifteen from the airport.  So, when arriving on a charter flight, be prepared for the fact that you will be the last to be brought to the Barcelo Tiran Sharm 5 * hotel.  But immediately, right from the plane, you will take a fascinating sightseeing tour of the hotels of Sharm el-Sheikh.  You can also independently get out to the Old City or the center of entertainment Naama Bay.  Minibuses shuttle without a schedule, but quite often, travel in them costs one and a half pounds.  Sitting in a taxi, you need to tell the driver: ‚ÄúNabq Bay‚Äù, although there is nothing like a bay in the village: the beaches of Sharm el-Sheikh in this area are flat, and therefore it is often windy on them.  Numerous reviews suggest that lazy people do not need to get into the city.  Nabq has excellent infrastructure and everything you need <span>(cafes, restaurants,</span> night clubs, souvenir shops) can be found on the main street of the village - La Strada.  There is no shortage here in large supermarkets: La Strada, Metro and Al Khan work.  Those who miss the European way of life, can look at the McDonald's or Starbacks coffee shop.  Reviews even claim that buying in Nabq is cheaper than in Naama Bay.  Some five-star hotels offer free buses to La Strada Avenue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="egypt charm best hotels" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/735578.jpg" width="572"></div>

    <h2>  Features of the village of Nabq </h2><p>  The beaches of Sharm El Sheikh amaze with its diversity.  The sand in Naama Bay is replaced by reefs right on the shore in Shark Bay.  Ras Umm al-Side has a very steep entry into the sea.  In Ras Nazran and Pasha Bay generally pontoons and ladders into the water.  This must be borne in mind when going on vacation with young children.  Nabq is the mecca of surfers and divers.  The open coast without bays is determined by the fact that there is where the wind can roam.  In the immediate vicinity of the sandy beach, corals grow.  The bottom is very shallow.  This circumstance allows you to relax in Nabq with children.  They like to dabble in shallow water.  Another feature of the local coast are significant ebbs and flows.  Sometimes you have to stomp more than a hundred meters beyond the depths.  Sea unrest here also happens quite often.  Red and black flags warn of a bathing ban.  But the Barcelo Tiran Sharm Hotel on this, in general disappointing, background looks like a happy exception.  The hotel enjoys a favorable position in a place free from coral.  So there is no need to buy special shoes.  The wind, according to reviews, blows only until noon, and then subsides.  Corals are on the right - snorkelling and diving enthusiasts can swim there.  Although, as tourists assure, lured inhabitants of the reef themselves sail to the beach for a "tribute." </p><h2>  Hotel location in Nabq </h2><p>  There are some tourists for whom the minimum number of stars when they agree to go to Egypt is 5. Barcelo Tiran Sharm, however, satisfies the needs of the most demanding and fastidious customers.  As we mentioned above, the hotel‚Äôs own beach is unique.  This is eight hundred meters of pure <span>quartz sand.</span>  Want to admire the coral?  Go a little to the right - the reef begins almost from the coast.  This hotel is a chain hotel, it belongs to the Barcelo chain.  The hotel is located on the very edge of the village.  Many tourists liked this: the window overlooks the mountains and the sea, and not the neighboring building.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is huge - eighty thousand square meters.  The territory is well-groomed, very green.  Gardeners constantly monitor the garden, although, mentioning the reviews, it is clear that the park was recently established here, the trees are still low, young.  The hotel is built in the shape of a flower.  In the center is the main restaurant, spa and reception, and in different directions the ‚Äúpetals‚Äù buildings diverge.  Everything looks very stylish, especially in the evening, with backlight.  A promenade is laid along the sea, there are swimming pools, tennis courts and a beauty salon.  The hotel positions itself as a place of romantic and family relaxation.  For children, a pool and a mini club are provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Barcelo Tyrant Charm" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/735562.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel accommodation - what awaits guests? </h2><p>  Hotel Barcelo Tiran Beach Sharm 5 * has completely new rooms of the category Family, Superior and Suite.  Each guest room has a balcony with sea or mountain views.  In fact, reviews called it a porch, because it fit a rattan couch, a tea table and chairs.  The rooms are very comfortable, large, with new furniture.  Their equipment corresponds to the declared five stars.  There is air conditioning, a safe, an iron with an ironing board, a set for self-brewing <span>hot drinks</span> (tea, coffee), a TV, a refrigerator.  Even such trifles as a fumigator, scales and clothes brushes are provided.  Every day, hygiene items were replenished in the bathroom.  Cleaned cleanly.  The newlyweds were touched that every night they beautifully made the bed in a romantic manner.  For other tourists, maids made towels with funny figures of elephants, giraffes and swans.  Nobody demanded a tip, and the money did not affect the quality of the cleaning.  Especially a lot of positive emotions brought tourists a welcome.  They meet here with cocktails, take things to the room, issue a password for Wi-Fi in advance.  The soundproofing in the rooms is good, and the audience has a decent rest: no one yells in a drunken voice under the window.  Sounds of evening animation in the rooms are also not heard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="barcelo tiran sharm 5 tours" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/735792.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  The Barcelo Tiran Sharm 5 * hotel tours go mainly from Russia and Ukraine.  Another thirty percent of vacationers are Germans.  Therefore, you will not need to get up at half past five in the morning to take a lounger on the beach or by the pool.  With a certain degree of tolerance, you will spend a wonderful vacation and you will have someone to chat with, even if you do not speak English or German.  Receptionists are also Russian speakers.  Girls will listen to your requests and help to solve all the problems that have arisen.  Animation, as guests' reviews assure, works perfectly.  The guys and girls have a well-developed sense of tact, and no one will forcefully drag you to learn belly dancing.  For children, children's animation works - a mini-club.  Also for younger guests there is a shallow pool.  In the evenings, only a children's disco is arranged, but the animators organize trips to the nightclubs of Sharm el-Sheikh.  However, you can be satisfied with the animated evening show at the hotel itself.  The reviews say it was interesting.  Everyone praises the spa.  There is a windsurfing club on the beach.  You can also fly on a kite.  Wi-Fi is free, but only works in the lobby.  There are several networks there, so the signal is normal.  At the pool, beach towels are issued in exchange for a card.  On the beach there are many sunbeds and wicker screens from the wind. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel barcelo tiran sharm 5" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/735793.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Experienced tourists hardly need to explain what an all-inclusive system is in the Egyptian Five.  The Barcelo Tiran Sharm Hotel has one main buffet restaurant.  Drinks can be enjoyed in the lobby bars, by the pool, on the beach.  The price includes unlimited local alcohol.  In addition, the hotel has three more themed restaurants, working a la carte.  Reviews especially praise the one on the beach.  It specializes in fish and seafood dishes.  As for the quality of food in the main restaurant of the Barcelo Tiran Sharm 5 * hotel, the reviews convey a lot of positive feedback to us.  Breakfast is thought out in such a way that all categories of vacationers are satisfied: for traditionalists there are cereals, sausages, scrambled eggs, granola, yoghurts, and for those who want to try something new there are always cooked dishes of Egyptian cuisine.  Women were delighted with the pastries and the variety of juices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="egypt hotels all inclusive rates" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/735810.jpg" width="600"></div>  Unlike most Egyptian hotels that serve instant coffee for breakfast, lovers of this drink were satisfied with its quality.  They say that you can drink custard from freshly ground grains.  The dinners were very hearty.  The dinners of many tourists were admired because they were all themed.  If a guest had a birthday, the waiters brought him a birthday cake.

    <h2>  Excursions from Barcelo Tiran Sharm 5 * </h2><p>  Reviews strongly recommend not to sit in the walls of the hotel, but to go to get acquainted with local attractions.  Yes, the pyramids and tombs are far from here, but there are many interesting places near by.  Nature lovers will be within easy reach of Nabq National Park.  Snorkeling stops are made along the way.  You can go to the nearby island of Tiran on a beautiful yacht.  The most popular excursion is called climbing the mountain of Moses (the one where the prophet received the tablets of God). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches Charm El Sheikh" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/735627.jpg" width="600"></div> Travel to the monastery of St. Catherine is also in great demand.  Some vacation packages include a tour to the center of Sharm El Sheikh.  Tourists also liked it.  It includes a visit to the local church, mosque, Old Market.  As for the rest of the excursions, they are typical for Egypt: ‚ÄúMarine‚Äù - on a glass bottom boat, ‚ÄúDesert Safari‚Äù on ATVs or jeeps, a trip to a real hammam.  Tourists are taken to Taba, Colored Canyon, Dahab.  In Sharm El Sheikh there are many hotels with water parks, where everyone can enter for a fee.  Closest to Barcelo Tirana is the Sea Club.  But reviews strongly recommend lovers of water rides to visit the Albatross or the Movenpic Golf.  Do not forget that you are in close proximity to Israel.  Excursions to this country can be one-day (to the bordering Eilat) and two-day (visiting Christian shrines and the Dead Sea).
