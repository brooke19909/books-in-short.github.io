  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Abdominal muscles in gymnastics and general physical education</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An interesting group of muscles that are located in humans in the region of the internal digestive organs are the abdominal muscles.  Located between the upper body and the lower aperture of the sternum, they surround <span>the</span> human <span>abdomen</span> , forming strong muscle walls.  Thanks to them, the internal organs of a person are in a certain position, but when moving they have a small amplitude of oscillation. </p><p>  In general physical education and sports, abdominal muscles play a big role, since they directly affect the beauty of the human body.  People who regularly do gymnastics and include exercises to strengthen the abdominal muscles in the complex of exercises do not have problems with a large stomach.  Thanks to modern simulators, many have the opportunity to engage on their own and maintain their health in good condition. </p><p>  The main functions of the abdominal muscles include narrowing the abdominal cavity and exerting a certain pressure on the internal organs.  In addition, the <span>abdominal press</span> (prelum abdominale) also takes part in the acts of urination and defecation, and in the female half of the population, due to these muscles, delivery is ensured. </p><p>  All <span>abdominal muscles</span> are divided into lateral abdominal muscles, front and rear.  Lateral are the largest of them and are several layers that lie on top of each other and are interconnected by tendons.  These are the main muscles that help a person to bend the body in different directions, or rather, return it to its original position, providing flexibility and mobility of the body.  The oblique muscles of the abdomen also play a large role in the rotation of the body, due to which the rotation around the spinal column is carried out, as well as respiratory actions are provided, since these muscles are involved in the exhalation process. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The abdominal muscles also protect the internal organs of the lower body from external influences, since the layers of this muscle group hold the organs in a certain position.  With regular exercise, the abdominal press is in good physical condition and ensures the normal functioning of the internal organs of a person.  If a person‚Äôs stomach begins to grow, this indicates that the internal muscles of the abdomen became relaxed and a metabolic disorder occurred. </p><p>  In the east, a traditionally beautiful figure was supported by women through dance, where, as a result of certain movements, massage of internal organs was carried out, and the muscles became elastic and elastic.  This allowed women not only to maintain the natural beauty of the body, but also to maintain the body in good physical shape. </p><p>  It should be noted that the abdominal muscles should be treated carefully enough and in no case should you strain them.  With heavy and debilitating physical work associated with lifting various weights, abdominal muscles are often injured.  The most common strains, <span>muscle breaks,</span> hernias and other injuries.  To avoid this, in no case should not be given an excessive load on these muscles. </p><p>  Summing up all of the above, it should be noted once again the huge role of the internal muscles of the abdominal press, not only in preserving the beauty of the human body, but also in ensuring the proper functioning of internal organs in the human body.  Abdominal muscles also have a direct effect on flexibility and mobility, which, as <span>Tibetan monks</span> say <span>,</span> is the key to health and longevity.  Therefore, during physical education classes, it is imperative to pay attention to the muscle group of the abdominal muscles and include them in the <span>complex of physical exercises.</span> </p>
