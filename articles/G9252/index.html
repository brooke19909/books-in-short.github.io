This city was highly valued even in Soviet times, but then it was mainly visited by the political elite.  It was very difficult for a mere mortal to get there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gagra Sanatoriums" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/973962.jpg" width="391"></div>

    <p>  Today, times have changed.  Everyone can visit a beautiful city in Abkhazia, it would be only a desire.  If you have it, feel free to pack your trip. </p><h2>  You have 100 reasons for this ... </h2><p>  Unique and unpredictable Gagra!  The Caucasus has always been famous for its hospitality and exotic views.  There are several reasons that make many Russians visit this blessed place.  Experienced tourists consider the main ones: </p><ul><li>  Geographical location.  The Caucasus Mountains surround the city, protecting it from cold winds and preserving the warm sea air, which is extremely useful for people suffering from respiratory diseases. </li><li>  Varied flora.  You will not see many plants in any other Russian region.  Here you can stroll through eucalyptus, lemon, and orange groves. </li><li>  Proximity to the border.  The city of Gagra is located near the border.  It <span>is</span> only 20 km from <span>Adler Airport</span> .  Therefore, there is a unique opportunity not only to admire the <span>sights of Abkhazia,</span> but also to visit Sochi - another famous resort. </li><li>  National <span>cuisine.</span>  <span>Abkhazian</span> dishes are a real gourmet's dream.  There are so many delicacies to try at least once in a lifetime.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter at all what you choose: mamalyga or hodgepodge in Abkhazian style.  Everything will be amazingly delicious. </li><li>  Winemaking.  The city of Gagra is famous for its wines.  These are not the drinks that we used to buy in stores.  Here is a natural wine that is made from the best grapes, without dyes and all kinds of powders.  Want to check the veracity of the famous phrase ‚ÄúTruth in wine‚Äù?  Then you definitely need to go to Gagra. </li><li>  Developed tourist infrastructure.  There is one more advantage that Gagra can boast of - sanatoriums.  There are a lot of them.  Moreover, almost each of them offers not only medical, but also wellness programs.  A good opportunity to combine business with pleasure. </li><li>  A huge kaleidoscope of excursions.  The city has a large number of attractions: both natural and man-made.  To examine them all, it will take a lot of time, but guides will certainly introduce you to the main monuments on your first visit.  In addition, a pleasant surprise awaits you: the prices for excursions in Abkhazia are much lower than in Sochi or Adler. </li></ul>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is all these factors that attract tourists to the southern fairytale city. </p><h2>  Abkhazia or Europe? </h2><p>  What to choose from these two geographical objects, of course, is decided by the tourist himself.  But Gagra has undeniable advantages.  Firstly, to travel to this city, you do not need a visa or a foreign passport, which means that you can save time and nerves.  Secondly, there is no language barrier, so they will easily explain to you where to find the best supermarket or where to have a cultural rest in the evening.  Thirdly, the usual Russian prices in rubles, so you can relax and not worry about the appreciation of currencies. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The city, which later became the best Soviet health resort, has an ancient history.  It was founded by a Greek merchant back in the 2nd century BC.  However, as a resort, he declared himself only at the beginning of the 20th century.  And this is the great merit of a relative of Nicholas II - Prince of Oldenburg.  Locals still cherish the memory of this man.  It becomes clear that one has only to visit the city. </p><h2>  Old and New Gagra </h2><p>  Conventionally, the city can be divided into 2 parts.  Their border runs along the river Tsykherva.  Old areas attract with coziness and intimacy.  This is the historic city center, striking in its picturesqueness and architecture of the beginning of the century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boarding house cote d'azur" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/973972.jpg" width="403"></div>

    <div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  New Gagra is a modern center, the development of which was carried out in Soviet times.  This is where you need to go shopping, as the most famous supermarkets and shopping centers of the city are located in these areas.  There are many restaurants, cafes, water parks and other entertainment venues. </p><p>  An important nuance for tourists planning to visit the city of Gagra: motels and resorts are located mainly in the Old part.  But private mini-hotels and small hotels in New Gagra. </p><h2>  Gagra: resorts and other places of temporary stay </h2><p>  Going on vacation to a foreign city, any tourist wonders about temporary residence.  Gagra in this regard provides a wide variety of options.  Arriving here, any tourist can count on: </p><ul><li>  At the hotel.  For example, Lulu is a private institution that belongs to the economy class.  Alex Beach Hotel, on the contrary, is suitable for those who like discreet luxury. </li><li>  On boarding houses and sanatoriums.  Accommodation in such institutions allows you not only to relax, but also to improve your health.  Among the most famous options are Colchis, Cote d'Azur, Ilios. </li></ul>

    <p>  In addition, you can rent a cottage or apartment.  However, it is worth remembering that in Gagra there is no hot water in the private sector in the summer.  In hotels and resorts, it usually happens all the time. </p><p>  It is advisable to buy a ticket to the sanatorium in advance, especially if you decide to go to Gagra in the high season.  Otherwise, many resorts (for example, "Nart", "Amra") will be inaccessible.  Some of them can be accessed without a pre-purchased ticket. </p><h2>  Pension with own beach </h2><p>  Do you choose a place of residence close to the sea?  Then the Radiant guesthouse is perfect for you.  It has its own beach, on the coastal zone you will find everything tourists need: sunbeds, umbrellas.  And here you can try amazingly delicious coffee, brewed in the sand using a special technology. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúRadiant‚Äù boarding house itself is a cozy and quiet establishment in the area of <span>old Gagra,</span> which is more suitable for families with couples, including children.  The rooms have everything you need: shower, toilet, air conditioning, refrigerator, hairdryer.  The balcony has special furniture so you can enjoy sea views.  The pension offers various excursions, as well as medical procedures.  Perhaps the most popular of these is massage. </p><p>  The price for accommodation from November to May is quite reasonable.  Without food, it will be only 500 rubles per day, in the summer - from 1900. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="prices in Gagra" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/973964.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <p>  Pension "Cote d'Azur" knows how to win the sympathy of guests, according to positive reviews.  The only negative that tourists often talk about is a small playground.  Sometimes it is very crowded. </p><h2>  Prices in Gagra </h2><p>  Many tourists who visited Gagra recognize its merits: nature, cuisine, hospitality, the sea.  But almost all of them, as a minus of their stay at the resort, call its prices. </p><p>  In fact this is not true.  In peak season, the cost of living in hotels and resorts increases.  However, at other times, prices here are quite affordable. </p><p>  The most expensive month is August.  Accommodation will cost 1,500 rubles per day.  Quite a high cost in July - 800 rubles.  But in June and September you can relax for 600 rubles.  The cheapest option is to go to Gagra at the beginning of the beach season.  In May, prices have not yet risen, and a hotel room will cost only 400 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Gagra by the sea" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/973961.jpg" width="341"></div>
