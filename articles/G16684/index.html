    <p>  In addition, the hotel has an afternoon snack.  At the pool serves rolls, ice cream.  And between dinner and lunch, they cook fish on the grill and bake pancakes.  The hotel serves local and international dishes. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  In Azurro 3 * <span>(Sunny Beach, Bulgaria)</span> there is a pool with a children's area, a playground.  The rooms have Wi-Fi, but it works intermittently, but in the lobby the signal is more stable.  On the territory there is parking, a left-luggage office, a currency exchange office, an elevator, a shop is working. </p><h2>  Sports and Entertainment </h2><p>  Azurro 3 * (Sunny Beach) (photos are given in the article) has an equipped recreation area near the pool.  It offers - water activities on the coast.  The hotel has a beauty salon, hairdresser, fitness center, gym, tourists can play billiards. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Hotel Azurro 3 * (Sunny Beach) is located near the coast.  The exact distance to the beach is difficult to determine, as different sources provide conflicting information.  How far from the coast is the hotel Azurro 3 * <span>(Sunny Beach, Bulgaria)?</span>  <span>Reviews of</span> tourists give us the opportunity to navigate this issue.  According to vacationers, the path to the beach takes at least seven to ten minutes in a calm step.  The coast is equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas, but you have to pay for them, because the beach is public.  As you know, in Europe, hotels do not have their own beaches, which are all municipal property.  The entrance to the sea is very convenient and gentle, and the coast has a sandy surface. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Sunny Beach is currently the most popular resort in Bulgaria.  Over 800 hotels of various levels have been built on its territory.  Sunny Beach is nothing short of an incredible and amazing combination of a man-made biosystem and the natural conditions created by the sun, sea, needles, and breezes.  The tourist area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resort occupies a seven-kilometer strip on the coast.  The resort has a rather favorable location, away from big cities, highways, railways.  It is for this reason that every year the famous Blue Flag goes to Sunny Beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="azurro 3 sunny beach reviews" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1559046.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The resort is incredibly lively, especially in summer.  It is great for holidays with children, because the local sea bay is moderately shallow and has a gentle slope.  Almost every hotel has a children's pool, there are playgrounds with slides and entertainment for the youngest tourists.  Since 2003, a water park has been operating, located ten kilometers from the resort.  All complexes are located along the coast, and therefore there are no large distances. </p><p>  Sunny Beach adores young people for whom all the conditions for entertainment (discos, clubs) are created here.  The resort has a lot of retirees from Europe, which indicates the universality of this place. </p><p>  The resort is best known for its stunning beaches.  The width of the coastline is 30-40 meters and is covered by high sand dunes.  The beaches are covered with fine sand of golden color.  In addition to stunningly beautiful nature, the tourist area has a wonderful climate.  In the summer, the temperature is between + 22-30 degrees, and the sea temperature reaches +26 degrees. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Sunny Beach has no significant historical sights, but Nessebar, located nearby, is considered one of the oldest cities in Europe.  The city is on the UNESCO list.  It is also called the site of 40 churches.  The best preserved of them are dated to the fourth and fifth centuries.  Sunny Beach itself is an amazingly fun place, all kinds of contests and folklore holidays are held here. </p><h2>  Azurro 3 * (Sunny Beach): reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to discuss the reviews about it of those tourists who managed to visit there.  As you understand, the Azurro 3 * hotel (Sunny Beach, Bulgaria) belongs to economy class establishments.  But at the same time, vacationers speak very well of him.  The territory of the complex itself is small, but neat and well-groomed.  And around is the <span>green zone.</span>  Because of what it seems that you are in the forest.  The air here is just amazing. </p><p>  Like any other budget complex, the hotel does not have a wide range of room categories.  Of course, the most popular apartment option among tourists in Azurro 3 * is standard.  Sunny Beach is a very affordable resort, and therefore comfortable and affordable housing are incredibly appreciated here.  Moreover, the resort is visited by many European youth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="azurro 3 standard sunny beach" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1558961.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <p>  Check-in at the hotel usually occurs without problems and quickly enough.  If the hotel does not currently have rooms available (for example, if you arrived in the evening or at night), then at the reception they suggest you move into the neighboring complex for a while.  In general, the situation with the lack of apartments is not entirely clear, but this happens quite often in this place.  The next day, tourists, as promised, are relocated to Azuro. </p><h2>  Room Reviews </h2><p>  I would like to pay special attention to the number of rooms of the hotel.  What are the apartments in Azurro 3 * (Sunny Beach)?  Reviews of tourists say that the rooms are consistent with the budget level of the hotel.  The rooms have standard furniture, plumbing is working properly.  In the event of any breakdowns, you should contact the reception desk, all problems are resolved quickly enough.  Of course, the apartments cannot be called chic, but you should not expect a similar level of rooms from a three-star complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Azurro 3 Sunny Beach Bulgaria" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1558973.jpg" width="504"></div>

    <p>  All rooms are clean and well maintained.  High-quality cleaning is carried out by the maids daily, but towels and bed linen are changed every other day.  The rooms have balconies, which is very convenient, since there is a place for drying beach items.  In addition, the terraces offer a wonderful view of the sea, who are lucky with the apartments. </p><p>  There are a number of undeniable advantages that make the incredibly popular Azurro 3 * (Sunny Beach, Bulgaria) - the reviews are confirmation of this.  The hotel has a very convenient location in every way.  It is located on one of the two main streets of the resort.  Nearby is a supermarket, there are many restaurants and cafes, a little further there are nightclubs and discos.  But at the same time, the complex is not at all noisy.  Apparently, the fact that the hotel is located a little inland is affected.  It is comfortable to rest at night, especially strong extraneous noise is not observed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="azurro 3 sunny beach booking" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1558962.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  The hotel is on the second line, walking to the coast is very close.  On the way there are shops and shops with various goods.  The municipal beach is very nice and beautiful.  For sunbeds and umbrellas on it you must pay.  But the coast is fully landscaped and has all the necessary infrastructure.  The beach itself and the entry into the sea are sandy.  Water is almost always clean.  Sea unrest is observed more in early September, during this period the storm season comes.  There are practically no waves in the season.  The beaches are cleaned daily, but tourists themselves throw a lot of cigarette butts, which is very unpleasant, especially since kids always play in the sand. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Special attention should be paid to reviews about nutrition.  Food always provokes a lot of conflicting opinions, no matter how good it is.  However, this does not apply to the Azuro complex.  Most vacationers stay very pretty.  Tourists can take for themselves only breakfast, and may prefer All Inclusive.  Of course, most tourists choose all-inclusive.  Meals take place in the main restaurant, which has an outdoor terrace.  It is more pleasant to eat on it, because the room is a bit stuffy.  During the period of large arrivals, sometimes there are problems with a lack of devices, but the waiters quickly solve it.  Breakfast at the hotel is more modest and monotonous. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel azurro 3 sunny beach bulgaria reviews" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1558963.jpg" width="558"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  But for lunch and dinner at the buffet there is always a sufficient assortment of dishes.  Those ending quickly replenish.  There is never a problem with a lack of food.  When the hotel is crowded with tourists, the restaurant becomes quite crowded, apparently it is not designed for so many guests.  In general, the waiters work harmoniously, quickly and conscientiously.  For those who prefer the benefits of All Inclusive, after lunch they fry delicious pancakes, grilled meat, distribute ice cream and delicious pizza.  You can try all this in the pool bar.  According to guests, the food is organized perfectly.  Of course, the restaurant has no gourmet dishes, but do not forget about the level of the establishment. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  I would like to note the popularity of the Azurro 3 * hotel (Sunny Beach).  Booking (the most popular guide site) is a confirmation of this.  Tourists very often leave their reviews about the hotel on its pages. The advantages of the complex include not only excellent location, food, but also excellent qualified Russian-speaking staff.  Workers carry out their duties in a coordinated manner, which generally has a positive effect on the entire establishment as a whole.  Many tourists speak very well about the staff of the complex. </p><p>  The hotel has a nice and clean pool, it is cleaned daily.  Around it are sunbeds and umbrellas.  Sun loungers have long been in need of replacement, but there is also a sufficient amount.  But umbrellas, unfortunately, are not enough at all. </p><p>  The hotel has a variety of tourists resting: from youth to senior citizens.  There are Europeans and representatives of the post-Soviet space.  The predominance of the inhabitants of a particular country varies (depending on arrival). </p><p>  Near the hotel there is a bus stop, thanks to which it is very convenient to get to anywhere.  It is very comfortable.  A particularly similar nuance will be appreciated by active tourists who seek to alternate beach vacations with sightseeing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="azurro 3 sunny beach bulgaria reviews" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1558972.jpg" width="596"></div>

    <p>  You can organize a very active excursion program for yourself: visit the Shipkinsky Pass, the Ethnographic Museum of Etar (open-air museum), the most unique Bulgarian monasteries that survived for many centuries and have come down to us.  In addition, you can go to the Botanical Garden in Balchik or to <span>Cape Kaliakra,</span> where they organize folklore shows in the evenings, taste national cuisine and wander around old Nsebar, visit <span>monasteries (Rilsky</span> and Sofia), see the valley of roses and a real garden of frozen stones.  Sunny Beach is a unique resort.  Here you will find a wonderful sea, a beautiful beach with the smallest sand and many beautiful and interesting places. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  If you plan to spend your vacation in Bulgaria, then you can consider the famous resort Sunny Beach as one of the options.  Hotel Azurro 3 * (Sunny Beach) is suitable for unpretentious tourists who are going to relax on the sea and enjoy the beautiful nature.  The complex does not offer luxury apartments and a gourmet menu, but clean rooms and good tasty food are at your service.  Particularly warm tourists speak about the hotel staff, who is cordial to all of its guests. </p>
