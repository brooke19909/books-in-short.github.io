    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  It is impossible not to say about the negative aspects that characterize the hotel "Sea" (Alushta).  The reviews contain a number of negative comments: </p><ul><li>  to get to the beach, you have to cross the roadway (traffic on it is not very intense, but not all drivers comply with the rules and speed limits); </li><li>  the prices in the restaurant are just sky-high (it is better to go down to the city and have lunch there); </li><li>  the spa area is very small, and the sauna is incredibly crowded; </li><li>  very small elevators in which two people can hardly fit; </li><li>  The SPA center works very little (I would like to visit it in the evening after a busy day); </li><li>  no soundproofing in the rooms - even the operation of elevators is audible; </li><li>  in buildings of a small number of storeys there are not only elevators, but also ramps, which makes it very inconvenient to carry suitcases; </li><li>  very poor breakfast; </li><li>  the staff is rather indifferent to the guests, despite the fact that rest in this institution is not cheap. </li></ul><p>  In general, it is worth noting the exceptional attractiveness of the Sea Hotel for tourists coming to Crimea.  This place has a long history, which began with several professors' dachas.  Now it is a large hotel complex with incredibly beautiful modern buildings.  Perhaps the main highlight of the resort can be considered its location in the park area at the very foot of the mountain.  It is always green here, it smells of the sea, juniper and cedar.  Also, tourists really like to relax in the spa after a busy day. </p>
