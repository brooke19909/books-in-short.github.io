Indeed, there are so many offers on the market of goods and services!  And sometimes you can get confused in them.  Now we have to get acquainted with a smartphone called HTC 7 Mozart.  This is a fairly new model of the latest generation of gadgets.  So, she can somehow attract attention to herself.  But what exactly is good about this phone?  You can answer only after studying all the technical characteristics of the smartphone.  In addition, before buying, it is also important to know what pitfalls can prevent the buyer from fully enjoying the device.  Do not be afraid, all phones have such moments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc 7 mozart" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/969913.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Dimensions and Weight </h2><p>  HTC 7 Mozart is a real phone communicator.  And for any calling device, its size and weight are important.  After all, it is far from always convenient to use a large-sized smartphone.  And our current version is quite compact.  Especially when you compare it with all modern phones. </p><p>  HTC 7 Mozart measures 60 millimeters wide, 119 long and 12 long.  Yes, this is a pretty <span>thick model.</span>  But it‚Äôs convenient for her to use, according to reviews.  And hold in hands too.  Of course, calling HTC 7 Mozart is also comfortable.  Especially if this smartphone is used by a child or a girl with small hands.  In truth, not every manufacturer can now offer such a compact phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The weight of the device is also pleasing.  Together with the battery, it is about 130 grams.  Not so much as it might seem at first glance.  Most phones now weigh between 160 grams, sometimes even without a battery.  So if you need a smartphone that is not only compact but also lightweight, then it's time to take a closer look at HTC 7 Mozart. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Next, it is important to pay attention to such a feature as the screen.  Many buyers will be able to note that it is not very similar to the standard one.  After all, his diagonal is not very large - only 3.7 inches.  When compared with modern counterparts, the average diagonal is about 4.7-5 inches.  Thus, HTC is a miniature phone that is very convenient to use.  True, it will be simply impossible to play modern games on such a small display, reviews warn. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc mozart 7 specifications" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/969912.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is also worth noting that the HTC Mozart 7 features are not very satisfactory in terms of screen resolution.  It is only 800 by 480 points.  Not enough for a modern phone.  But if you need a smartphone solely for business purposes, then this should be enough.  You can surf the Internet, read books too.  Watching videos or photos is also possible. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But there are quite positive aspects of the HTC 7 Mozart.  For example, despite its small touch screen display, the screen is capable of transmitting up to 16 million colors.  This allows the image to always remain bright, clear and saturated.  In sunny weather, the picture on the display will not fade.  So, ‚ÄúHRC‚Äù is a wonderful phone that will allow you to use all your capabilities in different weather conditions.  And all this without harm to nerves and eyesight. </p><h2>  Operating system and processor </h2><p>  As you can already see, the HTC 7 Mozart features slightly non-standard features for a modern phone.  Nevertheless, there is one small feature that still attracts buyers.  It's about the operating system.  To be honest, it and the processor play an important role in the performance of the device.  Especially if the buyer just needs a budget smartphone that will perform a variety of functions. </p><p>  Smartphone HTC 7 Mozart is an option that allows us to get acquainted with an operating system such as Windows Phone.  This phone has version 7.5 installed.  If you have not worked with this operating system before, then this is a great reason to start your acquaintance with something new, and not with the familiar Android.  We can say that "HRC 7 Mozart" is a great smartphone that will help you learn all the features of Windows Phone.  On it you can run a variety of useful applications and games.  True, there are not as many toys as we would like.  But the smartphone, according to reviews, will always be distinguished by its functionality.  Plus, you don‚Äôt have to think constantly how to reflash HTC 7 Mozart.  Testimonials indicate that for Windows Phone there are many programs running on the computer that will help to quickly implement the idea.  Simply find the one that seems more convenient to you with respect to the interface. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to reflash htc 7 mozart" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/969910.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But the processor at HTC 7 Mozart is not so powerful.  It has only 2 cores.  And each - at 1 GHz frequency.  Not much.  Especially if you want to play modern toys in the mobile industry.  However, it was initially noticed that we are not dealing with a gaming phone.  In general, for some interesting games and a bunch of useful applications, such power is enough.  Do not abandon the model because of the processor.  In fact, he showed himself worthy.  This is emphasized by the reviews left about HTC 7 Mozart. </p><h2>  RAM </h2><p>  True, not only the processor is responsible for the performance of the phone.  There is one more small moment.  It is called random access memory.  No matter how powerful the processor, any need for it disappears if there is not enough RAM.  More precisely, when it does not meet all the other characteristics of the smartphone.  Phone HTC 7 Mozart in this regard can only boast.  After all, the RAM here is pretty good for this model. </p><p>  Although many buyers claim that it is not enough.  We will be offered a total of 512 MB of RAM.  For a modern smartphone, this is an extremely low figure.  After all, often it is the RAM that helps launch games and applications.  But if you take into account that ‚ÄúHRC 7 Mozart‚Äù is a budget version of a smartphone, you can understand why this figure is not very high.  In principle, in combination with a 1 GHz processor, RAM works extremely well.  And this allows the operating system to respond clearly and quickly to user commands.  This is exactly what many buyers need. </p><h2>  Space </h2><p>  In addition, an important point is the free space on the phone.  Smartphone HTC 7 Mozart can not boast of too much here.  After all, the buyer will be offered only 8 GB of space.  Of these, about 1.5 will be occupied by the operating system.  So, about 6 GB will remain on personal data.  This is not so much.  And for the modern user, 6 gigabytes of free space is a real trifle. </p><p>  In principle, for the average buyer, who does not expect that the budget version of the smartphone will offer him incredible opportunities, this should be enough.  And when you consider that the HTC Mozart 7 specifications simply will not allow you to run weighty cool games, the problem should disappear by itself.  But if you are sorely lacking 6 GB of free space, then the smartphone has one interesting feature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone htc 7 mozart" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/969909.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  Memory card </h2><p>  For example, you can connect an additional memory card to the device.  Fortunately, such an opportunity is present here.  It should be immediately noted that recently there has been a clear trend in which there is no card slot in the phones.  But not at HTC 7 Mozart, whose photos are presented to our attention in the article. </p><p>  If there is a shortage of space, you can connect a microSD memory card to the device.  True, there are some limitations.  For example, the maximum allowed card size is 64 GB.  Plus, it is not recommended to fill in this place with information completely.  After all, then you will begin to appear system failures and malfunctions.  And this is not very pleasing to buyers.  Therefore, according to many users, it is best to fill out about 62-63 GB of space on the map with personal data.  And at the same time leave about 1 GB free.  In principle, as a budget smartphone, ‚ÄúHRC 7 Mozart‚Äù offers quite good opportunities so far. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Many people think how to flash HTC 7 Mozart.  But not every customer pays attention to such a moment as the supported types of communication on the phone.  Initially, the smartphone was invented just so that people could call each other and communicate information.  So, communication plays an important role. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc mozart 7 does not turn on" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/969908.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Fortunately, in our case everything is in order.  But it could have been a little better.  Initially, HTC 7 Mozart gives us the ability to connect to 2G and 3G networks.  In addition, if necessary, you can use GPS or GPRS.  Also, the phone has support for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth version 2.1.  The data transfer rate over the last connection will not be as fast as we would like.  But it will still be of high quality. </p><p>  If desired, you can connect to 4G.  Initially, such a possibility in the phone, despite the fact that it is quite new, is not.  But with the right approach, downloading additional applications and flashing it is worth a try.  In practice, customers rarely do this procedure.  After all, failure will require HTC 7 Mozart repair.  Yes, and have to explain what caused the breakdown. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Well, now even the simplest phone should be able to take pictures.  So the camera in the device plays an important role.  And of course, it would be nice if it turned out to be quite high quality.  In the case of ‚ÄúHC 7 Mozart‚Äù the way it is. </p><p>  The thing is that the buyer will be offered a 8MP camera resolution.  By modern standards, not a lot, but in skilled hands, as buyers assure, this is a very good indicator.  In addition, the model has autofocus, flash and face recognition technology.  You can‚Äôt shoot in Full HD, but you can make a high-quality video.  The resolution with which you can record is 1280 by 720 pixels.  It is a decent indicator for a modern budget smartphone. </p><p>  True, some are not happy that this model does not have a front camera.  Many people prefer to use it.  By the way, making video calls with ‚ÄúHC 7 Mozart‚Äù is not very convenient.  Again, due to the lack of a front camera.  But, as practice shows, this is not so common among modern buyers.  It is better to be able to take high-quality pictures than to make calls using video. </p><h2>  Price and equipment </h2><p>  As has been said repeatedly, HTC 7 Mozart is a budget smartphone.  But what does it mean?  To be honest, you can purchase this model at an affordable price.  Yes, the phone‚Äôs capabilities are not so diverse, but for the proposed price tag this is enough.  Indeed, in the store you can find such a model for about 3000 rubles.  Prices vary, but, as a rule, do not exceed 6000. Acceptable for many buyers.  HPC 7 Mozart is a great choice for a first grader.  The child will learn how to use a smartphone, and parents will not have to overpay.  In addition, the inability to launch new games contributes to an increase in student performance.  It pleases teachers and parents. </p><p>  Options when buying is also important.  For example, you will be offered instructions for HTC 7 Mozart, a headset, a charger, a battery, as well as a <span>warranty card</span> and wire for connecting and synchronizing with a computer.  In principle, the complete set of "HRC 7 Mozart" is standard.  And it suits almost every customer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc 7 mozart photo" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/969907.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Underwater rocks </h2><p>  Well, each phone has its own drawbacks that are not related to the technical characteristics.  The thing is that no one is safe from breakdowns and failures.  And for certain smartphone models, as a rule, there are a number of own problems.  EHTC 7 Mozart also has them.  And now we will meet them. </p><p>  For example, many buyers complain that after several years of use, HTC Mozart 7 does not turn on.  This can happen for several reasons.  First, the battery broke (such cases are quite common).  The battery is replaced and charged, the problem disappears.  The second is a system crash.  Calling a service center or self- <span>flashing the phone</span> will help <span>.</span> </p><p>  In addition, very often the ‚ÄúHTC 7 Mozart‚Äù breaks the touch screen.  In other words, he stops responding to touch.  In this case, you will have to use the help of a service center.  However, if you are very careful with your smartphone, then such surprises should not be. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that some buyers complain about the poor performance of the phone.  In fact, the reason for all this is a lot of information that is stored in the device.  Repair is not required - just clean the smartphone, it is unnecessary and unnecessary data. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Here we have learned what the HTC 7 Mozart smartphone is.  Now it's time to ask yourself a logical question: should I pay attention to this model of cell phone?  Everyone has to answer here independently.  But in practice, we can only say that ‚ÄúHC 7 Mozart‚Äù is really worthy of attention.  Especially if you need an inexpensive smartphone with a great camera. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc 7 mozart reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/969905.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In cases of need a gaming phone will have to abandon this model.  It is not suitable for games at all.  HTC 7 Mozart is the perfect solution for those who need a phone exclusively on business.  There is nothing superfluous in it, no temptations.  In addition, it is also a great solution for elementary school students. </p>
