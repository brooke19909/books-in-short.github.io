Clients of banking institutions encounter it when they come to the bank for <span>borrowed funds.</span>  The concept of ‚Äúcredit history‚Äù in modern Russia is rooted in the minds of citizens, as well as the term ‚Äúcredit‚Äù.  And so everyone suddenly became interested in where to get this kind of information.  To obtain such data, you first need to have a code of the subject of <span>credit history.</span>  <span>How to find out</span> it and get it in case of absence, we will consider in more detail below. </p><h2>  Code Purpose </h2><p>  To understand the purpose of the subject‚Äôs code, consider an example.  The banking institution you applied for a loan requested a credit history.  But you do not know where to find such information.  So that you do not have to go around all the credit history bureaus, you can use the website of the Central Bank, section CCCH.  By entering personal information and the code of the subject of the credit history, it is not difficult to find out the bureau in which the information related to the state of CI is located.  So that fraudsters could not see such information about you, knowing your <span>passport data, the</span> subject code was invented. </p>

    <h2>  Why do I need to know a credit history? </h2><ol><li>  It is necessary to know the situation regarding CI in order to make sure that you have no obligations to credit institutions that were obtained through fraud.  Since the negative <span>credit line</span> is not always the fault of the potential borrower of the bank.  Often, customers become victims of intruders.  In addition, there are cases when a credit history can be considered damaged due to the fault of employees of financial organizations who mistakenly recorded a loan in your name.  In such cases, you may dispute erroneous data. </li><li>  Knowing this kind of information, you can find out the reasons for banks to refuse borrowed funds and correct the situation. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="subject code of the credit history how to find out" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32473/776515.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  How is a credit history formed? </h2><p>  The borrower receives a loan from the bank and begins according to the schedule to repay it without any delay.  So the credit history of any borrower begins to take shape.  It will be positive in this case, since there are no delays here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But consider a situation in which for some reason you delayed the next payment, or maybe not one.  It‚Äôs really bad when you didn‚Äôt pay off your debt to a credit organization at all.  Then the history worsens, and over time it can become negative in the eyes of financial organizations. </p>

    <p>  Almost all banking institutions when issuing a loan pay attention to the credit history of the client.  With a positive story, they will be happy to provide you with borrowed funds on more favorable terms.  And with a bad one, most likely, a rejection awaits you.  Although there are some banks that work with borrowers with a negative credit history, their conditions will be tough and interest rates will be predatory. </p><h2>  What does a credit report look like? </h2><ol><li>  Title part.  This section includes information about the borrower - full name, passport data, TIN number and so on. </li><li>  The main section includes all the information about the loans you received, namely, the amount, the name of the bank that issued the loan, the presence or absence of arrears, and the repayment term are indicated. </li><li>  The closed section contains data on banking institutions that issued borrowed funds. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="code of the subject of the credit history how to find out if you did not take a loan" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32473/775703.jpg" width="450"></div></h2><h2>  Where to get the KI code? </h2><p>  The code of the subject of the credit history is set by the bank's client himself upon signing the loan agreement.  For example, Sberbank allocates a special <span>annex to the agreement</span> for this <span>.</span>  And in some banks, it is mentioned in the text of the contract. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A credit code is a combination of numbers and letters and should only be known to the borrower. </p><p>  If the code was not set upon receipt of borrowed funds, then you can come up with it later.  To do this, you need to send an application to the BCI or visit any bank. </p><h2>  Subject Additional Code </h2><p>  After you have received a CI code at the bureau, you can set an additional code.  It, unlike the main one, is used only within a month from the date of formation. </p><p>  Often this code is created so that when a client‚Äôs history is needed by another person, for example, a bank, not to give him written consent each time.  You can simply give him an additional code, with which he will get access to the necessary information of the borrower for a month.  After the expiration of the additional code, it is canceled. </p><h2>  How to get additional code? </h2><p>  The process of installing additional code includes the following steps.  It follows: </p><ol><li>  Log in to the Central Bank website. </li><li>  Enter the code of the subject of the credit history (how to find out in case of loss - we will consider below). </li><li>  Fill out the proposed form to assign an additional code. </li><li>  Assign additional code. </li></ol><p>  Although the procedure for obtaining additional code is simple, it protects the personal data of the borrower. </p><h2>  How to change the subject code? </h2><p>  To change the subject code, the borrower has the right to contact any banking institution, and not just where he took the loan.  The bank will send a request to the credit bureau, from where it will go to the CCCH, where they can answer it.  The answer from CCCH will go to the bureau, and from there - to the bank and the borrower.  To make the shift procedure faster, you can immediately contact a credit bureau. </p>

    <h2>  How to find out the subject code? </h2><p>  Above were considered the main points that the code of the subject of credit history has.  How to recognize him if you forget him?  There are several ways: </p><ol><li>  You can find out the code of the subject of the credit history in the bank where the loan was received.  Bank employees must provide the code at the first request of the client.  At the same time, the borrower needs to have a passport with him. </li><li>  The code is present in the loan agreement, which was issued upon receipt of borrowed funds.  This is considered the easiest approach to determining the code of the subject of credit history. </li><li>  How to know the code remotely?  You can resort to the services of the postal service.  To do this, an application is filled out, which must be certified by a notary.  Then, the application, together with the receipt on payment of notarial services, is sent to the NBCH.  There they will change the code and send new data to your address. </li><li>  With the same statement, you can contact any credit bureau.  In addition, the borrower must have a passport with him.  Based on these documents, you will receive a new code of the subject of credit history. </li></ol><p>  How to know if I haven‚Äôt taken a loan once in my life, this code?  The last two methods are suitable for this case. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that when the code is lost, it is impossible to restore it, you can only get a new one.  But do not think that information about the credit history will be accumulated again, and all the "sins" in this way can be hidden. </p><h2>  How to find out the subject code in Sberbank? </h2><p>  If the borrower needs to know the code of the subject of the credit history, Sberbank will not be able to inform him.  And all because such information is not stored in the bank, but in the credit bureau.  Therefore, it is better if the borrower goes directly there.  To avoid scammers, you should contact the bureau that passed the state registration.  An application form can be found on the official site of the NBCH to receive a new code of the subject of credit history. </p><p>  How to find out a code from Sberbank if a loan was received there?  You just need to contact a bank employee with a passport.  He is obliged to provide such information on the first request from the client. </p>
