  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gazyr is ... Value, history, application</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Now it has become fashionable to use ancient rites and traditions in their work.  In order to realize this direction, costumes are often used that will help you travel back to that time.  No exception are the Cossacks, who have interesting and colorful costumes.  Caucasian costumes have always attracted attention, but most often questions arise that gazyr is an element of clothing or are there other meanings for this word?  The article will help to understand this concept. </p><h2>  Meaning of the word </h2><div class="photo" data-original="hikond.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gazyr is" class="if uuid-3104393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54883/3104393.jpg"></div><p>  Gazyr is a word that has several meanings.  Firstly, among the Caucasian peoples, it denoted a rifle charge, in which there was either a certain amount of gunpowder, or paper cartridges and bullets.  They were either carried in a special bag - a gas box, or fastened in chest pockets, which were a bandolier.  Over time, Gazyr became a decorative element of the costume. </p><p>  Secondly, in the literal translation from the Turkic language, the word "gazyr" is "ready".  In Arabic, it will already sound like a "Khazir." </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kazak-zlato.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Caucasian gazyr" class="if uuid-3104410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54883/3104410.jpg"></div><p>  You can read about how old gazyrs looked like from a traveler Dubois de Montpere, who describes them in detail and carefully.  The soldier had two small pockets directly on the chest on both sides.  It is known that more often this was placed in several rows of cartridges or small boxes.  Most often they were made of bone, reeds, wood or metal.  If the warrior was from a wealthy family, then such bandoliers were attached to their shoulders with neat chains of silver. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ribalych.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ancient Gazyrs" class="if uuid-3104416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54883/3104416.jpg"></div><p>  It is known that gazyrs are not the invention of the Caucasian warriors, as such bandoliers have already been used by French musketeers and archers in Russia.  They were not necessarily worn on the chest.  Russian soldiers wore a belt with a pencil case, which was called a berendeyka. </p><p>  In the sixteenth century, unusual muzzle-loading rifles appeared in Spain, a feature of which was the constant monitoring of how much gunpowder was in it.  After all, if it would be more than it should be, then it would immediately burst when fired.  In battle, such a weapon had to be reloaded quickly, which is why there were such flasks, where the correctly measured gunpowder was poured in advance. </p><p>  The emergence of dimensional pencil cases helped not only protect the soldiers, but also facilitated the handling of weapons during the attack.  But in different countries, measuring cases for gunpowder were attached to clothes in different ways.  So, more often than not, they simply hung on a rope right on the soldiers' uniforms, so that they could easily take them during the battle, open the lid, pour it out and let it go.  These ropes were attached to the shoulder strap.  But often, the charges with which the soldiers were hung from two sides interfered in the battle, where it was necessary to move quickly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Caucasian gazyr </h2><div class="photo" data-original="iskatelklada.tuapse.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaftan with ghazyry" class="if uuid-3104423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54883/3104423.jpg"></div><p>  In the Caucasus, such pencil cases - measurements that interfered nevertheless in battle, were not used for long.  Soon, a caftan with gazyry was invented.  Gunpowder pockets on clothes were located in those places where they would not interfere with the hands to move freely.  During horse riding or saber felling, there was free space on the chest, so the ghazyrs were placed here. </p><p>  For a walking warrior, a chest gazyr was also a good way, since the belt was always occupied with extra pouches.  According to the descriptions of the famous traveler Montpere, the Circassian usually wore a gun on his shoulder.  It was embedded in a black case sewn from felt.  He fastened to the belt with two rings of red leather.  On the belt of the Circassian warrior were always attached a dagger and a cleaver, a screwdriver, gun flint and a leather purse where the tinder was stored. </p><p>  Usually gun flint was made of blackened silver.  It was a small box of bacon, which was used to rub bullets, so that they would slide better along the barrel during firing.  When shooting, the Circassian usually also used a small wooden stand made of battens.  He laid his weapon on her. </p><h2>  Application </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.e-wiki.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What are gazyry for?" class="if uuid-3104429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54883/3104429.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, many people do not even understand why gazyrs are needed, how they were used.  Indeed, in modern society, such pencil cases for gunpowder can only be found on national costumes, and then they have become a decorative element.  Chest gazyr is an integral part of the national costume of a Caucasian man.  They were perfectly adapted to combat in the mountains in all weather conditions.  This arrangement of gunpowder did not give many opportunities, despite even the position of a warrior.  With such a chest pencil case for gunpowder, a soldier could lie, stand or sit on a horse, but gunpowder was always intact. </p><p>  In addition, chest gazyry is also armor in saber combat.  After all, such pencil cases for gunpowder were mounted diagonally on the chest, and the Caucasian checkers were felled in this way.  Therefore, it was a good defense against the basic methods of battle. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  There is interesting evidence that Baron Wrangel, who was the last leader of the White movement, received the nickname "Black Baron" for his clothes.  This nickname was given to him in September 1918, since his topical clothing was a Cossack Circassian, on which gazyry were located.  But before that time he wore a completely different outfit. </p><p>  If we turn to literary heroes, then the mention of gazyry can be found in the work of Mikhail Bulgakov ‚ÄúRunning‚Äù.  A film of the same name was put on this play.  One of the characters in this film is Grigory Charnota, who was a white general, lived well, but now his time has passed.  As one of the degrees of his downfall, the director shows the sale of his gazyrs made of silver by Grigory Lukyanovich.  He was going to use them in Constantinople when he made bets on cockroach races.  He sold gazyry separately from his Circassian. </p><p>  But everyone learned about gazyry after the wonderful comedy film "The Caucasian Captive, or Shurik's New Adventures" directed by Leonid Gaidai was released on the screens in 1966.  The funniest heroes of this film are the horsemen whom the uncle of the main character hires to steal from her.  At the first meeting with Shurik Balbes, Experienced and Coward come in national costumes.  At Dunce played by Yuri Nikulin, a Circassian is dressed. </p><p>  And in the film, the most comic moment is when Dunce takes out cigarettes from gazyry, and from there a lighter pops up, like in a car, so that he can light it. </p>
