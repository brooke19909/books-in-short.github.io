    <h2>  Description of the lake </h2><p>  Since 1993, the lake has been awarded the title of National Park.  However, when the streamlining of the federal and regional systems of legislation began, it became clear that Aslykul is a reservoir that cannot be a park.  After 2004, it was considered a cluster site, and in 2011 it was isolated as an independent natural system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After that, residents began to complain about the absence of at least the minimum conditions for spending holidays.  They were also struck by a paid entry.  Due to the intervention of the prosecutor‚Äôs office, fees ceased, and the ennobling of the territory began.  Now the cleanliness of Lake Aslykul (the reservoir map is in the article) is monitored by the local administration. </p><p>  Even despite the low level of pollution, many people still come here to spend their holidays.  And thanks to the arrangement of the recreation center of the same name, comfortable living conditions appeared. </p>
