What mirrors are there?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many are interested in the question of where the mirror was invented.  How did this happen?  The mirror first appeared in ancient times in Turkey.  These were pieces of polished obsidian, and their approximate age is about 7,500 years.  Then the creators of the mirrors used stones and metal: gold, tin, silver, <span>rhinestone</span> and copper.  But all antique mirrors had one drawback - color shades did not differ in reflection. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where did the mirror" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12115/94279.jpg" width="360"></div>  The real mirror was created by Franciscan Pekam John in 1279, he described a method for coating glass with a thin layer of lead.  In Venice, where the mirror was invented, a technology that was difficult for those times was used - tin foil was applied to a thin layer of paper, then it was covered with a layer of mercury, again with paper, then glass.  Then the paper was pulled out. <br>  Of course, such mirrors were cloudy.  The production of mirrors in Venice lasted for three centuries.  Since 1773, the production of mirrors has become a fairly significant industry in Europe.  Venice was the first country to receive the right to grant patents for the manufacture of mirrors.  In France, where the mirror was invented during the reign of Louis XIV, the craftsmen of the company San Gobain solved the mystery of the Venetian mirror production.  And by the end of the XVIII century, almost all the houses of the city of Paris had mirrors.  And Parisian fashionistas wore small mirrors in their purses or attached to their belts.  Since the first mirror appeared, a lot of time has passed.  Now it‚Äôs hard to say exactly where the mirror was invented.  However, they play a large role in popular culture and superstition.  Young girls and women are still <span>wondering at grooms</span> using mirrors.  In Russia, where the mirror was invented at the beginning of the 18th century, ideally polished silver, gold, copper and rhinestone were used.  The most popular were metal discs, which were polished to a mirror shine on the one hand and decorated on the other.  Today, a mirror is a common element of the interior, and not a luxury.

    <p>  Wall mirrors are made in several versions.  They can be: </p><p>  1. Different in shape - round, rectangular, square, oval.  In addition, unusual and innovative forms are also possible: in the form of animals, birds, asymmetric and irregular. <br>  2. Different sizes: from small to mirrors throughout the wall. <br>  3. With edges processed in various ways. <br>  4. With different design: decorated or decorated with various applications. <br>  5. Recessed, framed or conventional. </p><p>  <strong>Other types of mirrors</strong> </p><p>  There are still other types of mirrors: a one-way mirror, a translucent mirror, a spy mirror, a Gesela mirror ... In many detective films, one-way mirrors are used during filming.  They are usually found in <br>  rooms where you do not need to see those who are watching, but see only your reflection.  Such translucent mirrors are used for covert surveillance of people, to protect rooms from unwanted prying eyes. </p>
