  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hospital for child care: payment, calculation, accrual</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Young parents regularly have to face the fact that their young children are ill.  If the mother has already left maternity leave, then for the formal care of the child she will have to arrange the appropriate sick leave.  Payment of sick leave for child care depends on various factors, which include seniority, age of the child, as well as the period for which the sick leave is issued. </p><h2>  Design Features </h2><p>  A hospital mother needs to take care of her child quite often, since young children constantly visit different kindergartens with various viruses and infections.  This period is equivalent to the registration of an ordinary sick leave when a directly working citizen becomes ill.  The features of registration and payment of sick leave for child care include: </p><ul><li>  for the entire period when care for the baby is required, a disability certificate is drawn up, moreover, it is issued by the attending physician, but additional information is entered into it by the head of the company; </li><li>  this period is paid by FSS funds; </li><li>  the maximum and minimum payments are equal to the same values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are assigned when registering the sick-list for themselves; </li><li>  the amount of payment depends entirely on the length of the working experience; </li><li>  the duration depends on whether the child is being treated on an outpatient or inpatient basis; </li><li>  when calculating the period of incapacity for work, the number of sick children in the family is taken into account, so the sheet does not close until all children have recovered; </li><li>  at certain times, employees have to face some restrictions on receiving pay. </li></ul><p>  Such a sick leave can be issued not only by the mother, but also by the father at the main place of his employment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="nalog-nalog.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment of sick leave" class="if uuid-2864570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2864570.jpg"></div><h2>  What conditions must be observed? </h2><p>  For registration and payment of sick leave for child care, several factors must be taken into account that allow mom or dad to be relieved of his work responsibilities.  These factors include: </p><ul><li>  the child really reveals any diseases; </li><li>  to alleviate his condition requires the presence of one of the parents, and also requires medical attention; </li><li>  it is required to confirm that the medical personnel carried out certain actions aimed at alleviating the condition of the child. </li></ul><p>  A sick leave is allowed regardless of the diagnosis made by the attending physician.  An incapacity certificate is not issued if a minor has a chronic disease in remission. </p><div class="photo" data-original="30seconds.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hospital childcare" class="if uuid-2873516" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2873516.jpg"></div><h2>  When is a disability certificate not issued? </h2><p>  The issuance of the form and payment of sick leave for child care is not made in the following situations: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  inpatient treatment of a child who is already 15 years old; </li><li>  the baby has a chronic disease in remission; </li><li>  another close relative took annual leave at his work. </li></ul><p>  If even under such conditions it is required to leave work in order to care for a minor, then leave can be issued without saving a salary. </p><h2>  Period duration </h2><p>  A hospital care for a child in a hospital or at home can last a different number of days.  This period depends on various parameters: </p><ul><li>  60 days are provided per year if the child is not yet 7 years old, and it does not matter if the treatment takes place in an inpatient or outpatient setting, but in especially complex diseases this period can increase up to 120 days per year; </li><li>  45 days a year is proposed if the child's age is in the range of 7 to 15 years, moreover, for one period of the disease, a sick leave for a maximum of 15 days can be issued </li><li>  if the child is more than 15 years old, then with inpatient treatment it is impossible to take sick leave, and if treatment takes place at home, the parent can arrange the period of incapacity for work for 30 days a year, but a maximum of 7 days is offered for one disease. </li></ul><p>  Parents often have to face quarantine in kindergartens.  All this period one of the parents should be at home, for which a sick leave is issued.  If a teenager who is over 15 years old is treated in a hospital, then parents will not be able to officially draw up a certificate of incapacity for work, since it is believed that doctors in a medical institution will be able to provide optimal conditions for the child. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.childrens.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sick mom to care for a child" class="if uuid-2864576" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2864576.jpg"></div><h2>  Rules for registration </h2><p>  If the child is taken care of during the main, additional or maternity leave, then the sick leave is not issued.  Therefore, the need for this document arises if the parent needs to go to work, while the child is still sick.  You can issue it even on a weekend, after which official payment is required, even if the days fall on weekends or holidays. </p><p>  Other rules for registration and payment of sick leave for child care include: </p><ul><li>  only one relative can draw up such a period, therefore, one payment is assigned for one disability certificate; </li><li>  parents are allowed to take sick leave in turn, and each of them receives payment from the Social Insurance Fund; </li><li>  if the parents have two children, then they can receive payment for each baby separately, and information about the children is entered on one sheet; </li><li>  if a person caring for sick children officially works in several companies, then you can get paid both in one organization and in several companies, but you need to contact employers provided that a citizen has worked in each company for more than two years. </li></ul><p>  You can find out other important nuances of this document directly from the doctor, since it is the doctor who first brings the necessary information to the sheet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vaikui.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how many days of sick leave to care for a child" class="if uuid-2864574" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2864574.jpg"></div><h2>  How is sick leave calculated for child care? </h2><p>  A citizen who draws up a sick leave to care for his children is interested in what kind of payment he can receive at the place of employment.  Therefore, it is important to know how to accrue sick leave. </p><p>  Only the first three days of this period are paid by the employer, and the remaining funds are sent from the FSS.  To calculate the sick leave for child care, it is taken into account what is the daily earnings of the employee at a particular place of employment.  To do this, it is calculated how much money was received by a citizen during two years of work.  After that, the earnings for the day of work are determined.  The resulting value is multiplied by the number of sick days. </p><p>  For the first 10 days, the amount of payment depends on the length of service.  A child care hospital is paid differently for different workers: </p><ul><li>  if the experience is less than five years, then only 60% of the average earnings are transferred; </li><li>  if the duration of this period varies from 5 to 8 years, then 80% of the salary is transferred; </li><li>  for work experience of 8 years, 100% payment is assigned. </li></ul><p>  If the duration of the sick-list exceeds 10 days, then in the following days a citizen can count on a payment equal to 50% of his average earnings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stuff.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="accrual of sick leave" class="if uuid-2864573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2864573.jpg"></div><h2>  How to determine average earnings? </h2><p>  To accrue sick leave, it is important to correctly calculate the average citizen's earnings for one day of work.  For this, the following actions are carried out by the accountant: </p><ul><li>  determines the total income of the employee for two years of employment; </li><li>  based on the value obtained, the average earnings per month are calculated; </li><li>  Further, the indicator is divided by the average number of working days per month, which makes it possible to determine the citizen's income in one day. </li></ul><p>  During the calculation, all the cash receipts of the citizen are presented, represented not only by the salary, but also by various surcharges, bonuses or other rewards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="matkapital.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="b / l care" class="if uuid-2875050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2875050.jpg"></div><h2>  Nuances of calculation </h2><p>  When calculating the payment of sick leave for child care, it is taken into account whether treatment took place in the hospital or at home.  If the minor was in the hospital, then all days of the disease are taken into account when calculating the allowance, taking into account the experience of the parent. </p><p>  If the treatment was carried out at home, then only within 10 days the calculation is based on the experience of the parent, and the following days are paid in the amount of 50% of the average citizen's earnings. </p><h2>  How to fill in the timesheet? </h2><p>  The accountant of the company must know what information is entered in the time sheet at the place of employment of the citizen.  For this, it takes into account how many days of sick leave for child care were issued. </p><p>  The report card indicates that the employee was issued sick leave, for which the designation "B" and "19" are used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sfexaminer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="disabled childcare" class="if uuid-2864578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2864578.jpg"></div><h2>  Nuances for the military </h2><p>  There is no information in the legislation that the military can arrange sick leave for the care of their children.  This is due to the peculiarities of the accrual of monetary allowance, since funds are not transferred to the FSS for military personnel.  Therefore, difficulties arise in obtaining compensation. </p><p>  The military cannot arrange sick leave to care for a sick child, but they can count on leave for personal reasons.  To do this, submit a report to the unit commander.  This vacation is allowed several times a year.  But when compiling a report, it is necessary to prescribe that rest days are required to care for a sick child. </p><h2>  The nuances of design for caring for a disabled child </h2><p>  If parents raise a disabled child, then they have the right to arrange annually up to 120 days of sick leave to care for a disabled child.  It does not matter if the treatment is inpatient or outpatient. </p><p>  If the minor is HIV-infected, then the parents and other relatives are paid from the state for the entire period of stay with the child in the hospital. </p><p>  A sick leave is issued in a situation when complications arise after vaccination or serious oncological diseases are detected. </p><p>  When filling out a sick leave, the doctor must correctly indicate the cause of disability using a special code.  If the child is officially disabled, then figure 13. If he has a malignant tumor or has serious complications after vaccination, then code 14. If the minor is HIV-infected, then code 15 is used for him. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mamdziecko.interia.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sick childcare experience" class="if uuid-2864577" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2864577.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Parents can arrange for sick leave at the place of employment intended for the care of their children.  Moreover, they can count on its payment at the expense of the employer and the state.  The size of the payment depends on the length of service of a citizen, the term of care for a minor, as well as on the reason for registering a period of disability. </p><p>  When determining the optimal period of the hospital, the age of the child is taken into account, as well as the nuances of his treatment. </p>
