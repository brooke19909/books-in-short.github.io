She reaches the heart and causes the most powerful emotions.  But sometimes you need to experience such strong emotions in order to remain in harmony with yourself.  For a change put aside tourist brochures illustrating the countries of Europe, and go on a trip to your native country.  Rediscover her beauty, see the sights.  Arrange for yourself an excursion into childhood, and let the hotel ‚ÄúSlovakia‚Äù, Saratov, become the first stop.  Is not it true that even the name is already awakening fantasy?  What is there in this hotel, a corner of Slovakia or a typical middle-class hotel?  He has three stars for quality, which means there is something to see.  What is the purpose of going here?  Yes, at least just make sure that the hotel business is developing <span>in Saratov</span> . </p>

    <h2>  Purpose and means </h2><p>  Vacation happens once, at most twice a year.  I would like to spend this time with benefit, so that later I have something to remember.  Well, what can surprise Saratov?  Although, here is just the hotel "Slovakia" in Saratov is surprising.  Still, how was the whole country transported to the city?  And what is so authentic there?  Should I come here?  And for what purpose?  Return to the homeland of the ancestors and enjoy the atmosphere of the homeland!  Come here!  On the quay of Cosmonauts, in the very center of the city, stands a high-rise 15-story building, which is occupied by Slovakia.  The hotel is three-star, but very comfortable and kind of native due to its internal message.  You must admit that it is easier and faster to realize your vacation goals if you come to Saratov, immersed in nostalgia for the old days.  Have you been to Slovakia for a long time?  Have you considered it as a travel destination?  It is unlikely, but it is surprisingly beautiful there, the spirit of antiquity is floating in the air.  Maybe the same here? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Inside the hotel </h2><p>  So, what will pamper visitors in "Slovakia" with?  The menu here is quite sophisticated, there are dishes from around the world.  The selection of drinks is wide.  In summer, there is an outdoor terrace.  The Caramel restaurant is open for guests with European and Oriental cuisine.  Indulge in the pleasure and be sure to try the local delicacies.  Eat plenty of greens to pay tribute to Central Europe, where vegetation occupies almost half of the territory.  A complimentary buffet breakfast is served.  But visitors can soak up the bed: the buns are always hot, and when ordering food can even be served in the room.  It is truly nice to have breakfast in bed while in Slovakia.  But so far the Slovakia Hotel has somehow not been saturated with nostalgia.  Saratov is a fairly progressive city, and people here are mobile.  As soon as you go outside, the charm of time is lost.  A computer can be used in the lobby, as there is free Wi-Fi access.  Transfer to the airport is paid, so postpone the amount in advance, but there is a river station nearby, and you can take a walk in this way. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Food for enjoyment </h2><p>  The hotel has two luxurious restaurants.  One is called "Slovakia" and is located in the <span>hotel</span> building <span>.</span>  He has been known <span>in Saratov</span> for more than a dozen years.  For an institution of this kind, this is a respectable term.  The work is stable, and this is a recognition of the class.  Inside is very cozy and bright.  The helpful staff will offer a choice of menus of Russian, European, Asian and Caucasian cuisine.  In addition, there is a bar, and the drinks in it are very exotic.  The bartender is both a specialist and a subtle psychologist.  He knows exactly what kind of cocktail to surprise you and how to diversify it.  The restaurant holds coffee breaks and corporate parties, so the staff is professional and stress-resistant.  Near the conference room where you can hold a meeting or presentation.  And on the ground floor is the restaurant LeNoir.  Its name is symbolic and recalls the American cinema genre of the 1940-1950s.  The atmosphere of femme fatal and elegant men reigns here.  Here the most famous personalities of the city dine and metropolitan guests often call in. </p>

    <h2>  Contact details </h2><p>  But before looking, the hotel can be contacted remotely.  There are reservations phones, a fax number, and two email addresses.  Reception answers calls round-the-clock.  Well, of course, there is a telephone for reserving tables in a restaurant.  Thus, solely for the convenience of customers, the Slovakia Hotel in Saratov operates.  Contacts are provided so that visitors feel comfortable, can clarify a number of issues and know how and when to come.  The hotel itself is very large, but it is better to first check the availability of rooms.  In almost all cases when the Slovakia Hotel (Saratov) is required, the reception phone will be the answer to many questions.  Call the number +78452289501. </p><h2>  What do people say? </h2><p>  It is best to find out the impressions of real people about some places, rather than leafing through leaflets.  What do visitors think about ‚ÄúSlovakia‚Äù?  Hotel "Slovakia" (Saratov) collects reviews from the polar.  The advantages include an impressive panoramic view of the Volga, a varied breakfast menu, a whole kaleidoscope of <span>Russian salads</span> and casseroles, the presence of Wi-Fi and work with cash and <span>cashless payments.</span>  But the cons are mostly annoying, for example, the lack of freshly brewed coffee and the inability to place an order to pay for the room.  Repair of the hotel does not cause positive emotions, therefore there is an atmosphere of the ‚ÄúSoviet hotel‚Äù.  You can take this moment for nostalgia and add colors to the Soviet menu.  For foreigners, the hotel will not be a luxury.  Rather, they will perceive it as a hostel, as the conditions are generally average. </p>

    <h2>  Through the eyes of a Russian man </h2><p>  Our compatriots, despite the emerging image of holiday lovers, remain less demanding.  They are calm about repair flaws and menu oddities.  Therefore, they may like the hotel "Slovakia" (Saratov).  Photos in brochures are generally true, but seem somewhat more interesting.  For quite some time, Saratov will not become a tourist town, since the concept of good service has not yet been established here.  It is best here to cook yourself before a long trip or to stay on a business trip. </p><h2>  Unbiased look </h2><p>  What can be said as a result of the hotel?  Does it cause nostalgia for the past?  Most likely yes, because here is a typical ‚Äúscoop‚Äù: the pictures are beautiful, the food is delicious, the linen is fresh, but the staff of different ages and character are not always good.  Guests note that in the role of maids, women feel uncomfortable, so they can sometimes let go of causticity or even cheat on customers.  The hotel infrastructure is convenient, you can get to it quickly from anywhere.  Rooms of varying degrees of comfort, and accordingly, their prices are different.  Upon request, the staff provides a number of additional services.  Some customers wish to have a home-made breakfast in their room.  Others give their laundry and ironing.  The visitor can order a manicurist or a masseuse in the room.  Naturally, this costs additional amounts.  Pets are allowed in the room, but on condition that they are vaccinated in a muzzle (if possible).  Upon request, staff will clean the room. </p>
