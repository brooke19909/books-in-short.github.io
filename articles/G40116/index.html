So, often with the question "Where is Karelia?"  Associations are emerging with Asian states.  Meanwhile, these lands are considered Russian since the XIII century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is Karelia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/910079.jpg" width="378"></div>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The territory of this part of the mainland began to be inhabited by ancient people after the retreat of glaciers around the 7th century BC.  e.  The first ethnic formations recorded the annals of the first millennium of our time.  Traditionally they are called Finno-Ugric tribes. </p><p>  With the growth of Slavic cities in the Novgorod region, the surrounding space passed under the control of new princes.  So, they had conflicts with the Karelian nobility and the Swedes over the right to own the territory located beyond the Ladoga and Onega lakes. </p><p>  In the Russian Empire, data on where Karelia is legally located has repeatedly changed.  First, the lands belonged to Novgorod, then to the Ingermanland province (after it was renamed St. Petersburg), then the <span>Olonets province</span> with the central city of Petrozavodsk. </p><p>  The bulk of the population were <span>indigenous people,</span> who had the right to settle in other territories south of their native places.  So, the Karelians lived in the lands of Novgorod, St. Petersburg, Kaluga, Tver, Yaroslavl, Vladimir, Tambov, Vologda, Smolensk.  After 1917, where Karelia is now located, a labor commune was organized, then transformed into the Autonomous Republic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Karelia where is located" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/910081.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are lakes, rivers, hills, plains.  The mass of cultural monuments attracts connoisseurs of art and antiquity, and pilgrims visit shrines in large numbers.  It is worth noting where Karelia is located - the north-west of the European part of Russia, near the border of the Arctic Circle.  This gives color to residents and towns. </p><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  It is indisputable that these places are unique in their nature and culture.  Guests of the republic find entertainment to their liking.  However, spending holidays in the land of rivers and lakes is not very popular among the general population.  This situation has developed for many reasons.  First of all, it is weather conditions - where the Republic of Karelia is located, summers are short and not too hot.  Moreover, the northern part of the land is colder than the southern.  In the vicinity of the White Sea and <span>Lake Onega, the</span> warm season begins in early June, and ends already in early September.  Closer to the borders of the Murmansk region, the summer time frame shrinks by about four weeks. </p><p>  Those who are not afraid of torrential rains, strong winds and early frosts will find nature untouched by man, unique architectural complexes, a rich catch of fish and much more. </p><h2>  The mountains </h2><p>  A key role in the formation of the area is that where Karelia is located in Russia, full glaciation repeatedly appeared.  In the process of melting and freezing, the water masses created stone and sand chains, hewn rocks, and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is the Republic of Karelia" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/910083.jpg" width="500"></div>

So, Nuorunen is famous for a huge boulder that lies on three small stones.  Vottovaara is a place with a pronounced negative connotation.  It is ignored by local residents and scientists are studying with interest. </p><p>  The opposite of the designated object is Sampo.  Beliefs ascribe to exaltation the power of fulfillment of desires.  Karelia has many myths and legends associated with this mountain, where there are a lot of other objects named after these rocks.  Pyanur is located in the north of the republic.  This is a peaked snow peak, the foot of which is covered with coniferous forest.  It is surrounded by lakes on both sides.  Lovers of active tourism will enjoy a beautiful view of the mountain itself, its surroundings and magnificent panoramas after climbing. </p><p>  Kivakka is also a popular holiday destination in the Republic of Karelia, where there is a hiking trail, the most powerful waterfall in the republic, and beautiful nature untouched by man. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is Karelia in Russia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34978/910080.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Ponds </h2><p>  In these places more than 61 thousand lakes.  Among them, the largest are Ladoga and Onega.  Also, many rivers with various obstacles cut through the landscape.  Thanks to this, the region is very attractive for tourists who wish to move through the water. </p>
