It is interesting at any time of the year.  One of the most interesting places of the resort is the Olympic pair in Sochi.  What to see on its territory? </p><h2>  The main attraction of Sochi </h2><p>  After the 2014 Olympics, the Olympic Park became the most visited place in the city.  “What to see in Sochi?”  - This is the main question that interests all guests of the resort.  Of course, it’s worth going to the Olympic Heritage Site.  Indeed, the main sports complexes are located in the park.  Currently, the complex is transferred to the city and everyone can visit it.  In the Olympic Park you can not only see interesting sights, but also have a great time with family or friends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nairi-sochi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi Park" class="if uuid-2920397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2920397.jpg"></div><p>  All Olympic venues are located in two zones: Mountain and Coastal, the distance between which is 50 km.  In the coastal zone in the Adler area, Sochi Olympic Park is located.  What to see in this amazing place?  The attention of tourists is worthy of absolutely all objects, since each of them is worthy of attention. </p><h2>  Where is the park located? </h2><p>  The Olympic Park is located in the center of Sochi, in the Adler microdistrict.  Near it are located such objects as the Church of St. John the Baptist, a media center, a natural ornithological park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.40938970000001" data-lng="39.97139040000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/6/6/0/10660.png"></div><p>  If you do not know what to see in Sochi, Olympic Park should be the first object during your excursion.  The complex occupies an impressive territory.  Its objects are far enough from each other (about 15-20 minutes).  Tourists have the opportunity not only to walk around the park, but also ride on electric cars that run on its territory. </p><h2>  History of the park </h2><p>  Specialists approached the preparation of facilities for the Olympics with all responsibility, because it was necessary to build a multifunctional complex convenient in all respects.  The climate of Sochi became a big problem in the design process: humid, subtropical with little snow and warm winters.  But the issue was resolved quite simply.  It was decided to build two clusters: mountain - Krasnaya Polyana and Rosa Khutor, coastal - in the Imereti Bay.  The climatic conditions of the first district made it possible to erect facilities for conducting open-air competitions.  The second cluster was designed to equip indoor stadiums. </p><p>  Before the construction began, the Imereti Lowland did not represent anything interesting.  It was a quiet place surrounded by small villages.  On its territory, summer residents cultivated gardens.  There was no traffic intersection and no infrastructure.  The construction of the Olympic Park has completely changed the region for the better.  Now here is the largest tourist center of the country.  The coastal cluster was incredibly conveniently designed.  On its territory there are stadiums, a park area, service buildings, a cottage town and more. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Park Infrastructure </h2><p>  The Olympic Park has become the main object of the Olympics.  On its territory there are sports arenas and a bowl of Olympic flame.  The park hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the games.  And now the work of the Olympic Park in Sochi has not been stopped.  It hosts entertainment and sports events, museums.  There is an amusement park here, and in the evenings tourists have the opportunity to enjoy the fountain in the Olympic Park.  In Sochi, it is difficult to find a more interesting place than a park.  Its area reaches 200 hectares.  Here you can go rollerblading, bicycles and segways. </p><h2>  Musical show </h2><p>  The fountain is one of the main attractions of Sochi and the Olympic Park.  All the guests of the resort seek to see the fountain, or rather, its music show.  You can admire its beauty at any time of the year.  True, the operating time varies depending on the duration of daylight hours.  In the summer, you can enjoy a daily show of the singing fountain in Sochi Olympic Park.  The schedule of submissions remains unchanged.  In the evening, the fountain is open from 20.00 to 21.00, and in the afternoon it turns on every thirty minutes.  In the spring and autumn, the evening show can be seen from 19.00 to 20.00, and in the winter from 18.00 to 19.00. </p><div class="photo" data-original="city-sochi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Singing fountain" class="if uuid-2920401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2920401.jpg"></div><p>  According to tourists, the fountain is a must-see.  The sculpture is at the foot of the Olympic flame.  The large fountain fascinates with glare and dance of water to the music of famous Russian works.  In the evenings, it looks especially fabulous. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  "Medal Plaza" </h2><p>  Medal Plaza Square is one of the main places of the Olympic Park in Sochi.  What to see in the summer, no doubt.  The square is the central gathering place for all guests.  It hosts holidays that are visited not only by guests of the city, but also by citizens.  It was on this square during the Olympics that the winners were awarded.  Its dimensions are impressive (48 thousand square meters). </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn----8sbwaafbgebmvqgqj.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Medal Plaza&quot;" class="if uuid-2920404" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2920404.jpg"></div><p>  A popular venue for photo shoots is the “Wall of Glory,” which is a composition with engraved names of Olympic winners. </p><p>  Another outstanding object in the square is the Bowl of Fire, at the foot of which is the Singing Fountain. </p><h2>  Fisht Stadium </h2><p>  Fisht Stadium has gone down in history forever, because it was here that the memorable and colorful opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympic Games took place.  The sports complex was built in 2013.  According to the architects, the building was supposed to resemble a snowy peak.  That is why the stadium got the name “Fisht”, which is translated from Adyghe as “white head”.  This is the name of the Caucasus mountain range. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn----8sbwaafbgebmvqgqj.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fisht Stadium" class="if uuid-2920406" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2920406.jpg"></div><p>  The stadium seats up to 40,000 spectators.  In the process of its construction, a cemetery of Old Believers was found, which is now surrounded by a fence and thujas. </p><h2>  Iceberg Palace </h2><p>  The Iceberg Sports Palace is a stunningly beautiful colored glass building that closely resembles an ice block.  It was built in 2012.  Within its walls, competitions in figure skating were held.  The palace has an area of ​​68,000 square meters.  It can accommodate up to 12,000 guests.  The building has a training and main skating rink. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tonkosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Iceberg Palace" class="if uuid-2920399" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2920399.jpg"></div><p>  After the Olympics, it was decided to move the stadium to another place.  But later they abandoned such an idea.  During the construction of the complex, the latest technologies were used, which guarantee reliability and a long service life. </p><h2>  "Washer" </h2><p>  The ice puck "Puck" is made in the form of the main attribute of hockey, it is somewhat reminiscent of a snow whirlwind.  Such an unusual snowstorm effect was achieved thanks to the mounted LEDs and lamps.  The building was erected for three years.  Now it is one of the significant objects of the park. </p><div class="photo" data-original="samovar.travel" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ice Arena &quot;Puck&quot;" class="if uuid-2920409" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2920409.jpg"></div><p>  The collapsible design of the ice arena allows you to transfer it to any other region of the country.
