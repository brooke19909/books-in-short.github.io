How to flash Samsung 5230?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The Samsung</span> 5230 is equipped with a display that responds to pressing with any item.  What to choose: pencil, stylus or fingers - the user decides for himself.  The only caveat: the touchpad does not respond to gloved hands, therefore, their management is excluded.  When pressed, the phone will emit a sound or vibrate, depending on the settings. </p><p>  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãthree inches (approximately 7.5 cm), its resolution is 240 x 400 pixels.  Colors are perfectly transmitted - the picture and video are full of juicy and bright colors.  It is because of this that watching videos on the Samsung 5230 is a pleasure.  They look much sharper and more beautiful. </p><p>  Customer reviews are mixed.  We can immediately say that 90% of consumers have a single problem - the sensor quickly ‚Äúfails‚Äù.  Its repair costs a lot of money.  Of the advantages, people note a loud speaker, low cost of the device, beautiful appearance and software, a good camera.  Of the minuses - the lack of Wi-Fi and 3G, the difficulty in finding a headset, the weakness of the back of the case. </p>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  In the sun, the matrix behaves quite adequately: the brightness disappears, ‚Äúblind spots‚Äù appear.  However, the correct viewing angles and contrast of the phone itself allow you to work with the device even in direct sunlight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The pluses of the Samsung 5230 screen (the photo of which is located just below) also include the fact that it easily responds to pressing at any degree of pollution. </p><p>  On the display you can see up to 10 lines of plain text and up to 3 - service.  In addition, the scale of the written can be changed thanks to the ‚Äúrocker‚Äù, which is responsible for the volume.  The standard font in the phone is also changing, but the options provided do not differ much from each other.  An advantage is the fact that the letters are actually quite large, so you can read it from a relatively far distance. </p><p>  The Samsung 5230 phone (specifications will be described in detail below) has the function of automatically scrolling through photos when the screen is rotated.  The control is given the Smart Unlock function, which allows, when in standby mode, to unlock the device, call a function, or call a specific number. </p>

    <h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  At the bottom of the phone on the outside are three buttons (cancel, call and return).  As active operation has shown, they are enough to use the device without unnecessary difficulties.  There is a small distance between them.  Buttons also protrude slightly from the panel, which completely eliminates accidental clicks on them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The speaker, which is responsible for listening to music and the audibility of the interlocutor's speech when making a call, is located above the display.  Samsung 5230 gets a well-deserved 5 on a five-point system for the quality of the conversation: words are clearly audible, no noise. </p><p>  The side edge of the case includes keys such as locks and cameras, as well as an eyelet for the key fob.  On the other hand, there is a volume rocker, which in some cases is responsible for zooming and scrolling the list, as well as a connector for USB, a charger and headphones.  Behind you can watch the camera.  The panel has a rough surface and a dot pattern, made of glossy material.  The weight of the device is 94 g. It fits comfortably in the hand and does not slip. </p><p>  The phone supports one SIM card and a memory card, which is inserted into the slot located directly under the SIM card slot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung 5230 specifications" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1047105.jpg" width="538"></div>

    <h2>  Samsung 5230 Menu: Contact and Call List </h2><p>  <em>Call log</em> </p><p>  Here you can organize calls at your own discretion: by received, missed, rejected, etc. There is also a call manager where you can see the duration of all calls and their cost, the counter of sent and received text messages.  In principle, the design of the section is very simple and straightforward, all the manipulations can be performed literally with one or two touches, therefore, there are no problems during operation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <em>Phone book</em> </p><p>  You can find the required number by scrolling with your finger, or by resorting to the built-in search.  The information in this section of the menu, depending on the desire of the owner, is depicted in different ways: in unsorted form, by group, by "favorite" numbers.  When creating a new contact, the user will be pleasantly surprised by the amount of data that he can provide.  There are such fields as "birthday", "site", "note", "fax", "actual address", "mailbox", "place of work". </p>

    <h2>  "Multimedia" and "Internet" as sections of the menu </h2><p>  <em>Multimedia</em> </p><p>  Here, the user will see a wonderful multifunctional player that is perfectly ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù under the control of a finger.  Looking at it, the buyer will immediately notice the resemblance to other players that the South Korean company provides in their products.  In the library, you can sort files by sections such as "albums", "genres", "artists", "playlists" and "frequently listened to songs".  Being in the player, with one click it is easy to call the equalizer or set the repetition of a particular track, forward it using communication tools.  And here you can put the song on the alarm clock and the bell.  The sound is clear and rich.  The only problem will be the lack of a universal headphone jack, but this can easily be fixed with an adapter. </p><p>  <em>Browser</em> </p><p>  This section is fully customizable.  For example, zooming in or out is easy by swiping up or down, respectively.  Double-tap on the screen returns to the original view.  For those who find it difficult to perform such manipulations with the phone, scaling is provided with the volume key. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to flash samsung 5230" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1047097.jpg" width="382"></div>

It also happens when the device stops starting or does not work correctly. </p><p>  So what is needed for the firmware? </p><ol><li>  Telephone.  First you need to check its system connector.  If it is dirty, be sure to clean it.  In the event that traces of corrosion are visible, for example, from liquid ingress, it makes no sense to flash it.  The USB cable does not recognize devices.  When the device simply does not turn on, then you do not need to try to change the software, it is not a problem. </li><li>  Battery.  It must be charged at least 50%.  If during the firmware it is discharged, the phone will never turn on again. </li><li>  New PC Studio.  Without this program, it will not be possible to transfer the necessary elements for the firmware from the PC.  It can be installed using the disk that comes with the phone, or simply downloaded from the Internet. </li><li>  USB cable  It is usually included. </li></ol><p>  First of all, you need to make sure that the PC Studio program is working.  After that, you should download the correct firmware version from the Internet (preferably the latest).  Then you need to start installing it on the computer.  After completing this process, the Samsung 5230 mobile phone can be connected to a PC via USB.  The program itself recognizes the connected device and starts the firmware process. </p><p>  After completion, you need to turn on the phone.  If desired, the software version can be viewed by typing the combination ‚Äú* # 1234 #‚Äù on the numeric keypad. </p>
