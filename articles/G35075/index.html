Nowadays, buying things you like is much easier thanks to loans.  Customers of Home Credit Bank in their reviews point out favorable conditions for granting loans, often call this financial institution the most reliable and give arguments in favor of working with it. </p><h2>  A few words about the company </h2><p>  The first office of Home Credit Bank was opened in 2002 in Nizhny Novgorod.  The company quickly enough entrenched in the financial market of the country, a couple of years later joining the twenty largest banking organizations in the country.  According to customer reviews, Home Credit Bank provided loans to buyers of chain stores such as Eldorado, Technosila, M. Video. </p><p>  Three years later, the financial company managed to enter the market of car loans and housing mortgages, but the 2008 crisis prevented development in this direction.  All large-scale lending programs had to be closed.  Since then, the bank has been focusing on: </p><ul><li>  Retail banking products. </li><li>  Deposits </li><li>  Salary projects. </li><li>  The development of Internet and SMS banking. </li></ul><p>  The Russians consider this financial organization one of the most loyal to potential borrowers, as they write in their reviews.  The license to Home Credit Bank, which occupies the top ranks of ratings by the volume of individuals' deposits, was issued by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation in March 2012. </p><h2>  Conditions for employees </h2><p>  Opinions about the company are often shared by consultants and company managers.  In general, people are happy with their work.  Credit experts in reviews of Home Credit Bank report that professional growth is possible here.  Commercial banking organization has been repeatedly recognized as one of the model employers.  According to the management, such a high place in the list is the result of continuous scrupulous work within the company, customer focus and the desire to create comfortable working conditions for employees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A clear confirmation that the bank takes care of its subordinates is the opening of a kindergarten in Obninsk.  This representative office is the largest.  The average age of the staff is 26 years.  Among the young employees there are many mothers with young children from one and a half years.  Since the issue of placing children in kindergartens in Obninsk is acute, the management decided to create all the conditions so that mothers have the opportunity to work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.retail-loyalty.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Home Credit Bank Customer Reviews" class="if uuid-2954649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2954649.jpg"></div><h2>  Why do people choose this particular bank </h2><p>  Each client has its own reasons for contacting this organization.  However, it is impossible to deny the fact that obtaining a loan at Home Credit Bank (according to customer reviews) is often much easier than at any other company.  The Bank is known for the lack of strict requirements in relation to individuals applying for a loan.  Here they quickly consider applications from new borrowers and offer unusually favorable conditions to regular customers.  In addition, you can receive the required amount in cash at Home Credit Bank on the day of treatment.  Many citizens mention this in reviews. </p><p>  A financial institution does not work with legal entities.  Consumer loans are issued only to the public.  Another nuance that makes customers choose in favor of this bank is the lack of the need to confirm the purpose of the loan.  Customers in reviews of Home Credit Bank note this fact.  They consider the important advantage that the company does not control the process of using the issued loan.  Thus, a citizen can spend money for various purposes: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Buying a new or overhaul of an old car. </li><li>  A trip to another country on vacation. </li><li>  Repair in the apartment, updating furniture or wardrobe. </li><li>  Treatment, expensive examination, etc. </li></ul><p>  For most customers, an important role is played by the simple procedure for obtaining a loan, the absence of the need to seek guarantors and provide property as collateral.  This is especially convenient when money needs to be received in a short time. </p><p>  Other customers are attracted by Home Credit Bank by the opportunity to choose their own method of debt repayment.  The company annually launches new programs, offers interesting and advantageous offers. </p><h2>  Borrower Requirements </h2><p>  Unlike other banking companies, Home Credit Bank lends money without attracting guarantors and pledging property.  Convenient to borrowers and a concise list of documents that must be presented to a bank employee: </p><ul><li>  Passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Certificate of insurance personal account (SNILS). </li></ul><p>  In the absence of SNILS, you can provide another document (of your choice): passport, driver's or pension certificate.  Citizens from 22 to 64 years old can apply for a loan at Home Credit Bank, and 64 is the age limit that a borrower will reach at the time of debt repayment. </p><p>  A prerequisite for the issuance of a loan is a permanent job.  The client must be officially employed for the past three months or more.  According to customer reviews, Home Credit Bank does not issue a cash loan to citizens who do not have a permanent residence permit or temporary registration in the region of circulation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To make a final decision on a loan, bank employees check the credit history of the client, which is contained in the NBCH.  Depending on the status of a citizen, the amount of the loan and the interest rate are determined.  In the case of a damaged credit history (for example, non-repayment, delay in loans at other companies), it is unlikely that you will be able to get a consumer loan from Home Credit Bank.  In reviews, some citizens also mention this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.stuff.co.nz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Home Credit Bank installments terms and conditions reviews" class="if uuid-2954657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2954657.jpg"></div><h2>  POS-loan: how to apply at Home Credit Bank </h2><p>  This is the most popular type of consumer loans that are allocated to customers to pay for goods and services.  In partner stores, representatives of the bank are present who are involved in the issue of obtaining a commodity loan. </p><p>  The partners of Home Credit Bank are hundreds of retail chains, each of which has a separate tariff plan.  Here are just a few branded stores that collaborate with this financial institution: </p><ul><li>  Ascona. </li><li>  The Messenger. </li><li>  "El Dorado". </li><li>  "M Video". </li><li>  Adamas. </li><li>  "Elena Furs." </li><li>  "The Snow Queen". </li></ul><p>  Home Credit Bank offers customers to issue not only a standard loan, which implies the calculation of interest on the use of credit funds, but also the so-called interest-free installments. </p><p>  You can apply for a POS loan when purchasing any product in the store.  As for installments, the assortment covered by the right to interest-free purchase is always limited to the distribution network.  Thus, the store determines in advance which goods can be purchased in installments and which are not.  This service can be of two types.  Let's consider each of them. </p><p>  The first option is actually the same POS loan with a fixed interest rate in the agreement.  The monthly payments include interest on the loan.  To provide the buyer with the cherished 0% per annum, the store itself makes a discount on goods that it sells in installments.  Consequently, the bank levels the discount due to accrued interest.  It seems that the client pays only the cost of his purchase, but in fact, goods with a discount on credit are made on credit. </p><p>  If the store does not want to make a discount, then how will the bank lend to the buyer?  There is only one option left - the design of a regular POS loan with interest. </p><p>  The second option involves the provision of installments directly by the trade organization.  In this case, the bank is not involved, the contract is concluded between the seller and the buyer, additional fees and interest are not charged. </p><h2>  Loan Program Terms </h2><p>  In addition to a pos-loan, you can take a loan in cash.  In the reviews of Home Credit Bank, users who apply for a loan confirm that it is really easy to apply for it at this company. </p><p>  To get a personal loan, you need to choose one of two offers of the bank.  The first is valid for regular customers.  They have the opportunity to get a loan on more favorable terms: </p><ul><li>  Interest rate from 10.9%. </li><li>  The minimum loan amount is 10 thousand rubles. </li><li>  The maximum loan amount is 1 million rubles. </li><li>  Loan term - up to seven years. </li></ul><p>  The following restrictions are established for new customers who are first willing to apply for a loan at Home Credit Bank: </p><ul><li>  Interest rate from 14.9%. </li><li>  The minimum loan amount is 30 thousand rubles. </li><li>  The maximum loan amount is 500 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Loan term - up to five years. </li></ul><p>  Special attention should be paid to the <span>loan program</span> for depositors and holders of payroll cards.  For these categories of customers, a consumer loan is provided at a minimum rate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ynet.co.il" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Installment plan from Home Credit Bank reviews" class="if uuid-2954658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2954658.jpg"></div><h2>  Calculator for calculating </h2><p>  To choose a suitable loan program, there is no need to go to the bank branch with a package of documents.  You can apply directly on the official website of the company.  Here, customers have the opportunity to use an online loan calculator. </p><p>  To find out the size of the overpayment and the monthly loan payment, you need to fill in all the free fields and click the button ‚ÄúCalculate‚Äù.  The online calculator on the Home Credit Bank website has many advantages: </p><ul><li>  You can use it for free. </li><li>  It is a universal tool that is suitable for calculating any type of lending, including pos- and car loans, mortgages. </li><li>  A convenient format for drawing up a payment schedule, which shows how much money will be spent on repaying the loan body and interest every month. </li><li>  Possibility of settlement taking into account the payment of one or more early installments. </li></ul><p>  According to reviews of loans of customers of Home Credit Bank, the calculator makes an accurate calculation, which fully coincides with the figures that will subsequently be indicated in the contract. </p><h2>  How to get a loan </h2><p>  Making a consumer loan does not take much time and does not require a huge package of documents.  The bank reviews applications, usually within one business day. </p><p>  First, you need to fill out a simple form on the website of Home Credit Bank.  In St. Petersburg (according to customer reviews) the decision is made in a couple of hours.  In order to increase the likelihood of approving a loan application, in addition to standard data (surname, first name, middle name, date of birth, series and passport number), you should indicate your mobile phone number, email address, confirm your consent to the processing of data and sending a request to the National Bureau of Credit Histories . </p><p>  After waiting for a positive decision, you can begin to select the optimal loan conditions.  When a suitable program is selected, the client will be assigned a day of admission at the nearest bank branch to arrange a loan and issue funds. </p><p>  It is important to indicate reliable information when filling out the application and ensure that the information entered fully coincides with the passport.  Having discovered a discrepancy, a bank specialist has every right to refuse to grant a loan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cbkg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Consumer loan &quot;Home Credit&quot; bank reviews" class="if uuid-2954659" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2954659.jpg"></div><h2>  Payment Methods </h2><p>  There are many ways to make monthly payments to pay off a loan.  Home Credit Bank applies an annuity debt payment scheme.  The entire amount is repaid in equal installments, but at the same time, the client first pays mainly interest on the use of credit funds, and then the main debt. </p><p>  Unlike other banking organizations, Home Credit Bank provides for the possibility of changing the date of making monthly payments.  This is specified in the contract.  This opportunity is most often used by those who are forced to pay off several loans at once. </p><p>  You can deposit funds to pay off debt: </p><ul><li>  In your account on the official website. </li><li>  Directly at the cash desk of any branch of Home Credit Bank.  In Moscow (according to customer reviews) this method of payment is not popular, despite the complete lack of commission when paying. </li><li>  Using ATMs Cash-in by specifying the details of the financial institution and the contract number. </li><li>  Through electronic payment systems. </li><li>  By postal order. </li></ul><p>  In addition, you can deposit funds for a loan at the terminal or cash desk of any other Russian bank, but in this case you will have to pay a fee for using its services. </p><h2>  Is it possible to pay the bank ahead of schedule </h2><p>  Repaying a loan ahead of time specified in the contract is the right of every citizen, enshrined in law.  Not a single bank, including Home Credit, has the right to refuse the debtor to pay the balance ahead of schedule, but at the same time, a loan agreement may provide for various nuances that also need to be taken into account. </p><p>  The client has the right to partially or in full to fulfill his obligations ahead of schedule to a credit institution.  There are a lot of reviews about early repayment of a loan at Home Credit Bank.  In none of them do users write about difficulties that have arisen. </p><p>  The differences between partial or final payment of debt are not so significant, but a little attention should be paid to them.  Regardless of whether the borrower covers all of the debt with his installment, or only part of it, he is obliged to notify the lender of the upcoming payment no later than 30 days in advance.  We are not talking about monthly payments.  For early repayment, you must write a statement in the form of a bank and make the necessary amount.  When the date of write-off comes, the funds will be transferred to repay the principal. </p><p>  If the borrower does not have enough money to fully cover the debt ahead of schedule, he has the right to write an application for payment of the debt indicating the amount in excess of the size of the monthly loan payment.  After the funds are credited to the personal account, the bank employees will be forced to recalculate the amount of debt and, in agreement with the borrower, reduce the amount of the fixed payment or shorten the loan term. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.retail-loyalty.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Installment card from Home Credit Bank reviews" class="if uuid-2954651" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2954651.jpg"></div><h2>  Installment card: main advantages and conditions </h2><p>  Today, this banking product is very popular.  If you believe the reviews, an installment card from Home Credit Bank is much more convenient and profitable than a regular credit card, because it allows you to solve financial issues in an instant and without overpayments. </p><p>  The annual interest rate on the installment card is zero, but only if the main condition is observed - to pay the debt on time.  The scheme of applying for an installment card from Home Credit Bank (according to customer reviews) is practically no different from the procedure for obtaining a loan.  An application for this product can be sent online or contact one of the bank branches. </p><p>  The size of the financial limit is set individually for each client and is in the range of 10-300 thousand rubles.  The size of the loan depends on the income of the citizen, his place of residence, age, availability of real estate and other conditions.  The period of validity of interest-free preferences is not limited until the client violates the installment conditions.  In the reviews of Home Credit Bank, people note that even with a one-time delay or replenishment of the card, the interest in the amount of 29.8% per annum is not automatically accrued. </p><h2>  Pros and Cons of Installment Cards </h2><p>  In their reviews, customers note that the main drawback of an installment card is the inability to withdraw cash.  It will not be possible to withdraw money from an ATM from it, but you can purchase goods through it in any stores equipped with a terminal for electronic payments.  In addition, electronic wallets cannot be replenished with an installment card.  This banking product is not involved in bonus accumulation programs and cashback services. </p><p>  However, there are many reviews of installments from Home Credit Bank, in which users write that they were satisfied with this service and advise it to be issued by others.  The advantages of such a card include: </p><ul><li>  Simple and understandable conditions. </li><li>  Minimum time and documents for registration. </li><li>  Long-term grace period. </li><li>  No need to pay for card service. </li></ul><p>  If you follow the rules of use and pay off the debt on the card in a timely manner, this will positively affect your credit history and increase the borrower's chances of obtaining a larger loan, as the need arises. </p><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Debit Card from Home Credit Bank </font></font></h2><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A debit card is a more convenient cash equivalent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The company offers its customers to issue a "Benefit" card. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reviews about Home Credit Bank describe all its advantages.</font></font></p><div class="photo" data-original="starbank.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about the card use &quot;Home Credit&quot; Bank" class="if uuid-2954653" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2954653.jpg"></div><p>      ,     ,         ,     .      ,  .  ,        ,       . </p><p>  ,  ¬´¬ª   ¬´ ¬ª   ,         .  ,    7 %     ,         10 . . </p><p> The predecessor of "Benefit" was the Cosmos debit card from Home Credit Bank.  In the reviews, customers indicate that those who opened an account before the end of 2017 continue to use it.  The principle of operation of both cards is not different, but the "Benefit" is a more profitable and improved project. </p><p>  Everyone can apply for a debit card at Home Credit Bank for free, the risk of refusal is minimal.  Unlike credit cards, debit products are not prohibited from issuing to minors with the consent of their legal representatives. </p><h2>  Types of deposits, interest rates </h2><p>  Bank deposits are a simple and effective way to increase your free finances.  Only individuals can make a profit on deposits at Home Credit Bank.  To put money at a profitable interest can not only citizens of the Russian Federation, but also foreigners. </p><p>  According to customer reviews, deposits at Home Credit Bank generate income on the same principle as in other financial institutions.  A person deposits a certain amount into his depositary account and does not use it for the period approved by the contract.  Having provided money for temporary use of the bank, the client can count on receiving a stable profit from financial transactions. </p><p>  Home Credit Bank has advantageous offers on deposit processing.  The rate for each client is calculated individually and depends on the amount of the deposit and its validity period.  The company offers a wide selection of deposit programs that allow individuals to receive a certain income.  Interest is paid monthly or at the end of the deposit term, with or without capitalization.  The conditions depend on the specific program. </p><p>  Everyone who applies to Home Credit Bank has the opportunity to choose a deposit that best suits their personal interests.  An application for opening a deposit can be submitted on the official website.  Today the company offers the following types of deposit programs: </p><ul><li>  "Quick income."  The minimum investment amount is 1000 rubles, the deposit validity period is from six months.  A deposit can only be opened in national currency. </li><li>  "Capital".  Deposits are accepted in Russian rubles for three years.  The minimum deposit amount is 1000 rubles. </li><li>  "Profitable Year."  Unlike previous programs, this involves investments in rubles, dollars or euros for a period of at least 12 months.  The minimum deposit amount is 1000 rubles, 100 dollars or 100 euros, the possibility of capitalization is negotiated with the client. </li><li>  "Pension."  Offer valid for citizens with a pension certificate.  A deposit, the minimum amount of which may be at least 1000 rubles, is issued for a year and a half. </li><li>  "Cabinet".  This offer can be used by investors with a minimum contribution amount of 1 million rubles.  The client will be able to use his money only after 12 months. </li></ul><p>  To make a deposit at Home Credit Bank, you need to contact the nearest branch of the company after preliminary approval of the application on the site.  The only document the client needs is his passport.  You can make an initial deposit to a deposit account in cash or by bank transfer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aravot.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Home Credit Bank Deposits Customer Reviews" class="if uuid-2954655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2954655.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Home Credit Bank does not refuse loans to almost anyone, not all customers are satisfied with the services and conditions offered by this institution.  Less than 50% of users recommend this bank.  Why it happens?  Indeed, at first glance, the company seems to be one of the best in the country.  In their comments, users indicate many reasons why you should not trust Home Credit Bank. </p><p>  In the reviews, people report that some employees, for unknown reasons, deceive customers when they indicate credit rates.  Actual amounts of overpayments for using a loan can several times exceed the rates specified in the contract. </p><p>  To confuse customers, the bank uses a very ingenious scheme.  For example, the agreement states that the client must pay 14% per annum for using the loan, but the borrower‚Äôs obligation to repay the loan at a refinancing rate that is not fixed and can take off at any time is written in small print there.  Deceived customers, if you believe the reviews, often found themselves in a situation where instead of 15-20% per annum under the contract they had to repay the debt at a rate of 50-60%. </p><p>  Home Credit bank employees do not consider it their duty to warn credit card holders that interest-free periods apply exclusively to non-cash transactions.  If the user withdraws money from the card at the ATM, the benefit ceases to apply and interest will begin to accrue. </p><p>  A lot of reviews from customers who had to deal with the incompetence of bank staff.  For example, a common problem is the late closing of credit card accounts, which is reflected in the credit history of citizens.  The imposition of insurance and additional banking products is another reason why this bank is not recommended by its customers to their loved ones.  Returning money for an insurance policy in case of early repayment of debt is very problematic.  It is important to note that insurance is issued even without the consent of the client. </p><p>  It is worth noting that many citizens, when signing a loan agreement, do not read what is written in very small print, paying attention only to the highlighted lines.  However, often it is in difficult to read fragments of the text that information is reported according to which people find themselves in a debt hole. </p><p>  In order to successfully cooperate with Home Credit Bank, customers must carefully read all the documents before signing. </p>
