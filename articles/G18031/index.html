Banks compete among themselves, luring customers with profitable interest rates on loans and deposits.  Attract financial institutions and a large selection of additional services.  Recently, Expert Bank has been gaining more and more popularity.  Customer reviews are proof of this. </p><h2>  Financial Institution Summary </h2><p>  The first steps to create a modern "Expert Bank" were taken in 1994.  Then a <span>limited liability partnership</span> under the name ‚ÄúSiberian Merchant Bank‚Äù was registered.  In the formation of the authorized capital, only 16 individuals participated, as well as the Omsk Regional Council of Trade Unions. </p><p>  Initially, his main area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity was related to the support of small businesses.  Profitable loans were issued for private entrepreneurs.  Interesting conditions for businessmen are still offered by Expert Bank.  Reviews show that 60% of the services of this financial institution are connected with the maintenance of individual entrepreneurs. </p>

    <p>  From the very beginning, the bank has been actively working with domestic payment systems.  Interestingly, this campaign was one of the first to introduce plastic cards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 2001, the bank was transformed into a Closed Joint-Stock Company.  Then the authorized capital already exceeded 1 billion rubles.  Since December 2004, the company has been a member of the deposit guarantee fund. </p><h2>  Customer credit </h2><p>  Reviews show that consumer loans remain the most sought after among individuals.  This can be confirmed by any employees of economic structures, including financial experts of Post Bank.  Feedback on the conditions offered by the institution described can be heard for the most part positive. </p>

    <p>  Citizens of the Russian Federation aged 21 to 65 years can act as borrowers.  The main condition is official employment in one place for at least 6 months.  Confirm the information will have a certificate of income. </p><p>  The minimum loan amount is 100 thousand rubles.  The rate is 18% per annum.  It is also proposed to use a convenient loan calculator.  ‚ÄúExpert Bank‚Äù (we offer you your feedback about it) gives you the opportunity to find out the amount of the estimated minimum payment before the transaction is concluded.  The maximum loan term is 60 months. </p><p>  On more favorable terms, military personnel can borrow money.  Mandatory experience at the last place of service - 4 months.  The loan rate is 16% per annum. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Car loan </h2><p>  To quickly manage to solve all the tasks is almost impossible without your own transport.  This is well understood by the managers of Expert Bank.  Customer reviews show that a financial institution offers favorable credit conditions for the purchase of a car.  The amount of the transaction can start from 100 thousand rubles.  In this case, Casco design is not necessary.  You can purchase both a new vehicle and a used car.  The contractual rate is 14% per annum.  The maximum term is 60 months.  Perhaps early repayment of the loan without penalty. </p><p>  Any citizen of the Russian Federation who has reached the age of 21 can become a client of the bank.  It is important that at the time the contract expires, the client should not be older than 65 years.  That is, if a person aged 63 years old wants to buy a vehicle on credit, the contract can be concluded only for 2 years.  To conclude a transaction, you must provide: </p><ul><li>  passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  SNILS number; </li><li>  income statement for the last 6 months. </li></ul><h2>  Credit Housing </h2><p>  Not every young family can afford to buy an apartment today.  It will be more profitable to buy square meters at the construction stage.  However, in this case, the collected funds may not be enough.  This is where Expert Bank can come to the rescue. </p><p>  Employee reviews show that housing lending is very much in demand today.  And the plus is that there are no restrictions on the maximum amount.  A financial institution studies the client‚Äôs application, evaluates its solvency and makes a decision on the conclusion of the transaction.  The maximum loan term is 30 years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>
