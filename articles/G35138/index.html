    <h2>  Guests on Nutrition </h2><p>  Marawila, like the nearest city of Negombo, where you should go out of interest, is replete with restaurants and cafes with reasonable prices.  Staying here on vacation, you can not help but try the seafood, which is perfectly cooked here.  But in general, the food at the hotel is excellent.  But there is something for everybody.  Most of the people resting here are Arabs, Indians and Chinese, because a considerable number of dishes are made based on their tastes.  That is salty and islet.  But there is a choice for European guests.  A large number of fruits are offered - bananas, watermelons, papaya, sweet pineapples. </p><p>  Breakfast is standard - vegetables, omelets, scrambled eggs, toasts, pastries.  But lunches and dinners are different every day - dishes are not repeated.  There are lots of salads - for every taste.  Meat, seafood, fish, poultry, sweets, vegetables - all in abundance.  Very polite and helpful waiters who are always interested in whether the visitor needs something and whether he is satisfied with everything. </p><h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  162 rooms are in Club Palm Bay 4 *.  Deluxe Room is a stylish, modern apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã55 sq.m.  Inside there is a king size bed.  It is worth noting that the rooms have access to their own furnished terrace, which offers a picturesque view of the surrounding surroundings. </p><p>  It also has powerful air conditioning, a personal safe, satellite TV and tea and coffee making facilities.  There is also a fan, a seating area and a telephone.  Guests staying at this apartment can use the wake-up service. </p><p>  Many people who wish to stay at the hotel request a Standard Room.  But the hotel has all apartments of only one class - "deluxe" (and separate offers for newlyweds).  It is worth, perhaps, to note the difference in the apartments in terms of the number of guests.  Some rooms can accommodate only two people, while others - three.  This apartment has an extra bed for another guest. </p>

    <h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  Living in apartments can cost a lot.  In this regard, it all depends on such a factor as the season.  Of course, the climate in Sri Lanka is such that you can swim and sunbathe throughout the year.  Only there are periods of monsoon (in May).  However, since most people spend their summer vacations, the high season is considered this time. </p><p>  The average price for a daily stay in a room for two people is 6,000 rubles.  The price includes breakfast, free cancellation, VAT, city tax and hotel service charge.  30,000 rubles for two come out per week, which, in principle, is not much.  Accommodation for three people, respectively, will cost three thousand a day more.  If you want to save money, it is better to use early booking.  Or regularly check prices to choose the best price. </p><h2>  What you should know </h2><p>  Check-in at 12:00.  Guests are evicted from morning until 11:00.  In the hotel you can live with children of any age.  If guests come with a child whose age is less than 2 years, then for his stay you will not have to pay.  But he will have to sleep on the beds in the room.  However, you can inform in advance, even when filling out the application, that the trip is planned with the baby, and in this case, a crib will be installed in the apartment. </p><p>  If the child is older, then for his stay will have to pay (50% of the cost per person).  But he must be younger than 12. If the child is 13, then he is already considered an adult guest, and the full price is paid for him. </p><p>  Need extra beds?  It is necessary to make a request to the hotel.  In advance, before departure.  Administration must send confirmation. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  People who have been to this hotel claim that this is a wonderful, fairly inexpensive option for those who dream of a relaxing and secluded vacation in a picturesque place.  Everything here has to do with it.  Guests pay special attention to the territory of the complex, which is the main highlight of the hotel.  Here silence and tranquility reigns.  Everything is beautiful, well-groomed - tropical trees and flowers grow everywhere.  The territory is so good that songbirds, chipmunks and mongooses settled here, who are so used to people that they became almost tame.  And lizards live in the lagoon. </p><p>  And the service here is decent - the administrators are polite and welcoming, and the maids are cleaned daily and honestly.  In general, who wants a paradise holiday - he should go here. </p>
