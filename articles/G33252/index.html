    <p>  This model is the "older brother" of Huawei P10.  Mostly smartphones differ only in size, screen size and cameras.  The differences also include different battery capacities. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The Huawei P10 Plus smartphone (its price at the moment is about 40 thousand rubles) looks pretty stylish.  In the back, it has similarities with the iPhone 7. However, all its faces are rounded, which is why the smartphone is very convenient in the hand.  There are no distinctive features in the front.  In addition to the screen, there is a front camera, a speaker, various sensors and a light indicator.  At the bottom there is an oval button, which is also a fingerprint scanner. </p><p>  In the back of the smartphone there are immediately 2 cameras and a flash.  The company logo is shown in the center, and various information below.  This is very similar to the iPhone 7, which is sometimes a plus, judging by the enthusiastic user reviews.  Huawei P10 Plus, however, unlike it, has a non-protruding camera, making it easier to hold the device in your hands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the side faces of the smartphone are various buttons.  On the right side is the on / off button and volume swing.  On the left is the SIM card tray.  At the bottom is a standard headphone jack. </p>

    <p>  All elements of the device are perfectly assembled.  However, there is one drawback of the Huawei P10 Plus phone, the reviews of the owners make it clear that this is not critical - this is the backlash of the volume swing.  He does not bother if you do not touch the key. </p><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The mass of good <span>reviews Huawei P10</span> Plus received due to its size.  The smartphone has a 5.5-inch display.  It looks great, and not everyone will be comfortable using it.  However, thanks to this, more information is displayed on the screen, and the icons and letters have an increased size.  On the smartphone market, you can often find devices with a screen size of 5.5 inches - this is a fairly common format, since in multitasking mode it is very convenient to use. </p><p>  Some of the previous smartphone models of this company did not have a frame around the display.  However, Huawei P10 Plus decided to abandon this decision, and therefore the device is made in a typical style for modern smartphones, which is why the user fell in love and received many rave reviews.  Smartphone Huawei P10 Plus can not boast of small size, but among its competitors it is the most compact and lightweight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Despite the 5.5-inch screen, the device is quite comfortable in the hand.  All buttons on the side of the smartphone are located in such a way that you can reach them without any problems. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The display of the smartphone quite qualitatively transfers the picture.  It is made using IPS-NEO technology.  The screen resolution is 2560 x 1440, with a pixel density of 540 ppi.  All information from the smartphone‚Äôs display can be seen without any problems under any conditions that impede this - sunlight, bright or inadequate lighting.  Also, the picture from the display is visible even when viewing it through sunglasses. </p>

    <p>  Brightness can be adjusted in a very wide range.  It is also worth noting that the display has wide viewing angles.  When viewing images, starting games or simply scrolling through the menu, you will notice that the picture is transmitted as colorful and high-quality as possible.  However, initially the shades of the display will be colder.  This parameter can be changed in the settings, then the display will be more colorful than on many other devices. </p><p>  Also, for users whose vision has noticeably deteriorated from the use of smartphones, the developers have introduced a vision protection function.  It can be switched on automatically or at the scheduled time.  It is better to use it in low light. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The internal filling of P10 and P10 Plus is the same.  It has an 8-core HiSilicon Kirin 960 processor with a clock frequency of 4x2.4 GHz and 4x1.8 GHz.  All this is paired with the Mali-G71 accelerator.  However, due to differences in the size of the displays, the Huawei P10 Plus works a little differently than its ‚Äúyounger brother‚Äù.  The difference is especially noticeable when starting resource-intensive games and programs.  When using a smartphone in utilities, this is not noticeable.  Especially in the reviews of the Huawei P10 Plus (128GB Ram 6GB). </p><p>  This difference does not mean that the P10 Plus "slows down."  It only means that the P10 is a little faster.  However, if one does not find fault with this, then the difference may not be felt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei p10 plus 128gb ram 6gb reviews" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19509/2023222.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Battery charge </h2><p>  The smartphone battery capacity is 3750 mAh.  Even by modern standards, this is a decent indicator.  Many smartphones currently have smaller batteries, so most users expect something more from the P10 Plus.  However, this will not happen, despite such a battery capacity, its charge lasts about 14 hours, and if you use it for about 6 hours over this period of time.  In continuous use mode, the smartphone will work no more than 8 hours. </p><p>  However, you can put up with this, since the device has the function of quickly charging the battery.  Despite the enormous capacity of his battery, it is fully restored in just an hour.  In this case, you should not install the smartphone for charging at night, as this reduces the battery life.  It‚Äôs best to charge your device before bedtime or in the morning. </p><p>  P10 Plus also has an energy saving mode.  It saves battery power by reducing the resolution of the display.  However, the difference is almost not visible.  And there is no particular benefit from this mode, since it saves no more than 15 percent of the charge, which is almost imperceptible.  Perhaps the developers did not want to degrade the smartphone in this mode and therefore introduced only minor changes in it, but, as it turned out, there was no benefit from this. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The development of cameras for this device, Huawei was engaged in conjunction with Leica.  Thanks to this, it was possible to achieve image quality comparable to the models of Apple and Samsung smartphones. </p>

    <p>  At the back of the smartphone are 2 camera modules.  The main one shoots in black and white.  Thanks to this module, all the elements in the photo and video are drawn and detailed.  The second module is responsible for color reproduction.  You can use only the main one, then the pictures will be black and white. </p><p>  Two cameras have different resolutions: the main - 20 megapixels, and the second - 12 megapixels.  Also thanks to the improved aperture, photos and videos turn out bright in low light. </p><p>  The front camera of the smartphone is only 8 megapixels, but this is enough for high-quality selfies.  Photos on the front camera are drawn. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The speaker of the smartphone is quite high quality.  The interlocutor is well audible, while the speaker is not so loud that people standing next to hear it. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the device has the ‚ÄúStereo‚Äù function.  It can be enabled in the smartphone settings.  Thanks to her, the sound during playing music, watching movies and other similar processes will be surround.  This is achieved through the inclusion of two speakers at once: the main and conversational.  However, this function only works when the smartphone is rotated to landscape orientation.  It is clear that the power of the two speakers is different, but it is automatically aligned, and this effect does occur. </p>

    <p>  The sound in the headphones is also very high quality.  However, it largely depends on the headphones themselves.  You should not expect good sound in the cheapest models.  If the headphones are powerful and high-quality, the sound will be appropriate. </p><h2>  Fingerprint scanner </h2><p>  The Huawei P10 Plus has a fingerprint scanner.  The company installed this element in its previous smartphones.  The scanner reads information very quickly.  This can be understood by reading reviews from the owners of smartphones Huawei P10 Plus.  It is also worth noting that the scanner is very difficult to fool; in 99.9 percent of cases, it correctly recognizes the fingerprint of its owner. </p><p>  It also has a feature - you can use the navigation buttons.  They can be activated in the device settings.  By default, the actions of the buttons are as follows: short press - "back", hold - go to the main screen, and swiping sideways with the finger - multitasking menu.  After getting used to using this feature, it becomes very convenient. </p>

    <h2>  Case included </h2><p>  Complete with a smartphone comes a cover book.  Although such accessories are almost never used by anyone, this is still a nice addition.  The quality of this cover is good.  It is made of rubberized plastic and lined with fabric on the outside.  The part adjacent to the screen is almost half made of translucent material.  This solution is very convenient, as you can see the time, notifications or switch the music composition if necessary. </p><p>  Although it is pleasant that the company has taken care of protecting its devices by supplying a cover-book in the kit, but at present such an accessory is unpopular.  Most often, owners of smartphones install a bumper cover that does not need to be constantly opened and closed, and a protective film or glass is most often used to protect the display. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Judging by customer reviews, Huawei P10 Plus, of course, turned out to be quite an interesting, excellent device.  It can perform various tasks.  The developers paid due attention to everything - the filling, the camera and, of course, the appearance.  Thanks to the design, the smartphone turned out to be very attractive.  However, only the fact that the device consumes a lot of energy is frustrating, but you have to ‚Äúpay‚Äù for everything, because all the chips of the smartphone consume a lot of resources.  On sale there are smartphones with two types of internal memory Huawei P10 Plus <span>128GB (according to customer reviews, more popular) and 64GB.</span> </p><p>  <span>This is all the information about the Huawei P10 Plus smartphone.</span>  <span>We hope the article was useful to you, and you have found all the information you are interested in.</span> </p>
