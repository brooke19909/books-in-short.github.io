There is no single answer to this kind of question, and it cannot be.

Now it‚Äôs clear how you can refine the relevant data.  This is a fairly simple task that has some simple solutions. </p><p>  Cellular operators cannot hide information about the movement of money on Simka - this is a violation of the rights of customers.

Then you have to look for the one on whom the SIM card is issued, or try to track the movement of funds yourself, without the help of Megafon employees. </p>
