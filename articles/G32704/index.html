In this article we will tell interesting facts about Bulgaria.  The resorts of this state were popular with our compatriots in Soviet times.  Today, many vacationers are planning to relax in the homeland of their father, Alexander the Great and the revolting gladiator Spartacus.  In addition to the warm and welcoming sea, you will find many ancient cities and unique cultural monuments, some of which are under the protection of UNESCO. </p><h2>  "Yes Yes" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.itaka.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Facts about Bulgaria" class="if uuid-3019296" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3019296.jpg"></div><p>  Perhaps the most famous interesting fact about Bulgaria is connected with the manner of communication in this country.  Going to this country, you should know that when denied, the locals nod their heads, and in agreement, they turn to the sides.  This is a very funny fact about Bulgaria, which often leads to confusion during the communication of travelers with local residents.  Of course, recently, at popular resorts, staff has been trying to adapt to the habits of visitors, using gestures that are correct in their understanding.  As a result, this is only more confusing. </p><p>  There are several versions of how such gestures appeared.  One of the most plausible claims that in the years when the country was under the influence of the Ottoman Empire, the Bulgarians intentionally swapped the gestures of denial and consent in order to deceive the Turks when they demanded that they accept Islam.  Since denial led to certain death from the sword, the Bulgarians decided on a trick, swapping gestures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  City Perperikon </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldfortravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Perperikon" class="if uuid-3019298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3019298.jpg"></div><p>  Another interesting fact about Bulgaria is that on its territory are the ruins of the ancient Thracian city of Perperikon.

Locals cook it before winter.  Make brandy immediately from several or only one type of fruit, adding anise, honey or nuts.  In winter, they drink it hot with caramel, adding orange zest or cinnamon.  For this, from the 19th century, they began to make special copper vessels with long handles, in which the drink was heated over an open fire. </p><p>  Here is an interesting fact about Bulgaria: it is believed that the level of prosperity of local residents is determined by the amount of brandy of different years of production, which is stored in their own cellars. </p><h2>  Rose oil </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.poppyavenueboutique.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rose oil" class="if uuid-3019295" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3019295.jpg"></div><p>  Almost all the rose oil that is consumed in the world comes from here.

It is customary to serve before the second or even with the second dish. </p><p>  The tarator is made from unsweetened yogurt or sour milk, adding dill, nuts, cucumbers, garlic and olive oil.  In some cases, green salad may be used instead of cucumbers.  It is believed that this is a very healthy, low-calorie and palatable food. </p><p>  Here is a classic recipe for this soup.
