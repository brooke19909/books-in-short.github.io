And, of course, Phuket enjoys special love.  Going on a trip, many tourists think in advance about where to go in Phuket.  Since Thailand is a place of exotics concentration, it is worth getting to know this wonderful country. </p><h2>  Island beaches </h2><p>  Having got to a hotel after a long journey, I want to relax, on the one hand, and on the other, I don‚Äôt want to lose precious minutes of sleep.  After all, Thailand is so beautiful that you need to have a lot to see.  Do not even think about where to go in Phuket.  The first place to visit is the beach.  Indeed, for the sake of the sandy coast and the warm sea, thousands of tourists fly here every year. </p><p>  The choice of beaches on the island is incredibly large, we will give only the best of them: Karon, Kata, Surin, Nai Harn, Kata Noi, Kamala, Rawai, Bang Tao, Panwa, Mai Khao, Yanui, Kalim, Nai Ton, Nai Yang, Freedom Pansy.  Each of them has its own characteristics and charms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to go in phuket" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2142488.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For swimming, the western coast and the southern part of the island are most convenient.  But more quiet places can be found in the northwest of Phuket and in the south.  The most noisy and fun are the famous Kata, Karon and Patong.  There are discos, <span>bars, restaurants,</span> shops and hotels.  The largest number of people here appears during the high season.  If this is your first visit to the island, then you should explore as many beaches as possible.  This is possible if you will be actively moving.  Indeed, to form an opinion about the coast, it is worth a look.  Then next time you will have no doubt where to go in Phuket.  Tourists visiting the island is not the first time already consciously returning to their favorite places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Party beaches </h2><p>  When wondering where to go in Phuket, focus on the purpose of your trip.  If you are looking for active parties and entertainment, then the direct road to Patong Beach.  It is he who leads the list of party places along the coast.  Here for guests there are diving centers, night clubs, massage parlors, night clubs for adults, transvestite shows and more.  The question of where to go to Patong (Phuket) is simply inappropriate.  Here in the district there are so many entertainments that one vacation is clearly not enough to try them out.  The main party place is the incredibly famous Bangla Road.  It is here that the main nightlife venues are concentrated. </p><p>  Young people love to relax on the equally famous Karon Beach.  Its northern part with developed infrastructure is especially interesting. </p><p>  Another great place on the coast is Surini Beach.  Of course, it can not be compared with Patong, but still it is also very fun here. </p><h2>  Beaches for families with children </h2><p>  Party places are not very good for families with children.  For parents, it is important, first of all, cleanliness and convenient entry into the sea.  There are several beaches in Phuket that are most convenient for babies.  One of them is Kata.  Despite the fact that there are no bars and nightclubs, the coast is perfect for families.  The coast has a smooth approach without vegetation and stones, the ebbs and flows are extremely rare.  And shallow water is a great place for kids. </p>

    <p>  Another place to recommend for children is Nye Harn.  It is here that Thais themselves prefer to relax.  There are practically no loud establishments here, and in the evenings it is very quiet and calm.  In the southern part there is a warm underwater current, in this place, as a rule, many children always swarm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Bang Tao, whose length is about seven kilometers, is also noteworthy.  Sufficiently long shallow water is formed here at low tide.  The beach is calm and peaceful. </p><p>  An incredibly long and gently sloping entry into the sea is Nai Yang.  During periods of serious ebb, the sandbank becomes so extensive that it is difficult to reach the depth.  For families with children, you can also recommend May Kak, and not because it has a gently sloping coast, but because there is no question where to go with a child in Phuket.  Indeed, on the beach itself there is a water park called ‚ÄúSplash Jungle‚Äù.  By the way, this is the only water park on the whole island. </p><h2>  Family holiday </h2><p>  Where can I go with children in Phuket?  The choice of objects for entertainment is quite large.  No wonder the island is one of the best world resorts for couples with children.  There are so many entertainments that they are not enough for one vacation. </p><p>  All kinds of amusement parks are very popular in Phuket.  Fanta Cea is in special demand.  There are playgrounds and attractions for the guests of the park, as well as animators who conduct recreational activities for children.  On the territory of ‚ÄúFanta Cea‚Äù there is a beautiful pond with carps and catfish, the kingdom of tigers and other interesting places.  Visitors can ride elephants and enjoy meals at local cafes. </p>

    <p>  Another wonderful place in Phuket (Thailand), where you should definitely go, is a dinopark.  On its territory you can see many incredibly realistic stuffed dinosaurs and other ancient creatures.  Photos taken in the park will surprise all your friends.  Children are incredibly pleased with such a walk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Schoolchildren should go to the butterfly park.  Very interesting excursions are held on its territory.  In the park you can see such butterflies that live only in the untouched forests of the tropics.  During a fascinating tour guides will tell you a lot about insects and their benefits. </p><h2>  Where to go on Karon (Phuket) </h2><p>  On Karon, as in any resort, there are many water activities - skiing, banana, parasailing and more.  The beach is very good for snorkeling and diving.  Surfers like to relax here, because from time to time the sea makes them happy with big waves.  Of the local attractions worth seeing the temple "Here Karon."  Despite the fact that the building is a little over a hundred years old, it is incredibly beautiful.  Ceremonies are still being held there.  In the southern part of the beach is Dinopark, which we mentioned earlier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phuket kata where to go" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2142543.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In the Karon area there are many massage and spa salons that are also worth a visit. </p><h2>  Attractions Kata Beach </h2><p>  Where to go to Kata (Phuket)?  You should definitely go to the Karon observation deck, which was previously called Kata.  It offers stunning views of the entire coast.  All tourists try to get here. </p><p>  No less interesting is Surf House.  This place wants to visit any surfer, because here you can ride the waves in any weather.  The pool of the establishment is something amazing.  Waves are created using generators, so they are always there.  Even inexperienced surfers can ride them. </p><p>  In the east of Kata Beach is the Kata Temple.  It was built at the very foot of a mountain covered with tropical greenery.  The temple was erected in 1832.  But despite a decent age, the building is maintained in excellent condition and appears before the tourists in bright colors among the lush greenery. </p><h2>  Phuket Attractions </h2><p>  The island is famous not only for beaches, so when you go on vacation, you should think ahead of time on the route, where to go and <span>what to see in Phuket.</span>  In the list of ‚Äúmust si‚Äù of any tourist in the first place is a statue of the Big Buddha, which is located in the Chalong area.  The figure of the Buddha is so impressive that it is visible from almost anywhere in the island.  Its height reaches 45 meters.  Buddha guards the entrance to the temple and the observation deck, where all tourists crowd, wanting to take stunning photos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="thailand phuket where to go" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2142563.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The Shell Museum is a place that will appeal not only to kids, but also to adults.  Its exposition has more than two thousand shells that have been collected for forty years.  Here are very rare exhibits.  The collection of shells is displayed so that visitors can visually see the differences between different objects.  Here you can see the world's largest gold pearl of 140 carats. </p><h2>  Phuket Aquarium </h2><p>  If you are considering ideas where to go in Phuket, then it is worth remembering such an interesting place as an aquarium.  It will appeal to those who want to see the underwater world, but do not want to dive under the water.  In the aquariums of the institution there are several hundred fish, as well as other underwater inhabitants.  The aquarium is divided into different parts, each of which has its own theme.  So, in the ‚Äúcoral reefs‚Äù you can see living creatures that have become the prototypes of the cartoon characters about the Nemo fish.  On weekends, visitors can witness the feeding of predatory sharks.  The highlight of the aquarium is a long tunnel, walking along which you feel like on the seabed. </p><h2>  Pearl farm </h2><p>  Women and girls love to go to the pearl farm.  A trip to the Nakha farm allows you to learn a lot about jewelry cultivation technologies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to go in phuket in the evening" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2142566.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Guides show guests the basic stages of pearl formation.  And farm jewelers demonstrate the main stages of processing and manufacturing of jewelry.  At the end of the tour, tourists are given the opportunity to purchase pearl jewelry at a local store. </p><h2>  Snake farm </h2><p>  Tourists seek to Phuket for exotic.  Oddly enough, but trips to the snake farm are very popular among vacationers.  On it, guests can watch shows featuring pythons and cobras.  At the end of the show, tourists are offered to visit a local store with snake-skin products, which are very popular among guests. </p><h2>  Sirinat Park </h2><p>  If you are looking for where to go to Phuket on your own, then as one of the options you can consider a trip to the Sirinat park.  Not only tourists, but also local residents like to relax on its territory.  The park has three well-maintained beaches, as well as tropical forests not touched by human hands.  The coast of Sirinat is washed by the clear waters of the sea. </p><p>  In the park is the famous water park "Splash of the Jungle."  On the territory of the complex, tourists can try a variety of water attractions.  Visitors also organize trips to mangroves.  Tourist routes pass through the most beautiful places.  If you like these places, then you can stop in the park in a bungalow for a few days. </p><h2>  Where to go for a walk in the evening? </h2><p>  Many tourists travel to Thailand for nightlife.  Where to go in the evening in Phuket?  The island in this regard is a kind of entertainment center.  Each beach has its own beer bars, nightclubs and other establishments.  The leader in nightlife is Patong.  It is this beach that the majority of tourists who come to Phuket choose.  Patong is definitely the best place for active entertainment. </p><p>  The main street on which the center of nightlife is located is Bangla Road.  In the daytime, the street looks exactly like the other streets of the city.  But with the onset of the evening, it changes dramatically, turning into one large night club.  Having arrived for the first time on Bangla Road, any tourist is immersed in an atmosphere of incendiary fun.  True, there are a lot of transgender people in local bars and discos.  For Thailand, this is quite a common thing. </p>
