  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Boris Nikolaevich Yeltsin: biography, family, political activity, photos and interesting facts from life</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The significance of the personality of Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin in Russian history is very great.  You can relate to it differently, but you can‚Äôt ignore it in any way.  President Yeltsin is evaluated differently.  Someone says that he led Russia out of the worst crisis and did not allow the country to fall completely in the world ranking.  Some criticize Yeltsin‚Äôs policies and accuse him of impoverishing the population, drastically reducing the standard of living and other hardships that fell on Russians in the difficult period of the early nineties. </p><p>  So, what did the board of the <span>first president of the Russian</span> Federation remember?  What were the main stages of Yeltsin‚Äôs biography?  How did his elevation happen?  What is known about the Yeltsin family?  What legacy did he leave behind?  <span>When did Yeltsin die?</span>  Answers to these and many other questions will become available to the reader after reading an article devoted to this bright personality. </p><h2>  Place of birth of Yeltsin </h2><p>  The biography of Yeltsin begins in the village of Butka, which is located in the southern part of the Sverdlovsk region and is part of the Talitsky district.  However, Boris Nikolaevich with full confidence cannot be called the indigenous Butkovoi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="freenews-es.tk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Homeland of Yeltsin B.N." class="if uuid-2457724" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69761/2457724.jpg"></div><p>  The fact is that the family of the future leader of the Russian Federation lived in the neighboring village of Basmanovo.  Basmanovo was inferior in population to Butka.  Consequently, the medical center where the birth took place was located in Butka.  Thus, the biography of Yeltsin began here on February 1, 1931. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, the birthplace of Boris Yeltsin is the subject of heated debate between residents of two neighboring villages.  Each of them seeks to attribute this distinctive feature to himself. </p><p>  Boris Nikolaevich's parents did not stand out from the Soviet people of that period, that is, they honestly engaged in simple work.  Russians by nationality, Yeltsins worked in production. </p><h2>  Hero father </h2><p>  Nikolai Ignatievich Yeltsin, the father of the hero of this article, was an ordinary builder and worked at the loss of his face for the benefit of his family.  However, it often happens that children have to pay for the "sins" of their ancestors. </p><p>  Parents of Nikolai Ignatievich were prosperous peasants and had in their households several farm laborers - poor peasants who worked for food and a monetary reward.  While cultivating a solid plot of land, the Yeltsins managed to accumulate money and become enemies of the proletariat by the troubled times of the Civil War.  That is why Nikolai Ignatievich suffered from the repressive totalitarian Soviet machine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kknews.cc" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yeltsin B.N. with parents and brother" class="if uuid-2459511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69761/2459511.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth paying tribute to the father of Boris Yeltsin - he did not break.  Having served his sentence in the Volga-Don and being amnestied for exemplary behavior, Nikolai Yeltsin returned to his homeland and was able to start his career from scratch.  Thanks to his natural zeal and determination, he was able to build a good career - he became the head of an enterprise specializing in the construction of residential and household facilities.  This career growth can be called phenomenal, given the repressive past of a person who lived at a time when children were judged by their parents. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is known that a significant part of the character the child borrows from his parents.  This happened in this case.  It was this innate impenetrability and inflexibility that was passed from father to son and was repeatedly demonstrated in the future by Boris Nikolayevich. </p><h2>  Mother of Boris Nikolaevich </h2><p>  Claudia Vasilievna Yeltsin (maiden name - Starygin) can be called an ordinary Soviet toiler.  Most of her life, Claudia Vasilievna was engaged in cutting and sewing, working as a dressmaker. </p><h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><p>  The next stage of Yeltsin‚Äôs biography includes the school years of the future leader.  At a very young age (not even five years old) Boris Yeltsin had to survive the move to the city of Bereznyaki, which is located in the Perm region. </p><p>  In school years, the hero of the article was already distinguished by a strong character and pronounced leadership qualities, which he only developed over time.  Confirmation of these words is the fact that Boris Yeltsin was appointed <span>head of the class</span> and did a good job of this responsible work. </p><p>  From the preserved document on the education of Yeltsin - a matriculation certificate - it can be seen that he studied well and was far from a stupid student.  With firm certainty, he could be attributed to drummers.  In many subjects, the future leader had excellent marks.  He was particularly successful in teaching in such subjects as algebra, geometry, trigonometry, natural sciences, geography, the constitution of the USSR, astronomy, and a foreign language (German).  In other subjects, Yeltsin had a solid "good."  However, Boris Nikolaevich was often let down by discipline. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.oldpicz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yeltsin B.N. in young age" class="if uuid-2457741" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69761/2457741.jpg"></div><p>  This man could not be called an exemplary boy and an impeccable student.  More than once or twice, the future head of state was seen in fights in which he easily prevailed thanks to his impressive physical data and wrestling character.  Peers respected Boris Nikolaevich, and some were frankly afraid. </p><p>  It was during school years that Boris Nikolaevich lost two fingers (and partially the phalanx of the third), which he wrote about in his memoirs.  Playing as a schoolboy in nature, he discovered an unexploded fascist grenade that turned out to be equipped.  Instead of leaving her and running away, Boris Nikolaevich tried to take her apart and render her harmless.  The consequence of this attempt was a severe mutilation of the left hand, which remained with Yeltsin for life. </p><h2>  Higher education </h2><p>  It is precisely because of this circumstance (the absence of several fingers on the hand) that Boris Yeltsin was not taken to serve in the Soviet army.  The young man had to immediately go to college.  Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin received his higher education at the Ural Polytechnic Institute.  Given the propensities for exact sciences demonstrated by Yeltsin when mastering the school curriculum, he decided to enter the prestigious profession of a civil engineer at that time.  In addition, this profession was already traditional in the family of the future head of state.  Yeltsin‚Äôs father also connected his life with the construction site. </p><p>  An interesting part of Yeltsin‚Äôs biography is his sporting achievements.  Biting into the "granite of science", Boris Nikolaevich found time in his life for playing sports.  Due to his high growth and athletic build, Boris Nikolaevich chose volleyball.  It should be noted that the usual enthusiasm for this game sport over the years of study at the institute gradually grew into something more.  Thus, without three fingers on his left hand, Yeltsin was able to fulfill the standard of the master of sports of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and get the coveted badge.  Over time, Boris Nikolayevich was entrusted with coaching the women's volleyball team of the institute. </p><p>  The looks of a handsome and handsome young man were directed by the views of many students.  With one of them, Anastasia (Naina) Girina, the future president forever united his life, forming a strong and lasting family.  At first, young people simply kept sympathy for each other in their hearts, trying not to pay attention to them.  But after some time, Boris Nikolaevich realized that it was more than just sympathies - true and strong love, there was no getting away from it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rarehistoricalphotos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yeltsin B.N. student years" class="if uuid-2457743" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69761/2457743.jpg"></div><h2>  Labor activity </h2><p>  After graduating from the Ural Polytechnic Institute, Boris Nikolaevich began his career in the chosen path - construction.  The hero of the article got a job in the Sverdlovsk Building Trust, firmly linking his future fate and career with him. </p><p>  A young and promising specialist builder immediately attracted attention and began to confidently climb the career ladder.  This circumstance was also facilitated by the fact that since 1961, Boris Nikolaevich was a full member of the Communist <span>Party of the Soviet Union.</span>  At that time, this circumstance played a very important (and possibly decisive) role.  Entering the CPSU, a person received a "ticket to life."  Without membership of the Communist Party, counting on a successful career was reckless. </p><p>  Boris Nikolaevich (thanks to the above qualities and conditions) quickly climbed the career ladder.  From a simple engineer, Yeltsin grew up in the main.  A few years later, a promising boss became the head of the Sverdlovsk House-Building Plant. </p><p>  Looking ahead, it should be noted that most of Yeltsin‚Äôs life was connected with construction.  This area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity marked the main milestones of both the labor and political careers of the future president. </p><h2>  The beginning of a political career </h2><p>  With the entry into the CPSU, Boris Nikolayevich‚Äôs political career begins.  An active life position and ability to achieve goals in spite of everything contributed to Yeltsin‚Äôs political career. </p><div class="photo" data-original="read01.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Work in the party 1975. Yekaterinburg" class="if uuid-2459501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69761/2459501.jpg"></div><p>  The first step on the ladder of party work, which led Boris Nikolaevich to leadership of the state, was the election to the Kirov District Committee of the CPSU.  This fact allowed Yeltsin to be delegated to the conference of the Communist Party of the Sverdlovsk Region. </p><h2>  Elevation </h2><p>  In 1968, the production career of Boris Nikolaevich ended.  Party functionaries noticed a talented leader, and the Sverdlovsk Regional Committee of the CPSU became the new place of work for Yeltsin.  The sphere entrusted to Yeltsin was completely combined with his life and work experience - construction. </p><p>  Seven years later, Boris Nikolaevich received a new position - Secretary of the Sverdlovsk Regional Committee of the CPSU.  With the increase, the zone of responsibility of the hero of the article has expanded significantly.  Now Yeltsin was responsible for the development of industry in the Sverdlovsk region - one of the most promising regions of the country. </p><p>  In 1976, Boris Nikolayevich actually became the first person of the Sverdlovsk Region - the First Secretary of the Sverdlovsk Regional Committee of the CPSU.  A young (for a person who held such a high position) forty-five-year-old leader actively took up the development of the region.  Over the years of Yeltsin‚Äôs rule, significant changes have taken place in the region: the region‚Äôs food supply has improved, agricultural and industrial facilities have been built, and strategically important roads have been laid.  One of the most striking and memorable buildings built in Yekaterinburg under the leadership of the Boris Nikolaevich region is the new building of the CPSU regional committee, which at that time became the highest in the city.  The height of the building has twenty-four floors, which gives the building an impressive and majestic look. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rarehistoricalphotos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The collapse of the USSR" class="if uuid-2457747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69761/2457747.jpg"></div><h2>  Popularly elected president </h2><p>  Yeltsin's further career developed rapidly and swiftly.  Since 1978, he was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and since 1984 he was a member of its Presidium. </p><p>  Since 1985 (on the recommendation of the party elite) Yeltsin was transferred to serve in the capital of the Soviet Union - Moscow.  The field of activity was traditional for him - coordination of construction of residential and industrial facilities. </p><p>  After some time, Yeltsin - First Secretary of the CPSU MGK (in modern terms - the head of the city of Moscow).  During this period of time, he finds himself in a whirlwind of political manipulation and displacement, the result of which is a sharp break in relations with the CPSU and the rapid growth of the leader's popularity.  From a party functionary, Yeltsin turned into an alternative head of state.  The struggle for power, the details of which do not seem appropriate, makes Boris Yeltsin the President of the RSFSR on June 12, 1991.  The dualism of power that arose for a short time quickly came to naught and ended with Yeltsin becoming the sole leader of the state. </p><p>  Power to him did not pass by inheritance (as in the period of autocracy).  He was not appointed leader of the country at the top of the party nomenclature.  Yeltsin forever went down in Russian history as a president elected by the people. </p><h2>  For a second term </h2><p>  The collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent radical reforms did not help strengthen Yeltsin‚Äôs rating as president.  The situation was aggravated by the war in the Chechen Republic, which many call the result of Yeltsin‚Äôs ill-conceived policy of providing regions with independence from the center. </p><p>  But in 1996, Yeltsin still gained the majority of votes as a result of the elections and was elected for a second term.  However, the situation in the country continued to deteriorate.  The external debt of the state grew, calls for the resignation of Yeltsin were increasingly heard.  The health of the leader of the state was rapidly deteriorating. </p><h2>  Leaving the Kremlin </h2><p>  The result of all these circumstances was Yeltsin‚Äôs decision to resign as president of the Russian Federation.  The announcement of this decision was announced during the New Year‚Äôs address on December 31, 1999.  The outgoing president named Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin as his successor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.history.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The election of Yeltsin B.N. President of the RSFSR" class="if uuid-2457749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/69761/2457749.jpg"></div><p>  April 23, 2007 Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin died.  When this happened, the decree of the President of the Russian Federation declared national mourning.  Russia said goodbye to the first president. </p><p>  Over the years of Yeltsin‚Äôs rule, Russia has experienced one of the most severe shocks in its recent history.  The political structure has changed, big changes have occurred in the country's economy.  Obviously, an adequate assessment of the activities of the first president can be given only after some time.  Only one thing is obvious - Yeltsin was at the helm in an extremely difficult time for the country and was doing what he considered right. </p><h2>  About the Yeltsin family </h2><p>  Boris and Naina Yeltsin have two daughters - <span>Elena Okulova</span> and <span>Tatyana Yumasheva.</span>  The latter is the head of the Fund of the First President of the Russian Federation B.N. Yeltsin. </p><h2>  Yeltsin's legacy </h2><p>  In order to preserve the historical heritage of the activities of the first president of the Russian Federation, the Yeltsin Presidential Center was created - a non-profit organization uniting many influential people of modern Russia.  The organization's tasks include supporting projects in the field of education, culture and charity. </p><p>  The name of the first president named many organizations, streets in settlements.  In a number of places monuments were erected to him.  It is quite obvious that Yeltsin is the brightest figure in the life of the country during the collapse of the USSR and the formation of a new state. </p>
