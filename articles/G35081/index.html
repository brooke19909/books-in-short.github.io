The people of Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The population of not every country in the world has as many reasons for pride in their homeland as the people of Russia.  The Russian Federation is the largest state in terms of area on the globe, among our fellow citizens there are many outstanding commanders, writers, inventors.  The history of the Fatherland is replete with significant dates.  So, let's figure out what Russia is proud of. </p><h2>  How did Russia begin? </h2><p>  First of all, we will answer the question of who laid the foundation for Russia?  According to legend, the founders of Russia were three brothers - Rurik, Sineus and Truvor.  It was they who laid the foundations of our sovereignty in Novgorod.  The guardian of the son of Rurik Igor - Prince Oleg - was able to add Kiev and some other principalities to the possessions.  So Kievan Rus appeared.  Of course, such founding fathers of our statehood should be proud of. </p><p>  The very name "Russia" was officially assigned to our Motherland by Peter I, having founded an empire with a capital in St. Petersburg.  From this time began one of the most remarkable periods in the history of the Fatherland.  So Great Russia arose - one of the strongest states of that time.  The origin of his glory and power, we owe it to Peter I. </p>

    <h2>  Flag of the Russian Federation </h2><p>  Of course, speaking of what Russia is proud of, one cannot but mention its flag.  It is the banner of the state that should support the patriotic feelings of citizens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, what does the <span>flag of Russia</span> mean when and how did it arise?  The modern flag of our Motherland - the white-blue-red tricolor - began to be used from the end of the 17th century, first as a ship banner, and then as the banner of the Tsar of Moscow.  And again, its use is connected with the name of the same Peter I. Then the tricolor was used as the flag of the Russian Empire.  After the Bolsheviks came to power, he was replaced by a bright red banner.  But in 1991, due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the formation of the Russian Federation, the tricolor again became the state flag.  With minor changes adopted in 1993, it is still in use today. </p>

    <p>  Now back to the question of what the flag of Russia means.  According to the heraldic tradition, it is believed that white symbolizes nobility and freedom, blue symbolizes fidelity, in addition, it is the color of the Virgin, red symbolizes courage and sovereignty. </p><p>  Of course, such a flag is worthy of being what the citizens of Russia are proud of. </p><h2>  Coat of arms of Russia </h2><p>  Another symbol of statehood is the <span>emblem of the Russian Federation.</span>  The people of Russia are no less proud of them than the flag.  It is an image of a double-headed eagle, on the chest of which on the shield is placed <span>George the Victorious,</span> striking a snake. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In a somewhat modified form, this emblem was used as the heraldry of the Byzantine dynasty of Paleologists.  Then, in the XV century, after the capture of Constantinople by the Turks, it began to be used by the Russian prince Ivan III as a personal coat of arms and a symbol of royal power.  He considered himself, thanks to the marriage of <span>Sophia Paleolog, the</span> heir to this illustrious dynasty, and Russia, respectively, the heiress of Byzantium and the Roman Empire. </p><p>  For many centuries, the double-headed eagle remained an invariable symbol of the kingdom of the Russian and Russian Empire, until after the victory of the October Revolution it was replaced by the emblem of the Soviet Union in the form of a circle with a globe and a sickle and hammer in the center, bordered by ears of wheat.  But after the formation of the Russian Federation, in 1991, the former paraphernalia again became a symbol of the state.  And now the double-headed eagle is what Russia is proud of. </p><h2>  National anthem </h2><p>  The anthem of Russia has a much shorter history than the period of the coat of arms and flag.  Nevertheless, with the first chords of his melody, pride overflows the hearts of all patriotic Russians. </p><p>  The melody was written back in 1939 by the composer Alexander Alexandrov.  True, for many years it was used for the anthem of the Soviet Union.  After the collapse of the USSR in 1990, Glinka's ‚ÄúPatriotic melody‚Äù, written by him in 1833, began to be used as the Russian anthem.  But the words for this song were never matched.  So Russia remained a country with a hymn without words, until in 2000, in its capacity, the government returned the tune of Alexandrov.  The words for the new anthem were written by Sergei Mikhalkov, who, incidentally, had previously been the author of the main song of the Soviet Union. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Since that time, every Russian is proud to hear: "Russia is our sacred power ...". </p><h2>  Moscow is the capital of Russia </h2><p>  What Russia is proud of, if not its capital!  Indeed, there is something to experience this feeling for.  Moscow is one of the largest and most beautiful cities in the world.  At the moment, the population of the Moscow agglomeration exceeds 16 million people, and the population of the city itself is more than 12 million.  In addition, Moscow is a major global business center.  This city has developed industrial production. </p>

    <p>  Moscow has one of the largest metro lines in the world.  The city has a huge number of architectural and historical monuments.  The Kremlin, Red Square, Pokrovsky Cathedral, <span>Lenin's Mausoleum,</span> Novodevichy Convent are just a small list of the most famous of them. </p><p>  Moscow has a rather long and interesting history.  It was founded by Prince Vladimir, and then Kiev - <span>Yuri Dolgoruky</span> - at the site of the village of the disgraced boyar Kuchki.  The first evidence of it dates back to 1147.  From the second half of the 13th century, Moscow was the center of the specific principality, and from 1325, it was actually the capital of Russia.  True, under Peter I, this status was lost for 200 years, since St. Petersburg became the capital.  But in 1918, Moscow again received the honor of being called the main city of the country.  The capital of our country, this city is to this day. </p><h2>  Kremlin </h2><p>  One of the most significant symbols with which Russia is associated around the globe is the Moscow Kremlin.  And this, of course, is a reason for pride of the inhabitants of our country. </p><p>  The Kremlin is a fortification, and, in fact, it existed as long as the city itself exists.  But it constantly changed: at first it was wooden, and from the time of Dmitry Donskoy it became stone. </p>

    <p>  One of the most famous buildings of the Moscow Kremlin is the Spasskaya Tower, it was built in 1491 under Prince Ivan III.  The chiming clock on it is an appeal to the unity of all Russians. </p><h2>  Military forces </h2><p>  Of course, Russian citizens can be proud of their army.  Over a long history, she won a huge number of significant victories in numerous wars, the vast majority of which were defensive or liberating, but never took the form of aggression.  But, of course, the most significant triumph of our weapons is the great Victory over fascism.  May 9 is a holy day for every Russian.  Other dates of Russia, no matter how glorious they may be, cannot be compared with this day. </p><p>  And at present, the Russian army maintains the highest degree of combat effectiveness.  In terms of strength, it is second only to the Chinese army.  In terms of aggregate combat power, only the US Army is ahead of our troops.  Although some experts argue that the real combat capability of the Russian armed forces is higher than that of American soldiers. </p><p>  The Russian army will continue to be a guarantor of the inviolability of the borders of our Motherland, as well as fully participate in peacekeeping activities around the globe. </p><h2>  Territory of Russia </h2><p>  The Russian Federation is the largest state on the globe.  Its total area exceeds 17 million square kilometers.  This by itself is an occasion for pride.  Not a single country in the world has been able to unite in itself on a voluntary basis so different in physical and geographical location, national and religious composition of the population of the territory. </p>

    <p>  Famous scientists who gave the world a huge number of valuable inventions, laws and theorems, are also among the Russians in sufficient quantities.  These are Mikhail Lomonosov, Dmitry Mendeleev, the Cherepanov brothers, Alexander Lodygin, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Sergey <span>Korolev, Andrey</span> Sakharov and many others. </p><p>  Russians are widely represented among the discoverers.  Moreover, they explored not only land and sea, but also space.  These are Ermak Timofeevich, Semyon Dezhnev, <span>Erofei Khabarov,</span> Mikhail Lazarev, Thaddeus Bellingshausen, Ivan Kruzenshtern, Nikolai Miklukho-Maklay, Yuri Gagarin.  But many great Russian travelers and discoverers simply did not fit on this list. </p><p>  Famous Russian cultural and art figures are known all over the world.  These are Alexander Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov, Leo Tolstoy, Fedor Dostoevsky, Nikolai Gogol, Kazimir Malevich, Fedor Chaliapin and many others.  Their great creations are what the citizens of Russia are proud of. </p><p>  The most famous Russians were listed above.  But any worthy citizen of our Motherland is an occasion for her pride. </p><h2>  Russia is a great country </h2><p>  The Russians have a huge number of reasons to be proud of their country, and Russia - their citizens.  The greatness of our Fatherland is inherent in every person who inhabits its expanses, in every work of art or architectural creation created by the hands of people.  Awareness of this fact is the path to harmony.  If the majority of our compatriots follow it, this will ensure peace and prosperity of the Motherland for many years to come.  Every worthy citizen should proclaim to the whole world: ‚ÄúI am proud that I live in Russia!‚Äù </p>
