    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  In this part of the island, the climate is tropical.  The average annual air temperature is around +29 ¬∞ C, so the water off the coast of Montego Bay is very comfortable throughout the year.  But from May to September, it rains heavily, and, of course, the number of tourists decreases sharply, but interest in this place is still preserved.  The peak season falls on December-February. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Montego Bay in Jamaica is a calm and quiet place.  His calling card is the picturesque sandy beaches of Walter Fletcher and Doctors Cave, each of which can be reached on foot from the city center. </p><p>  Doctors Cave Beach is owned by a private club and is known far beyond the borders of the country.  It is distinguished by bright turquoise water, a strip of white sand, up to two hundred meters wide, modern equipment of locker rooms and showers, numerous bars and restaurants located along the coast, in which guests are treated to dishes of national cuisine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The beach has excellent conditions for diving, water sports, you can visit the pools with mineral water. </p>

    <p>  On the beach "Walter Fletcher" covered with white sand, families with children like to relax.  The water here is calm, and the entrance to it is smooth.  Here is the Marine Park, where you can find entertainment for every taste: ride on unusual boats with a transparent glass bottom, jet skis, play tennis or beach volleyball, jump on trampolines.  And, of course, just sunbathe in a sun lounger under the gentle sun. </p><h2>  Sightseeing: Old Town </h2><p>  When purchasing tours to Jamaica, most tourists do not want their stay in the country to be reduced exclusively to beach vacations.  That is why they are sent to this city.  Montego Bay is the second largest city in the country and a popular holiday destination for wealthy and famous people from around the world.  Here are the buildings of the colonial past - cathedrals and churches, mansions and museums, old prisons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tours to jamaica" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/1850094.jpg" width="600"></div>

One of the city‚Äôs most famous houses is the Rose Hall, built at the end of the 18th century by a British slave owner. </p><p>  No less interesting is the Greenwood mansion, which at one time belonged to a large landowner.  Here visitors can get acquainted with a unique collection of rare books, see exquisite antique furniture, musical instruments and Chinese porcelain.  One of the most famous buildings of the Old Town is the St. James Church (1778), the Blue Hall Museum, the Cage Prison (1806). </p><p>  Today in the center of Montego Bay managed to save only a few unique buildings of the past, the remaining parts are absorbed in tourism infrastructure and civilization. </p><h2>  Donald Sangster Airport </h2><p>  It is located three kilometers east of the city, on the northwest coast of the island, in the center of the country's main tourism areas.  Nearby, many resort and hotel complexes have been built.  The airport is a short drive from the famous cruise ports of Ocho Rios and Montego Bay, which provides a constant flow of tourists. </p><p>  It was built in 1947 and originally bore the same name with the city.  But it was later renamed in honor of the Prime Minister of Jamaica - Donald Sangster. </p>

    <p>  One two-level terminal operates on domestic flights.  Two international terminals pass about four million passengers annually. </p><p>  The airport provides such standard services as duty free shops, car parking, ATMs, as well as a cafe and restaurant. </p><h2>  Sam Sharp Square </h2><p>  The square, which will be discussed later, is the center of urban activity in Montego Bay in Jamaica.  It is located in the area where Cage (the ‚ÄúCage‚Äù) is located - a former prison for runaway slaves, and later for all blacks who met the police on the streets of the city on Sunday after three in the morning. </p><p>  The ruins of the building of the Court, which was built in 1804, but suffered from a fire almost twenty years ago, are also preserved here.  The Heritage Trail is a popular tourist route that includes a visit to the square and allows you to learn more about the vibrant and rich history of Jamaica and its inhabitants. </p>

    <p>  The area has changed several names in its history, but in October 1983 it acquired the existing one.  At this time, a sculptural composition was established here with Samuel Sharp, who addresses the citizens in honor of the 21st anniversary of Jamaican independence. </p><p>  Sam Sharp is a hero of the country, a Baptist deacon, who became the leader of the uprising, which began in the winter of 1831 and quickly swept the entire parish.  The freedom fighter paid too high a price for her - his own life.  The British hanged him on the square in 1832. </p><h2>  St james church </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of Montego Bay in Jamaica is this church.  It was built in the style of late Georgianism and became one of the most beautiful on the island.  Resting in Montego Bay in Jamaica, do not miss the opportunity to explore this magnificent building. </p><p>  The church delights tourists with its interesting shape of the Greek cross.  This is the only Christian temple in the world that has a similar shape.  Unfortunately, the earthquake that occurred here in 1957 caused great damage to the construction.  Restoration work on the restoration of the architectural monument continues today. </p><p>  The interior of this church is impressive: high wooden doors, an exquisite candelabra and incredibly beautiful stained glass windows decorating the altar give the interior of this building the charm of antiquity and add some kind of awe to the atmosphere of the temple. </p><p>  Rose Hall is another very popular tourist destination in Montego Beach.  But it attracts travelers not only with its external design and internal splendor, but also with an ancient legend. </p><p>  Once upon a time in this house lived John Rose Palmer.  This mansion, built in 1770, was inherited from his uncle.  After some time, John married the insidious Englishwoman Annie, who secretly engaged in black magic and witchcraft from her husband.  On her account were the lives of three husbands, including John Rose. </p><p>  The legend has not lost its relevance today: they say that the ghost of the mistress still lives in the house.  Today you can get here as part of an excursion group, not only during the day, but also at night.  The guide in details will tell you exciting details from the history of the ancient castle. </p>
