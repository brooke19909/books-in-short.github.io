They are located near the Tien Shan mountain system, uniting several Asian countries at once.  The lakes themselves cover only the territory of one state - Kazakhstan.  The Kulsai system (these reservoirs are also called) is located 10 km from the border with Kyrgyzstan.  The environment has very impressive views, as there is a coniferous forest and beautiful mountains.  The greatest depth reaches a mark of up to 50 m. The fauna is represented mainly by trout (mikey). </p><p>  Kolsaysky lakes were formed due to the natural deepening in the ridges, where the water stream currently flows.  Those who come to admire the area can set up a small camp or settle in special village houses.  It is possible to rent a room in a hotel located in the national park.  Cottages and yurts were built near one of the ponds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kolsai lakes" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1122970.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lakes </h2><p>  At the moment, Kolsai Lakes (reviews of which are mostly positive) are divided into three full-fledged reservoirs: </p><ul><li>  Upper Kolsay is located at an altitude of 2850 m. </li><li>  The second lake has two names - Mynzhylgy and Kolsayskoye.  Due to its size, it has become the largest in the system. </li><li>  The third body of water has small dimensions (width - 400 m, length - 1 km, and depth - 80 m), so it did not receive a name. </li></ul><p>  The object of tourism Kolsai lakes have recently;  quite next to them is another pond - Kaindy.  Due to the influx of tourists, guest houses and various leisure facilities began to be built near the system.  For lovers of hiking, companies offer special routes of 25 km.  The total duration of such excursions is about 3 days, if you use horses - a day.  The traveler will meet on his way such a huge and famous lake as Issyk-Kul, as well as the Sary-Bulak pass. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Lake Tourism </h2><p>  The Almaty region is distinguished by magnificent landscapes, and few can forget the trip to this area.  The lakes are dark blue;  they lie near steep cliffs, odorous coniferous landings and <span>alpine meadows.</span> </p><p>  Many travelers call the system a real gem!  Unfortunately, only extreme sportsmen can swim in the first lake.  It is too cold even in the summer - no more than 8 degrees. </p><p>  A small path leads to the second lake.  It meets tourists with a beautiful landscape - a dam made of fir trees and a lawn with flowers. </p><p>  The third body of water is the smallest, so it is perfectly hidden between small rocks. </p><p>  According to travelers' reviews, it can be clarified that the water changes its color depending on the weather: the sky appeared - and Kolsai lakes immediately turned dark blue, and as soon as the clouds hid it, the color changed to emerald green.  With such characteristics, animals should be the same "royal".  Rainbow trout is a joy for fishermen.  However, the happiness of lovers of such a holiday is short-lived, since it is forbidden to catch prey. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alma-Ata's region" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1122976.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Visit to the lakes </h2><p>  Almaty region constantly accepts tourists.  But the Kolsai lakes system is best visited between May and September.  In summer, you should take protective equipment with you - ticks are especially active at this time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Path to the lakes </h2><p>  From the city of Almaty (aka Alma-Ata and the southern capital) to the lakes 4-5 hours drive: they are separated by a path of 300 km.  When traveling with your own transport, it should be borne in mind that the last 50 km have ceased to be a comfortable road, and you can‚Äôt get to the shores by car at all. </p><p>  Looking at the map of Kazakhstan, you can see that after Almaty you need to move eastward to the village of Malovodnoye.  Here you should be especially careful, as you can skip the right fork.  On it there is a need to turn right, there will be a bridge, after which again you should turn in the same direction. </p><p>  The next fork in the road will be after two villages.  Hot springs should be crossed.  If the movement continues in the right direction, the driver will notice that the asphalt has changed to gravel. </p><p>  After the pass, which has the name Toraigyr, you should turn right again.  Further, the road becomes too winding, with drops and gorges, but, in principle, it has a normal appearance, so you won‚Äôt have to go along it for a long time. </p><p>  The last point to drive is Saty.  Kolsaysky lakes are located 10 km from the village.  When there is a fork, you should not turn.  At the end of the road there will be an ecological park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kolsai lakes reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1122978.jpg" width="600"></div>
