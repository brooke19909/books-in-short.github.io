    <h2>  Create a Google Account </h2><p>  In order to use the two methods that will be discussed later, you will need a Google account.  If you have one, then half of the problems are resolved, and you can download games on your Android tablet without any difficulties.  If not, you should go to your device via the link ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù - ‚ÄúAccounts and Sync‚Äù and select ‚ÄúAdd Account‚Äù.  The system will ask you if you want to add an existing account or a new one.  When creating an entry, you will need to enter your first and last name, the desired username, which will be the address of your email inbox on Google services.  Immediately, it is worth noting that if the selected login is busy, and also if it is less than 6 or more than 30 characters, options for the name similar to those indicated above will be offered.  After that, a strong password is entered with confirmation, and the system itself will determine its complexity and reflect it on the scale with the appropriate color and comment.  The last point of registration is the indication of information for recovering a forgotten password: the selection of one of the secret questions and the answer to it, as well as the indication of an additional e-mail address.  After that, click the "Create" button. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Downloading games from the Google Play Store </h2><p>  Now that the account is created, it's time to talk about how and, most importantly, where to download games to the tablet.  For owners of Android devices, such a wonderful system as the Google Play Store has been created.  In order to enter there, you should find on your tablet an icon with this name (usually it is in the "Applications" section or on one of the device‚Äôs screens).  When you first log in, you agree to the terms of use of the service by clicking the appropriate button and you get to the main page. </p>

    <p>  Many owners of Android devices are active users of torrent trackers, where you can find guaranteed safe applications for both the tablet and smartphone.  And for such people, it‚Äôs not the issue of the download process that matters, but the problems associated with installing the application on your gadget.  After all, everything will have to be done manually.  But how? </p><h2>  Install applications from .apk files </h2><p>  Despite the fears of beginners and dummies, this method is not complicated: a file of this format is copied to the device‚Äôs memory card and opened either using the installed file manager, like EStrongs, or special applications like AppInstaller. </p><p>  You can install applications through a computer by connecting an Android device to it.  For this, InstallAPK is installed on the computer, a smartphone or tablet is connected via the USB cable.  Through the launched program, the desired file is selected and launched, after which the process of installing it on the device begins.  Now you know not only how to download games to your tablet, but also how to install them correctly if they are downloaded in .apk format, and not automatically through the Google Play service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="upload games to your android tablet" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20556/433465.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Installing games with a cache </h2><p>  The independent installation process of such games seems aerobatics to many.  If you download the game from the Play Store, the system automatically downloads and sets the cache itself - additional files that did not fit in the .apk file.  After reading this description, you will understand not only how to download games to the tablet from your computer, but also how to install them if, along with the main installer, additional materials are also offered. </p><p>  To do this, you need to do the following: download the file itself and the cache, packed in a .rar or .zip archive, connect the device to the computer, open the archive and move the folder in it to the address: sdcard / Android / data or sdcard / Android / obb.  The cache path is usually indicated at the place where you downloaded the game.  If the specified folder does not exist, then you need to create it.  Then the .apk file is downloaded to the memory card, and after disconnecting the device, it is launched to install the game. </p>

    <h2>  How to remove unnecessary games? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that earlier we considered various ways of how to download games to a tablet for free, we will also tell you about options for removing already unnecessary applications: </p><ul><li>  through the application manager along the path "Menu" - "Settings" - "Applications" - "Application Management", where you can delete an unnecessary application by going to its control screen; </li><li>  using the programs AppInstaller or Uninstaller, where you can remove all unnecessary programs with one touch; </li><li>  through file managers, where similar functions are available in the menu; </li><li>  via the Google Play Store, if they were downloaded from there.  The tab ‚ÄúMy Applications‚Äù displays a list of installed programs, from where you can easily remove them. </li></ul>
