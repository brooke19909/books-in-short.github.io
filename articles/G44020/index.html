The members of this leading link of the Communist Party were a real party elite, possessing immunity and having a tremendous influence not only on party politics, but also on the life of the vast Soviet Union.  In fact, we can confidently call the top leadership of the Soviet Union the Politburo of the <span>CPSU Central Committee</span> under Brezhnev.  The composition (photo below) included a total of 27 people, each of whom had a significant impact on the fate of the Union of Soviets. </p>

    <p>  Brezhnev Leonid Ilyich spent a long period as Secretary General of the CPSU Central Committee (1966-1982).  The Politburo under Brezhnev included the most influential political figures of the Soviet Union of that time, which will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Composition of the Political Bureau of 1966 </h2><p>  The composition of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU under Brezhnev in 1966 totaled 11 people: </p><ol><li>  Brezhnev Leonid. </li><li>  Voronov Nikolay. </li><li>  Polyansky Dmitry. </li><li>  Suslov Michael. </li><li>  Mazurov Kirill. </li><li>  Kosygin Alexey. </li><li>  Kirilenko Andrey. </li><li>  Podgorny Nikolay. </li><li>  Pelsche Arvid. </li><li>  Shelepin Alexander. </li><li>  Rustle Peter. </li></ol><p>  In the early years of the reign, only eleven members were members of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU under Brezhnev.  The composition, age and photos of the members of the Politburo of the next years are of considerable interest, since this distinctive elite club is filled with the brightest politicians of their time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Politburo in 1971 </h2><p>  Over time, there was an increase in the members of the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee under Brezhnev.  The composition of 1971 consisted of 15 people: </p><ol><li>  Brezhnev Leonid. </li><li>  Voronov Nikolay. </li><li>  Grishin Victor. </li><li>  Kirilenko Andrey. </li><li>  Kosygin Alexey. </li><li>  Kulakov Fedor. </li><li>  Kunaev Dinmukhamed. </li><li>  Mazurov Kirill. </li><li>  Pelsche Arvid. </li><li>  Podgorny Nikolay. </li><li>  Polyansky Dmitry. </li><li>  Suslov Michael. </li><li>  Shelepin Alexander. </li><li>  Rustle Peter. </li><li>  Scherbitsky Vladimir. </li></ol><h2>  Composition of the Politburo in 1976 </h2><ol><li>  Brezhnev Leonid. </li><li>  Andropov Yuri. </li><li>  Grechko Andrey. </li><li>  Grishin Victor. </li><li>  Gromyko Andrey. </li><li>  Kirilenko Andrey. </li><li>  Kosygin Alexey. </li><li>  Kulakov Fedor. </li><li>  Kunaev Dinmukhamed. </li><li>  Mazurov Kirill. </li><li>  Pelsche Arvid. </li><li>  Podgorny Nikolay. </li><li>  Romanov Gregory. </li><li>  Suslov Michael. </li><li>  Ustinov Dmitry. </li><li>  Scherbitsky Vladimir. </li></ol><h2>  1981 lineup changes </h2><p>  The Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU under Brezhnev, whose composition until 1981 remained unchanged, was radically rebuilt.  The changes affected not only the current policy, but also the structure of the central committee.  The current membership included: </p><ol><li>  Brezhnev Leonid. </li><li>  Andropov Yuri. </li><li>  Gorbachev Mikhail. </li><li>  Grishin Victor. </li><li>  Grechko Andrey. </li><li>  Kirilenko Andrey. </li><li>  Kunaev Dinmukhamed. </li><li>  Pelsche Arvid. </li><li>  Romanov Gregory. </li><li>  Suslov Michael. </li><li>  Tikhonov Nikolay. </li><li>  Ustinov Dmitry. </li><li>  Chernenko Konstantin. </li><li>  Scherbitsky Vladimir. </li></ol><h2>  1982 events </h2><p>  The composition of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU under Brezhnev in 1982 underwent major changes, since 1982 was marked by a tragic event.  March 23 in Tashkent, Leonid Ilyich visited the aircraft factory.  A large crowd overflowed the bridges, and they fell right on him, causing a collarbone fracture.  The tragedy shook Leonid Ilyich‚Äôs health completely and irrevocably, the collarbone did not grow together and the Secretary-General had to overcome severe pain by conducting meetings.  November 10, he was gone.  The composition of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU under Brezhnev in 1982 lost two influential politicians - Mikhail Suslov and Leonid Brezhnev. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Andropov Yuri (Secretary General of the Central Committee of 11/12/1982). </li><li>  Brezhnev Leonid (passed away on November 10, 1982). </li><li>  Gorbachev Mikhail. </li><li>  Grishin Victor. </li><li>  Gromyko Andrey. </li><li>  Aliyev Heydar. </li><li>  Kunaev Dinmukhamed. </li><li>  Pelsche Arvid. </li><li>  Romanov Gregory. </li><li>  Suslov Michael (passed away January 25, 1982). </li><li>  Tikhonov Nikolay. </li><li>  Ustinov Dmitry. </li><li>  Chernenko Konstantin. </li><li>  Scherbitsky Vladimir. </li></ol><h2>  The five most important </h2><p>  Among some modern political scientists there is an opinion that the main problems and issues were considered in the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU under Brezhnev 5 main members. </p>

    <p>  The Politburo resolved the most important issues - political, economic, party.  The Secretariat of the Central Committee was engaged in the preparation of these questions, and specially created commissions were involved in resolving individual problems.  The political bureau consisted of the five main members of the Central Committee, the remaining members had the right only to an advisory vote at meetings. </p><p>  Who was in the ‚Äúelite five‚Äù of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU under Brezhnev, at what age did he get into it? </p><p>  <em><em>Suslov</em> Mikhail Andreevich</em> (years of life 1902-1982).  He became a member of the Politburo twice: the first - even under Stalin I.V., the second - in 1955, at the age of 53 years, and he was until his death.  The main ideologist of the country, Suslov, when he was a member of the Politburo under Brezhnev of the USSR, was the chief controller and curator of the departments of culture, science, agitation, and education.  Responsible for censorship.  Stalin's confidante, the cleverest and dodgy politician, he bore the nickname of the ‚Äúgray cardinal‚Äù and ‚Äúthe man in galoshes‚Äù.  Had a huge impact on the country's politics.  According to rumors, even Comrade Brezhnev himself did not dare to argue with Mikhail Andreevich. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <em><em><em>Podgorny</em></em> Nikolay Viktorovich</em> <em><em> </em></em>  (1903-1983 gg.).  He was in the Politburo for more than 17 years - from 1960 to 1977.  He served as Chairman of the Presidium of the BC CCCP during the reign of Brezhnev.  This meant that Podgorny, a politician who was hardly noticeable and had little influence, could be called the ‚Äúhead of state.‚Äù  Realizing this, Nikolai Viktorovich loved when journalists, interviewing, called him nothing more than ‚Äúthe president of the Soviet Union‚Äù.  Brezhnev did not like this fact, and in 1977 the 74-year-old Podgorny was ousted, combining his position with the post of Secretary General. </p><p>  <em><em><em>Kosygin</em></em> Alexey Nikolaevich</em> <em><em> </em></em>  (years of life 1904-1980).  He was introduced into the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU under Brezhnev (since 1960), and was in it almost to death.  He was a kind of record holder - he was the chairman of the Council of Ministers for a long sixteen years, at the same time moving to small posts in the Politburo.  Carried out activities in the field of economics - carried out reforms in the planning system.  After two heart attacks, at the age of 76, Aleksey Nikolayevich was removed from the Political Bureau under Brezhnev. </p><p>  <em><em>Pelshe</em> Arvid Yanovich</em> <em> </em>  (years of life 1899-1983).  Latvian Communist, was admitted to the Politburo in 1966, at the age of 67.  Retired due to death.  He controlled the observance of party discipline in the position of Chairman of the Party Control Committee.  Arvid Yanovich is also known for writing multi-volume works on the history of the CPSU, recommended at that time for compulsory reading in universities. </p><p>  <em><em>Ustinov</em> Dmitry Fedorovich</em> <em> </em>  (years of life 1908-1984).  Member of the Politburo from 1976 until his death.  He died at the age of 76.  From 1941 to 1945 he served as the People's Commissar of Armaments, in 1976 he held the high post of Minister of Defense.  Not being a military man, he bore the rank of Marshal.  He is credited with the main role in the introduction of Soviet troops into Afghanistan.  He had every chance to become at the helm of the country as the new General Secretary in connection with the death of Brezhnev, but lost the championship to Andropov, Yuri Vladimirovich. </p><h2>  List of other members </h2><p>  Throughout the existence of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU under Brezhnev, the composition, the list of members of which is presented in the table, regularly changed, forming the structure of the main administrative body of the country. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Full name </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  Years of membership in the Politburo </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Nikolai Voronov </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1963 .... 1971 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Dmitry Polyansky </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1960 ... .1976 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Kirill Mazurov </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1965 ... .1978 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Andrey Kirilenko </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1962 ... 1982 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Alexander Shelepin </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1964 ... .1975 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Peter Shelest </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1964 ... .1973 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Victor Grishin </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1971 ... 1986 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Fedor Kulakov </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1971 ... 1978 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Dinmukhamed Kunaev </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1971 ... 1987 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Vladimir Scherbitsky </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1971 ... .1989 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Yuri Andropov </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1973 ... .1984 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Andrey Grechko </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1973. ... 1976 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Andrey Gromyko </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1973. ... 1988 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Grigory Romanov </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1976 .... 1985 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Mikhail Gorbachev </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1980 ... .1991 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Nikolai Tikhonov </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1979 ... .1985 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Konstantin Chernenko </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1978 ... .1985 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="229"><p>  Heydar Aliyev </p></td><td valign="top" width="139"><p>  1982 ... .1987 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Brief curriculum vitae </h2><p>  Each member who has ever been a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU under Brezhnev (composition, age, photos of which are presented in a brief curriculum vitae), made a serious contribution to the development of a great power. </p><h2>  Leonid Brezhnev </h2>

    <p>  Born in 1906 in the village of Kamensky (Ukraine).  He studied at the gymnasium, reclamation technical school, and the Institute of Metallurgy.  Succeeded in a party career.  The Second World War was fought by Leonid Brezhnev as a political worker. </p><p>  In 1960, he headed the BC CCCP.  As a result of the <span>resignation of Khrushchev,</span> in the preparation for which he took an active part, he became First Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee in 1964, and in 1966 - General Secretary.  Contemporaries characterized Leonid Ilyich as a friendly, polite person, an executive and conservative official. </p><p>  During Brezhnev‚Äôs stay at the helm, national gross income grew, some industries developed, but at the same time bureaucracy developed and the beginning of the USSR‚Äôs participation in the Afghan war was begun. </p><h2>  Mikhail Suslov </h2>

    <p>  Date of birth - 11/21/1902 years.  Place of birth: Shakhovskaya village, Saratov province.  The family in which Mikhail Suslov was born was from the poorest layers of peasants, and the opportunity to learn and develop with a young man appeared only with the advent of Soviet power. </p><p>  Active work in the field of the party, moving to Moscow and further promotion along the party line lead to the fact that at a fairly young age - about forty years old, Suslov takes up the post of secretary of the Stavropol Regional Committee.  Actively implements Stalinist politics and as a result becomes the chief ideologist of the Union - the editor of the newspaper Pravda.  Until the end of his life (until 1982) he was a member of the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee under Brezhnev. </p><h2>  Arvid Pelshe </h2>
