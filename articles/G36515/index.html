By the way, the hotel provides its guests with transfers to the airport and the <span>seashore,</span> you should not worry about this. </p><h2>  What does the hotel look like?  Brief infrastructure description </h2><p>  San Marco Hotel 2 * - city hotel.  It is a large multi-story building, built in a modern style.  The hotel does not have its own courtyard, however, inside the building there is everything you need for a comfortable fun holiday.  By the way, elevators are constantly working in the building, so do not worry, even if you are settled on the top floor.  There are several parking spaces near the hotel.  Around it are other buildings, including some hotels.  The road, and therefore the public transport stop, is close.  By the way, the hotel was opened in 2005, and in 2014 a radical reconstruction was carried out on its territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel San Marco Hotel 2 * (Dubai, Deira): description and photos of rooms </h2>
