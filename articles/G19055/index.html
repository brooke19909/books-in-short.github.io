When designing the complex, LenSpetsSMU, acting as a builder, did everything possible to ensure that the houses in it fully and completely corresponded to the architectural concept of the district, in which buildings erected in the Stalin era predominate.  Therefore, although the buildings are being built using modern technologies, their appearance harmoniously fits into the already existing historically established ensemble. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Moscow Gate" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1289101.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About the developer </h2><p>  The construction company has been operating in the real estate market since 1987.  In fact, this is a huge holding, which has in its composition more than 60 divisions.  One of them is LenSpetsSMU.  St. Petersburg is a city with a certain architectural appearance, and therefore, not every developer is honored to work in its historical areas, which is Moscow.  The Etalon company, which includes LenSpetsSMU, is considered a responsible and respected developer.  On her account - more than 150 completed projects, all objects are always delivered on time and without any imperfections.  The holding uses an integrated approach in its activities, and therefore leads the project from start to finish: from the moment of selecting a site and designing the complex until its commissioning.  The housing offered by the company is of excellent quality, and its activities have been awarded many state awards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd Moscow gate reviews" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1289102.jpg" width="600"></div>

The residential complex is located next to the metro station of the same name and in the immediate vicinity of the city.  In parallel with the construction of houses, the <span>construction of the</span> necessary infrastructure is in progress, in addition, the first floors in all buildings will be leased for commercial real estate.  Housing in the Moscow Gate residential complex belongs to the comfort and comfort + class, in connection with which mainly large-sized apartments predominate in houses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Moscow Gate St. Petersburg" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1289109.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  Since the construction of a residential complex is a large-scale project, it is planned <span>to commission</span> all the facilities <span>in</span> turn.  The first house began to be built in 2014, construction work is currently being completed, the building is scheduled to be commissioned in the second quarter of 2016.  It will have 240 apartments.  Since 2015, the construction of buildings of the second and third stage, the number of residential premises in them - 629 and 288 apartments, respectively.  The entire complex should be put into operation at the end of 2010.  At the moment, all work is in strict accordance with the schedule. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  The ecological situation of the district, located in the center of the metropolis, can hardly be called prosperous.  Near the LCD there are transport highways, thermal power plants, and industrial enterprises.  Naturally, one should not mention clean air at all.  So those for whom the issue of ecology is paramount should turn their eyes to new buildings in the suburbs.  Apartments in the Moscow Gate residential complex are more suitable for those who care about the prestige of housing, as well as the need to stay as close to the center of the metropolis as possible. </p><p>  True, the environmental situation is somewhat going to improve the developer, planning to carry out massive work on landscaping the complex.  In addition, the Kolmovsky and Roshchinsky Gardens, as well as the large Dynamo Park are located nearby. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  As for the objects of social and shopping and entertainment infrastructure, everything is in order here.  Which, in principle, is understandable, because the place where the complex is located is almost the center of the metropolis.  There are plenty of huge supermarkets, and small convenience stores, there are huge shopping and entertainment and sports complexes, pharmacies, clinics.  The only thing that can be considered a disadvantage is a small number of schools located nearby.  For which he sometimes gets not quite good LCD "Moscow Gate" reviews.  However, this defect will be eliminated by the developer by commissioning its own d / s and school. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="modern residential complex" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1289147.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Transport </h2><p>  A description of the area in which the new building is located would not be complete without mentioning its <span>transport infrastructure.</span>  However, in our case it would be possible to do without it, since everyone understands that practically the center of St. Petersburg cannot suffer from poor transport links.  In addition to the metro station of the same name, to which it is only five minutes to walk from the house‚Äôs doorstep, residents of the Moskovskie Vorota residential complex can use public transport services (trams, minibuses, buses).  Stops are located next to the buildings.  As for highways, there are also plenty of them here - these are Ligovsky and Moscow Avenues, ul.  Zastavskaya.  Before leaving for the WHSD - only three kilometers.  Nevertheless, during rush hour you will have to stand in traffic jams. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenspetsmu St. Petersburg" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1289151.jpg" width="532"></div>

    <h2>  Layout of apartments, cost </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the Moscow Gate residential complex was designed taking into account the concepts of architecture of the Stalin era.  This was reflected not only in the appearance of the complex, but also in the layout of the apartments.  All living quarters are distinguished by the presence of large kitchens (in some apartments their area reaches 20 "squares") and high (2.8 meters) ceilings.  Regardless of the format of the apartment, each has a loggia or balcony.  Also, they are all characterized by large hallways.  In studios and ‚Äúodnushki‚Äù (though not in all) the bathrooms are combined, in all other apartments - separate. </p><p>  Designers of the company did a great job and provided future residents with the opportunity to choose layouts.  And there are a lot of them, I must say.  These are 5 types of one-room, 29 two-room, 56 three-room and 7 four-room.  So everyone will find a suitable option for themselves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="area description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1289160.jpg" width="592"></div>

    <p>  <span>The area of ‚Äã‚Äãresidential</span> premises is 29-112 "squares", the cost is from three and a half to 15,000,000 rubles. </p><p>  The first building is for rent with a <span>rough finish,</span> all subsequent ones are finished. </p><p>  You can buy any of the attractive apartments today on the basis of equity participation and at the lowest initial cost. </p><h2>  LCD "Moscow Gate": reviews </h2><p>  What do people say about the <span>residential complex?</span>  It is worth saying that there are enough enthusiastic responses, and reviews full of negativity.  As for the good.  Naturally, everyone unanimously praises the location of the Moscow Gate residential complex.  Still, it is still the center of such a magnificent metropolis as St. Petersburg.  People also like the fact that next to the house you can buy almost everything, including furniture, you do not need to go anywhere.  Excellent consider all and the transport structure of the area.  The proximity of the subway station is also a huge plus.  Potential buyers also respond well to the layouts of apartments, it is also impressive to many that the construction is carried out by a reputable developer, who is respected in the real estate market.  The progress of construction also does not cause any complaints. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Moscow gate Lenspetsmu" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1289131.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Now for the cons.  In the first place - poor environmental conditions.  Actually, no one is hiding this.  As they say, do not like it, look for options in the country.  The center of the metropolis a priori will not be able to please residents of the houses with a clean atmosphere.  Some are not completely satisfied with the fact that in the first building apartments are rented out only with rough finish.  On the contrary, it pleases others.  Firstly, the apartment will be cheaper, and secondly, everything in it can be done in its own way, and not complain about the color of the wallpaper from the builder or the wrong quality of the doors.  The minus is also considered by many that there are few schools and d / s near the buildings, however, as already mentioned, the builder will eliminate this defect by erecting its own facilities. </p><p>  As for the cost of housing, no one considers it particularly overpriced, since nevertheless the new building belongs to the comfort class segment, for which, as you know, you have to pay. </p>
