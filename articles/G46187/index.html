Huge capacities, a large number of professional specialists, development potential - all this the company is actively implementing today, trying to catch up with its competitors and squeeze out their composition of the Big Three. </p><p>  As of 2017, the organization has more than 140 thousand employees, all of them are engaged in ensuring the smooth operation of not only mobile communications, but also wired home Internet.  Not so long ago, Rostelecom signed an agreement with Tele2 Russia, due to which both parties won: the first was able to significantly expand its coverage, and the second began to monitor the general state of affairs of the company‚Äôs mobile television systems. </p><h2>  Rostelecom: the history of mobile communications </h2><p>  Rostelecom‚Äôs mobile communications, reviews of the high quality of which are distributed also thanks to the word of mouth effect, initially had a great advantage over all other telecom operators.  The fixed-line telephony base received in 1990 from the USSR Ministry of Communications helped create a high-quality <span>mobile network.</span>  Most of the first mobile numbers functioned as part of subsidiaries of this company, in particular, Skylink, Yeniseitelecom, Baykalvestkom, etc. </p>

    <p>  The situation changed in the winter of 2014, when Tele2 Russia assets were merged with the company.  This has made it possible to achieve huge cost savings by combining capacities and freed up resources.  The money received went to modernize the network, as well as advertising to attract new customers.  As of 2016, the total revenue of the company amounted to more than 295 billion rubles, and the number of mobile communication users has already exceeded 15 million. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Network coverage </h2><p>  If you decide to purchase a cell phone, then the best way to create an impression of Rostelecom‚Äôs mobile communications is to provide feedback on the quality of coverage.  As of December 2017, the company serves more than 70 Russian regions, which are conditionally divided into 7 macro-branches - Center, Ural, Volga, North-West, Far East, Siberia and South .  Within each of them, work is constantly ongoing on the construction and improvement of existing base stations that affect network coverage. </p>

    <p>  Since the company is exclusively Russian, when traveling abroad it will not be possible to use its services.  But do not despair, because there are roaming partners who provide communication services to Russian operators at fairly competitive prices.  Billing will depend on which country you decide to go to, as a rule, the most expensive countries are those that are too little popular among residents of Russia, a detailed list can be found on the official website of the mobile operator. </p><h2>  Company Features </h2><p>  If you have already purchased a device with Rostelecom mobile communications, positive feedback on the quality of communications will not be new to you.  In addition to directly servicing cellular communications, the company also leases its capacities to other operators, this is quite normal practice, due to which it is possible to reduce the cost of providing its services to customers.  In addition, in some regions of Russia, Rostelecom is a monopoly operator, and local residents use it mainly, but casual guests here would have had a hard time if the company did not allow its base stations to be used. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  As of 2017, all the cellular assets of the company are in joint management, in which Tele2 also takes part.  Over the three years of the existence of such an alliance, it was possible to completely restore the operation of base stations according to a completely new model in Krasnodar, Yekaterinburg, Tver, Arkhangelsk and the surrounding areas.  According to analysts, the company takes a course to teach its customers to use mobile Internet more often and even use it to make calls. </p><h2>  Moscow and the region </h2><p>  The simplest tool that allows you to choose Rostelecom mobile communications is reviews.  Moscow is the most convenient city for registering a SIM card.  It is there that customers are offered the most convenient rates, for example, in December 2017, the ‚ÄúOn All L‚Äù plan was introduced, on which you can get 12 gigabytes of Internet traffic and 500 minutes for calls to absolutely any Russian numbers for just 399 rubles a month.  A distinctive feature - all the components of the package can be carried over to the next month. </p><p>  Rostelecom, together with Tele2, set a course for maximum tariff simplification, which is why no more than 10-15 units are offered in each region.  In Moscow and the region, ‚ÄúOn All XL‚Äù is very popular, which includes 1,500 minutes to all numbers of the Russian Federation, as well as 30 gigabytes of Internet traffic, the monthly fee here is 799 rubles per month, which is very profitable compared to other operators. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  There is also a weak link in Rostelecom - mobile communications in the Moscow Region, reviews of which leave much to be desired.  Often, customers complain of disconnection and low network coverage.  Of course, the company is aware of this problem and is trying to solve it, but it takes a fairly large amount of time.  As a kind of compensation, we can consider the appearance on the market of the Super Simka S tariff plan, which provides customers with free calls to Rostelecom numbers throughout Russia, as well as 5 gigabytes of Internet traffic, the subscription fee here is only 7 rubles per day. </p><h2>  Voronezh </h2><p>  Not so long ago, a strong link appeared in Rostelecom mobile communications - Voronezh, the reviews of local residents about the company gush with positive and joy.  Previously, all of the company's current customers were served by the Nizhny Novgorod Cellular Communications organization, and they constantly had difficulty getting mobile services and the Internet. </p><p>  After the reorganization of the local operator, things immediately went smoothly, and the number of connected customers in the region increased significantly.  Customers note a large number of convenient and transparent tariffs, as well as noticeable improvements in the quality of communication that allow you to use the services without fear that the conversation may be interrupted at any time. </p><h2>  Tariff Plans </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the company also provides <span>broadband Internet access services, the</span> main priority of Rostelecom is mobile communications;  tariffs, reviews about the company, details - all this is in the public domain for all comers.  All tariff plans offered to her are mainly divided into two types: package and standard.  The first ones are a whole range of services: minutes for calls, Internet packages, SMS messages, etc. For the client, such tariff plans are the most profitable, because for a relatively small price they immediately receive all the necessary services. </p>

    <p>  Standard tariff plans are gradually becoming a thing of the past, since they are much more expensive than modern ones.  In this case, traffic packets, minutes and messages are not discussed, the client uses a pre-set tariffication, and at the same time he can connect the necessary options with traffic, SMS or minutes for an additional fee.  The cost of connecting tariff plans and their tariffing will directly depend on the region in which the client is located.  As a rule, the most expensive connection is in underdeveloped areas located in the Far East and in the northern part of the country. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  The main tool that helps Rostelecom to develop mobile communications is customer reviews.  They are satisfied with the pricing policy of the company, since it is a discounter against the background of the operators of the so-called Big Three.  The company itself is actively positioning itself as a bastion of low prices and a means to save money. </p>

    <p>  According to customers, it would be worth more time and effort to upgrade their network, since far from all regions of Russia it is at the required level.  Network users paid special attention to the fact that in some cities during the opening ceremony of the operator, communications did not work very well and had to use competitors' SIM cards. </p><h2>  Legal entities service </h2><p>  Another area of ‚Äã‚ÄãRostelecom is mobile communications for business, reviews about it are much more supportive.  Working with legal entities is much more complicated in its functionality than with physical ones; it requires specific knowledge and skills, therefore, much more attention is paid to it.  In terms of communication quality, customers are quite satisfied with the services of the company, and have been cooperating with it for a long time. </p>

    <p>  Many clients from the b2b segment, who today use the mobile communications of this company, have long worked with her on fixed communications.  Standard telephony is still in demand in this segment, since every self-respecting organization must have an office and a city phone number. </p><h2>  What did 2017 remember for the company? </h2><p>  What exactly attracts the attention of Rostelecom - mobile communications, 2017 reviews from customers and partners indicate that the network quality continues to improve, but there are still many areas for growth.  The company pays special attention to the development of its facilities in the Far East; this year, work began on the construction of a trunk cable on the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk-Krabozavodskoye route, which will improve fixed-line and Internet services, and in the future, mobile communications. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you are still just choosing mobile communications for yourself, Rostelecom, whose reviews are mostly positive, can become your full partner.  If you are at a loss to choose a suitable tariff plan for yourself, you can use the services of call center specialists.  You will be happy to advise on all matters of interest around the clock and seven days a week. </p>
