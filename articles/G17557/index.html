As a result, we see one model of the smartphone, but it turns out that two are hidden under it.  The same thing happened with the ASUS ZenFone 3 Max.  The phone did not score a lot of reviews.  Why?  We learn further. </p><h2>  Company </h2><p>  ASUS recently entered the market with its smartphones.  The company has been operating since 1989.  The first samples of the production of smart phones were back in 2007.  But only in the last couple of years have these models become noticeable in the market. </p><p>  The company is located in the Republic of China.  He is engaged in the production of computer equipment.  He devotes most of his time to the production of laptops, monitors, desktop PCs and their components. </p><h2>  About smartphone </h2><p>  The manufacturer chose the name of the ASUS ZenFone 3 Max line.  Reviews are mostly good.  But not all buyers were able to deal with an incomprehensible classification. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus zenfone 3 max reviews" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2015983.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For many users, it still remains that there are two different phones with the same name.  But no one pays attention to the incomprehensible code in brackets.  As it turned out, doing this is sometimes useful.  Otherwise, instead of one phone you will get another, which will be noticeably different. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a result, ZC520TL and ZC553KL are two different devices.  They differ in size, screen size, processor, camera, etc. </p><p>  Despite the difference between the two devices, they also differ in configurations, which further complicates the choice of the buyer.  Therefore, if you decide to buy this model, carefully look at the parameters so that after not to be disappointed and not to call unscrupulous sellers. </p><h2>  Packaging </h2><p>  There is nothing supernatural in the box.  The manufacturer decided to save on it.  Therefore, both options come in a plain white box made of thick cardboard.  In front there is an image of the phone, the model is indicated, but there is no additional index.  He will have to look at the back of the box. </p><p>  Inside there is a charger with a 220 V block and a USB cable.  By tradition, a paperclip was placed to remove the SIM card tray.  A nice gift was the presence of an OTG adapter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus zenfone 3 max zc520tl reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2015982.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Let's start with the ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC520TL.  Design reviews received average.  Someone was expecting the best, someone was not impressed with the materials.  But the model usually looks.  By the way, it looks practically no different from the second modification.  The difference is only in dimensions, because they have different diagonals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, the model turned out to be restrained.  It is presented in three colors: gold, or, more precisely, pink, dark gray and silver.  All cases look good.  As is clear from the responses of the owners, there was a buyer for everyone. </p><p>  In general, looking back at previously released models, one could notice how manufacturers want to stand out.  There were artsy, weird, elegant and stylish smartphones.  Now everyone has begun to follow the fashion, which is often dictated by the flagships of Apple and Samsung. </p><p>  From here we get curved edges of the screen, rounded body shapes, the use of metal and glass.  Manufacturers have chosen one template, which is slightly modified for special occasions. </p><p>  The same thing happened with the ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC553KL.  The reviews once again remind us that we have a pattern: a rounded case, noticeable combinations of metal and plastic.  On the lid are already familiar bands for antennas. </p><p>  Now you can distinguish new items only by tactile sensations.  Using 2.5D glass is not always successfully implemented, which is why random clicks are observed.  An important role is played by the assembly.  They began to trust more weighty large smartphones using metal elements. </p><h2>  Essential elements </h2><p>  On the placement of all elements on the ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC520TL, the reviews were different.  This is due to the fact that many owners switched to this model from other Chinese.  And despite the fact that everything has remained unchanged, yet even the transfer of the headset jack has been criticized. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus zenfone 3 max zc553kl reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2015984.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The front part is occupied by the screen.  But since the device is not positioned as frameless, on the sides you can see a thin border, and the frame at the bottom and top of the display is impressive.  On top there is 2.5D glass, which looks more profitable on a dark model. </p><p>  Above the screen there is a front camera, then a ‚Äúpeephole‚Äù with indicators and a speaker grille.  The LED of missed notifications remains barely noticeable.  The indicator itself in the active state is bright, but does not interfere at night. </p><p>  In the middle under the display is the company logo.  The control button block has moved to the screen. </p><p>  The back panel is made of metal, and the panels on the top and bottom are made of plastic.  Below them are antennas for communication.  On the top there is a second microphone for noise reduction.  Under it is the square ‚Äúeye‚Äù of the camera and the same size below the fingerprint sensor.  To the left of the camera is a small flash. </p><p>  At the bottom of the lid is an external speaker.  Above it is the company logo.  The placement of speaker perforation is very unsuccessful.  If the phone is lying upside down on the sofa, you can skip the call. </p><h2>  Details </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the details of the ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC520TL smartphone received good reviews.  Not everyone was happy that the headset jack had moved to the top end.  In most modern models, it is located below, along with a charging port.  Therefore, some had to get used to. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus zenfone 3 max zc520tl 16gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2015986.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The rest of the elements have retained their placement.  As already mentioned, at the top end of the audio jack.  On the bottom there is a small hole in the main microphone and a place for connecting the charger.  Unusually, it turned out empty, because the speaker moved to the rear panel. </p><p>  The left end occupied the tray.  It is, as always, combined.  You can install one microSIM and nanoSIM one.  Or change one of the ‚ÄúSIM cards‚Äù to microSD.  The right side is occupied by volume and power buttons. </p><h2>  Exploitation </h2><p>  After using the ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC520TL 16Gb, the owners left positive reviews.  Despite the typical design and simple appearance, the phone was very convenient.  Moreover, both the 5.5-inch version and the younger modification. </p><p>  In his hands he lies comfortably.  Due to the rounded edges it does not fall out of the hand and does not press in the palm of the hand.  Easy to operate with one hand.  Successfully lies and a finger on the scanner.  Some owners complained about the operation of this sensor.  But the case is quite rare and most likely associated with the assembly. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Next, consider the model ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC520TL 16Gb.  Reviews regarding him are not bad.  This modification is slightly worse.  It works with a diagonal of 5.2 inches.  At the same time, the screen resolution is 1280x720 pixels.  For such a diagonal, this is quite enough.  There are no obvious flaws.  We have a good average screen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone asus zenfone 3 max reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2015985.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It has good brightness and contrast.  In the afternoon in the sun the screen is perfectly visible.  There is an automatic brightness control.  It works correctly and quickly responds to lighting changes. </p><p>  Color reproduction is correct, without obvious distortion.  The viewing angle is not bad, but with slight deviations, hue distortions and dull colors are noticeable. </p><p>  The older model has got a 5.5-inch display.  The LCD screen is equipped with an IPS matrix.  The resolution is 1920 √ó 1080, so the ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC553KL smartphone received positive reviews. </p><p>  Relative to the previous modification, the display is much better.  It produces a brighter and richer image.  He has a sharper and sharper picture. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The lenses of both versions are also different.  ZC520TL equipped with a module with 13 megapixels and aperture f / 2.2.  The lens responds quickly to the team and works with PixelMaster technology.  Autofocus is also smart and accurate.  Sometimes it can ‚Äúmiss‚Äù, but this rarely happens and depends on the lighting. </p><p>  White balance is correct.  There is a post-processing photo, but it is not too noticeable.  Detailing the pictures is not bad.  The problem arose only with the dynamic range.  But it can be "fixed" by turning on the HDR mode. </p><p>  At dusk, the camera does not show a good result.  But this is not surprising, given the budget and parameters. </p><p>  In general, the ASUS ZenFone 3 Max camera received positive reviews.  Convenient was its interface.  There is a set of standard shooting modes, but here they are more "for show". </p><p>  Model ZC553KL has got an improved module.  It works with a resolution of 16 megapixels, a 1/3 inch sensor and f2.0 aperture.  Endowed this lens with ASUS TriTech technology.  To say that it is very useful is difficult.  But autofocus has become more precise, due to the fact that there is a contrast analysis and phase detection. </p><h2>  "Iron" </h2><p>  Not surprisingly, ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC553KL 32GB was also the best in performance.  There are many reviews on this subject.  And if we consider the parameters, then the advantage of the model with a 5.5-inch screen is noticeable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus zenfone 3 max 32gb reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2015988.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As a result, the older model received a processor with eight cores Qualcomm Snapdragon 430, which operates at a frequency of 1.4 GHz.  Adreno 505 is responsible for the graphics. The internal memory is 32 GB, and the operational memory is 3 GB. </p><p>  The younger model was weaker.  It has a <span>MediaTek MT6737T</span> chipset <span>.</span>  Works with four cores at a frequency of 1.4 GHz.  The graphics are answered by the Chinese Mali-T720.  The most common modification is sold with 2 GB of RAM. </p><p>  In principle, you can summarize the performance of both models of ASUS ZenFone 3 Max 32GB.  They get good reviews in this regard.  Who did not expect anything supernatural from the smartphone was not disappointed. </p><p>  Less experienced users hoped to get something more.  In fact, we have two ordinary smartphones.  Their performance is enough to enjoy any game on medium graphics settings.  Sometimes slight overheating is observed, most often during charging. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  But in battery life, the older model is a bit inferior.  But this did not affect the reviews on the ASUS ZenFone 3 Max ZC553KL.  The 5.2-inch version has the ability to charge other gadgets.  Works with 4230 mAh battery. </p><p>  The manufacturer immediately announced that the standby time reaches 720 hours.  Continuous conversation will last 20 hours.  The unit can play movies 15 hours in a row, and you can ‚Äúsit‚Äù on the Internet for up to 18 hours. </p><p>  In fact, as always, everything turned out to be a little less.  At maximum brightness, the phone was able to show clips for 12 hours.  It can continuously download web pages for 5 hours. </p><p>  In general, the device can "live" without power for up to three days.  But everything, of course, depends on the operation.  You can use special energy-saving modes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asus zenfone 3 max zc553kl 32gb reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2015989.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The 5.5-inch model received a 4100 mAh battery.  It seems like it is slightly smaller, but given that the screen has increased, the difference in performance may be different. </p><p>  This model will not last three days.  The maximum is one and a half days.  Continuous use will last 7 hours.  In general, even such an indicator is a good solution. </p><p>  Since the manufacturer positioned the smartphone as ‚Äútenacious‚Äù, ASUS ZenFone 3 Max received good reviews in this regard.  Many buyers liked the fact that you can not be afraid to go out without a charger, take the phone to work or study and not think that he is sitting down now. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  These are both models from ASUS.  You need to understand that we have budget options.  Something unusual cannot be expected from them.  The cost of the younger model is about 10 thousand rubles, the older one is 1-2 thousand rubles more expensive. </p><p>  The cost to someone seemed overpriced.  After all, for the money you can buy a more powerful phone from Xiaomi or Meizu.  But fans of ASUS definitely liked the phone. </p><p>  About appearance and design did not talk much.  Everyone is already fed up with this typical design, which is trying to parody the "apple" devices.  But someone was still satisfied with the laconic appearance, restrained calm shades. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone asus zenfone 3 max zc520tl reviews" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2015987.jpg" width="600"></div>

The presence of Android 7.0, which the ZenUI proprietary shell did not spoil, also pleased users. </p><p>  The owners noted that the device does not have a large number of pre-installed programs that do not bring any benefit and take up space.  The manufacturer managed to make a simple interface with clear settings. </p>
