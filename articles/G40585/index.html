    <p>  Time of Troubles in Russia: briefly on the main thing </p><p>  The beginning of the unrest was marked by the suppression of <span>the Rurik dynasty: the</span> legitimate heirs of Ivan the Terrible died, in Russia there was no legitimate king.  By the way, the death of the last heir to the throne was very mysterious.  She is still shrouded in secrets.  The struggle for power began in the country, accompanied by intrigue.  Until 1605, Boris Godunov sat on the throne, on whose board famine fell.  Lack of food forces people to engage in robbery and robbery.  <span>The revolt of Khlop</span> ended the discontent of the masses, who lived in the hope that the prince Dmitry killed by Godunov was alive and would soon restore order. </p><p>  So, the <span>reasons for troubled times</span> are outlined.  What came next?  As expected, False Dmitry I appeared, who obtained support from the Poles.  During the war with the impostor, Tsar Boris Godunov and his son Fedor die.  However, the unworthy throne was not long: the people overthrew False Dmitry I and elected Vasily Shuisky as king. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="causes of troubled times briefly" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/167728.jpg" width="576"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But the rule of the new king was also in the spirit of troubled times.  Briefly, this period can be described as follows: during the uprising of Ivan Bolotnikov, <span>False Dmitry II</span> appeared <span>,</span> for the struggle against which the tsar signs an agreement with Sweden.  However, such an alliance did more harm than good.  The king was removed from the throne, and the boyars began to rule the country.  As a result of the Semiboyarshchyna, the Poles entered the capital and began to instill the Catholic faith, while plundering everything around.  Which further exacerbated the already difficult situation of ordinary people. </p><p>  However, despite all the hardships and deprivations of the troubled times (briefly described as the most terrible era for our country), Mother Russia found the strength for the birth of heroes.  They prevented the disappearance of Russia on the world map.  We are talking about Lyapunov‚Äôs militia: the Novgorodians Dmitry Pozharsky and <span>Kuzma Minin</span> gathered people and drove out foreign invaders from their native land.  After this, the Zemsky Sobor was held, during which Mikhail Fedorovich Romanov was elected to the kingdom.  This event ended the most difficult period in the history of Russia.  The throne was occupied by the new ruling dynasty, which was overthrown by the Communists only at the beginning of the twentieth century.  The Romanov House brought the country out of darkness and strengthened its position on the world stage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="troubled times in Russia briefly" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/239654.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The consequences of troubled times.  Briefly </p><p>  The results of the troubles for Russia are very deplorable.  As a result of chaos, the country lost a significant part of its territory, suffered significant losses in population.  The economy was in terrible decline, the people became weak and lost hope.  However, what does not kill makes you stronger.  So the Russian people managed to find the strength in themselves to once again restore their rights and make themselves known to the whole world.  Having survived the most difficult times, Russia was reborn.  Crafts, culture began to develop, people returned to agriculture and cattle breeding, stopping robberies on the high road. </p>
