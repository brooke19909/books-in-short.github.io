They have become commonplace and even help to cope with lack of money, make a major purchase or relax at sea.  However, the conditions provided by various banks are so different that you can stay with positive emotions or get into deep debts. </p><h2>  What you need for a loan </h2><p>  There is a huge difference in conditions for the capital resident and guest.  Almost all the banks of the city of Moscow offer favorable conditions to the radical, and the visitor will need to first search for something suitable.  It may well be worth starting with registration and only then apply for a loan, but sometimes you can get by with temporary registration. </p><p>  It is also just necessary to instill confidence in the bank about good income.  It is best and easiest to do this using the 2NDFL certificate, which will provide a complete legal picture of earnings.  Unfortunately, in the capital, a huge number of people who work informally or simply for a hidden salary, in this case it is much more difficult to formalize everything, but it is possible, because many organizations understand the situation and go towards it. </p><h2>  What are the loans </h2><p>  Especially for those who do not have the time or ability to fulfill all the conditions of a regular loan in a state bank or in another serious organization, there are a wide variety of loans. </p><p>  The most common option is a loan or another option of lending with proof of income level, it is in this form that most contracts are implemented.  However, there are also targeted loans, with which it is only necessary to determine and inform the bank what money is needed for.  An example is a car loan, when the car remains for a long time the property of the bank, but the borrower can fully use it.  You can also take a loan secured by real estate, but this is quite risky and such transactions are only possible as a last resort. </p><h2>  How is the procedure </h2><p>  Once it has been determined why a loan is needed, it is necessary to start obtaining it.  First of all, you need to evaluate the existing proposals, now it can be done using the network.  Also, an application for a loan in Moscow banks can be executed on the Internet, in some cases it is enough to indicate all the necessary data, in others to attach a scan of all the required documents, but the trip to the organization at the initial level is not required.  This is a serious saving of time and effort, and these are some of the most important resources of modern man.  Then you need to wait for a call from a specialist who will inform you about the decision of the bank, as well as how to get the money and where to do it. </p><p>  Be sure to carefully prepare for the loan, try to find out all the conditions and rationally assess the situation.  View forecasts for inflation, as well as overpayments and try to compare these figures.  So that the burden is not too heavy, you need to use the advice of specialists and translate their wishes into reality regarding the timing and other nuances. </p></div></article>
