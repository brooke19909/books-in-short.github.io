    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  This hotel has existed for over 35 years.  It was built in 1980.  But, since the last repair work was carried out in 2010, everything looks beautiful, new and modern.  This is one of the reasons why every year thousands of tourists come to Mercury 4 * (Bulgaria). </p><p>  Sunny Beach is the largest seaside resort in the east of the country.  It is located on the Black Sea bay, along the beach, which extends 10 kilometers into the distance. </p><p>  The nearest airport, located in Burgas, is about half an hour to drive.  A bus stop is located 100 meters from the hotel.  From there you can drive anywhere.  Even to the city of Nessebar, the old part of which is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p><p>  However, the hotel itself was located in a favorable tourist location.  The beach can be reached in a few minutes, as well as the city center.  At 200 meters from the hotel is the Mania Dance Club, Royal Beach Mall, and a little further - a water park.  In general, everyone will find where to walk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Mercury 4 * (Bulgaria, Sunny Beach) is a hotel focused on comfortable rest of guests.

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The vast majority of people come to Mercury 4 * (Bulgaria, Sunny Beach) to enjoy beach and sea activities.

Even a small water slide was installed for them.  And in general, as tourists who have been here assure, children's animation here is better than adult shows.

For adults, karaoke and sometimes dance evenings are organized once a week. </p>

Therefore, if you want to relax here, you need to reserve rooms in advance. </p><p>  Check-in starts at 14:00 and lasts until midnight.  In any case, it should be so.  But, as the guests here said, if tourists arrived at the hotel earlier, then they can arrange them without waiting for 14:00.  But only if there are rooms free from guests.  And the departure lasts until noon.  Return flights should be ordered, taking into account this fact. </p><p>  With children, as mentioned above, you can live here.  Many with them go to Sunny Beach.  The reviews left by tourists make sure that this is the right decision.  But you just need to know that the hotel does not provide cots.

    <h2>  Tourists about the resort </h2><p>  People who have visited a place like Sunny Beach leave very positive reviews.  Everything is fine here.  First of all, tourists note the excellent transport connection in the form of buses that go to various directions.  Even to Elenite and Burgas can be reached by taxi.  And you do not need to wait long for it - buses run every 2 minutes. </p><p>  Another highlight of the resort is the beaches.  Clean, with pleasant golden sand, umbrellas and sun loungers.  Although they can not be used - just lay a towel and rest like that.  By the way, you can swim without fear.  On the beach, if anything, lifeguards are on duty.  And they really are on duty, and not sitting for a look.  Moreover, if someone does not obey the ban on swimming (this happens during periods of strong waves) - they are "caught" by force from the water. </p><p>  In general, everyone who was here assures us that lovers of fun should go here.  Sunny Beach never sleeps.  Except for the holiday season.  And in the summer and in the spring nightlife is seething here.  We especially love Sunny Beach for young people who sleep during the day, and with the onset of sunset they go out to conquer entertainment establishments. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  And now you can return to the topic of the hotel.  Or rather, to the staff.  In the hotel, as mentioned above, people work, trying to do everything for their client.  Rooms are cleaned daily, replacing towels.  Linen is laid fresh every three days. </p><p>  I am glad that there are ashtrays on the balcony, and in the bathroom - shampoos and gels.  Maids, by the way, do not take tips if you leave them in the room - even if in the most prominent place, on the bed.  If you want to reward them, then you need to hand the money directly into your hands. </p>

    <h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  As you could already understand, everyone is satisfied with the Mercury Sunny <span>Beach 4 *</span> hotel <span>(Bulgaria, Sunny Beach)</span> .  However, this is not surprising.  The apartments are spacious, comfortable - it‚Äôs nice to be in these.  Of course, some say that it would not hurt to make the hotel even more modern, but you need to understand that the price is fully consistent with the quality.  Yes, the apartment does not have a plasma TV, but who needs it at all on vacation? </p><p>  But right at the exit of the hotel there is a store in which the lowest prices are available throughout Sunny Beach.  Souvenirs and cosmetics should be taken only there. </p><p>  And there are not many Russians in the hotel.  Mostly British and Germans.  But in general, the contingent is pleasant and calm.  The only thing - next to the hotel there is a noisy casino where all the fun begins closer to midnight.  Therefore, if you want silence, you need to ask for a room with a different look.  Or close the balcony for the night.  The rest of the hotel is a perfect combination of price and quality.  It is worth coming here to rest and check this fact yourself. </p>
