Sony Xperia V: phone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Smartphones are a real symbol of modernity, and many can no longer imagine life without them.  About a year and a half ago, the <span>Sony Xperia</span> V came out, which at that time quickly became the flagship model.  What kind of <span>reviews</span> did he deserve <span>?</span>  <span>Sony Xperia</span> V is one of those smartphones that has been stably under the Christmas trees for two years in a row.  This fact alone speaks volumes. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reviews sony xperia v" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/460950.jpg" width="596"></div></h2><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  This component is most often awarded praise.  Everything is fine with the phone: 4.3 inches, resolution 1280 x 720, which at that time was considered a very good indicator, and even today the smartphone does not look like an anachronism.  Users really like the Sensor on lens option, thanks to which the display has significantly increased viewing angles.  Mobile Bravia Engine 2 technology, which was perfected in this model, makes the picture even more realistic.  Many buyers say that this option was the reason for the purchase, since none of the competitors had such a high-quality image. </p><h2>  Moisture protection </h2><p>  More precisely, protection not only from moisture, but also from dust.  This option has earned numerous accolades.  <span>Sony Xperia</span> V is the gadget that you can safely take to the beach with you.  Users note that with it you can not be afraid to get in the rain;  the phone may lie a couple of hours in the sand, but dust will not get inside the case.  If your smartphone gets dirty, you can easily wash it right under running water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  LTE </h2>

It can function in the following ranges: I, III, V, VII and XX.  Please note that in any case, you will need a special SIM card.  Many buyers swore for a long time with technical support, not having the slightest idea about this nuance.

    <h2>  Little trick </h2><p>  Experienced users have discovered one feature that is not documented in the normal manual.  By entering the combination * # * # 4636 # * # *, you can set LTE only in the settings, as a result of which the device turns into a great access point.  If you are in a large city where there is already a fourth-generation network, do not miss the opportunity to experience all its advantages! </p><p>  This feature is especially valuable for those people who are often on business trips. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  This item also earned good reviews.  Sony Xperia V was not without reason a hit of sales.  Even today, buyers often pay attention to its beauty.  The concave lid looks fresh and unusual, distinguishing it from the pile of the same type of flat "bricks" that have flooded the world market today.  In addition, seasoned gadget lovers note that the release of this model was the milestone from which Sony completely abandoned the buttons on the front panel: since then they completely moved directly to the display. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, reducing the number of buttons does not always cause delight of buyers.  Alas, due to the disappearance of the mechanical camera button, you now have to use the application icon on the display, as a result of which it is quite possible not to have time to make a successful shot.  The connectors here are also not enough - microUSB and a 3.5 mm jack for headphones.  Actually, this smartphone Sony Xperia V is different from contemporaries, who often also have an HDMI port. </p>

However, to <span>each his own.</span>  If you are constantly in nature, then these features are by no means called disadvantages.

    <p>  A powerful aluminum edge around the perimeter of the case not only adds a certain charm to the smartphone, but also makes it much stronger.  In any case, it was she who deserved excellent reviews: the Sony Xperia V may fall from a decent height, but there will not be a single crack or deep scratch on the case. </p><h2>  Insides </h2><p>  Oddly enough, but many buyers for a long time had no idea that they had purchased a device protected from moisture.  The stubs are still not talking about anything: they were still on the antediluvian Samsung X100.  And under the lid everything looks quite ordinary. </p><p>  This is exactly what the main ‚Äútrick‚Äù of Sony Xperia V is: the review shows that this is only a decorative surface, and all ‚Äúoffal‚Äù are protected by a non-removable waterproof plate.  In addition, a rubber gasket runs along the curb of the back cover, which is a reliable barrier to dirt and dust. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  On board this smartphone is the most powerful chip in this line: Qualcomm 8960 Snapdragon S4, paired with a dual-core processor with a frequency of 1.5GHz, Krait.  Of course, 1 GB RAM is not enough today, but none of the users complained about the interface or application brakes.  The internal memory has 8 gigabytes.  In addition, Micro SD cards up to 32 GB are supported. </p>

The settings are factory, so you don‚Äôt need to ‚Äútwist‚Äù it yourself.

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  Further we learn about Sony Xperia V: the review should be continued, telling about the software component of this phone. </p><p>  Initially, it was sold Android 4.0.4, but today the version can be updated, since the manufacturer has traditionally been distinguished by a long support for its gadgets.  In addition, Sony Xperia V, whose firmware is somewhat outdated, today has a bunch of unofficial custom mods, among which it is easy to choose your own. </p><p>  Experienced users indicate that this is the first smartphone in which the company has seriously moved away from the traditional purpose of the buttons on the menu. </p><p>  So, the Menu button has been replaced by a widget, when clicked, a list of the most recently launched applications is called up.  This decision was not dictated by any internal disagreements in the company, but by the basic requirements of Android.  The decision is controversial, but almost all pretty quickly get used to it.  Most likely, precisely because of the features of this OS, Sony at one time chose to abandon the support of mechanical buttons. </p><p>  As we have already said, the characteristics of the available hardware are quite enough for comfortable work and relaxation.  Nothing slows down and does not freeze.  This Sony Xperia V phone is different from many modern models. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone sony xperia v" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/460946.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Preset Application Suite </h2><p>  It is gratifying that in our century, when every significant company creates its own shells for Android (almost always causing a desire to ‚Äúdemolish them‚Äù), there are still companies that are approaching customization wisely.  In any case, Sony‚Äôs own interface has not only been living for its fourth year, but also has a bunch of fans.  In addition, users are pleased with the pre-installed sets of applications in the company's smartphones. </p><p>  Of course, there is the ubiquitous Facebook, a decent set of games and other entertainment programs.  The selection is good: nothing is annoying, and everything works perfectly with the usual Android utilities. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Interestingly, it was this manufacturer who at one time began to actively promote Play Movies and Play Books.  Yes, yes, Sony actually stood at the origins of Google‚Äôs decision to start selling not only applications, but also other content.  So, users at one time enthusiastically read free Pushkin, Gogol, Dostoevsky.  However, there is still no need to pay for the books of these writers, and in other cases there are free passages to familiarize yourself with the work. </p>

Not necessarily New Year's - such a phone will be happy to receive at any time of the year.
