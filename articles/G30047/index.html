The option is effective immediately after crossing the state border.  It is important to know that by day we mean the time from 00.00 to 23.59.  This fact must be taken into account if the subscriber is in a different time zone.  Other options that are aimed at modifying calls do not interact with this tariff when in roaming.  In other words, the subscriber will not be able to connect services that reduce the cost of outgoing calls.  However, the user can enjoy free incoming calls, which is a big advantage.  The option "World without borders" can be connected both for individuals and corporate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newsroom.mastercard.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Service activation" class="if uuid-3013902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3013902.jpg"></div><p>  If the subscriber has disabled the option "World without Borders", then the service can be activated only on the next day according to Moscow time.  In the event that mobile communication is carried out through special equipment, the tariff is suspended.  The service has no time limit, and if necessary, the option can be quickly disabled. </p><h2>  Payment in roaming </h2><p>  The World Without Borders service implies a daily subscription fee.  At the same time, the mobile operator provided the following possibilities to replenish the balance: </p><ul><li>  payment by credit card; </li><li>  function "promised payment"; </li><li>  option "pay for me"; </li><li>  service from the operator "credit of trust"; </li></ul><p>  The cost of one incoming minute costs no more than 1 ruble, so communication is provided almost for free.  Outgoing calls are paid according to the full tariff plan.  Free minutes are provided once a day at 00.00 Moscow time. </p><h2>  Customer Reviews </h2><p>  In order to form an objective idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis service, you can read user reviews.  Many note that the option "World without borders" provides excellent quality of communication in roaming.  However, the cost of this service is quite high.  As an indisputable advantage, they can save a mobile number without changing a SIM card.  The operator provides a high level of communication at any time and anywhere, as evidenced by the numerous positive reviews of users of this service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fromthelabbench.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="User reviews" class="if uuid-3013906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3013906.jpg"></div><p>  User reviews claim that the World Without Borders option saves money when roaming on incoming calls.  The main plus of this option is the provision of 30 free incoming calls that are valid in any country in the world.  However, subscribers warn that it is not necessary to go beyond the specified tariff, since exceeding 30 minutes of incoming calls will be charged according to the tariff in force in the host country.  This can lead to instant debit of funds from the account. </p><h2>  Brief conclusion </h2><p>  Employees of international companies, vacationers and travelers who travel outside the country make calls on special conditions.  Tariffs for communication services in some countries can quickly empty a user's personal account.
