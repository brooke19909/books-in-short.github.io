And who, if he hadn’t already watched, at least hadn’t heard of the film “A Nightmare on Elm Street” and his hero - Freddy Krueger!  This character is closely associated in the minds of many people with this particular holiday.  On Halloween, it is customary to dress up in fancy dress.  Buying them is often expensive, it’s much easier to make them yourself.  And <span>how to make a Freddy</span> Krueger <span>mask</span> at home? </p><h2>  Halloween story </h2><p>  Halloween comes from Celtic history.  It is traditionally celebrated on October 31, or rather, on the night of November 31 to November 1.  It is believed that all witches, sorcerers and other evil spirits arrange a coven on this night, which is why it is customary to dress up in eerie costumes and paint your face with cuts and bruises.  Another name for the holiday is the eve of All Saints Day, originally it was worship and honoring the dead.  The Celts had no doubt that on this day their souls visited living people, tried to appease the dead with refreshments.  From here came the expression “Muck or sweetness,” saying, if you don’t give me something tasty, I’ll let you spoil something.  Today it is popular among children who, dressed in fancy dress, go home, asking for gifts. </p>

Freddy Krueger is his main character.  This is a disfigured man in a striped sweater and with blades on his fingers, who kills his victims at night.  For the first time, the role was played by actor Robert Englund, then - Jackie Earl Haley. </p>

It is not so difficult to make his costume.  The main attributes are a striped sweater and a <span>black hat.</span>  Here you have to tinker with the mask.  It’s important to understand: Freddy Krueger is not a bunny or a cat whose mask can be cut out of paper.  It's more about makeup ...

    <h2>  Freddy Krueger mask: make up </h2><p>  The character's face in the film was frightening - terrible burns disfigured him.  To achieve this effect, you can use the usual foundation - it will become the basis of makeup.  With a sufficient amount of tonal, you need to combine gouache (not liquid!) Of red and yellow (or orange) colors, mix thoroughly and leave to dry.  When the mixture thickens, you need to pour a little vegetable oil into it and mix again.  Such a composition is safe for the skin and should not lead to an allergic reaction.  It should be applied not with a thin, but not with a thick layer, simultaneously creating bulges, roughness and roughness on the skin, so that you get a feeling of a charred face.  Top makeup needs to be powdered - either with baby talcum powder or regular powder. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

It must first be moistened with any special tonic or lotion, and on top of a thin layer, spread glue for false eyelashes.  Previously, you should take ordinary white napkins and tear them into small pieces.  These patches must then be pressed onto the face smeared with glue, while making bumps, as if from burns.  When everything dries, you need to paint over the “burns” with foundation and dark red (or <span>burgundy) lipstick.</span>  In some places you can apply a bright red lipstick to create the impression of fresh blood.  Eyes and eyelids should be densely circled in black.

    <p>  There is also such a wonderful thing as face painting.  With it, you can also depict anything on your face, including Freddy Krueger's mask.  Face painting is sold in specialized stores for creativity.  In addition to it, you will also need a foundation, powder, red lipstick and, of course, brushes (sponges) for drawing. </p><h2>  Silicone mask Freddy Krueger </h2><p>  Buying a similar one in the store is not difficult.  She, of course, looks really terrifying, especially if done qualitatively.  But, as a rule, the high cost of such products rolls over, so you can try to make a silicone mask yourself, but you need to remember that this is a rather painstaking and difficult process. </p>

To do this, the “experimental rabbit” must lie on a flat horizontal surface.  Hair must be removed from the forehead, temples, ears, it is desirable to cover them altogether (you can use a hat for the pool), otherwise they can quietly get into the silicone mass and freeze with it.  Face skin should be generously smeared with a special release cream so that then the dried mask can be easily removed.  According to the instructions, silicone needs to be diluted (it is necessary to purchase a two-component platinum-based material that is harmless to the skin) and use a thin, comfortable brush to apply it on the face.  Extremely careful to act near the mouth, nose, eyes (they must be closed!) And eyebrows (it is also advisable to cover them).  Leave to solidify.  After drying, a bandage divided into pieces (chopped, torn - it does not matter) is uniformly applied to the mask, on top of which it is necessary to apply gypsum, diluted to the consistency of sour cream.  Leave it to solidify for about half an hour.  Then carefully take the casts.

    <p>  Using acrylic paints, the finished mask can be painted as you wish (or as required by design).  Once the mask of Freddy Krueger is being prepared, then you should draw terrible scars and burns.  It is important not to forget to make and cuts for the eyes.  To make the face under the mask “breathe”, you can attach a fabric lining from the inside.  The product is attached to the face with rubber bands or glue.  Before putting on the mask, it is advisable to let it stand for a couple of days. </p><h2>  Paper or cardboard mask </h2><p>  If a person who makes Freddy Krueger’s costume knows how to draw, then he can do the usual paper mask.  The measurements are taken from the face, the oval of the required size is drawn on paper (or cardboard, or whatman paper), cuts are made in it for the nostrils and eyes, holes on the side for the elastic, which the mask will be attached to the head, and then it is painted in the likeness of a photograph of a movie character.  DIY Freddy Krueger mask made of paper! </p><p>  By and large, it is not so important whether you know how to draw, whether you are good at sculpting and so on.  If anyone - whether creating a Freddy Krueger mask or making cinnamon rolls - is approached with soul and inspiration, then the result will certainly surprise not only the author, but also those around you!  And this is the most important thing. </p>
