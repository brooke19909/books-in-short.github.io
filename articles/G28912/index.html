Before its construction, it was only necessary to leave the railway station, as soon as shouts were heard, calling for buses to different regions of the country.  A new bus station appeared in the city, and it was all over.  Kiev breathed a sigh of relief, and the people in need of such vehicles moved to another place. </p><h2>  Where is the main bus station of the capital of Ukraine </h2><p>  It is located at a distance of 318 meters from the Demievskaya metro station.  So, if you suddenly need to come to the Central Bus Station (Kiev), his address is: Moscow Square, 3. Thanks to the help of the metro of the capital, do not be afraid to get lost.  Five minutes on foot - and you in the subway, or vice versa, left the subway, five minutes passed - and already in place.  In the building of the bus station, everything is done as expected: ticket offices for the sale of (preliminary) tickets, cameras work where you can store luggage, a first-aid post, mother and child rooms, a toilet, a waiting room, an electronic board with available seats and a bus departure schedule.  If you want to eat, you can contact the fast food restaurant, which is located nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bus station Kiev" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/768182.jpg" width="400"></div>  It was built in 1957-1961.  It is designed on the basis that it will send 600 flights and seven thousand passengers daily.  The <span>Central Bus Station (Kiev) is</span> located next to a large transport interchange.  Here converge: <span>Druzhby Narodov</span> Boulevard (from here you can get to the left bank of the Dnieper), Krasnozvezdniy Prospekt (from the Solomensky district), 40th Anniversary Boulevard (it leads to the Teremki district) and the latter - Science Avenue.  From here, to the very center of Kiev - Maidan Nezalezhnosti - can be reached by metro in seven minutes, except for the time for descent to the metro and climb.

Let's continue.  Firstly, this bus station is a complex of the highest category, which has a group of buildings and service points designed for boarding and disembarking passengers, a parking area for those who are expecting a flight, as well as all that we have already called.  It also provides services for sending the necessary correspondence, other useful little things, for example, paying for mobile communications, selling souvenirs, etc. The central bus station (Kiev) was built in the spirit of the Soviet era.  The architects who planned the construction are E. Belsky, I.N. Melnik, A. Miletsky.  The premises of the bus station were decorated by artists A.F. Rybachuk and <span>V.V. Melnichenko with</span> ceramic mosaic panels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bus station central kiev" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/768180.jpg" width="600"></div>  In the main building of the station there are ticket offices for the sale, booking and exchange of tickets.  It provides services not only for its citizens, but also for citizens of several European countries.  Nearby is an enterprise that is very well known in Ukraine: Karl Marx, and a company store where passengers can spend comfortable shopping in between flights.

    <h2>  Central Bus Station, Kiev.  How to get there </h2><p>  To get to this transport center of the capital of Ukraine, using city transport, you can use buses, minibuses, and trolleybuses.  But for us, the most interesting way is to get to the <span>Kiev Metro,</span> especially from the railway station, because it is there that people come most often.  From the Vokzalnaya station, you reach Khreschatyk, then go to the Maidan Nezalezhnosti station and arrive where you need to go to the Demievskaya station.  The whole journey will take 20-25 minutes, this is taking into account the rise and descent into the subway.  For comparison: opposite the main entrance to the railway station, you can take the shuttle bus No. 539. The journey will take a maximum of 20 minutes, but this is only if there are no traffic jams. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  That is, if your time is not limited, then take the minibus, otherwise we advise you not to risk it - go by subway.  From here, from the railway station, you can also take bus number 5. It leaves from the same place as the minibus, but rarely.  Rides, if there is no traffic jam, 20 minutes.  And another five minutes you need to spend from Izyumskaya street to the bus station.  The option is beneficial if you have large bags. </p><h2>  Flights from Kiev bus station and the question of its abolition </h2><p>  This station sends a lot of flights domestic (in Ukrainian cities) and international, including to European countries.  The following destinations are most popular: Belarus, Spain, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Austria, Hungary, Estonia, Lithuania, Moldova, France, Russia, Greece, Italy, Germany and Poland.  Ticket offices where you can purchase tickets are located in the main hall, and there are also ticket offices of carriers.  In 2013, the issue of the abolition of this transport facility was raised. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bus station kiev phone" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/768179.jpg" width="600"></div>  It was planned to close the Central bus station (Kiev) and transfer part of the passenger flow to other Kiev bus stations.  For example, the bus station on the Teremki, which was then being built, was to become part of its receiver, at the same time, it was planned to build several more similar ones on the outskirts of the capital.  But <span>these plans were</span> suspended for well-known reasons, and now their perspective is unknown.  More on this in the next section.

    <h2>  Will there be a new bus station in Kiev </h2><p>  Back in 2013, they planned to open a new bus station in the capital.  In this case, Kiev would noticeably unload from transport in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Demievskaya metro station.  ‚ÄúTeremki‚Äù are located on Odessa Square.  The bus station is 97% ready for opening, it remains only to bring the building into a state of full operational readiness.  In the meantime, it stands, fenced with barbed wire and a fence.  In order to finish all the work, 5.5 million hryvnias were needed, and it would be possible to transfer the object to the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bus station kiev address" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/768178.jpg" width="600"></div>  The bus station would be even better in capacity than the current one: a two-story building that will house ticket offices, a large waiting room, a mother and child room, a cafe, a first-aid post and a police station.  Now 213, and after the full completion of 400 buses per day, and it is planned to service 8.5 thousand people.  It is technically possible to receive the passenger flow of all Kiev railway stations - "Summer", "Southern" and "Central".
