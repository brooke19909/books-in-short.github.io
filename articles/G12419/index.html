  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a dinosaur out of paper: two ways</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sometimes it becomes unclear why these ancient dinosaurs attract children.  Perhaps your child became interested in these unusual creatures.  Try to make an interesting craft together with him, and for this, first check out how to make a dinosaur out of paper. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a dinosaur out of paper" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10712/406491.jpg" width="353"></div></h2><h2>  Craft options and necessary materials </h2><p>  This article provides two options for making a paper dinosaur figure.  Consider a detailed phased description of each of the technologies.  For origami-style crafts, you need to use fairly thick colored paper.  It is desirable that it is the same on both sides.  This condition must be observed, since in finished products (both origami and simplified models) all facets of the material are visible.  And it will not be very beautiful if the craft is not everywhere painted. </p><p>  For the second model, you will need colored cardboard, scissors, glue, a simple pencil, felt-tip pens or <span>colored pencils</span> and brads (rotational elements). </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY paper dinosaur" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10712/406490.jpg" width="265"></div></h2><h2>  The first step on how to make a dinosaur out of paper </h2><p>  So, let's get to work.  Each of the items described below has its own picture, which clearly demonstrates the whole process of how a dinosaur is made of paper with his own hands.  Follow the instructions, following all the steps as accurately as possible: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Take a square piece of paper for work and fold it diagonally.  Position the workpiece in front of you, turning in the form of a rhombus, taking into account the horizontal direction of the fold line. </li><li>  Bring the upper and lower corners to the middle and fold so that the left faces of the square are closed on a diagonal line.  Repeat for the right planes. </li><li>  Lift the right planes superimposed from above, turning them slightly and leading the left sides out. </li><li>  As a result, the edges will be located "house".  Bend them in the left direction, and then wrap the entire workpiece 19 ¬∞ around its horizontal axis. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper origami dinosaurs" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10712/406492.jpg" width="232"></div></h2><h2>  The second stage, how to make a dinosaur out of paper </h2><p>  Having received the preliminary blank, you now need to turn it into a figure similar to a dinosaur. </p><ul><li>  Expand the layout in front of you so that the craft resembles a triangle.  Lift the right sharp corner up and at the same time immerse part of the paper blank to the left. </li><li>  The result is improvised wings and the upper body of a dinosaur.  Draw a diagonal fold at approximately 1/3 of the neck height.  By bending the paper along this line, tilt your head forward. </li><li>  Form the nose of the pangolin by pressing a sharp corner inward (see enlarged image). </li><li>  Bend the edges of the wings by folding the paper corners a bit obliquely.  Make the tail by introducing the part inside the craft and bending it for clarity.  Draw a felt-tip pen on the eyes.  This will give the craft completeness. </li></ul><p>  Having familiarized yourself with how to make an origami paper dinosaur, you can try your hand at making other models. </p><h2>  Making a movable dinosaur layout from paper </h2><p>  Of course, very original crafts can be made using the art of origami.  Dinosaurs can also be made out of paper by combining individual parts.  To do this, draw the details: a large oval (trunk), two squares (legs) rounded at the corners, a long wide tail and a neck with a head (like a giraffe).  Let these parts be, say, green.  Then, to shape the legs, cut a few small rectangles, for example, orange.  Stick them on the bottom as <span>claws.</span>  <span>From paper of</span> the same color, make small triangles (‚Äúmane‚Äù along the ridge) and glue it along the upper line of the body.  Gather all the cut out details to form a dinosaur mockup.  In brackets, install brads.  Draw the eye with a felt-tip pen or colored pencils.  A simple craft with rotating parts is ready.  Preschool children will surely like it. </p>
