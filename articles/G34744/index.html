    <h2>  Geographical Description </h2><p>  Within the Moscow Upland, the Klyazma River originates.  The map shows that its source is located near the city of Solnechnogorsk.  Then the <span>river flows</span> in a southeast direction, along the territory of Moscow (Khimki urban district).  Her path continues along the border of the Molzhaninovsky district of the capital, near the village of Cherkizova turns east.  The riverbanks in the upper reaches are high, the valley is quite narrow.  At the Klyazma reservoir, the width is 12 meters.  The river flows through the Pirogovskoe and Klyazma reservoirs, where it mixes with the Volga.  Downstream, the flow is regulated, the width near the Klyazma railway platform is 20 meters.  The water stream runs along the <span>Meshchera lowland,</span> in this place the right bank is much lower than the left.  Klyazma is a deep and wide river.  In Noginsk its shores are at a distance of 50 meters from each other, in Vladimir - 130 meters.  In some places, the width is 200 meters.  The depth is shallow, the maximum value is 8 meters, usually 1-2 meters.  The bottom of Klyazma is clayey, mostly sandy.  In some places, limestone strata cut through the river. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Using </h2><p>  Klyazma is a river with which the development of the entire north-eastern part of Russia is connected, starting from the 12th century, from the period of the Vladimir-Suzdal principality.  In those days, the river was navigable along its entire length.  Even before the Slavic settlement, the Klyazma-Skhodnya-Moscow trade route provided for the economic development of the region.  With the advent of various crafts in the 17th century, many ceramic, textile and paper industries appeared on the river, first handicraft, and then factory and factory. </p><p>  In the 20th century, in 1937, the construction of the canal was completed.  Moscow, in the upper river was blocked by the Pirogov dam, and the Klyazma reservoir was formed.  Water flow through dams became regulated and began to be fed by the Volga and rivers of the northern part of the Moscow region.  In 1941, two hydroelectric power stations began to be erected on Klyazma, however, with the outbreak of war, their construction was stopped.  In the last century, in the 70s, a construction project was presented for consideration on the outskirts of the capital of the Eastern Shipping Canal. </p><p>  At present, the river in its lower and middle reaches provides water for various industries and residents of numerous settlements.  Klyazma is navigable at a distance of 267 kilometers, from its mouth to the city of Vladimir, it is used for the transport of goods by barges.  In the middle reaches, navigation is limited by a rocky bottom and a shallow depth of the section between Mster and Kovrov.  There is a cargo port (Vyazniki) on the river and there is an old shipyard in Gorokhovets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Waterworks </h2><p>  There are many <span>hydraulic structures</span> on the Klyazma River <span>.</span>  Several dams were built: in the Solnechnogorsk district (Lunevo village), in the village of Pirogovsky, in the city of Korolev, in the village of Tarasovka, in the villages of Obukhov and Sverdlovsky, in the vicinity of the city of Shchelkovo (village of Amerovo).  The concrete dam in Noginsk deserves a separate discussion.  Its height is 2.5 meters.  It is equipped with a coastal spillway and six adjustable spillways. </p><p>  On Klyazma there are several water and sewer systems: Orekhovo-Zuevskaya, Pavlovo-Posadskaya, Noginskaya, Obukhovskaya, Shchelkovo.  In addition, in the Moscow region there is ongoing hydrological monitoring by the departments of the Moscow Center for Environmental Monitoring and Hydrometeorology.  There are three hydrochemical points: in Pavlovsky Posad, Schelkovo and Orekhovo-Zuev. </p>

    <h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  A great place for fishing lovers is the Klyazma River.  Fishing in these places is wonderful.  Almost all representatives of the river fauna of the central part of the country are found in the waters.  The most catching time is spring.  It was then that schools of fish began to sail into the river from the reservoir.  In the spring, an ide is caught in the wiring, pike and perch are caught in spinning, and the scavenger and roach are caught in float gear and snacks.  In summer there is an opportunity to catch asp, common carp, silver bream, crucian carp, carp, tench.  Burbot is caught between the bottom driftwood.  The rarest and most valuable prey on Klyazma is sterlet. </p>

    <h2>  Horseshoes </h2><p>  A map of the Vladimir region indicates that Klyazma flows through its territory mainly through fields, only occasionally there are dense forests on its way.  Soil on the shores in the area consists of sand and clay.  There are a lot of steep steep rocks and sandy braids on the river, Klyazma likes to loop and wash in various interesting places.  ‚ÄúHorseshoe‚Äù is a curious phenomenon that happens when a river suddenly turns around 180 degrees and starts to flow in the opposite direction.  Distances between the channels of the same river can reach kilometers.  Then two streams gradually connect with each other and form a picturesque island.  This is a very beautiful picture.  In addition, such places are very rich in different fish.  First, an asp is settled in them, then zander and pike take the place.  Then, among the washed sand spits with picturesque snags, catfish and burbot begin to come across.  Almost all fish appear in water with a clear, not overgrown with bottom vegetation: perch, roach, chub, garter, scavenger, etc. Over time, the horseshoe grows in grass, becomes swampy, but more than a dozen years must pass.  In the early years of its existence, such a place is a true paradise for a fishing enthusiast. </p>
