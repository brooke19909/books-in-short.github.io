But there is a place on earth where not only the attributes of the socialist past are not destroyed, but, on the contrary, they are carefully guarded.  We are talking about the town of Sillamae in Estonia.  Everything here - the architecture of buildings, the design of streets and squares, the atmosphere itself - seemed to freeze somewhere at the turn of the 60s of the 20th century.  Many tourists specially come to Sillamae to plunge into the already irretrievably lost microclimate of those times in which there was not only bad, but also a lot of good.  However, this amazingly cute town attracts not only with the preserved corner of our history, but also with its wonderful beaches, beautiful waterfalls, and the true hospitality of the inhabitants.  We invite you to take a fascinating virtual tour of it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sillam√§e Estonia" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1912505.jpg" width="493"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The narrow strip on the <span>shores of the Gulf of Finland</span> stretches the charming, unusually quiet and calm, which offers relaxation and inspiration to the city of Sillamae.  Estonia is a Baltic country that shares a border with Russia.  Before it, on the ideal highway, which the whole Baltic region is famous for, you can reach the house in half an hour, since it will be necessary to overcome only a little more than 29 km.  Geographically, the town belongs to the Ida-Virumaa county, one of the most picturesque in the country.  An interesting fact - Sillamae is located somewhat closer to the Northern capital of Russia St. Petersburg, which is 170 km away than to the capital of the country Tallinn.  The distance to it is 186 km.  Of the largest cities in Estonia, Narva is closest to Sillamae.  This glorious city on the highway Tallinn - St. Petersburg is only 26 km away. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Located a little away from the tourist routes in Estonia Sillamae.  How to get to this town?  There are three options: </p><p>  1. On the water.  There is a seaport in the infrastructure of Sillamae, where a modern comfortable ferry goes every day from the Russian port, located in the village of Ust-Luga.  Unfortunately, he does not take ‚Äúhorseless‚Äù passengers, only car owners.  For traveling around Estonia by car, this is perhaps the most profitable option, allowing you to skip the border without waiting in line. </p><p>  2. By land.  The fastest option is to get to Sillamae by bus.  The town has its own small bus station, combined with a gas station.  You can get from Narva in 40 minutes, from Tallinn in 3 hours. </p><p>  3. Drive a diesel train.  The main inconvenience in this case is that you have to do a transplant, since the closest to Sillamae.  The station is located in Vaivar.  From there you have to go either by bus or by taxi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sillam√§e city Estonia" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1912512.jpg" width="485"></div>

    <h2>  Pre-revolutionary history of the town </h2><p>  Relentless chronicles testify that in 1502 a tavern was opened in the small settlement of Sillamae under the sign ‚ÄúTor Bruggen‚Äù.  What she was famous for, they can tell in the city museum.  It is located in the central square, works all week, except Monday and Sunday.  In 1600, a solid bridge was erected in the settlement, a mill was built, about which there are also records.  But this settlement became more famous during the Northern War, which also affected Sillamae.  Estonia has not always been an independent state.  At the beginning of the 18th century, it became part of Russia after the victory of Russian troops over the Swedes.  In 1704, defensive redoubts were built near Sillamae by order of Peter the Great.  Now it is reminded of by the Swedish Wall, located between Sillamae and Sinim√§e.  And although no military operations took place directly on it, a hiking trail was laid along the rampart, which is a local attraction.  Walking through it will be interesting to everyone who came to Sillamae.  Before the revolution, the Russian intelligentsia was very fond of visiting this town.  Here in 1869 the famous Peter Tchaikovsky drew inspiration.  And no less famous physiologist Pavlov came here on vacation 25 years in a row, starting in 1891. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in Sillamae Estonia" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1912574.jpg" width="480"></div>

In 1928, a port, a power station and a plant were built here, which began to process oil shale.  At first, the plant was engaged in the distillation of shale oil supplied from Kohtl, but soon they began to implement their developments.  Sillamae gradually from the seaside resort became an industrial center.  During the years of fascist occupation, German authorities redesigned the plant to produce special fuel for submarines.  They also engaged in the repair of tanks.  After the war in 1946, a metallurgical plant appeared in Sillamae, which had then the status of a settlement, at which shale ores were processed into uranium.  The village was closed and classified.  He received the code name Narva 10. In 1957 he was given the status of "city".  In 1991, the mysterious plant was declassified, it began to deal with rare earth metals.  After Estonia regained independence, the plant was closed.  Now in Sillamae there are two repositories of radioactive substances, but numerous measurements show that the radiation background is within acceptable limits.  The sculpture of a worker with a peaceful atom in his hands recalls the period of secrecy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sillamae Estonia photo" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1912506.jpg" width="491"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sillamae now </h2><p>  You can call the unique town of Sillamae.  Estonia is a somewhat conservative country.  Here, great emphasis is placed on national traditions, customs and language, and in Sillamae almost everyone speaks Russian.  According to the latest census, only 4.8% of Estonians live here, and 87.5% of Russians.  But not only this is famous for Sillamae.  Here they decided not to change the appearance of the city center, but to leave it as it was in the era of Stalin!  The idea paid off.  Now most tourists come here to plunge into the atmosphere that reigned in this region more than 70 years ago, to walk along the quiet cozy streets, to admire the buildings built in the post-war period.  The current status of Sillamae is ‚Äúa city of fresh sea breezes‚Äù.  This phrase can be understood literally, since in the Gulf of Finland sea winds blow quite often.  But the status can be interpreted as follows: "a city open to all good people, a city in which good changes are taking place."  ‚ÄúSillam√§e‚Äù can be translated from Estonian as ‚Äúbridge‚Äù and ‚Äúmountain‚Äù.  These symbols are depicted on the city emblem and flag.  They are yellow in color, which means the golden sands of the shores of the bay, and the blue background represents the blue of the sea. </p><h2>  Climate features </h2><p>  The proximity of the Gulf of Finland has a decisive influence on the weather in Sillamae.  Estonia is located in the temperate zone, where it is relatively cool in summer and warm enough in winter.  In Sillam√§e, the features of the marine climate are felt even more significantly.  In winter, it is extremely rare that the air temperature drops to -10 ¬∞ C.  More often the thermometer column is kept within -3 ¬∞ C -6 ¬∞ C.  In the summer, there is no special heat in the city.  Basically, the air temperature is around + 20-23 ¬∞ C.  The water of the bay near the coast warms up only by July.  Then its temperature can be around + 22 ¬∞ C.  However, by September it drops to + 19 ¬∞ C.  That is, swimming here is comfortable only in July and in August. </p><p>  You cannot call very rainy weather in Sillamae.  A lot of precipitation falls here only in winter.  In the remaining months, sunny days alternate with rainy and cloudy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sillam√§e Estonia Attractions" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1912508.jpg" width="482"></div>

    <h2>  What to see </h2><p>  Estonia is proud of many interesting tourist sites.  Sights in Sillamae - this is the preserved atmosphere of the Stalin era.  In the city center, almost every building can impress with architectural ensembles, stucco moldings and pilasters that characterize the style of Stalin's neoclassicism.  By the way, the houses here are mostly two-story.  In the new districts of the city there are no sky-high skyscrapers either, all buildings are at most 6 floors high.  Walking around the historic center of Sillamae, you must definitely see the town square.  It is located on a terrace made on a high <span>seashore,</span> and is all buried in flowers.  It houses the House of Culture, built in 1948, and the house of city government.  It is built in the form of the town hall, which always attracts tourists.  Noteworthy is the Rodina Cinema, erected in 1955.  Previously, its interior was decorated with crystal chandeliers and beautiful panels, on the second floor there was a restaurant with live music, and in the basement there was a shooting gallery.  The staircase leading from the town square to Mere Boulevard, which descends to the Gulf of Finland, reminds of past times.  It is decorated with numerous huge flowerpots with flowers.  There are two new churches in the city, one is the Orthodox Kazan Icon of the Mother of God, built in 1995, and the second is the Catholic church of Saints George and Adalbert, erected in 2001. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sillamae Estonia stores" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1912500.jpg" width="476"></div>
