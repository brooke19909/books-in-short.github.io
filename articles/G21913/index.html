This is due not so much to the fact that this is one of the few countries in the world where residents have the right to personal opinions and freedom of choice of sexual orientation, but to the fact that the entertainment industry here is aimed at obtaining maximum emotional impressions. </p><p>  Regardless of whether there is an introduction of elephants, a transvestite cabaret or a Siam Niramit show, they show the incredible ability to work, talent and love of Thais for their work and traditions. </p><h2>  Phuket Show </h2><p>  Thais are a completely extraordinary people who do the most incredible things with their lifestyle or work.  For example, one of the best resorts in the country - the island of Phuket, is famous for its many shows, in which a significant part of the population takes part. </p><p>  According to the reviews of vacationers, in Thailand they can appreciate the moments of life and make them as happy as possible, but for many foreigners, shows have been organized (for example, Siam Niramit), which should remove the burden of everyday stressful life. </p>

    <p>  Siam Niramit (Phuket) is a park where every guest can "try on" the customs of local residents, becoming a spectator of an elephant show or taking part in feeding animals.  What do tourists write in their reviews?  A visit to the ethnic village and the following folk dances, Thai boxing, the performance of <span>war elephants</span> to the sounds of drums - all this is perceived as the promised show of Siam Niramit, but the most grandiose spectacle is yet to come. </p><h2>  Submission to the show </h2><p>  The houses in the ethnic village are built in the style of the northern and southern provinces, each of which introduces the culture and customs of their inhabitants.  For example, in the huts of the ‚Äúnortherners‚Äù their national costumes are presented, which everyone can try on and take pictures of themselves.  Judging by the reviews, many park guests do this. </p><p>  At the ‚Äúsoutherners‚Äù, local craftsmen work in the houses, demonstrating their skills in various crafts.  Travelers can take silk, pottery, or fabric painting lessons.  Guests can enjoy the on-site restaurant, which serves Thai, Japanese, European and vegetarian dishes as a buffet.  It is designed to receive 1,200 clients at the same time, and the nearby theater venue allows you to enjoy food and at the same time watch performances by Thai artists and boxers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Everyone can take a short elephant ride, which in 10 minutes of an extraordinary trip will cost only 200 baht. </p><p>  After the guests got an idea about the life and traditions of the Thais, they are invited to the Siam Niramit (Phuket) show.  The reviews of those who visited him note that his only drawback is the ban on shooting and photographing. </p><p>  It is important to know: the violators of the ban will face an impressive fine, so telephones and other equipment that can be removed must be handed over before the start of the performance. </p><h2>  The first action of the play: 1st act </h2><p>  This theatrical performance is an exact repetition of a show held in Bangkok.  It consists of 3 actions, each of which is divided into several acts.  There is a kind of break between the actions, during which information on different screens is given in different languages, what the audience expects in the following scenes and what they are talking about. </p><p>  In the first action, the story is about 4 regions of Thailand and their history.  The story of the formation of the kingdom of Lanna is preceded by everything, namely, the time when peace and prosperity reigned in it. </p>

    <p>  The performance begins with a spectacular royal procession to the Buddha temple for worship and rituals.  The king of Lanna, accompanied by his faithful warriors and dancers carrying the gifts of Buddha, meets the queen to the sounds of war drums, and together they launch flying lanterns into the sky.  The first act ends with a sword dance with sabers. </p><h2>  2-4th acts </h2><p>  The second act of the play Siam Niramit is dedicated to cultural traditions that united 2 civilizations.  Events unfold on the market of the port city, located on the shores of the South Sea.

    <p>  In the third act, Isan, the north-eastern part of the country, appears before the audience.  The action is dedicated to the sermons that the Buddha brought to the people, accompanied by traditional songs and dances. </p><p>  The last act speaks of the life of the royal court and ordinary people during the so-called Golden Age in the central plain of Ayutthaya. </p><h2>  Second Action: Paradise and Hell </h2><p>  In this part of the show Siam Niramit (the photo below demonstrates this), the Thais reveal their beliefs and understanding of Hell, Paradise and something like Purgatory, called Himaphan (magic forest). </p><p>  This people believes in the existence of these places, which is probably why the performance in the 2nd part, although colorful, is very serious.  This is especially true for the punishments of sinners in Hell.  Paradise is headed by the supreme Thai god Indra, who looks at the world from the height of Mount Phra Sumeru, which the local population considers the center of the universe.  Surrounded by angels and other gods and goddesses, in the radiance of gold and the brilliance of diamonds, they meet the righteous and surround them with honors. </p><h2>  Himaphan </h2><p>  The magic forest, according to the belief of Thais, is on the verge of heaven and earth.  It is inhabited by mythical animals and gods.  In this scene, the actors depict the eternal struggle between the god of thunder and the goddess of lightning.  The treacherous Ramasuna longs to have lightning, therefore attacks Mekkhala, but she stops him by firing ‚Äúarrows‚Äù and sending heavy rain on him.  On stage, indeed, at this time rain poured and lightning flashed. </p>
