But there are so-called stationary cell phones.  In appearance, they are more likely similar to the classic wired models, as well as in the main controls.  They may be in demand, for example, by older people, for whom a cell phone in a modern format is unusual.  Or, as an option, in the office, which for some reason is not connected to land lines.  What are the main features of landline cell phones?  What models of the corresponding type of devices are popular in the Russian market? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="landline phones with a sim card" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1076497.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  What characteristics are most important when choosing a device? </h2><p>  We‚Äôll examine the characteristics of a SIM card phone when paying for it.  Of course, in some aspects, a <span>stationary GSM phone</span> with a SIM card is selected taking into account the subjective preferences of the user, for example, when it comes to the design of the device.  But if we talk about the most important characteristics of the device, then such modern experts single out the following list: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  number of supported GSM frequencies; </li><li>  sensitivity of the standard antenna; </li><li>  the presence of an external SMA antenna; </li><li>  display type, as well as its basic characteristics; </li><li>  Battery capacity; </li><li>  operating temperature range. </li></ul><p>  We study their specifics in more detail. </p><h2>  GSM support </h2><p>  As for the supported GSM frequencies, most of the stationary GSM phones available in the Russian market, one way or another, can work in the GSM 900/1800 standard.  Other frequencies are rarely used by leading mobile providers.  Therefore, with regard to this characteristic, almost any landline telephone with a SIM card sold in the Russian Federation will be practically guaranteed to meet the compatibility criteria with Russian GSM standards.  But if the device is bought abroad, for example, in an online store or at an auction, then it makes sense to pay attention to what frequencies it supports. </p><h2>  Antenna Specifications </h2><p>  Regarding the sensitivity parameters of the receiving module, it is desirable that they be at least 100 dBm.  It can be noted that in most cases, those models of devices that are common on the Russian market also meet this criterion.  The next parameter is the availability of an external SMA antenna in the telephone set.  This hardware component determines the phone‚Äôs ability to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù a signal in areas outside the operator‚Äôs stable coverage area when a conventional antenna may not be able to cope with its task. </p>

    <h2>  Display and battery </h2><p>  The next significant aspect of choosing a stationary phone with a SIM card is the type of display.  In most cases, to meet the basic needs of the user of the device of this type, an LCD display with a resolution of 128 x 64 or higher is sufficient.  The optimal battery capacity of a stationary phone with a SIM card is 800 mAh.  Of course, higher rates are always welcome. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Temperature range </h2><p>  Regarding the temperature range at which the manufacturer guarantees the stable operation of the device, landline phones with a SIM card of those models that are most popular in the Russian Federation are able, as a rule, to function in an environment from minus 10 to 55 degrees.  However, again, if the device is bought outside the Russian Federation, it will be useful to double-check its corresponding characteristic - it is quite possible that the device will not be designed for use, for example, at sub-zero temperatures. </p><p>  We will now study examples of devices that satisfy the basic requirements for modern stationary GSM-phones, which we examined above, and therefore can be used to effectively solve problems involving the installation of models of the corresponding type in the office or apartment. </p><h2>  Phones "Termite": main features </h2><p>  We‚Äôll explore what constitutes a stationary cell phone with a Termite SIM card in the popular FixPhone v2 modification.  This device is compatible with the networks of the largest Russian operators, such as MTS, MegaFon, Beeline, as well as any other suppliers with GSM 850/900/1800/1900 infrastructure.  The phone in question can, like a traditional cell phone, receive and send SMS, be used in conference calls involving 3 subscribers, support the option of call forwarding, as well as call barring.  In addition, the device is equipped with an additional speaker, which can be used in talk mode on the speakerphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  The considered stationary telephone with a SIM card can work <span>offline</span> from the battery for 72 hours (if used in standby mode) or 3 hours (if the subscriber is talking on it).  The device can be located both on the table and on the wall - the device case has special holes for vertical mounting of the device.  The phone comes with a standard antenna, but you can turn it off and replace it, for example, with a street one, which may be more sensitive to the signal. </p><h2>  Phones "Termite": reviews </h2><p>  How do users evaluate a landline phone with a Termit SIM card in the modification we have reviewed above?  The owners of this device note primarily stable communication, the convenience of controlling the device, as well as functionality.  A landline telephone, in principle, has the same basic capabilities as a familiar mobile device.  Sending and reading SMS is carried out without any difficulties, as well as using other functions of the device.  The device‚Äôs battery characteristics are very decent, according to the phone‚Äôs owners: it has sufficient capacity to provide decent battery life indicators. </p><h2>  Phones from Rostelecom: the most popular modifications </h2><p>  One of the leading Russian communication brands also produces landline phones with a SIM card, and in a fairly wide range of modifications.  So, the most affordable model is the E1.  The device in modification S1 has large buttons, a sufficiently loud signal, as well as a bright screen.  In addition, S1 supports communication using the Bluetooth interface.  If you want a stationary cell phone with a SIM card to work in 3G networks, then you can pay attention to the F2 device, also produced by Rostelecom. </p><h2>  Reviews about devices from Rostelecom </h2><p>  So, one of the largest Russian telecommunication brands produces several models of stationary GSM-phones.  What do users say about their experience in their operation? </p>

    <p>  In principle, any landline phone with a Rostelecom SIM card, judging by the reviews of the owners, is characterized, first of all, by a high level of stability.  The Russian brand has focused specifically on the reliability of manufactured devices of the corresponding type.  However, in terms of functionality, judging by the reviews, the devices from Rostelecom, in principle, are not inferior to analogues. </p><h2>  MegaFon devices: what are their specifics? </h2><p>  Another major telecommunication brand, MegaFon, also produces its own stationary devices with SIM cards.  Among the most notable models of the corresponding type of devices are the ETS3125i.  This landline phone with a SIM card can also work on battery power.  At the same time, experts note rather good indicators of the device‚Äôs battery life.  That is, the user has at their disposal a cordless landline telephone with a SIM card that can be freely moved around the apartment or office without fear that the battery will suddenly run out.  The device comes with an external antenna that allows you to ensure stable operation of the device with a weak <span>mobile network</span> signal <span>.</span>  It is worth noting that this landline phone with a MegaFon SIM card can only work with SIM cards issued by its manufacturer brand. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews of phones from MegaFon </h2><p>  We‚Äôll now study what users say about devices from MegaFon.  In principle, in terms of basic functions, these devices are not inferior to the products of other brands that are present on the Russian market.  But they have a peculiarity - the devices from MegaFon are compatible only with those SIM cards that are serviced by their manufacturer brand.  Sometimes, according to some users, this can be considered as a disadvantage of phones of the appropriate type.  But if a subscriber uses a MegaFon SIM card, the device will provide the highest quality communications.  A stationary cell phone with a MegaFon SIM card will probably look definitely preferable to analogues in those territories of the Russian Federation that are served only by MegaFon. </p><h2>  Kammunica </h2><p>  Another well-known supplier of devices of this type is Kammunica.  He produces Kammunica GSM-Phone devices - landline phones with a SIM card, which are characterized by the optimal combination of functionality and price.  The device is equipped with a multi-line LCD screen on which various information about calls can be displayed.  Menu and phone keypad in Russian.  You can also include the English interface on the screen.  The letters and numbers in the device are quite large. </p>

    <p>  Consider a stationary cell phone with a SIM card, like many other models of devices of the corresponding type, is equipped with a battery.  Also included is an external antenna.  The device has a built-in notebook with the ability to quickly access contacts.  In the phone‚Äôs memory, dialed, received, and missed calls are recorded.  The device can send and receive SMS messages.  The phone user can change the ringtone.  Among other useful functions of the device in question is an alarm clock. </p><h2>  Phones from Kammunica: reviews </h2><p>  What do users say about Kammunica devices?  According to many owners of devices of the corresponding type, their main advantages are functionality and ease of use.  Of course, such reviews are often subjective, there is no reason to unequivocally say that phones from other brands are inferior in terms of operating comfort, as well as in technological capabilities to those devices manufactured by Kammunica.  But we can well determine that the corresponding devices are in no way inferior in this aspect to competitive solutions. </p><h2>  Devices from Orgtel </h2><p>  Another well-known brand that produces landline phones with a SIM card is Orgtel.  The Top Phone model produced by this company is very popular in the Russian market.  What are its main features?  First of all, this is a very simple menu structure in Russian.  The apparatus is supplied with an external antenna, which allows for stable communication with a weak signal.  If necessary, a more powerful SMA antenna can also be connected to the telephone.  The device, like many other solutions, is equipped with a battery.  Autonomous operation of the device is about 72 hours.  The device in question can also send and receive SMS.  Other noteworthy functions are the ability to make calls in conference mode, hands-free mode, the ability to use a calculator, an alarm clock. </p>

    <h2>  Landline phones from Orgtel: user reviews </h2><p>  What do users of phones of the appropriate type from Orgtel say?  First of all, the owners of the Top Phone model devices are impressed by the device‚Äôs high-quality reception of an operator signal, achieved, among other things, by using an external antenna.  Also, device users note a large number of additional features of the device: setting an alarm, using a calculator. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So, a landline phone with a SIM card is a device that, from the point of view of the main user tasks, should perform the following main functions: </p><ul><li>  provide voice communications within the framework of GSM channels; </li><li>  Receive and send SMS messages </li><li>  offer the user the optional connection of an additional antenna in case the signal is unstable, and the device will need to be made more sensitive. </li></ul><p>  It is highly desirable that the phone is equipped with a battery with sufficient capacity (to ensure autonomous operation without access to the outlet).  The rest of the equipment of the device with certain functions and additional features as a selection criterion depends on the needs of a particular user.  The above-considered models of landline phones with SIM-cards, in general, meet these criteria.  The choice of a specific model can be made taking into account market availability, current price, as well as versatility (in terms of support for SIM-cards from different operators). </p>
