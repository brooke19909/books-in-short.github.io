    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  When making a review about Lenovo Vibe Shot, we were primarily faced with the packaging of a smartphone.  It is made of thick cardboard, has compact dimensions and at the same time has a minimal amount of information on its surface.  After removing the cover, a neatly packaged phone in one section opens to the eye, and its additions, occupying another part of the free space. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should be noted that the ‚ÄúLenovo Vib Shot‚Äù equipment is generally quite modest.  The list of accessories provided by the developer includes a charger, an adapter for European-format sockets, a flat USB cable for connecting to a computer.  In addition, the manufacturer equipped the box with instructions for a smartphone and a needle for opening slots with a SIM card and microSD.  If the user wants a cover for Lenovo Vibo Shot, he will have to buy it in a separate order. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Logically, to begin with the characteristics of the device itself, you need to start with the main and most obvious - its appearance.  Already on this issue ‚ÄúLenovo Vib Shot‚Äù (reviews confirm this) has something to show. </p><p>  To begin with, plastic, metal and glass are connected in the phone case.  Due to this, the device not only has an attractive appearance, but is also well protected in practice, say, from drops, shock and other third-party influences.  Perhaps, taking this into account, a cover for Lenovo Vibo Shot will not be needed - the phone is already quite durable. </p>

    <p>  Three color modifications of the device are offered for sale - black, gray and red.  The difference in their design is the color scheme for the metal frame around the perimeter of the case.  In all other respects, the model remains unchanged - only in gray the back cover of the smartphone is painted in white, and not in black (as in all others). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance Features </h2><p>  No wonder the phone has a prefix shot at the end of the name.  In English, this word means ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù, which shows the intention of manufacturers to present the device as an analog of the camera.  The design traces the same thing. </p><p>  In particular, this is expressed in the back cover of the apparatus.  It is divided (visually) into two sections through the use of different materials.  As noted by the Lenovo Vibe Shot reviews, from afar, due to this separation and the presence of a camera eye in one of the marked parts, the phone really looks like a stylish camera. </p><p>  This is not the only highlight presented by the developers of the model.  Another interesting solution is the use of a glass coating on both sides of the smartphone.  Since the device has a rectangular shape of a sort of ‚Äúbrick‚Äù, the glass coating of the back cover really looks spectacular.  However, as reported by Lenovo Vibo Shot reviews, such a move is not the most practical due to the soiled back cover, the visibility of fingerprints on it. </p><p>  There is another usability problem that is not so obvious at first glance.  This is the location of the camera eye.  From a decorative point of view, the solution is very successful - place it on the very edge of the back cover.  True, the developers do not take into account that at first the user often closes the eye with his finger, with which he holds the corner of the smartphone.  It turns out to be somewhat inconvenient due to the fact that in the future you need to take the phone more carefully so as not to close the review. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Device Navigation Elements </h2><p>  Despite the originality shown in the design, the location of the phone‚Äôs batteries remains classic - we can find the same set on other smartphones.  So, under the screen, first of all, we see the physical buttons ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, which are equipped with white backlight.  Due to this, they look attractive against the background of a dark display. </p><p>  The remaining keys are located on the right panel.  Here is a classic set of display lock buttons and volume control.  We also added a button for switching the shooting mode and a button for quick access to the ‚ÄúCamera‚Äù application.  No wonder the new ‚ÄúLenovo Vib Shot‚Äù is positioned as a camera phone. </p>

    <p>  The left side of the device looks empty - slots for installing an additional memory card, as well as SIM, were placed here.  The system of special mines that can be seen on the iPhone is used.  Really, convenient and practical. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The entire front surface is painted to match the color of the display, which makes it appear that the screen takes up more space than it actually is.  Although it is impossible to say that the phone is equipped with a small display, the characteristics describing the Lenovo Vibo Shot testify: its size is 5 inches.  It operates on the basis of IPS technology, which allows you to transfer a colorful picture of high accuracy.  The image density is huge - due to the resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, it is about 440 dpi.  In simple terms, you can say that the model‚Äôs screen conveys a very accurate, sharp picture, and this is a definite plus. </p><p>  The developers did not forget about protecting the screen, covering it with a special third-generation <span>Gorilla Glass,</span> resistant to mechanical influences. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the Lenovo Vibe Shot phone has the ability to increase the screen brightness for more convenient operation in bright weather and in direct sunlight, and vice versa - to reduce it for comfortable viewing of the picture from the display at night and in the absence of lighting .  This option is clearly to the liking of ordinary users. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The Lenovo Vibe Shot phone runs on an eight-core processor developed by Qualcomm.  This is the Snapdragon 615, four cores of which give a clock frequency of 1 GHz, and four more - 1.7 GHz.  This allows us to argue about the high performance of the device, its ability to work even with the most ‚Äúcumbersome‚Äù (from the point of view of physics and graphics) applications, top-end games without any delays and braking. </p>

    <p>  Antutu testing also gives excellent results - at the level of other flagships from Samsung, Meizu, LG.  A nice feature of the phone is also the ability to play video in FullHD format.  The image quality is excellent, frames are downloaded smoothly and without hangs. </p><p>  The fact that the device‚Äôs processor is properly optimized to work under different loads is also evidenced by the fact that the model does not heat up even after a long load.  Again, the result is a more economical battery consumption. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  We have already said that one can judge the emphasis placed on the camera function by the manufacturer by the name of the phone that we describe.  This is confirmed by the characteristics describing the Lenovo Vib Shot.  So, there are two cameras - front and main.  The latter has a strong matrix with a resolution of 16 megapixels.  This is indicated on the back of the phone, directly opposite the logo of the device.  In addition to strong hardware, manufacturers also tried on a software basis for interacting with the camera.  In particular, the creation of high-quality images is facilitated by the availability of options such as auto focus (using laser technology), a three-tone flash, and also two modes with a set of filters - Auto and Pro. </p>

    <p>  As the recommendations show, the new ‚ÄúLenovo Vib Shot‚Äù automatically offers the user a minimum of settings, choosing the conditions for creating the best photo on their own.  As for the Pro mode, here the photographer can choose in what conditions the picture is taken, and what the composition should look like in the future. </p><p>  <span>The front camera,</span> according to the technical descriptions of the model, has a resolution of 8 megapixels.  It‚Äôs convenient to take high-quality ‚Äúselfie‚Äù pictures with it.  The only caveat - since there is no autofocus here, care must be taken to move your Lenovo Vib Shot a short distance away.  The camera only in this case can create a good photo of you and what is located behind your back. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  If we talk about operational, the device has 3 GB of memory.  In this regard, the Lenovo Vibo Shot can be compared with ZTE Nubia, LG G2, OnePlus One and others.  What is characteristic, with such an ‚Äúunpaired‚Äù amount of RAM in the market, most often there are Chinese devices. </p>

    <p>  As for the physical memory for hosting multimedia data, 32 GB is built into the device for these purposes.  In addition, the Lenovo Vibot Shot smartphone supports the operation of additional microSD cards, with which the disk space on the device can be increased by another 64 GB.  Thus, the developers made it possible for the user to expand the memory of the device and even work with it as a portable data saver or multimedia player.  This is already determined by the preferences of the owner of the phone. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The phone is equipped with a powerful non-removable battery, which has a capacity of 3000 mAh.  This is enough for such a functional device to work for 20-23 hours in moderate operation.  To save battery and, as a result, increase the level of autonomy allows a special option for smart consumption.  It means optimizing all processes taking place in the device in such a way as to prevent useless processor loading.  Practice shows that the reception works quite successfully. </p><p>  Under heavy load, the battery lasts up to 7 hours.  This indicator can be called average for devices of this class. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  When the ‚ÄúLenovo Vib Shot‚Äù, which is dedicated to the review, was released in the middle of summer 2015, the current version of the Android OS was 5.1.  Now the most recent is a modification of Android 6.0.  Therefore, most likely, Vibe Shot will receive its update and will work under this version. </p><p>  It should be said that the manufacturer did not install the ‚Äúbare‚Äù interface offered by the software developer - Google - ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù.  Lenovo showed originality and released their own design for the model.  This is Vibe UI.  Outwardly, she uses the same tricks that are noticeable on Android L - gradients, similar sets of fonts and colors. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  As already noted, the device supports two SIM cards.  Both are capable of catching data in the format of a GSM network and working with wireless mobile Internet in 3G / LTE networks.  In addition, on the phone, of course, there is a Wi-Fi module (standard speed) and Bluetooth (used to receive and transfer files, as well as connect to wireless accessories).  There is also a satellite signal receiver, necessary for navigation in space.  The latter supports working with GPS (world standard), GLONASS (Russia) and BeiDou (China).  There is also an FM radio working through a headset (used as an antenna). </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  We managed to find many recommendations describing the Lenovo Vib Shot (in Russia and on foreign sites).  This can be attributed to the popularity of this model, with the fact that it seems attractive in the eyes of the buyer.  This is a combination of several factors that users indicate, noting the positive aspects of this smartphone.  For example, the price set on ‚ÄúLenovo Vib Shot‚Äù.  So, at the time of release, the device cost about $ 350.  Compared with the top models from Samsung, this is a budget option that offers the buyer much more options.  Therefore, the choice, obviously, is made in favor of Lenovo Vib Shot. </p><p>  Price is not the only thing that positively characterizes reviews.  The emphasis is also on the attractive design of the phone, its original appearance;  more - on the materials from which the device case is assembled.  Even when you simply hold the smartphone in your hands, not knowing about the technical characteristics hidden inside, you get the impression of the model as a high-quality, high-tech product with wide capabilities.  Completes this idea the presence of a large colorful and clear display.  They can positively characterize the device and technical parameters - a large supply of memory, a high-performance processor, a capacious battery. </p><p>  Negative reviews tell us that the phone has only one speaker, which degrades the sound quality in general, and also that the battery seems to some users too weak and not durable enough.  There are reviews of a weak built-in photo editor that does not satisfy user requests.  It should also be noted the display of unnaturally pink colors at the corners of the screen, which also, according to the assurances of some users, attract attention and can be considered a drawback of the model. </p><p>  Of course, there are many reviews of such minor flaws, most of them are purely subjective, based on personal preferences and beliefs of the buyer. </p>

    <h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  We conducted a detailed <span>review of Lenovo Vibe Shot</span> and revealed for ourselves some key features of the device.  Firstly, it is really made with high quality.  Despite the mistakes with the placement of the camera‚Äôs eye and other minor flaws, the device looks great.  In addition, the quality work of the manufacturer is felt during the operation of the phone.  So, there are no any backlashes, creaking or walking parts of the body.  This is a good indicator. </p><p>  Secondly, the hardware and software fillings of the model are pleasing.  Due to the powerful processor, camera, battery (although this is a controversial moment), the phone is able to perfectly cope with the tasks assigned to it, it is not buggy, does not show any braking and delays.  Transitions between menu panels and application switching are smooth. </p><p>  Thirdly, it should be noted the low (relatively) cost of the device.  For the price at which this flagship of Chinese Lenovo is offered, you cannot buy top-end smartphones from Samsung.  In most cases, the capabilities of both devices are the same. </p><p>  Therefore, in our opinion, the model can be considered as an excellent solution if you need a high-tech smartphone with a stylish design and lots of features at a reasonable price. </p>
