  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rent an apartment in Kiev for a short time.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Coming to a foreign city very often, for a short period of time I do not want to stay in a hotel.  There can be many reasons for this, but the main one is that in a hotel room you will not be able to meet and chat with friends or colleagues in an informal setting. </p><p>  To do this, you can <noindex>  <span>rent an apartment in Kiev</span> </noindex>  .  What should I look for when looking for an apartment for rent? </p><h2>  Agency or newspaper? </h2><p>  Arriving in Kiev on a business trip, you will probably need documents for an advance report.  Therefore, it is better to search for an apartment through an agency that will issue the required documents.  This applies to citizens of other countries in order to obtain registration.  Otherwise, you can choose the option for ads in the newspaper or on the Internet.  The latter option is preferable, as it allows you to view photos of the proposed apartments.  This method of finding housing will be much cheaper. </p><h2>  Area. </h2><p>  When choosing an apartment, it is important to choose the area as close as possible to the place of the upcoming work or event.  In an extreme case, there should be several public transport stops nearby.  Given that each apartment will have an equipped kitchen, it is good if there is a grocery store or cafe next to the house where you can have a bite to eat. </p><p>  If you plan to relax in Kiev for several days, then it is better not to choose a living space near schools and preschool institutions. </p><h2>  Inspection of the apartment. </h2><ol><li>  When examining the proposed housing, you should pay attention to the serviceability and reliability of the doors and locks. </li><li>  Sewerage and water supply should work properly in the apartment. </li><li>  Bath or shower should be clean.  The availability of towels is usually negotiated separately. </li><li>  The kitchen should have a working refrigerator, stove, kettle and dishes for several people.  Some apartments may have a microwave and washing machine.  They must also be in good condition. </li><li>  Check if the apartment has an iron and ironing board. </li><li>  Sheets should be clean and dry. </li><li>  If the guest does not smoke, then during a preliminary conversation by telephone, attention should be paid to this.  Usually in an apartment where a smoker lived before, the smell lasts a long time.  This will be very annoying. </li></ol><h2>  Price. </h2><p>  The price is influenced by many factors: the area, repair in the apartment, the availability of additional household appliances.  With a long rental, you can agree on a substantial discount. </p><p>  In addition to renting, many companies offer transfers from train stations to apartments and vice versa, and services for organizing a cultural program in the capital of Ukraine. </p></div></article>
