  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What you need to pay attention to before buying an apartment in London</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  London is one of the most famous cities in which everyone wants to visit at least once, and at the same time feel like an Englishman, while completely merging with the energy of the beautiful capital of Foggy Albion.  After all, just in this city a lot of the most diverse sights are collected and in order to consider everything you need to spend several weeks.  In addition, peculiar people live in London, whose mentality is seriously different from the psychology of residents of other states, which makes communication with London residents a pleasure.  But the truth is, only if you are fluent in English. <br><br>  It is worth noting that many people choose London not only for travel, but also in order to make this city a permanent residence, for which you will have to <noindex>  <span>buy an apartment in London</span> </noindex>  .  All the necessary information related to the purchase of housing can be obtained on the website en-rus.co.uk, where you can easily get acquainted with the prices of real estate in London and choose for yourself an apartment that is ideal for further residence in the capital of Misty Albion.  There are many reasons that force you to buy a home in the capital of England, but regardless of the reason for buying a home you need to approach with all responsibility paying attention to even the most inconspicuous little things.  Therefore, before buying an apartment in London, it is advisable to know a few simple rules that will help you choose the apartment in this city as successfully as possible. <br><br>  The first thing you need to know before buying a home is that in England there are several forms of ownership.  For example, such a form of ownership as leasehold makes it possible to own housing only for a certain time and the minimum tenure for real estate is 1 year, and the maximum is 999 years.  Upon the expiration of the term, the property owner loses ownership of the housing.  This form of ownership can be compared with rental housing, only an English rental gives more rights to the temporary owner.  Well, such a form of ownership as freehold makes it possible to fully redeem property. <br><br>  You also need to know that the choice of housing in London is quite diverse and housing prices depend on in which area you are going to buy an apartment.  For example, the most expensive areas of the city are: Mayfair, Knightsbridge and Belgravia.  These areas are located in the central part of the city, which means that housing prices here are the highest.  If you want to live in a fairly decent area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLondon, but want to buy cheaper housing, then in such a case, areas like Hammersmith and Voxhol or the suburbs of the city that bear such names as Isilworth and Hounslow are ideal for you. <br><br>  In conclusion, it is worth noting that London real estate prices are constantly rising, so the sooner you buy a home for yourself, the cheaper it will cost you.  Ideally, you had to buy housing 5 years ago, since then the prices for English real estate were much lower than now.  True, it is worth noting that when buying housing today, you not only get a luxury apartment in the city, but also invest your money profitably, since in a few years the value of your property will be much higher. </p></div></article>
