It is known to be located off the coast of Africa.  Its fertile territory in the ancient world historically passed from Carthage to Rome, then to the Byzantines.  To this day, the island is connected to the mainland by the bulk road built by the Romans.  It is now used as the main transport route of the island. </p><p>  Later, in the Middle Ages, the island became the subject of territorial disputes between Arab pirates, Normans and Spaniards.  There was a bloody struggle for it, in which the Ottoman Empire took over. </p><p>  Nowadays, Djerba is an integral part of Tunisia, which has been actively developing its tourism industry since the end of the 20th century.  The local mild Mediterranean climate (average annual temperature ranges from 21 to 27 gr.) Is ideal for spa holidays. </p><p>  It is in the north-east of the island, in its best resort area, where huge palm trees with an impressive crown adjoin a wide sandy strip of beaches, and the turquoise sea is perfectly transparent, among the dozens of modern hotel complexes, a four-star hotel is discussed, which will be discussed in this article, - Isis Hotel Spa. </p>

    <p>  Holidays in it (as in most hotels on the island) are preferred by fans of health tourism.  The high tourist season lasts from April to November.  Well-known in the world centers of talassotherapy (rejuvenation) operate, practicing medical technologies using sea mud, water, algae. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Recommendations for those who bought a tour to the hotel </h2><p>  What can be advised to tourists who bought a tour to Isis Hotel?  First, do not expect them to be appeased here, while they themselves, while staying in a hotel, will pour out their bile on everyone.  This will not happen. </p><p>  Arabs are a distinctive people.  They take a step towards and wait for a similar step from tourists.  If this happens, this will guarantee that the guest‚Äôs rest is sure to succeed.  Be friendly, and the positive will return to you a hundredfold.  According to legend, the companions of Odyssey liked this region so much that they did not want to leave it.  From time immemorial, Islam, Judaism and Christianity have been coexisting here. </p><p>  Arabs working at the Isis Hotel understand many phrases in Russian.  If a tourist knows a couple of dozen phrases in English (by the way, the hotel staff speaks them to the same extent), then he will be able to communicate productively.  If the hotel guest speaks French, he is absolutely "on horseback" (this language in Tunisia is considered the second official language). </p>

    <p>  Slavic tourists make up a significant part of vacationers at the Isis Hotel Spa.  Their reviews contain brief comic instructions on what should be done (except for a beach holiday) for each guest of the island: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  meditate while looking at the sunset over the Mediterranean Sea; </li><li>  taste the ancient dish - jerbinsky rice (it is magnificent); </li><li>  to get the Djerbin malhaf (cover); </li><li>  enjoy watching flocks of pink flamingos; </li><li>  visit the world's oldest synagogue La Griba, built 2.5 millennia ago. </li></ul><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Transfer from Djerba-zarzis airport to the hotel takes about half an hour.  The hotel was built 15 km from the island's capital - Houmt Souk.  It is landscaped and modern.  The nearest village of Midoun is located four kilometers from the Isis Hotel Spa 4 * <span>(Tunisia, Djerba).</span> </p><p>  The location of the hotel complex is very successful.  From here, it is not far to Ajima, the main port of the island, where you can inexpensively buy gorgeous seafood from fishermen.  You can also drive to Gelala, the center of local pottery, in half an hour.  Hotel Isis Hotel Spa is usually impressed with local exoticism.  They are captivated by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãacquiring a local veil, melkhaf.  Tourists - fans of diving believe that the local marine area near the coastal cliffs is a unique place for diving. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  The Isis Hotel Spa 4 * (Tunisia) is located in a three-story thick-walled, but graceful, typically Arabic building.  Guest reviews about him are quite loyal.  From them it becomes clear that this average hotel (its number of rooms has 289 rooms) is neat and comfortable for tourists.  Its small territory, equipped with swimming pools and designer landscaped, is aesthetic, pleasant, promotes relaxation and recovery. </p><p>  Residents of the hotel feel the talent of the people who built it.  Not only air conditioners, but also the elements of the Muslim architecture of the building, textured walls, protect against heat, and arcades with multi-level terraces and a protruding sloping roof create a gracious shadow for hotel guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  It is striking that, in general, the building of the four-star hotel is completely and tastefully constructed.  At the same time, we note that on the island of Djerba there is another hotel belonging to the same hotel chain.  Indeed, the tourist portals mention a lower rating than the hotel we are considering, built in 1998.  Its name is Isis Hotel Spa 3 * (Tunisia).  Its infrastructure is simpler than that of its shabby, owner of four stars.  However, living in it on the island, you can take advantage of the same recreational opportunities of the resort, but for less money. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The modern, thoughtful and comfortable infrastructure of the Isis 4 * hotel complex is even outwardly quite original.  The snow-white buildings of the hotel contrast pleasantly with the greenery of landscape design and the blue sky.  Two modern universal swimming pools are surrounded by walking and square terraces, aesthetic deck chairs and umbrellas. </p><p>  Dishes of the Neptune restaurant, among which the works of Tunisian cuisine stand out, grouped in a buffet are tasty and nutritious.  Fans of Mediterranean cuisine do not remain deprived.  A L'Hippocampe restaurant and Bacchus and Phenicia bars treat them to elaborately prepared seafood. </p><p>  Isis 4 * guest service also includes a number of additional services.  Its wellness hotel spa center, practicing spa treatments, reflex massage, baths for every taste (hammam, steam room, sauna), as well as dynamic training exercises are very popular.  Under him, certified professionals work.  The hotel has facilities for mini-golf, volleyball, tennis. </p><p>  Guests of Hotel Isis Thalasso Spa 4 * can buy - at your choice - individual and group lessons with an experienced trainer: </p><ul><li>  in water sports (water skiing, windsurfing, sailing, water aerobics, diving, rowing); </li><li>  in game sports (billiards, tennis, volleyball, golf); </li><li>  for fitness, horse riding, exercises in the gym </li></ul><p>  What else distinguishes a four-star hotel from other, less rated (we are talking about the previously mentioned Isis Hotel Spa 3 *, Tunisia)?  Animation, services of the Aladdin mini-club for children, a modern conference hall for vacationers in the hotel complex of business people were added. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Can this hotel be called comfortable for its guests?  Obviously.  They live in spacious, air-conditioned rooms.  The furniture in the rooms is made of natural wood. </p>

    <p>  The rooms are in good repair.  The bathroom is equipped with both a bath and shower.  In addition to air conditioning, TV, standard for such hotels, the rooms of Hotel Isis Thalasso Spa 4 * are equipped with a safe, minibar, hairdryer.  But that is not all.  The rooms at the same time have a dining area equipped with the necessary appliances and furniture. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Extremely transparent, visible for tens of meters is the Mediterranean Sea in the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel bay.  Local residents claim that the reason for this is the unique filtering properties of the local soil.  In addition, even in winter, during the low season, the water temperature off the coast is suitable for swimming. </p><p>  The comfortable beach of Isis Hotel Spa (Tunisia) equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas is only 200 meters away from the hotel, which means that the guest can reach the beach from his room in just 2 minutes.  Agree that this is quite convenient. </p><h2>  Animation </h2><p>  Not always it is present in the description of the hotel.  However, not in this case.  The animation team from Hotel Isis Hotel Spa (Alex, Chiko &amp; Rio, Nouri, Faycel, Wissem, Foufa) work out their money by 200%!  According to tourists, they are simply magnificent: not knowing Russian, the guys stirred, amused everyone.  There was often a funny chameleon with them, watching which it was simply impossible not to laugh.  According to the animators, this is a member of their team. </p>

    <p>  During the day they organized all kinds of entertainment in the pool area.  In the mornings, warm-up and stretching were carried out for vacationers.  From time to time, animators organized water polo and beach volleyball competitions for tourists.  In the evenings, before the disco, they taught vacationers a funny dance step. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  We will begin to consider this aspect of the stay of tourists in the hotel in question with ... a slight irony that accompanies the statement of one fact.  More than once, reading the reviews of tourists vacationing at the Isis Hotel Spa (Tunisia), you can stumble upon a phrase that begins with the words: "I have recovered (recovered) ..." What do you think this says?  That's right: about the skill of the chef. </p><p>  The menu of the main restaurant, named after the God of the Seas, has dozens of items.  Light breakfast: milk, cereals, yoghurts, egg dishes, pastries, coffee juices, tea.  Lunch is very hearty.  A lot of vegetable dishes, baking.  From meat - beef, veal, turkey, chicken, liver.  Several fish dishes are prepared daily.  Like lunchtime - dinner menu.  By evening, tourists are treated to grilled fish and meat. </p><p>  It is nice to see how the cooks and waiters of the hotel work together and harmoniously, you can feel the skillful leadership of the administrator Ms. Mufida with a professional team of waiters and bartenders, among whom Hakim &amp; Bouali stands out. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Prices for tours to the Isis hotel for 7 nights start in the low season from $ 1,400.  The island of Djerba is considered a resort for an exotic (with Arabic characteristics) economy vacation. </p>

    <p>  For successful market shopping, it is important to navigate the schedule and working hours of various markets (there are about a dozen of them).  For example, Houmt Souk is open on Monday and Thursday.  Summarizing, we say that shopping on Djerba is distinguished more by market impromptu than by brand exclusivity. </p><p>  Perhaps the only store competing with the markets, besides duty-free islands, is the Al Jazeera fixed-price supermarket. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  For many tourists <span>, Hotel</span> Isis Thalasso Spa (Tunisia) has become exactly the place where they touched the Arab world.  Here are great animation guys, wonderfully organized as a single team by restaurant workers and bartenders. </p>

    <p>  How gratifying that it is in such places that tourists, after informal communication, experience human warmth and gratitude!  As it is necessary in the modern world, often hostile to people. </p>
