    <h2>  Cala Fonoll Beach </h2><p>  This is a small rocky area near the city of Andratx (2.2 km).  On one side of it is a modern hotel, and on the other - residential buildings.  The slope is covered with round boulders and gravel. </p><p>  To get to this beach is quite simple - you need to go through the sailing club, and then go onto the Cala Fonoll road, which will lead you to this quiet and uninhabited beach.  It is ideal for a relaxing holiday when you want to isolate yourself from the city noise and retire. </p><h2>  Cala tutnt </h2><p>  It is located forty kilometers from the city of Soller.  The beach two hundred meters deep into Mount Serra de Tramuntana.  The entrance to the sea is semicircular.  The beach is surrounded by a luxurious pine forest.  At the water, the beach is covered with sand, and then goes into gravel and rounded stones.  You can arrive here on a yacht, but anchoring it here is not recommended due to strong winds.  There are more vacationers here than on Cala Fonoll beach. </p>

    <p>  The stony beaches of <span>Mallorca</span> receive very conflicting <span>reviews</span> .  Some are happy to spend their holidays in a quiet and peaceful place, while others find such a pastime too boring. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Those who prefer a more active holiday, in the company of old and new friends, it is better to choose sandy beaches - they are always crowded, have a well-developed infrastructure.  In addition, in such places you can always make a new acquaintance. </p><h2>  Sandy beaches </h2><p>  The beaches of Mallorca (they are clearly visible on the map of the island) are mostly sandy.  And I must say that 80% of all those who come on vacation choose them. </p><p>  In the south of the island is the magnificent small beach of Cala Mondrago (Cala Mondrago), located between two bays with perfectly clear water.  There is a small bar (right on the beach). </p><p>  One of the most beloved beaches by tourists is rightly considered Calo des Moro - there is a breathtaking landscape, majestic pine trees surrounding the beach, calm, crystal clear water and a sandy bottom.  The size of the beach is small, and there are quite a lot of people who want to spend time here.  Therefore, you need to arrive early to occupy the attractive place on the white sand. </p>
