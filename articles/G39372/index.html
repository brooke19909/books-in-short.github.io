Is it possible to have a good rest if the vacation fell exactly in October?  Of course, there are many resorts in the world and, of course, there are those where it is always warm, there is a lot of sun and wonderful evergreens grow.

    <p>  When choosing an autumn tour, one must be especially careful so that the rest is not spoiled by bad weather.  If the choice is successful, then you can emerge from the cold rainy autumn, to be where the beautiful summer is.  By the way, there will be much more positive feelings than when you go to hot countries in the summer. </p><p>  <strong>Section 2. In which countries is it warm in October?</strong>  <strong>Festivals and Holidays</strong> </p><p>  By the way, few people think that in <span>central Europe,</span> unlike Russia, at this time of the year weather is still quite stable, without prolonged rains and night frosts.  Why not go there?  Yes, and a lot of reasons.  For example, in October, Oktoberfest is held in Munich.  This is a very famous festival for beer lovers from all over the world.  For the annual celebration, a special sort of beer, Viz, is specially prepared ‚Äî it was Ludwig I who loved it very much. It‚Äôs the time to go to the Czech Republic for those who must have wine at the festival.  Folk fun, fun and ditties - a holiday in the Czech Republic lasts for a month! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  October is a special month in Israel.  At this time, the country celebrated love: a procession of multinational columns, slogans proclaiming friendship, love and peace. </p><p>  In the United Arab Emirates, camel races were organized at this time. </p><p>  In Phuket - a festival of vegetarians.  Amazing spectacles can be seen here at this time: piercing the cheeks, processions in white robes, climbing the razor ladder, whose height is 12 m. But there are no victims at this holiday, so amazing performances can only scare a little, but everything ends well. </p><p>  <strong>Section 3. In which countries is it warm in October?</strong>  <strong>Sun and sea</strong> </p><p>  Perhaps every student, almost without hesitation, will answer that Thailand, Turkey and Egypt - this is where it is warm in October </p><p>  <span>In Thailand,</span> prices are fairly low <span>in October</span> .  It is wonderful that the rainy season ends in September, so you can have a very good rest in this country.  In fairness, it is worth noting that summer rains in Thailand, of course, are.  However, at this time of year they go at night.  In addition, they are also very warm.  Unimaginably beautiful places and a wonderful clear sea - for everyone who wants to leave from the cloudy cold weather, a trip to Thailand will do just fine. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  If you really want to bask in the rays of the hot sun, it is better to go to Egypt.  The sea here is gentle at this time, and the sun is very hot.  Until mid-November, you can enjoy beautiful weather: water temperature - +26 ¬∫C, and air temperature - up to +30 ¬∫C.  Trips to Egypt are relatively inexpensive, so you can have a wonderful long-awaited vacation here.  The hotels of tourists will appreciate the excellent service, the animators will make your vacation with children very interesting. </p><p>  In October, it is warm in Turkey - the air temperature is about +17 ¬∫C.  It rains a lot at this time, but they usually do not last long, and the puddles, after the rain has passed, dry out quickly.  There are relatively few tourists in Turkey at this time, so prices are dropping.  You can have a great rest, not only swimming in the sea, but also devoting time to the sights.  At this time, locals finish the harvest, so the variety of fruits and vegetables becomes amazing. </p><p>  As you have seen, the answer to the question of where it is better to go for a vacation in October depends on the tastes and individual preferences of each individual traveler.  One thing can be said for sure - there is no reason to worry: in the opinion of experienced tourists, going on vacation in the fall is much more interesting and economical than in the summer months. </p>
