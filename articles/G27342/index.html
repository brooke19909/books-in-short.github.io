Webtransfer: reviews about the payment system</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are currently many ways to make money online.  But, unfortunately, it is impossible to write off scammers who do not miss the opportunity to deceive the gullible people and cash in on this.  For example, investment social service "Webtransfer", reviews of which contradict each other.  Some claim that they make good money on it, while others accuse developers of fraud. </p><h2>  What is Webtransfer? </h2><p>  Microfinance system "Webtransfer" reviews are not always flattering.  But there are people who do not know what kind of service it is.  Developers promise earnings on the issuance of loans without investment.  Beginners register on the site, get a personal account.  The system provides them with $ 50, which can be given at interest and earn first money.  Then users can take loans and give loans at higher rates, as a result it turns out to make good money (27%), according to the developers.  However, for this you need to deposit your own considerable funds into the account and also issue loans.  Webtransfer (reviews confirm this) insures deposits only in words.  In fact, few manage to get their money back, much less earn money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="web transfer reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38878/1112057.jpg"></div>

The reviews confirm that this is easy to do, just have an account on one of the social networks or an email address.  After that, the registration is confirmed via SMS message, which comes to the specified user number. </p><p>  Upon completion of registration, the user automatically enters his personal account, in which you also need to specify some information about yourself in the appropriate fields.  When all the information is indicated, you need to click on the "Confirm" link.  Next, the system will send a number to confirm its data in the Webtransfer system.  The overwhelming majority of user reviews do not recommend registering with this service, since you can lose time, money and effort in vain. </p>

    <p>  For credibility, the system provides each beginner with $ 50, which can be used to issue loans for several days.  Then the service will automatically debit them from the account.  That is what many ordinary people buy, dreaming of getting rich. </p><p>  You need to replenish your account by at least $ 50 from your wallet, after which you can allegedly start issuing loans and making money.  In this regard, there are doubts about the decency of the developers, because they unfoundedly promise income without investments. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Positive opinion about the service </h2><p>  Few accolades claim that users manage to earn huge money here.  To issue loans, you can set the terms and interest on loans yourself and receive regular profits.  It does not lend itself to a logical explanation of why developers need to give someone the opportunity to earn money for free, when you can do it yourself. </p><p>  When issuing a loan, it is very important to choose a special option ‚ÄúGuarantor‚Äù, which saves users money if borrowers turn out to be dishonest.  Positive reviews contain boilerplate information about how great it is to make money, how the support service makes contact, and all that sort of thing. </p>

    <p>  The user simply fills in all the necessary items, gives out money at interest and waits for profit.  As a result, a table with the amount of the loan issued and the profit that he will receive after the end of the loan term will appear on the website page below.  The application is sent, and the process is considered to be running. </p><p>  When the user has sent the application, information on the submitted offer will appear in his personal account, and after the system finds the borrower, it will become possible to monitor the loan issued, the following information will be displayed on the site: </p><ol><li>  Amount of the issued loan. </li><li>  Information about the dates of conclusion and expiration of the transaction. </li><li>  Data such as loan rate, repayment amount, number of days until the end. </li><li>  Numbers of the borrower and certificate on the loan. </li></ol><p>  It is worth noting that this is exactly what happens until the time comes for the withdrawal of earned money from the system. </p><h2>  Negative opinion </h2><p>  If the user at the initial stage does not have his own funds, then he can take a loan from Webtransfer.  The reviews of 2014 confirm that it is not difficult to take out a loan, but it is necessary to send passport details and a photocopy of the document.  In addition, the system may suddenly stop working, not respond to requests, and this becomes the reason for the delay in credit and the accrual of fines.  As a result, it may happen that there are no funds on the account, but only a debt to a service that has paid the debts of a negligent user nobly. </p>

    <h2>  Withdrawal difficulties </h2><p>  It is with the problems of cashing out money that all the negative reviews about the WebTransfer resource are associated.  The withdrawal of money theoretically occurs as follows: </p><ol><li>  Select the appropriate option. </li><li>  Indicate the desired amount, which can be any, but more than $ 50. </li><li>  Choose an electronic payment system. </li><li>  Be sure to check the box ‚ÄúAccelerate withdrawal‚Äù. </li><li>  After which the application is sent. </li></ol><p>  In fact, after sending the application, you can wait as long as you like, but the money does not come to the account.  Users are accused of violating the rules, blocked and stop responding to their requirements. </p><h2>  How Webtransfer Finance Developers Justify </h2><p>  Reviews about this service are far from ideal.  Some write that they could not withdraw the money, and they were blocked, unjustly fined, and so on.  The developers are not confused by the mistrust of customers, and they argue that all this could happen not only due to dishonesty of the company, but also because of certain violations on the part of the users themselves.  Webtransfer Finance does not force customers to deposit their money; they can be earned in the system. </p><p>  However, it is not possible to deal with this, and more and more people are offended by this service.  Before registering in the new system for making money, it is worth remembering where free cheese happens. </p>
