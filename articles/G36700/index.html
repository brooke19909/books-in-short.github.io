There are several options: also buy a ticket for a low-cost airline, which will cost about 20-30 euros or take a bus around Europe for 10-15 euros.  Consider several routes, but first: how to get from Vienna to Prague cheaply. </p><p>  Vienna is 330 kilometers from Prague, so you can take a ride from the Wien Hbf station on bus companies: Flixbus, ArdaTur, Regiojet, Infobus and Eurolines for 14 euros.  Flights run every day from six in the morning until one in the morning.  It takes 4-6 hours.

To track such great offers, we advise you to follow the news of specialized services. </p><h2>  From Russia by train </h2><p>  We examined the options for transfers and the use of <span>trains in Europe,</span> but are there any other options, how is it cheaper to get to Prague from Russia?
