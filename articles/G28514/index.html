Experienced travelers already have their favorites.  Hotels have now become popular in the Latin Quarter and neighboring Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s.  Great location and easy access to the main attractions attract many tourists. </p><p>  The best hotel in Paris is different for everyone.  You can see the city, living in a budget hostel and in a fashionable palace. </p><p>  Notre Dame, the Eiffel Tower and the Champs Elysees remain the most visited places in the capital, but the real charm and excitement of being in Paris is hidden, as a rule, in detail.  Therefore, many guests of Paris choose accommodation options away from the center and enjoy a leisurely study of the secluded corners of the most famous city in the world. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  There is a clear opinion that hotels in Paris are expensive, and the rooms are small and cramped.  In some ways, this is true, because many tourists come here, and hotels are always crowded, which affects the quality of service. </p><p>  But even in crowded Paris there are hotels where you can spend time with pleasure.  And not always the numbers in them are fabulous money. </p><p>  Travelers are advised to choose accommodation in the center, as close to the metro as possible.  And to save, you need to contact the hotel directly to reserve a room.  The price will be slightly lower than through an intermediary. </p>
