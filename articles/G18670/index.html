Ayat (10 m).  The limiter is a reinforced concrete dam.  The first fortification was built in 1825.  Its remains are preserved.  Even in summer, the lake is full of water due to the dam.  There are small islands.  The most popular of them are: Krasny Island (center) and Saint Island (south). </p><p>  In winter, the Saint is of most interest.  The distance between it and the pumping station is 4.5 km.  There is a legend according to which, in the 18th century, a miracle worker and a hermit lived here.  This fact determined the name of the object. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The bottom is everywhere covered with silt.

    <h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  Fishing in the Sverdlovsk region brings generous results.  Regulars of the place manage to get crucian carp, perch, roach, pike, ruff and bream.  Visitors are happy with the environment.  Waiting with a fishing rod in hand gives pleasant results.  Ripus, carp and whitefish are settled here artificially.  Visitors stop on each shore of the lake.  The most popular areas are backwaters, islands.  Here the tributaries flow into the lake. </p><p>  Characteristics of fishing: </p><ul><li>  The fish caught by fishermen on a visit to the Ayatskoye lake is most often small to medium-sized perch, weighing 1 kilogram scavenger. </li><li>  Roach pecks well. </li><li>  Pike catch is possible. </li><li>  The size of the fish is small. </li><li>  Trophy specimens are rare here. </li></ul><p>  At the beginning of the last decade, carp were stocked.  It breeds poorly due to inappropriate climate.  Fishermen still periodically manage to catch large individuals. </p><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  This place has good potential as a tourist destination.  Beautiful landscape of the mountain range.  Holidays in the Sverdlovsk region are pleasant due to their proximity to nature.  There are a lot of questions on the agenda that should be addressed in order to ennoble the object.  The pond is swamped.  Thick bushes formed.  The highest hill is Medvezhya, reaching 307 meters.

    <p>  A lot of fish and waterfowl.  In the forest surroundings, cranberries and cranberries are harvested.  Wandering through the thickets, people meet lynx, moose, hares, squirrels, foxes, roe deer and muskrat.  Near Shaitan bears live.  The point was not in vain assigned the status of a state reserve.  This is a unique natural area in need of care. </p><p>  Fishing in the Sverdlovsk region on the lake.  Ayatsky is not always convenient due to the lack of approaches.  Visitors are selected closer by truck, pitching tents.  Sandy beaches are not provided.  With great comfort, they live in fishing houses.  For a membership card, the accommodation fee is 250 rubles, without this document - 350 rubles. </p><h2>  Guest ratings </h2><p>  The state of the reserve will significantly improve the creation of convenient access roads.  Tourists overcome puddles and mud over the last two hundred meters.  Owners of machines modest in technical capabilities pass the test not without difficulty. </p><p>  The first impression is negative due to the lack of modern benefits of civilization, insufficient grooming.  People who do not so much pursue comfort as enjoy the beauty and naturalness of nature do not complain.  Complications appear when moving the boat to the shore from the car.  50 meters she has to be dragged in her hands along a swampy road.  There is no control over the machine left out of sight. </p><p>  Sandy beach, pier and parking are used only by the clients of <span>the recreation center.</span>  During waves and strong winds, fish are poorly caught.  Hooks occur due to the shallow depth and large amount of grass at the bottom.  A good bite here is a matter of chance. </p>

    <p>  In total, the lake leaves a positive mark in memory due to its size, spaciousness, and the proximity of the forest.  Those who are not afraid of the lack of amenities and are ready to go towards wildlife, will definitely like it here.  It is important to explore all sides of the lake, find the most suitable for each person.  For urban residents, this is a good chance to escape from the hustle and bustle of the day and relax on the shores of a reservoir. </p>
