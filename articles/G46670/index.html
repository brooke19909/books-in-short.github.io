    <p>  <strong>History of Saint Tropez</strong> </p><p>  The first mention of the settlement in the territory, which later became known as St. Tropez, dates back to the 2nd century BC.  e.  The city owes its name to Saint Great Martyr Tropes, who lived in the 1st century, one of the first Christians who suffered for the faith.  According to legend, by order of the <span>emperor Nero,</span> Tropes was cut off his head, and his body was put in a boat, which was nailed down to where the city is now located.  After the <span>fall of the Roman Empire</span> , the pirate emirate Fraxinet settled on the Mediterranean coast, which included St. Tropez.  France began to own these territories only in the 15th century.  The locals still celebrate the victory in the <span>naval battle</span> held in 1637 off the coast of St. Tropez, when only 4 French ships completely defeated the Spanish squadron, consisting of 22 galleons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, famous painters began to visit here.  <span>The French neo-impressionist painter</span> Paul Signac created his pointillism technique precisely in St. Tropez (France, as you know, is the birthplace of many stylistic trends in painting), and Henri Matisse drew his creative mood here.  However, the film ‚ÄúAnd God created a woman‚Äù brought true popularity to this town.  Later, a famous series of films was shot here about an energetic, but stupid policeman, in the role of which was Louis de Funes, as well as "An Umbrella Trick" and "Pool". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="san tropez france on the map" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/274681.jpg" width="600"></div>
