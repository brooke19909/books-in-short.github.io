    <h2>  How to start a business </h2><p>  A man running past a cafe or restaurant does not always have time to look into it, but he would not refuse a cup of coffee.  For such people, a coffee house on wheels is provided, which itself drives up to the client in a convenient place for him.  Such an apparatus is best moved within busy areas such as train stations or office buildings.  Mobile vans operate on battery power and in order to use it, you do not need to have your own room.  For those who do not have the means, you can start your own business by renting a coffee machine (equipped with a coffee grinder). </p><p>  Sometimes for beginning businessmen a profitable opportunity is tucked up.  Some coffee capsule companies supply machines for making such a drink.  To promote their technology, they give a coffee machine in return for a certain number of capsules purchased from them. </p><p>  After the profit will multiply and there will be an opportunity to expand your business, it will be easier to move on to the next stage.  Namely, to think about purchasing a professional coffee machine for a coffee shop.  The experience of some businessmen shows that 150,000 rubles will be needed for the most necessary equipment.  Perhaps some will be the help of buying a ready-made franchise. </p>
