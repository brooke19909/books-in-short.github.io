Each of them has its own advantages, each has a large number of attractions that you need to see.  Since the distance between Krasnoyarsk and Novosibirsk is relatively small (just over 800 km), you can travel a bit and explore both cities.  How to get from one to another? </p><h2>  The estate of Andrei Dubensky </h2><p>  Before talking about the methods of transportation, you need to at least briefly touch on the history and sights of these wonderful cities.  It‚Äôs worth starting with Krasnoyarsk because he is older. </p><p>  The city on the Yenisei was founded in 1628 by Andrei Dubensky and his Cossacks.  Then it was still a prison under the name Krasny Yar, created to protect the eastern borders.  Later, it became first a county town, then a provincial city (in 1822) and received its current name.  By the way, the whole point is the red hill on which the prison was built.  It was called Kyzyl Char, which translates as "red yard" (that is, a hill, a cliff, a hill). </p><p>  Famous people traveled to Krasnoyarsk - Fridtjof Nansen, Anton Chekhov, Emperor Nicholas II.  They all spoke warmly of him.  And how many celebrities Krasnoyarsk gave to the country!  These are artists Vasily Surikov and Andrei Pozdeev, writers Viktor Astafyev and Alexander Bushkov, athletes <span>Ivan Yarygin</span> and Sergey Lomanov, musicians Dmitry Hvorostovsky and Vyacheslav Butusov ... More recently, the winner of the music show ‚ÄúVoice‚Äù on Channel One was Daria Antonyuk, a native of Zelenogorsk, which was only 130 kilometers from the capital of the Krasnoyarsk Territory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The most important sights of the city on the Yenisei include the Communal Bridge and the Paraskevi Pyatnitsa Chapel on Karaulnaya Hill, depicted on a ten-ruble note.  The first is the oldest bridge in Krasnoyarsk (it was opened in 1961).  And the chapel of Paraskeva Fridays was erected in 1805. At first it served as a guard tower. </p><p>  This is the highest place in the city where the observation deck is now located.  It offers a beautiful view of the whole of Krasnoyarsk.  And not far from the chapel is a cannon, which every day at exactly noon gives a volley heard in every area.  Citizens can check the clock on it. </p><p>  Another observation deck is not in Krasnoyarsk itself, but on the way to the small town of Divnogorsk, near the village of Ovsyanka, where the great writer Viktor Petrovich Astafyev was born.  It is located at an altitude of 300 m. You can see from it the Yenisei, Ovsyanka, the mighty Siberian mountains.  And on the site is the ‚ÄúTsar Fish‚Äù - a sculpture of a giant sturgeon from the work of the same name by Astafyev.  This place is one of the most popular for weddings and photo shoots. </p><p>  Another attraction of the city on the Yenisei, known not only throughout the country, but also abroad is the Stolby Nature Reserve.  These are the great mountains, bordered by pine trees, cedars, deciduous trees.  Under the influence of natural conditions, over the years, the rocks have acquired bizarre shapes, reminiscent of either a person or an animal.  Therefore, their names are interesting - Feathers, Grandfather, Turtle, etc. ‚ÄúPillars‚Äù are divided into two zones - a tourist one, where everyone can walk and admire stunning beauties, and a nature reserve, where rare plants grow, animals live, and where outsiders no entry.  Seven species of plants and six species of animals living in the "Pillars" are listed in the Red Book. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Perhaps it is worth mentioning the Arc de Triomphe, located on the former main square of the city.  In the XVIII century, there was a church on this place, near it there was a market.  Krasnoyarsk grew, rebuilt, and the area ceased to be the main one, the market was removed, and the church was demolished.  In 2003, in honor of the celebration of the 375th anniversary of the city, the Triumphal Gate was erected on this site. </p><p>  Krasnoyarsk has a wide variety of monuments and fountains.  Of course, the city cannot be compared with St. Petersburg in their number, but this does not mean at all that they are in some way losing to St. Petersburg. </p><h2>  Young yes early </h2><p>  Novosibirsk, although much younger than Krasnoyarsk, is not inferior to it in either grandeur or beauty.  It occupies the third place in Russia in <span>terms of population,</span> although it is only 124 years old (formed in 1893).  This is the largest metropolis of Siberia. </p><p>  The need for a new settlement arose because the Great Siberian Route ‚Äî the Trans-Siberian Railway ‚Äî was being built.  It was necessary to live somewhere for workers - railway workers and bridge builders.  So there was a small village Alexandrovsky, named after Alexander III.  After 2 years, he received a different name - Novo-Nikolaevsky.  In 1917 it was renamed Novo-Nikolaevsk, and already in 1926 - in Novosibirsk.  Since 1962, it has been a millionaire city. </p><p>  The city on the Ob gave the world many talents, including engineer Nikolai Garin-Mikhailovsky (a street and a metro station were named in Novosibirsk), military pilot Alexander Pokryshkin, singers Yanka Diaghilev and Pelageya, actors Irina Alferova, Andrey Panin, Alexander Pushnoy and Tatyana Lazareva, athlete Alexander Karelin, film director Andrei Zvyagintsev ... </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Of the attractions of Novosibirsk, significantly distinguishing it from Krasnoyarsk, it is worth highlighting the metro.  Although small (only two branches), but it is.  The metro appeared in 1985 and is popular with the townspeople.  Of all the stations, the ‚ÄúRiver Station‚Äù is worth highlighting.  It is ground-underground, passes along the longest covered metro bridge in the world (more than 2 thousand meters).  The station is also interesting because stained glass images of various Siberian cities are located on its walls.  Also unusual is the Gagarinskaya station, the ceiling of which creates the illusion of a starry sky, and on the walls are portraits of the first cosmonaut - Yuri Gagarin. </p><p>  Akademgorodok is another attraction of the city.  No wonder Novosibirsk is considered the best scientific center.  There are dozens of different research institutes.  State University is also located there.  It is important that the buildings of Akademgorodok are scattered in the forest.  The nature of this place is almost untouched, therefore it is comfortable to breathe there and at any time you can walk along the forest paths.  Akademgorodok was founded in 1957 and since then has been the pride of the townspeople. </p><p>  One of the largest zoos in Russia is also located in Novosibirsk.  Even rare and endangered species of animals live in it.  And it opened only as a small zoo in 1933. Since then, it has grown significantly and occupies about 60 hectares.  Favorite visitors are a family of polar bears - there is always a huge crowd around them. </p>

    <p>  The Opera and Ballet Theater, located in the city center, on Lenin Square, is the largest beyond the Urals.  This is the largest theater in Russia - even more than the Moscow Bolshoi Theater.  Its dimensions exceed 11,000 m¬≤. </p><p>  There are fewer fountains in Novosibirsk than in Krasnoyarsk, but the city on the Ob is not inferior to its brother in the number of monuments.  What sculptures you will not find here - a monument to sausage, and a monument to a traffic light, and a sewing machine, and Vovka from the Far Far Away Kingdom ... </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  So, how to get directions from Krasnoyarsk to Novosibirsk?  There are several ways.  The cheapest one is by car, the fastest by plane, the easiest by train, and the most sophisticated by bus. </p><h2>  By rail </h2><p>  A train journey from one city to another takes approximately 12 hours.  On some formulations - a little faster, on some - a little longer.  Trains from Novosibirsk to Krasnoyarsk and vice versa run during the day, but perhaps the most convenient option would be to travel at night - sat in the evening, arrived in the morning. </p>

    <p>  The cost of tickets for a reserved seat car varies from 1,500 to 2,900 rubles, depending on the selected train.  Branded trains are always more expensive.  Prices in a compartment car are higher: from 2,300 to 5,700 rubles.  And about 10 thousand will cost a luxury ticket. </p><h2>  By air </h2><p>  In order not to spend half a day, many people prefer traveling by plane.  In addition, the distance from Krasnoyarsk to Novosibirsk is small.  The plane overcomes it in just over one hour.  The price here is, of course, higher. </p><p>  Different carriers request a different amount.  So, for example, the UTair company can fly a little more than 5 thousand.  You need to consider the cost of a taxi from the airport to the city - about 1,000 rubles.  Like trains, planes between Krasnoyarsk and Novosibirsk fly every day. </p><h2>  By bus </h2><p>  Previously, a bus ran daily between two cities.  He left the Krasnoyarsk bus station at 13:30, arrived at the <span>Novosibirsk station</span> at 3:30 (traffic time - 15 hours).  Obviously, he was not popular.  Not everyone can sit for 15 hours in an armchair (far from always comfortable), so it was canceled. </p><p>  Compared to an airplane, train, or even a car (the latter goes faster), the bus loses.  However, for fans of extreme sports, there is still a way to get to Novosibirsk from Krasnoyarsk by bus route.  You need to take a bus to Kemerovo, make a change there to the small town of Leninsk-Kuznetsk, and from there you can get to Novosibirsk.  However, this method will take a sufficient amount of time and money, so it‚Äôs worth several times to think before choosing this particular route. </p><h2>  By car </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnoyarsk Novosibirsk distance by car" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1948788.jpg" width="490"></div></h2><p>  For owners of a personal car, it is possible to get from one point to another by car, but on condition that the driver is not afraid of expressways.  The distance by car from Krasnoyarsk to Novosibirsk is approximately 790 km.  When traveling at an average speed of 80-90 km / h, you can overcome it in 10-11 hours. </p><p>  Those who have tried this option, note the good condition of the track, which does not interfere even with the permanent repairs of various sections of the road, and the clear visibility of the markings even at night.  The only negative, as on any highway, is the constantly meeting trucks, which are sometimes difficult to overtake. </p><p>  With a fuel cost of 35-36 rubles.  and consumption of 10 liters per 100 km, the issue price will be about 3,000 rubles.  The advantage of this method of movement is its speed (with the exception of the aircraft, this is the fastest option) and independence from anyone but yourself.  The disadvantage is in sufficient inconvenience compared to a comfortable ride on a train or plane. </p><p>  Whatever method a person chooses for himself, in fact, this is not so important.  The main thing is to visit two beautiful cities of our country and see with their own eyes their beauty. </p>
