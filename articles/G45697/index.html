Among the leading destinations among the Russians are still Thailand, Turkey, the Dominican Republic, Israel and, of course, domestic resorts in the Krasnodar Territory and Crimea.  However, despite the fact that Russians increasingly choose Sochi, Anapa or Yalta, in the fall and winter, for example, these places cannot give the opportunity to swim in the sea and sunbathe in the sun, even though they are in subtropical latitudes and in palm trees on the embankments of these cities.  So what to do for those who want not only to change the atmosphere and relax, but also to dive with a mask and snorkel, while spending less money than at home?  There is an exit! </p><h2>  Holidays in Turkey </h2><p>  Turkey is now a paradise for those who are looking for a budget holiday.  Prices for tours to this country are insanely attractive, you can spend two or even three times less than in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory (and this, taking into account the flight!).  The reason for this generosity is that due to political circumstances, the Turkish government subsidizes hotels that host guests from Russia.  This happened after the coast of Turkey was again open for tourists from our country after a short interstate conflict.  Turkey has traditionally earned millions in the entertainment and resort industries, so losing customers is like a disaster for it.  Therefore, the government is doing everything in its power to lure foreigners into its warm sandy beaches and cozy hotels with a chic level of service.  And with all this, you can meet the 40 or 50 thousand rubles for an excellent hotel room on the first line on an all-inclusive basis.  There are also a lot of destinations in Turkey itself, this country is located between the Black and Mediterranean Sea, there are thousands and tens of thousands of hotels for every taste and budget in various cities and regions of this warm southern state.  Today we will consider one of the quite popular and very worthy places - Orfeus Park Hotel 4 * hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Side </h2><p>  Side is the name of a small town.  It is constantly inhabited by just over ten thousand people.  This settlement is located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, from here it is close at hand to Antalya (only 75 kilometers).  The climate here is beautiful and very favorable, especially for families with small children: in winter the temperature rarely drops below 15-17 degrees Celsius, in summer it is a comfortable 30 degrees with a plus sign.  You can swim in the sea almost all year round, the water temperature almost never drops below 18-19 degrees Celsius.  There are two beaches in Side: west and east.  Both of them are marked with the Blue Flag - this is an international award testifying that these beaches comply with all environmental standards and have a high-quality infrastructure.  The western beach is considered safer, the entrance to the water there is gentle, under the feet - a sand.  This contributes to the fact that in the high season there really are a lot of people, especially families with children.  The eastern beach is less popular, but it is also very crowded there.  Both beaches offer a huge range of water and not only water entertainments, lifeguards are on duty here, and cozy restaurants and authentic cafes are located near the beaches.  Also, this region has a very rich history, many ancient buildings and artifacts have been preserved here.  In Side is one of the most popular hotels - Orfeus Park Hotel 4 *.  We will talk about all this a bit later, but for now we‚Äôll figure out how to get to Side on our own. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Side </h2><p>  Side is a very popular resort, including among Russians.  Therefore, Russian and Turkish carriers provide maximum access to this resort.  Of course, the most affordable, popular and fastest way to get to Side is air travel.  Almost all major Russian cities have flights to Antalya.  From there, you can get to the destination by taxi, bus or by transfer - in time it takes only about an hour on a good smooth road.  Airfare may vary and vary depending on the date of booking and time of year, now prices start at $ 250.  You will have to spend three and a half hours on the plane, which, in general, is not so much. </p><p>  There are also other, more extreme options: to get on a bus (three days on the way from Moscow) or on your own car.  Ferries between Russia and Turkey also run from Sochi, but after you go ashore, you will have to spend almost 24 hours in the comfortable armchair of a comfortable bus to Side and to the 4-star Orfeus Park Hotel. </p><h2>  Side Attractions </h2><p>  As for the sights, here, as we noted above, there really is something to see.  Some people call this place a "city-museum", with which, in fact, it is difficult to argue.  Many sightseeing objects have a history of many thousands - some monuments were created by man even before our era.  First of all, you should go to the very center of the city - this is a historical district, the so-called old city.  Antique buildings with amazing architecture have been preserved here.  Some buildings, of course, turned into ruins under the influence of time and various military conflicts, but some of the "exhibits" still delight the eyes of tourists and local residents.  Here you can visit the remains of the ancient Greek city of Agora, next to which are the destroyed fragments of the oldest stone building in all of Turkey - the basilica.  But even among the ruins you can see Byzantine symbols engraved on the stone, and next to this place is a small bishop's chapel and palace, which were erected a little later.  In high season, there are a lot of tourists in these places, and in the ancient city it can be very hot and stuffy, so do not forget sunscreen, a hat and a bottle of cool water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  If you come here for drive, emotions and entertainment, welcome to the noisy nightclubs, which here and there attract guests with bright lights and loud music.  As for shopping, in Side this is not as good as in large cities.  If you want to buy something, then it is better to go to neighboring Antalya, since in Side itself prices are too high, and the choice is very small.  But all markets, shops, beaches and other entertainments are almost within walking distance from the largest hotels, including the Orfeus Park Hotel 4 * in Side, which we‚Äôll talk about now. </p><h2>  Differences of the hotel 4 * from 5 * </h2><p>  But first, briefly dwell on what is the difference between a 4 star hotel and a five star hotel.  Of course, the first thing that immediately catches your eye is the price.  Sometimes two almost identical hotels, the difference of which is in one star, have prices that differ by half.  In fact, ‚Äústardom‚Äù is, of course, an indicator of the level of service and quality of the hotel, but when it comes to 4 stars or 5, there are practically no differences.  There is a regulation accepted by the international community and a list of requirements by which hotels are given stars.  If you carefully study these documents, it turns out that the difference is in the details: the number of elevators, their waiting time, the presence of a canopy in front of the entrance or the cleaning time.  Moreover, all the differences are seconds (if we are talking about the waiting time or the cleaning time), but the prices are growing at times.  It is not easy to get five stars, but it‚Äôs an honor, the hotel management really does a lot of work, but it‚Äôs not always worth overpaying for it.  Today we are talking about the hotel Orfeus Park Hotel 4 * in Turkey, which is one of the best in price and level of service in this country. </p>
