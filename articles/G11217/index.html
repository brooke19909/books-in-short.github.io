This means that you will need to transfer all user files (music, photos and videos), contact information, received messages, reminders and calendar events. </p><h2>  Method number 1 - iclaud.com </h2><p>  <span>There are four ways to transfer contacts from iPhone to Android:</span> </p><ol><li>  Each user of Apple technology must have <span>an Apple</span> ID <span>account</span> , it is required not only for successfully downloading applications from the AppStore store, but also for synchronizing a PC, phone or tablet with iCloud cloud storage. </li><li>  The main thing to remember here is that when you start exporting, you must definitely configure the synchronization of contact information.  To do this in the iCloud settings, the slider next to the "Contacts" item is turned on. </li><li>  To do this, you need to log in from a full browser from a PC. </li><li>  Using your Apple ID account, open the iCloud cloud storage site and log in.  Select "Contacts" and wait for the complete download of the contact list.  Using the key combinations CTRL + A (for Windows) or CMD + A (for MAC), all contacts in the list are selected. </li><li>  In the lower left corner, click on the gear icon and select "Export vCard". </li><li>  A computer browser automatically downloads a file with the vcf extension.  It is in it that all contacts are stored.  This file must be sent to the new device and export started. </li></ol><p>  This method of action, such as transferring contacts from iPhone to Android, is ideal for both new smartphones and ‚Äúlast century‚Äù cell phones. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Method number 2 - My Contacts Backup </h2><p>  The AppStore store has many applications for every taste that make it possible to export contacts from the Apple gadget.  We offer to stop your attention on the free utility My Contacts Backup. </p><p>  To perform the transfer of contacts you need to take a few simple steps: </p><ol><li>  The first thing, as you already understood, is to download and install the My Contacts Backup application and allow it access to the contacts of the iPhone smartphone. </li><li>  Next, click on the green Backup button and wait for the process to complete. </li><li>  Then you need to click on the E-mail button and send a vcf file to your mail. </li><li>  Download the vcf file from mail and run it, while the export of contacts will happen automatically. </li></ol><h2>  Method number 3 - iCloud + Dropbox </h2><p>  If the previously analyzed method No. 1 required the presence of a stationary computer, then in the third method we will consider the possibility of how to transfer phones from iPhone to Android using the standard iOS browser - Safari. </p><ol><li>  On an iPhone smartphone in Safari, you need to go to iCloud.com </li><li>  You should click the "Share" button and find the item "Full version of the site". </li><li>  After the full version of the page is loaded, you need to log in by entering your details from your Apple ID account. </li><li>  After successful authorization, you will be taken to the iCloud application menu. </li><li>  Open the Contacts menu. </li><li>  In the lower left corner you need to click on the gear and double-tap "Select all".  As soon as all the contact information turns blue, you need to re-click on the gear and select "Export vCard" already. </li><li>  After the vcf-file is fully loaded, a new tab will open in the Safari browser, in it you must select the "Open in ..." item and save it in any cloud service convenient for you: DropBox, Google Drive, OneDrive and others. </li><li>  And the last thing to do is download the file from the cloud storage and export the contacts to the memory of the new gadget. </li></ol><h2>  Method number 4 - CardDAV </h2><p>  Another way to transfer contact information from iPhone to Android is to use the special CardDAV application and the server, of course, iCloud. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ri.gov" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to transfer contacts from iPhone to Android" class="if uuid-2256051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64787/2256051.jpg"></div><ol><li>  From Google Play to an Android gadget, you need to install an application called CardDAV. </li><li>  In the full list of accounts, select the CardDAV application and click on its launch. </li><li>  As a server, you need to use the p02-contacts.icloud.com format entry.  In the "Name" and "User Password" fields, account information with an Apple ID is entered.  Click the "Next" command. </li><li>  We synchronize contact information from the server to the phone, and then click "Finish." </li><li>  During synchronization, contacts are automatically transferred to the memory of our new smartphone. </li></ol><p>  The idea above the proposed method, how to transfer numbers from iPhone to Android, is to export your contacts directly from the Apple server. </p><h2>  Transfer data to Android from your iPhone </h2><p>  It should be remembered that the successful transfer of data depends on the preparation of both devices, namely both gadgets must be connected to the Internet, and their batteries are 100% charged. </p><p>  Also note that during the data migration period you cannot give devices any third-party commands, run other programs and applications, or initiate a series of actions that are directly related to a decrease in data transfer speed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The question of how to transfer photos from iPhone to Android is now resolved. </p><p>  In order to successfully complete the transfer, make sure that there is more than enough free space on the second one, and if for technical reasons it is still not enough, you should take care of the installed additional memory in the form of a flash drive. </p><h2>  How to copy files from one device to another? </h2><p>  Copying files from iPhone to Android can be done with both Windows and Mac. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blogs.technet.microsoft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer photos from iPhone to android" class="if uuid-2256770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64787/2256770.jpg"></div><ul><li>  For Windows, you must connect your iPhone to the PC.  Then you need to go to the ‚ÄúMy Computer‚Äù folder and find the iPhone there.  Then we double-click on it with the left mouse button and find all our media files on the device, then copy them to the folder created in advance on the desktop of the personal computer.  After that, according to the same scheme, the copied files are transferred to a smartphone or tablet with the Android operating system. </li><li>  For Mac OS, you also need to connect your Apple smartphone to your PC at the very beginning, then open the application called ‚ÄúImage Capture‚Äù.  After that, the user should click on the ‚ÄúDownload All‚Äù button and export everything to a previously created folder on the desktop.  With this simple action, all the necessary files will be transferred, now you can start the process of copying them to a device with Android OS. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="geek-nose.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to transfer information from iPhone to Android" class="if uuid-2256800" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64787/2256800.jpg"></div><h2>  We move to a new platform without data loss </h2><p>  When moving from one system to the second, the user figuratively packs suitcases with all media files, contact information, reminders, calendars and other values. </p><p>  But how to transfer messages from iPhone to Android?  In the form in which they are displayed on an iOS device, messages cannot be read on Android OS.  Further, we will consider how and in what format to convert messages for migration from one system to another. </p><h2>  Transfer SMS messages from iPhone to Android using iTunes </h2><p>  Before transferring SMS messages from the Apple device to Android, you need to extract them.  To do this, you need to connect your iPhone to a personal computer via a USB cable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="androidphones.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer numbers from iphone to android" class="if uuid-2257288" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64787/2257288.jpg"></div><p>  Then you need to open the iTunes application.  When you connect the device, you will see a button with the iOS logo, which is located on the top panel, you just need to press it.  In this way, the <span>backup</span> process will automatically start and Summary will appear on the screen. </p><p>  At the end, on the PC, you need to find the exported file with SMS messages, it looks like this: 3d0d7e5fb2ce288813306e4d4636395e047a3d28.  The file is located, as a rule, in the most recent folder. </p><p>  The found file must also be copied to the Android device. </p><p>  After that, convert using the free iSMS2droid service.  To do this, you need to go to the https://isms2droid.com/ link in the browser, follow the step-by-step instructions, click ‚ÄúSelect SMS database in iPhone‚Äù, load the previously backed up file with SMS messages. </p><p>  The conversion process will be displayed on the display, after which you will need to download the SMS Backup &amp; Restore utility and only then start the SMS recovery process on the Android device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="artkiev.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer phones from iphone to android" class="if uuid-2257308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64787/2257308.jpg"></div><h2>  Transfer notes from "apple" to "Android" through the Gmail service </h2><p>  Today, perhaps, there is no such person who was not using Google.  And, most likely, it will be Google that will be the easiest way to transfer notes between iPhone and Android.  Using the Google Sync application, you can synchronize your iPhone using Gmail mail in minutes.  After you establish a full-fledged working connection, you can synchronize notes, calendars, photo and video files, contacts with your Gmail account. </p><p>  After you perform these simple tricks, notes from the iPhone are automatically transferred through your Gmail account and will be displayed as Notes.  Now you just have to log in to your new gadget with the Android operating system under your Gmail account. </p><p>  That's all!  These are the easiest ways to transfer information from iPhone to Android. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ua-mac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to transfer messages from iphone to android" class="if uuid-2257295" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64787/2257295.jpg"></div><p>  Recently, the fact that it is possible to create synchronization not only between different devices, but also between different operating systems cannot but rejoice.  After all, it was not so long ago that it was possible to move information only in manual mode, spending a lot of precious time on it.  And now the user can in two accounts connect all the available gadgets. </p><p>  Therefore, we can say with full confidence that the question: "How to transfer all information from" iPhone "to" Android "?"  today should not arise. </p>
