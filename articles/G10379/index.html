    <h2>  The reasons for the revolution: version number 1 </h2><p>  It is quite difficult to clearly understand and define the essence of the processes that led to the emergence of protest sentiments in Chinese student society.  There are two versions of the reasons. </p><p>  The essence of the first is that the liberal reforms carried out since 1978 in the Chinese economy and political system have not been brought to an end.  Proponents of the continuation of radical changes in the West European and American patterns believed that the logical conclusion of liberalization should be the gradual removal of the CP of China from total control over the country.  Students advocated for democracy and human rights.  The USSR and perestroika undertaken by President of the USSR Gorbachev were the reference point, a model that was supported by supporters of such a view on the development of China. </p>

    <h2>  Version number 2 </h2><p>  Part of the Chinese youth went to Tiananmen Square (1989) to uphold the ideal of China's development, which Mao Zedong defended.  They believed that the development of private property, business and other capitalist factors would have a detrimental effect on the development of a great state. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For supporters of these views, democratization was needed as an instrument of influence on the national government.  In their opinion, market reforms could lead to strong unrest and social disasters.  People were afraid of changes in the traditional Chinese society of peasants and artisans. </p><h2>  Course of events </h2><p>  The events on the Tiananmen Square in 1989 took place on the principle of Maidan in Ukraine: </p><ul><li>  a large free territory in the Chinese capital was chosen for protests; </li><li>  a tent camp has been created; </li><li>  there was a certain hierarchy among the participants; </li><li>  financial support was provided by sponsors from the Communist Party. </li></ul>

    <p>  The revolution began on April 27, 1989.  At first, the protests were not massive, but the total number of participants was gradually growing.  The social structure of the protesters was heterogeneous.  The following groups of people gathered on the square: </p><ul><li>  students </li><li>  factory and factory workers; </li><li>  intelligentsia; </li><li>  peasants. </li></ul><p>  In late April and early May, all the protests took place peacefully.  The tent city lived its ordinary life.  Of course, the country's authorities could not tolerate this protest in the capital for a long time.  The <span>Communist Party of China</span> appealed to the people 4 times to disperse, but these words were never heard.  Unfortunately, the demonstrators made a mistake.  It consisted in the fact that they did not comply with the order of the authorities.  So many people paid for disobedience to life. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On May 20, a meeting of the leadership of the Communist Party and Beijing took place, at which it was decided to impose martial law in the city.  At that time it was already clear to the whole world that an armed dispersal of the action was being prepared.  The country's leadership could not make concessions to the protesters, as this could undermine the power of the ruling party. </p><p>  Tiananmen Square (1989) was crowded with people.  Thousands of protesters expressed the protest mood of Chinese society.  On June 3, a military operation began to disperse its citizens.  At first, the authorities did not want to use serious weapons, so unarmed soldiers of the National Liberation Army of China tried to enter the square.  The protesters did not let them in, so the top decided to use tanks to shoot and disperse the demonstrators. </p><p>  On the evening of June 3, tanks appeared in the city.  They made their way through the barricades.  The militarized organizations of the protesters entered into an open confrontation with the tank units of the PLA.  By destroying the tracks, the vehicles were neutralized and then set on fire.  About 14-15 tanks were eliminated.  Already on June 4, events on Tiananmen Square (1989) began to develop according to a more cruel scenario: </p><ul><li>  execution of peaceful demonstrators; </li><li>  confrontation between people and soldiers; </li><li>  crowding out people from the square. </li></ul>

    <h2>  The number of victims of the revolution </h2><p>  An official investigation into the 1989 events in Beijing has not yet been conducted.  All information from Chinese sources is classified. </p><p>  According to representatives of the State Council of China, the civilian population was not shot at all, but more than 300 soldiers of the Chinese army died.  The version of the authorities is understandable: the army behaved culturally, and protesters killed soldiers. </p><p>  The representative of Hong Kong in an interview with foreign reporters said that, according to him, about 600 people were killed.  But there are more terrifying statistics, which feature thousands of victims of the execution on the square.  The New York Times published information from Amnesty International.  Human rights activists received data that the number of victims of the June 4 events reached 1,000 people.  The death toll according to journalist Edward Timperlake ranges from 4 to 6 thousand people (both among protesters and among soldiers).  NATO representatives spoke about 7 thousand victims of the tragedy, and the USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs - about 10,000 people killed. </p>

    <p>  Tiananmen Square -1989 left a bright bloody trail in world history.  Of course, it will never be possible to find out the exact number of victims of those clashes. </p><h2>  Effects </h2><p>  Oddly enough, but the events of spring - summer 1989 had a long-lasting positive effect for the country.  The overall strategic and real results are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Western sanctions were short-lived; </li><li>  the political system of the country, led by the Communist Party of the PRC, strengthened and stabilized; </li><li>  liberalization and democratization of economic and domestic policies continued; </li><li>  increased economic growth; </li><li>  over 25 years, the country has become a strong superstate. </li></ul><h2>  Lessons for the future </h2><p>  All world totalitarian leaders of the 21st century should recall China-1989.  Tiananmen Square has become a symbol of the unwavering will of the people to live better.  Yes, people did not have the task of overthrowing the government, but in any other country protests can have completely different goals.  It is worth listening to the people and taking into account their interests in the process of building the economic and social policy of the state.  Tiananmen Square in 1989 is a symbol of the struggle of ordinary people for their rights! </p>
