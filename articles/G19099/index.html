Good beaches - both landscaped and wild.  A wide offer of housing - all this is Kabardinka.  The private sector in this area has flourished since Soviet times.  But modern life has made adjustments to the variety of services.  What does Kabardinka offer us? <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kabardinka private sector" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/321412.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Rest, private sector, prices in the village </h2><p>  The traditional rent of a room, apartment or house in the village is probably the most convenient, well-known and inexpensive type of vacation.  However, it should be said that there are practically no such proposals in the Kabardinka on the so-called ‚Äúfirst line‚Äù.  The entire coastal area is occupied by various <span>sanatoriums, bases, pensions</span> and camps.  This should be guided when coming to a resort such as Kabardinka.  The private sector offers accommodation here, ranging from a 5-10 minute walk to the sea and ending with an hour (if you rent a room somewhere closer to the outskirts).  The most popular holiday destinations are for rent in the center of the village, from where it is close to the beach and shops.  However, more distant areas are captivating with excellent conditions, not so expensive prices and a different range of services included in the price.  Moreover, these places are often more comfortable than in the main streets.  The average cost of housing in high season is 300-500 rubles per person per day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kabardinka leisure private prices" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2647/321776.jpg" width="566"></div>

There are so many offers here that the option is quite good - to come to the place and decide.  But if you still think that you should not spend the first day of vacation searching for housing, you can contact the owners by phone or e-mail (and many owners of good new homes have Wi-Fi) and agree on everything in advance.  Rest in the private sector in Kabardinka has the charm that gives you complete freedom of action, comfort, like in a good hotel, but at the same time you can choose whether to eat in cafes and canteens, or cook at home from products bought in the market or in the supermarket.  In addition, many owners are guides at the same time - they can take you to the mountains with their own transport and show you amazing places in the Caucasus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in the private sector in Kabardinka" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/321416.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  What tourists say about local housing </h2><p>  Many vacationers admit that homeowners often turn out to be decent and helpful people who really offer many different quality services.  Most often, such reviews are found about rooms and houses located on the outskirts of the village of Kabardinka.  The private sector is usually represented by welcoming people.  They offer beautifully furnished rooms with all amenities, houses in the garden, among the greenery, sometimes with pools, beautiful playgrounds, parking lots and garages.  Often you can order food - at the request of tourists.  But the most important thing is that the people here really like to receive guests and every year they try to improve the conditions for their relaxation. </p>
