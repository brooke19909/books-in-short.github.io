For those who are engaged in needlework, this is also an exciting activity.  Even a beginner can make such a tree on his own, but for this lesson you need, in addition to the basic materials, be patient, because the work will be painstaking. </p><h2>  Materials </h2><p>  In order to weave a tree of beads with your own hands, you need the following materials: beads, thin wire for weaving, thick wire for forming the trunk.  In addition, you need gypsum, a container for the tree.  Of the tools: wire cutters, a toothpick, scissors and foil. </p><p>  For a small tree, about 100 g of beads will be required.  Color depends on the wishes of the master.  To make the tree look more natural, it is advisable to mix 3-4 shades of the same color.  With this approach, the finished tree plays with highlights and tints of flowers, as if illuminated by the sun. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.ru" data-author=": miss.k85, "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself bead tree" class="if uuid-2399414" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2399414.jpg"></div><p>  If you plan not only to make a tree of beads with your own hands, but to supplement it with coins or beads, then you need to prepare the appropriate materials. </p><p>  The wire will fit ordinary copper or thin multi-colored, which is sold in needlework stores.  It is important that she keeps her shape. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the trunk you will need a piece of thick wire, a branch or a rod of a suitable size made of durable material. </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  As in nature there are no two identical trees, so in the manufacture of each time will be obtained different options.  Today you can find many workshops on how to make a tree from beads with your own hands.  There are many options: birch, mountain ash, apple tree, blooming lilac, tree, sakura, maple, grapes.  Depending on the model of the tree, assembly schemes also differ.  A novice will also cope with some options, and some models need certain skills to work with beads. </p><p>  The following are ways to make a bead tree with your own hands for beginners. </p><ol><li>  Mix the beads in one container. </li><li>  Cut a piece of wire 70 cm long. </li><li>  String 5-7 beads and, after scrolling the wire a couple of times, make a loop, stepping back from the end of the wire for at least 10 cm. The result is a leaf. </li><li>  At a distance of 0.5 cm from the first leaflet, make the second.  And so on to the end of the wire. </li><li>  At the end, at least 10 cm should remain to form twigs and connect them together. </li><li>  To simplify the process, you can string several tens (by ¬º of the wire length) beads at once, and then twist the leaves. </li><li>  The resulting wire with loops must be framed.  To do this, you need to pick up one of the tips, hold the first ‚Äúleaflet‚Äù with your fingers and start scrolling the rest of the wire with eyelets around the first leaflet until the last leaflet is wound.  Connect the ends. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="thewom.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bead trees for beginners" class="if uuid-2403523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2403523.jpg"></div><p>  The twig is ready.  They will need to make about 90 pieces for a small tree.  To make the tree bigger, you need to proportionally increase the number of branches. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself bead trees for beginners" class="if uuid-2399358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2399358.jpg"></div><h2>  Little addition </h2><p>  If you make sakura, then the loops are made in the same way, but the algorithm for subsequent twisting of the branch changes.  In this case, you need to start from the central loop.  Twisting is carried out along the "branch" so that the leaves are located opposite each other. </p><p>  If you plan to weave coins or beads that will imitate the fruits, then you need to weave them at the stage of branch formation.  For every third branch you need to fix an additional element. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY trees photo from beads" class="if uuid-2399402" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2399402.jpg"></div><h2>  Crown </h2><p>  When all the branches for a tree of beads with your own hands are ready, you can start assembling the crown.  Three branches are woven into one larger.  Then these three branches are connected into an even larger one.  The three largest are connected in a bundle.  From 90 small branches you need to form 3 bunches.  Then, with the help of wire, they are woven into one trunk, forming the crown of a tree. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a tree from beads with your own hands" class="if uuid-2399384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2399384.jpg"></div><p>  The length of the branches during twisting is formed at the request of the master.  If you make the branches short, then the crown will be thick, if the branches are long, then the crown will be airy and openwork. </p><h2>  Trunk </h2><p>  Do-it-yourself tree trunk made of beads can be made as described below.  When the crown is assembled, then at the top where the branches are intertwined, the trunk is wide, but the lower it is, the thinner it is.  Therefore, you need to strengthen it and make it thicker.  For this, a strong thick wire, rod, branch or even a felt-tip pen or pencil that has served its purpose will do.  Using a thin wire, the barrel blank is screwed tightly to the crown.  ‚ÄúPonytails‚Äù remaining from the branches are evenly wrapped around the base. </p><p>  And then - improvisation.  You can thicken the trunk and make bark in various ways.  For example, wrapping thin strips of fabric or paper.  You can wrap with wire, the same as the tree is made of, making beautiful even turns.  Or decorate the trunk with polymer clay or gypsum. </p><p>  If gypsum is chosen as the material, then you must immediately prepare the container in which the future tree will ‚Äúgrow‚Äù.  Dilute the building mixture to the density of village sour cream and put in a container.  Set the tree and secure so that it stands level.  In order not to stain the beads, you can pre-wrap the crown with foil. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself bead trees" class="if uuid-2399422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2399422.jpg"></div><p>  Coat the trunk with gypsum, giving it the desired shape.  After complete drying, dilute a small amount of gypsum or finishing putty to the same consistency and grease the base and trunk of the tree with a thin layer.  With a toothpick, draw grooves on the bark and roots to give the wood a natural look.  Thick branches can also be covered with gypsum. </p><p>  After drying, we proceed to the "revitalization" of the tree.  It is necessary to color the bark in the selected color.  Acrylic paints or gouache are suitable for work.  Painting is carried out in 2-3 steps, so that the color is deep, rich and even, without bald spots. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself bead trees" class="if uuid-2399463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2399463.jpg"></div><p>  In the end, you can varnish the entire composition.  Then remove the foil and spread the leaves. </p><h2>  Dressing </h2><p>  After drying, the bead tree, made by one's own steps step by step according to the instructions, is almost ready.  It remains to decorate the base.  You can paint the soil or lay out the base with pebbles, beads, artificial moss, sisal.  You can complement the landscape with a bench, mushrooms, a small hut and other decorative elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handmadebase.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself bead trees" class="if uuid-2399430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2399430.jpg"></div><p>  Here's how to make a tree of beads with your own hands.  It will become an adornment of any interior.  Such creations can be made both for yourself and as a gift to relatives and friends.  After all, this is an exclusive thing, one of a kind. </p><p>  The presented photos of trees made from beads with their own hands are a source of inspiration.  After all, it is worth making one small tree, as there is a desire to repeat this creative process again and again, creating new masterpieces each time. </p>
