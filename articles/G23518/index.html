How to make a butterfly?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Before the celebrations, whether it‚Äôs a wedding party, a child‚Äôs birthday or other significant event, people begin to think about decorating the house.  Of course, you can always hire special agents who will do everything in the best possible way, but this is an additional waste of money.  Why not use your own skills and imagination?  It will turn out no worse, you will have to make some efforts, but the result will exceed all expectations.  So, the article will discuss how to make a butterfly out of paper. </p><h2>  What are the options </h2><p>  The easiest way to make the perfect detail for decorating the interior is with a template.  Here you need colored cardboard and scissors to cut a figure.  To fix the resulting beauties, you will need pins or double-sided tape.  But the place for the butterflies will have to decide on their own.  It can be curtains, tablecloths or vases. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper butterfly" class="if uuid-2257260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2257260.jpg"></div><p>  What else is there a way <span>to make a butterfly</span> with your own hands?  When using paints for drawing, contours are created, then the figure is painted over and cut out.  Another option is gluing cardboard with any fabric you like.  Some craftsmen go further and use the plotter to cut butterflies with patterned wings.  At the end of the work, you can apply varnish to cover to get an unforgettable decoration. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What will be needed to complete the crafts </h2><p>  As mentioned above, there are various techniques to make butterflies.  Depending on the chosen method, you will need to acquire the necessary tools and materials. </p><p>  Now we will talk about how to make a butterfly in the style of origami.  Here you need colored or white paper, and for everything else you have your own hands.  Before starting work, you need to check whether the following materials are available in the house: </p><ul><li>  different types of paper; </li><li>  transparent glue; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  elements for decoration, you can use beads or sequins; </li><li>  colored pencils, felt-tip pens, paints; </li><li>  wire; </li><li>  threads. </li></ul><p>  After making sure of the presence of all of the above, you can proceed to the creation of these masterpieces. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lucrurifrumoase.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a paper butterfly with your own hands" class="if uuid-2257267" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2257267.jpg"></div><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  To understand how to make an origami butterfly, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the following points: </p><ol><li>  A square sheet of paper is folded twice diagonally, then unfolds.  All fold lines must be ironed so that they are clearly visible. </li><li>  Then the paper is folded in half in vertical and horizontal planes, to then give the craft a triangular shape. </li><li>  This figure will turn out when folding the opposite sides of the sheet. </li><li>  In the next step, you need to wrap the corners to the top of the triangle. </li><li>  The side next to the bent corners is bent, and the wings of the craft are straightened. </li></ol><p>  How to make a butterfly?  This question is considered above. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a butterfly out of paper" class="if uuid-2257264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2257264.jpg"></div><h2>  Another option for making crafts </h2><p>  It should be noted right away that the technique, which will be described later, is more time-consuming, but gives more opportunities for the realization of their own artistic abilities.  The most difficult thing is to decide on the desired image, which will be printed for making the layout.  Eyes always run up from the number of options offered, and most importantly, they are all very beautiful. </p><p>  The next step is to print the selected image on any printer.  The future layout is almost ready.  The image is applied to the cardboard, then the contours are drawn with a pencil.  All that remains is to cut the workpiece.  If necessary, you can create several templates that will have a different shape and size from each other. </p><p>  Note to needlewomen!  To create a composition that will surprise all guests with its beauty and reality, it is recommended to make butterflies of different sizes. </p><p>  It remains to do the decoration of the resulting models.  Compared to the technology already described (how to make a butterfly out of paper with your own hands), there are much more opportunities to create a unique and elegant figure. </p><p>  For coloring, markers, pencils, felt-tip pens or paints are used.  With a small fraction of the artistic gift, you can give paper butterflies the coloring that their nature has awarded.  To make the model even more realistic is quite simple when using beads or beads of dark color, which will act as an eye. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lucrurifrumoase.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper butterflies" class="if uuid-2257273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2257273.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a butterfly with the help of the vytynanka technique </h2><p>  Do not be afraid of an unfamiliar, unusual word.  It only means cutting out all kinds of figures from thick paper.  Such technology can even be attributed to folk art. </p><p>  If we talk about the stages of work, they look like this: </p><ol><li>  The image of a butterfly is applied on thick paper.  You can draw it yourself or use any suitable pattern. </li><li>  Cutting is done either with special tools or well-sharpened scissors. </li></ol><p>  As it turns out, making butterflies is quite easy and simple, you just need to choose the right option, stock up on some patience and get to work. </p>
