According to the definitions of all explanatory dictionaries, this is a free population, not belonging to aristocrats, but possessing all civil rights.

What is a demos in fact, and how much is a strong part of society, aristocrats realized very quickly.  The rebels demanded the rights to govern the country, the abolition of slavery (debt) and the redistribution of land.

    <p>  Frightened by bloody clashes and rumors of a forthcoming general uprising, the aristocrats frantically sought a way out.  At a convened public meeting, a ruler named Solon was elected.  This man was respected by both the "lower classes" and the "upper circles."  This is exactly what the aristocracy relied on, hoping that Solon would be able to reconcile the parties and reach a compromise without bloodshed.  The new ruler came from a rather noble family, but did not belong to the rich.  He was engaged in maritime trade (an honor in Greece), was smart and extremely honest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Solon took control of Athens.

The farmers rejoiced: finally the debts are forgiven!  Knowing what a demos is, it is easy to understand that the nobility ‚Äúheld on‚Äù precisely at the expense of ordinary people cornered.  Some were enriched, others became more and more poor.  The land of Attica was called Solon the slave, who finally got freedom.  Which, in fact, was true.  Now, according to the law of the venerable archon, a person could borrow only for his property.  Turning the debtor into slavery was prohibited.  All debtors were released.  Not only that, Solon ordered to search for those who were sold overseas, and to redeem, and for the money of the state.  Among those who returned, some managed to forget their native speech. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now in Athens, only strangers were slaves. </p><h2>  Knowing the benefits </h2><p>  Now aristocrats could not rule the country, as before.  Any rich person, regardless of the level of nobility, could become an archon.  Representatives of the demos, who managed to get rich thanks to sea trade, had ships and owned houses, land and slaves, could also take this position.  The most important state affairs were now resolved only at the general People's Assembly, in which all citizens participated (free Athenians). </p><p>  An elected court was established and the most brutal laws were repealed.  For the first time, a poor man of 30 years old, not previously accused, could become a jury.  The judge was determined by drawing lots.  All the Athenians had the right to attend the hearing.  After the speeches of the prosecutor, witnesses and the accused, a secret ballot began, which was carried out by throwing stones in one vessel (black - ‚Äúguilty‚Äù, white - ‚Äújustify‚Äù).  Counting was immediately carried out: the court‚Äôs decision depended on which stones there were more, and if the votes were divided equally, the defendant was released.  It would seem that a compromise was found, a truce was reached.  However... </p><h2>  Solon leaves Athens </h2>

    <p>  In fact, Solon not only did not please anyone (although he did a lot), he also brought hatred on himself.  The rich were embittered by the cancellation of debts and the deprivation of free labor, while the poor wanted a redistribution of land.  Solon decided to leave the country for allegedly commercial matters.  He wandered for many years, then still returned to his homeland.  "Like a wolf I was spinning among the dogs ..." </p><p>  But it was <span>Solon‚Äôs laws</span> that became the basis of democracy. </p>
