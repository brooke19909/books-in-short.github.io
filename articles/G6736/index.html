This is mainly due to the huge number of bankruptcies of Russian banks.  The situation as a whole is not even affected by the fact that the state is trying to attract the attention of depositors by providing deposit insurance and guarantees.  Consider the most popular foreign banks in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="foreign banks in Russia" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/1966793.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Citizens' trust in foreign banks </h2><p>  Foreign banking giants more and more inspire confidence among legal entities and individuals.  You need to understand that the legislation in force in the Russian Federation does not give foreign banks the right to open branches, and all they can get is a share.  In simple terms, foreigners have the opportunity to establish subsidiaries of Russian structures related to finance, to be their founders and to manage. </p><p>  When choosing a bank, you should pay attention to the assets and balance sheet for the last year, since if the bank works with a negative balance and this trend continues for a certain period, it may lose its license.  It is necessary to analyze whether the bank participates in CERs ( <span>deposit insurance</span> system <span>),</span> which will allow the withdrawal of a bank license to return up to 1.4 million rubles of the deposit amount. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Financial balance and participation in CERs is not all.  You also need to find out how the bank relates to its customers.  Both legal entities and individuals worry about how quickly its employees will solve the problem. </p><h2>  List of foreign banks in Russia </h2><p>  Foreigners intend to invest colossal amounts and develop such subsidiaries.  Often, the invested funds exceed the authorized amount of the financial institution itself, as a result of which trust in such organizations becomes higher both for individuals and legal entities.  One should not blame Russian citizens for such behavior, since everyone is aimed at preserving their earned money and, of course, no one wants to lose it.  Below is a list of foreign banks in Russia: </p><ul><li>  UniCredit Bank. </li><li>  Raiffeisenbank. </li><li>  Rosbank. </li><li>  Deutsche Bank. </li><li>  Citibank. </li><li>  Home Credit Bank. </li><li>  Barclays Bank. </li><li>  "Credit Europe Bank". </li><li>  "Deltacredit." </li><li>  "OTP Bank". </li><li>  Rusfinance Bank. </li></ul><p>  When choosing a foreign structure, you need to be selective and attentive, since it is precisely the thoroughness of the analysis of the work of a foreign bank that will help calculate the fate of the deposit.  The financial market of our country is now famous for the fact that more and more foreign banks appear and strengthen on it thanks to loopholes in the legislation.  Foreign financial organizations compete significantly with Russian ones, as they provide the most profitable conditions for lending and savings programs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="representative offices of foreign banks in Russia" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/1966792.jpg" width="482"></div>

    <h2>  Citibank </h2><p>  This is a full-fledged institution that has been registered in the Russian Federation for a long time.  A huge share of the authorized capital is foreign investment. </p><p>  The consumer can use many products, and the <span>implementation of deposits</span> implies individual conditions.  The larger the cash amount of the deposit, the more interesting the interest rate. </p><p>  This bank deals with clients from both the private sector and legal entities.

Loans from foreign banks in Russia are not very popular so far, but everything is ahead. </p><h2>  Credit suisse bank </h2><p>  A private bank with foreign capital in Russia, which positions itself as an institution for deposits with a fixed income from shares of companies. </p><p>  Distinctive features are: </p><ul><li>  Implementation of activities in the field of finance with a license in Russia.

The above organizations, in turn, are more popular. </p><p>  Weak participation of our own system of banks in our country is a problem of economic development.  A number of researchers see a way out of this situation in increasing lending to the economy by foreign banks.  To achieve this goal, you must: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank with foreign capital in Russia" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/1966790.jpg" width="600"></div>

In this case, the probable negative consequences of their activities in Russia are indicated, for example: </p><ul><li>  the allocation of credit funds exclusively to the extractive, secondary spheres of the economy; </li><li>  an attempt to oust banks with Russian capital from certain market segments; </li><li>  support for foreign companies that compete with Russian enterprises; </li><li>  the impact on domestic political life in the country, etc. </li></ul><p>  In fact, the owners of foreign banks are closely connected with international companies that are fighting a fierce battle for markets, including in Russia.  Foreign banks work in the name of the interests of their countries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="loans in foreign banks in Russia" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/1966788.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Interest rates on deposits</span> and loans </h2><p>  There is a certain tendency: the larger the bank, the lower the deposit interest rate.  The best conditions for deposits can be found in foreign banks.  It is imperative to pay attention to the early termination of the deposit agreement, due to unforeseen circumstances it is easy to lose part of the interest on the deposit. </p><p>  So, for example, in UniCredit Bank, the interest on the deposit is 7.5%, in Raiffeisenbank - 7%.  In all other banks, interest rates are approximately the same.  The average <span>rate on deposits</span> in foreign currency is 2.5-3%. </p><p>  We examined the representative offices of foreign banks in Russia. </p>
