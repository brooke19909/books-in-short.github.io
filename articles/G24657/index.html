  <section class="page js-page"><h1>EGP UK</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The country is located on the British Isles in northwestern Europe.  Consider the EGP of Great Britain - first its geographical aspect.  Great Britain consists of four large provinces: England, Wales, <span>Northern Ireland</span> and Scotland.  EGP UK <strong> </strong>  is largely determined by its insular position.  The British Isles are the largest archipelago in Europe.  It consists of two large islands (Ireland and the UK) and more than five thousand small ones.  The southern part of the island of Great Britain is at the fiftieth, and the northern part of the archipelago (Scottish islands) is at the sixtieth degree of northern latitude.  The distance from the northernmost point of the island of Great Britain to its southernmost point is 966 kilometers, and its greatest width is 508 kilometers.  The geographical position of Great Britain is such that it is washed by the waters of the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, and the southern part of its coast is located only thirty-five kilometers from the northern coast of France.  They are separated by the English Channel.  <span>The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGreat Britain</span> is equal to 243 810 square kilometers. </p><p>  Plains of England are of great importance for agriculture.  A little later, the plains began to develop and mountainous terrain.  An important incentive for this was first pasture, and then mineral resources.  Historically, in the course of geological evolution, various minerals began to form in the bowels of the British Isles.  In the country there are almost all known minerals, not only diamonds. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the central part and in the north of England are the Peninsky Mountains, which are composed of coal.  In their northern part, karst deposits are widespread.  The foothills of these mountains are rich in coal deposits.  Based on these deposits, large mining centers of the Yorkshire, Lanshire and other coal basins were formed, the estimated reserves of which are more than four billion tons. </p><p>  In most of England, flat plains and hilly cuest ridges alternate.  Cuests are most often composed of limestone or chalk, and the plains are represented by more loose rocks: sand, clay, marl.  All these sedimentary rocks accumulated in ancient marine basins. </p><p>  Small elevations in the plains of the Midland are associated with deposits of iron ore and coal.  Here is one of the largest iron ore deposits - 60% of all its reserves are concentrated in East Midland. </p><p>  Consider now the economic side of EGP in the UK <strong>.</strong> </p><p>  The country's agriculture is characterized by very high intensity.  It is well equipped and produces 60% of the food needed by the UK, using only 2% of the human resources.  The leading <span>industries</span> are chemical and petrochemical, <span>gas</span> and oil production, oil refining, engineering, ferrous metallurgy. </p><p>  <span>Gross domestic product</span> per capita is $ 36,600 per year.  Great Britain occupies the 13th place in the world in terms of living standards.  The country's economy is one of the most developed in the world.  The country has developed mechanical engineering, which is mainly focused on the production of non-standard equipment, as well as various types and types of machines. </p><p>  The country has well-developed electronic and electrical engineering, large automotive industry, aircraft manufacturing, shipbuilding, <span>agricultural engineering</span> and machine tool building.  The chemical and petrochemical industries, the production of handling equipment and industrial equipment, as well as the oil refining and pharmaceutical industries, and ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy are widely represented.  The UK is one of the first places in the world in the export and production of dyes, <span>synthetic fibers</span> and plastics, detergents, chemical and mineral fertilizers. </p><p>  Thus, we presented in the article information reflecting the EGP of Great Britain. </p>
