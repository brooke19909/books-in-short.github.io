But it is the count from Transylvania who remains the most famous and popular vampire.  So why not choose this <span>look for Halloween?</span>  Dracula ... A costume that allows you to transform into the mystical king of vampires, looks incredibly impressive and at the same time is not too difficult to manufacture. </p><h2>  What does the main vampire look like? </h2>

    <p>  You can find out who the Count from Transylvania is and what it looks like by reading the book of the same name or by carefully watching one of the most popular films.  In fact, Dracula has several guises.  The traditional option is a white or <span>red shirt</span> with frill, dark trousers and shoes, a long black cloak with a scarlet lining.  However, you can often see the main vampire in a classic tuxedo.  The invariable detail of the image is a smooth, combed back hairstyle or long hair, pale skin, red eyes and huge fangs.  Does all this seem too complicated for you?  In fact, it‚Äôs not difficult to make a Dracula costume with your own hands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  We sew a vampire cloak: ideas and patterns </h2>

    <p>  The most important element of the costume is the mantle.  It will look more effective if we use fabric of two contrasting colors to make it.  The top side should be black or dark blue.  The lining in the classic version is red.  The easiest option: to sew together two identical rectangles of fabric of different colors and in the upper part make a drawstring with a lace or ribbon to tie a cloak around the neck.  A more complex option is to use the trapezoid or half-sun shape for the main mantle sheet.  Dracula's Halloween costume will turn out even more interesting and effective if you have sufficient sewing skills and make a cloak with sleeves and a collar.  You can also add a mantle with a deep hood.  All these enhancements are made based on the standard selected cloak pattern. </p><h2>  Hard collar and frill </h2><p>  If you choose a Victorian version <span>of a vampire costume,</span> you can make a beautiful collar for a shirt.  The most convenient frill in this case is to make removable.  To do this, it‚Äôs enough to stitch together several rows of ruffles from a material resembling the one from which the shirt is made, and add lace to the tone as desired.  Jabot is sewn onto an elastic band and is worn around the neck like a bow tie.  Such an element of the outfit would certainly be appreciated by <span>Count Dracula.</span>  <span>The costume of the</span> vampire <span>king is</span> hard to imagine without a long cloak.  What about a tough collar?  Sewing this element is not difficult at all.  Draw a template on the paper - this may be the correct trapezoid or a part with a curly outer edge.  Cut out two identical elements from the fabric.  If the cloak has a lining of a contrasting shade, let the collar be two-sided.  A layer of non-woven material will help stiffen the element.  Cut out also two parts from this material and glue each of them with one of the fabric elements.  After that, it remains only to sew the collar, and he will keep his shape.  Sew the finished element to the mantle - and now you have a cloak that Dracula himself would envy.  The costume for the theme party is almost ready, it remains to pick up additional items of clothing and accessories. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Basic clothes for a vampire costume </h2>

Perfect: classic black pants and a white shirt.  You can wear a full suit or shirt with a vest.  However, it‚Äôs okay if you didn‚Äôt find suitable clothes - strict black jeans and a light turtleneck will do.  Dracula is a costume that should be kept in traditional "vampire" shades.  It is black, red, burgundy, sometimes blue and green.  The most impressive combination of saturated colors with dark and cold shades.  To ensure that the outfit does not look too colorful, just combine black with one of the bright colors.  If desired, you can also add a white shirt.  If there is no light shirt, red or blue is suitable, the most important thing is that the color be bright and noble enough.

The most important sign of a vampire is large and sharp fangs.  They are easiest to purchase at a holiday merchandise store.  Another characteristic of night creatures is the aristocratic white skin color.  Special makeup or the lightest powder will come to the rescue.  Dracula's Halloween costume can be complemented with makeup.  Do not be surprised, this is really a masculine image, but remember the heroes of popular films about vampires - most of them have eyes and eyebrows.  Try to experiment on the eve of the party - many complement this image also with blood smeared around the mouth.  But this is optional.  Round classic sunglasses, an elegant cane and a cylinder hat will always come in handy as extra accessories.

This is not a completely correct question, since we are talking about a literary male character.  However, if a girl or girl really wants to try on a dark image, you can always become a vampire or even a bride of Dracula.  The gown is made in the same way as for a man's suit.  But basic clothing will have to pay special attention.  The best option is a Victorian dress in a dark floor or a long skirt and corset.  Elegant lace or silk gloves, jewelry with large antique stones will not be superfluous.  Do not forget about false fangs and bright makeup.  You can make a modern image of a vampire - in a miniskirt, with false nails of red or black color and an open neckline.  Do not be too lazy to choose also high-heeled shoes, mesh stockings or tights with an original pattern.
