Not all hotels in Turkey can boast the first line.  The complex has its own beach.  He is pebble.

    <p>  The Germans are the main part of the guests of Vera Mare Resort 5 *.  Reviews of tourists say that this hotel is focused on family vacations.  However, many German pensioners come here to spend time.  In general, this does not affect the quality of rest, it‚Äôs just worth getting used to. </p><p>  Children's and evening animations work very well.  But, perhaps, young couples looking for active nightlife will be a little boring here.  Although the hotel has its own disco, and around there are enough entertainment venues that do not let you fall asleep until the morning.  For this reason, many hotel guests try not to take rooms with sea views, they are more noisy.  After all, all the entertainment is on the coast, which means the music from there reaches sleeping tourists. </p><p>  The complex is trying to encourage its regular customers.  Those vacationers who are not spending their holidays here for the first time are even given bracelets of a different color.  And this suggests that people like to relax in this place and they come back here again and again. </p><p>  The hotel staff quality cleaned rooms.  Sometimes, however, incidents happen with the fact that, for example, they forgot to add soap or add water to the bar.  But you should not pay attention to such trifles.  In general, vacationers are very satisfied with the service at the hotel, noting the friendliness and friendliness of the staff. </p><h2>  Travel tips </h2><p>  If you are going to visit <span>Belek</span> in <span>Turkey,</span> Vera Mare Resort 5 * may very well become your vacation destination.  When planning a trip in advance, you need to pay attention to entertainment in order to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat you can see in this beautiful country.  Of course, there are tourists who do not leave the hotel for the entire time of rest, but it would probably be foolish not to see the local sights and not to know more closely the customs and customs of the inhabitants. </p><p>  Turkey is rich in beautiful places, so one trip is unlikely to be enough to see at least a small part of the natural wealth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vera mare resort 5 locations" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1443882.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  You can take advantage of the many guides at the hotel to see local attractions.  But experienced tourists do not recommend contacting street barkers.  You can rent a car at the hotel, then any trip for you will not be a problem at all.  If for some reason you cannot take this opportunity, then it makes sense to sign up for group excursions. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  A very popular trip to Aspendos.  This is a very ancient Greco-Roman town in the province of Antalya.  Such a trip will allow you to see one of the most magnificent ancient cities.  Once the city was so large that even had the right to mint moments, which speaks of its importance.  Tourists can see with their own eyes the remains of an amphitheater, built in the second century BC.  Until recently, festivals and concerts were organized here. </p><p>  Children will be interested in visiting the Troy water park.  The highlight of this place is its unusual design.  Everything in it is made in the style of the era of Trojan warriors.  A special pride of the park is the life-size Trojan horse, well-known to all.  The water park has many slides, water rides.  Local entertainment will appeal not only to children, but also to adults. </p><p>  Having visited the park, you should definitely go to the Troy Dolphinarium.  Here you can see an interesting show with dolphins, white whales, walruses. </p><p>  <span>Kepryul Canyon</span> will appeal to true wildlife lovers.  More than six hundred species of plants grow on its territory, and thirty of them are considered endemic.  The canyon got its name from the river, due to which it was formed.  A difficult waterway with many rapids has long attracted fans of extreme sports.  Lovers of altitude and mountain climbing can try their hand here.  In addition, guides offer horse riding in the protected area. </p><p>  Not far from Belek is the historical and architectural complex of Perge, one of the main attractions of which is the ancient theater.  Once the building was designed for twelve thousand spectators.  The theater was built by the Romans in the second century BC on the site of a similar Hellenic structure.  It is believed that this building is the best-preserved theater in all of Asia Minor.  It‚Äôs hard to imagine the beauty of this place.  Some parts and decorations of the oldest building are still in place, and most have long been moved to the Antalya Historical Museum to ensure the full preservation of values. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vera mare resort 5 room types" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1443883.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For good reason, Belek has gained particular popularity among tourists.  He is primarily interested in his beaches.  The sandy coast stretches for many kilometers.  For its beauty, grooming and cleanliness, it was awarded the blue flag.  Local beaches are well equipped, the entrance to the sea is flat and comfortable everywhere, the resort is just perfect for kids.  Some of them are closed at night.  This is done for a reason.  The fact is that at night the turtles leave the sea to their clutches in the sand.  For this reason, warning signs are even placed on the coast.  Along the entire coast of Belek, restaurants, bars and cafes are built. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Many of our compatriots, coming to Turkey, want to go shopping.  Of course, this is an entertaining thing.  Only with the local population you need to be able to bargain.  Since the prices of goods are sometimes simply unrealistically high. </p><p>  Resting in Vera Mare Resort 5 * (Turkey), you can visit the market in the small village of Kadriye.  The Oriental Bazaar is open every Tuesday.  On it you can buy very different products: jewelry, fabrics, fruits, sweets. </p><p>  Those tourists who want to make serious purchases can go to larger markets, there are a lot of them in Turkey. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Concluding the conversation about the hotel, I would like to summarize some of the results and refer to the reviews of vacationers, since they allow us to present a more or less real situation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vera mare resort 5 belek bogazkent" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1443891.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to tourists, the hotel is located in the far part of Belek, closer to Side.  The hotel itself does not seem pathetic.  Quite an ordinary building.  The location of the complex is quite convenient, getting from the airport is generally not difficult.  The hotel has people from completely different countries: Germans, Poles, Kazakhs and many others.  The service staff understands the Russian language well, so there are no difficulties.  As for the staff, he is courteous and friendly.  Perhaps some mistakes may occur, but not so large as to attach importance to them. </p><p>  The hotel area is not very large, but very well-groomed and green.  It can be seen that the plants are carefully looked after.  It is very nice to walk along the paths and admire. </p><p>  As for food, tourists are very pleased with it.  The all-inclusive system has its advantages.  Throughout the day, in any bar you can have a snack between the main meals.  Ice cream is distributed twice a day.  In general, the hotel serves a lot of sweets and fruits.  There is never a need to buy something from food, because everything is enough.  As for alcohol and soft drinks, they are all free.  It should only be understood that all alcohol is Turkish-made.  You can get used to it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel vera mare resort 5" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1443893.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Very pleased with the coast in Vera Mare Resort 5 *.  The beach of the hotel is large and allows you to accommodate everyone.  There is a bar on the coast, staff offer vacationers snacks and refreshments.  Special attention deserves the animation of the hotel.  For the kids, very good programs are organized in the daytime and in the evening.  Not bad with adult entertainment.  Especially tourists like the Turkish Night holiday.  In general, here rest is good for lazy tourists.  Perhaps for this reason, there are so many foreign pensioners and families with children.  Active youth prefers more party places.  Vacationers can visit an incredible amount of local attractions by renting a car or joining an excursion group.  On such entertainment is not worth saving.  Turkey is an interesting camp, rich in beautiful places that are worth seeing. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  If you are planning a trip to Belek, Vera Mare Resort 5 * can be a good place to relax.  The hotel is not glamorous rooms, but meets the ratio of "price-quality".  Therefore, it may well qualify for the title of a budget hotel complex. </p>
