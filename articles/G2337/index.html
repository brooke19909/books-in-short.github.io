    <p>  Regarding the prices, many say that you will not have to pay too much.  The basic <span>insurance rate</span> for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance for ordinary cars will cost 4,118. In Moscow, the basic cost of car insurance is less - 3,604, in the Moscow and Novosibirsk regions - 3,775 rubles.  In principle, not very expensive.  And it pleases many. </p><p>  It is noted that Energogarant offers very affordable prices for its services.  It is recommended that you find out more accurate information at the company‚Äôs offices in a city.  But obviously there is no need to overpay for insurance. </p><h2>  Conclusion of an agreement </h2><p>  Energogarant (insurance company, <span>Magnitogorsk)</span> receives positive <span>reviews</span> for concluding an agreement with the organization for the provision of certain services.  Not necessarily hull or compulsory motor liability insurance.  It doesn‚Äôt matter which region it is in question, everywhere the principles of work remain the same. </p><p>  Many note that when concluding an agreement, employees explain all the features and nuances of cooperation in a clear language.  And it pleases.  If you have questions from the client they will be answered.  The contract is drawn up in several copies, in compliance with all norms and rules.  No scam! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Nevertheless, many clients recommend reading the text of the contract carefully so as not to accuse Energogarant of fraud.  Pay particular attention to issues related to compensation.  Some cases may not be covered by insurance.  It is better to know about them in advance.  Nevertheless, all this is spelled out in the text of the agreement.  If you carefully study what you sign, you can easily understand what you have to agree to. </p><h2>  Insured events and surprises </h2><p>  The Energogarant insurance company does not receive the best reviews because some employees lure customers to themselves with incredible offers.  There are opinions according to which the staff promises to paint the car upon receipt of scratches.  But in reality, everything turns out differently. </p><p>  How exactly?  Neither CASCO nor MTPL do not pay for painting.  Some indicate that when inspecting a vehicle, it turns out that they will have to make repairs at their own expense.  Because of this, there are many negative opinions about the work of the company. </p><p>  It has already been said that before concluding an agreement, you must carefully read the text of the contract.  All insurance and non-insurance events are registered there.  Accordingly, additional attractive offers do not need to be paid attention.  Usually, Energogarant quickly calculates deceivers and fires them.  But a negative imprint is still left on the organization‚Äôs reputation. </p>

    <h2>  Sustainability </h2><p>  Energogarant (Perm, insurance company) receives positive reviews for its sustainability.  According to the results of the assessment, the company is very stable.  It is noted that the population predominantly trusts the insurance company. </p><p>  To date, the trust level is at A ++ (or AAA).  This is the highest rating.  With Energogarant, the population can be calm for themselves and the insured property.  This company will not suddenly be closed, it will not go bankrupt.  These nuances for some customers are quite important points.  The Energogarant insurance company in Nizhny Novgorod also receives extremely positive reviews for its reliability. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  What reviews does the Energogarant insurance company receive for customer service?  This question interests many.  And here, as in most cases, there is no consensus.  Much depends on the particular branch and employees working in a particular branch. </p><p>  For example, in Magnitogorsk they often complain about the service.  It takes about half an hour to serve one client on any issue, while the organization works from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., with a lunch break.  Some express dissatisfaction with the fact that often only a branch selling OSAGO policies is open.  Workers serve slowly, some conditions of cooperation are not clear. </p>

What insurance company "Energogarant" receives reviews on compulsory motor liability insurance and on hull insurance?  Most customers pay attention to such a nuance as calling an emergency commissioner.  An important point in customer service. </p><p>  For this feature, the organization receives mixed opinions.  Someone indicates that it is impossible to wait for the emergency commissioner.  And you have to try hard to get paid. </p><p>  But the insurance company "Energogarant" reviews on hull or compulsory motor liability insurance still earns good.  On various otzoviks you can find a large number of positive opinions regarding the departure of the emergency commissioner.  The employee will arrive quickly, all further service also takes place without special incidents.  Some say that cooperation with Energogarant is a matter of personal success.

    <h2>  Are additional services needed </h2><p>  Insurance company Energogarant in Astrakhan reviews making money as a very conscientious organization.  But at the same time, potential and real customers indicate that office workers are imposing additional services.  More precisely, they persistently offer them when buying CTP or CASCO. </p><p>  What is it about?  Energogarant is actively promoting life insurance.  That is, with car insurance they begin to offer life insurance as well.  The cost of an additional service depends directly on CASCO or CTP.  Moreover, employees are persistent in offering their products. </p><p>  You should not be surprised or scared.  This is quite normal.  Each organization is trying as much as possible to offer its services to the client for profit.  That is why Energogarant (insurance company, Izhevsk) does not earn the best reviews in this area.  Often, customers do not like this approach.  They come to the insurance company, knowing exactly what they need. </p><h2>  Auto repair </h2><p>  Special attention is paid to car repair from the specified organization.
