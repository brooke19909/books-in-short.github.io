Until September 1 of last year, it was called the Verde Resort, and still on the sites of some tour operators it can be found under this name.

What are the charms and bonuses of this hotel?  What do tourists write about it, because usually vacationers love hotels located right on the beach?  Let's find out about this not only from the description of the hotel, but also from the reviews of the travelers themselves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Innvista Hotels Belek 5" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2039360.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To get to the hotel Innvista Hotels Belek 5 *, you need to fly to Antalya Airport.  And then it all depends on whether you are an independent traveler or have acquired a package tour.  In the second case, a transfer awaits you.  But depending on how many hotels will deliver guests, your trip time will be more or less.  But the minimum to get to this hotel will take about an hour, although Antalya Airport is only 25 kilometers away, and to the city itself - 35. The famous Belek resort is no more than 5 km from here.  And in order to get from Antalya Airport on your own, you need to catch a bus that will take you to the bus station.  From there, you will transfer to a minibus or other type of public transport that goes towards Alanya or Belek.  Usually drivers stop near large country hotels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kadriye </h2><p>  Tourists who travel to this hotel often initially think that they are going to Belek.
