    <h2>  The emergence of a new state in the south-west of Crimea </h2><p>  The new principality was formed as a result of the separation of the former Byzantine colony located in the Crimea, and controlled by a small Greek state called Trebizond.  By the beginning of the XIII century, Constantinople had largely lost its military power, which the Genoese, who were greedy for someone else‚Äôs good, who had captured the northwestern part of the peninsula, were not slow to take advantage of it.  At the same time, an independent state was formed on the territory not controlled by Genoa, headed by a former governor of Trebizond and dubbed the Principality of Theodoro. </p><p>  The mystery of the Crimea hid his name from us, but it is known that this man belonged to the dynasty of Theodore, who ruled the metropolis for two centuries and gave the name to the newly formed principality.  The founder of this family, Theodore Gavras, a Byzantine aristocrat of Armenian descent, rose to the top of power after being able to collect the militia individually and free Trebezund from the Seljuk Turks who captured him, after which he became his ruler.  Power was inherited until, as a result of court intrigues, the dynasty was pushed back by more successful competitors from the Comnenus clan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The heyday of the former Byzantine colony </h2><p>  As mentioned above, by the beginning of the XIII century in Crimea, on the territory not controlled by the Genoese, an independent principality of Theodoro was formed, which was named after the ruling dynasty in it.  Having left the subordination of its former metropolis and successfully repulsed the raids of numerous conquerors, it existed for two centuries, which became the heyday of Orthodoxy and statehood on the southwestern coast of the Crimean peninsula. </p>

    <p>  The territory of the principality extended between the modern cities of Balaklava and Alushta, and the city of Mangup became its capital, whose ancient fortress was built back in the 5th century.  Until now, its ruins attract thousands of tourists who annually come to Crimea.  It is believed that in the most favorable periods the population of the principality reached one hundred and fifty thousand people, of which almost all were Orthodox.  The Principality of Theodoro in Crimea ethnically consisted mainly of Greeks, Goths, Armenians, Russians, and representatives of several other Orthodox peoples.  They communicated among themselves mainly in the Gothic dialect of the German language. </p><h2>  The role of refugees in the life of the mountain principality </h2><p>  The Crimean principality of Theodoro became a haven for numerous Orthodox Christians who were looking for salvation from Muslim conquerors in it.  In particular, their significant influx was observed after the capture of East Byzantium by the Seljuk Turks.  To the Orthodox monasteries of Mangup - the capital of Theodora, the monks moved from the mountain cloisters of Cappadocia, looted and destroyed by enemies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  An important role in the formation and development of the state was played by the Armenians, former residents of the city of Ani, who resettled in Feodoro, after their homeland was conquered by the Seljuk Turks.  Representatives of a country with a high level of culture, these refugees enriched the principality with their centuries-old experience in the field of trade and crafts. </p><p>  With their appearance, numerous parishes of the Armenian Orthodox Church were opened both in the Feodorite and in the Genoese part of Crimea.  Over time, the Armenians began to make up the bulk of <span>the Crimean population,</span> and this picture continued even after its conquest by the Ottoman Empire. </p>

    <h2>  The rise of the economy and culture of theodorites </h2><p>  The period from the XIII to the XV century is not in vain called the golden age of this state.  Over the course of two hundred years, the Principality of Theodoro was able to raise building art to the highest level, thanks to which vivid examples of economic, temple and fortress architecture were erected during this relatively short period.  Largely thanks to the skillful craftsmen who created the impregnable citadels, theodorites were able to repel countless invasions of enemies. </p><p>  The Crimean principality of Theodoro was famous for its agriculture, especially viticulture and the production of wine, sent from here far beyond the borders of the state.  Modern researchers who excavated in this part of the Crimea, indicate that they found storage of wine and wine grapes in almost all settlements.  In addition, theodorites were famous as skilled gardeners and gardeners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Relations of the Crimean state with Moscow </h2><p>  An interesting fact is that the principality of Fodoro and its princes had the closest ties with Ancient Russia.  It is even known that it was from the mountainous regions of Crimea that several aristocratic surnames originated, which played a prominent role in the history of our state.  For example, the Khovrins boyar clan descended from several representatives of the ruling Gavras dynasty who moved there from Mangup to Moscow in the 14th century.  In Russia, for several centuries he was entrusted with control over the most important area of ‚Äã‚Äãstate life - finance. </p>

    <p>  In the XVI century, two branches separated from this surname, representatives of which are also noted in Russian history - these are the Tretyakovs and Golovins.  But the most famous among us is the Mangup princess <span>Sophia Paleolog,</span> who became the wife of the Grand Duke of Moscow Ivan III.  Thus, there is every reason to talk about the role played by the Principality of Theodoro and his princes in the history of Russia. </p><h2>  Other international relations of the state of Feodoro </h2><p>  In addition to Ancient Russia, there was also a whole series of states with which the Principality of Theodoro had political and economic ties.  The history of the late Middle Ages testifies to its close dynastic ties with most of the ruling houses of Eastern Europe.  For example, Princess Maria Mangupskaya, the sister of the Theodore ruler, became the wife of the ruler of Moldavia, Stephen the Great, and her sister married the heir to the throne of Trapezunta. </p><h2>  Life surrounded by enemies </h2><p>  Looking back at history, one involuntarily asks the question: how could a small mountain principality withstand such formidable conquerors as the Tartar khans Edigey and Nogai for a long time?  Despite the fact that the enemy had a multiple numerical superiority, he not only failed to achieve his goal, but, having suffered significant losses, was driven back outside the state.  Only subsequently some areas of the country were under its control. </p>

    <p>  The Orthodox principality of Theodoro in Crimea, which was also one of the last fragments of Byzantium, aroused hatred among both the Genoese Catholics and the Crimean khans.  In this regard, its population lived in constant readiness to repel aggression, but could not continue for a long time.  A small state surrounded by enemies on all sides was doomed. </p><h2>  The invasion of the peninsula of Turkish conquerors </h2><p>  There was an adversary against whom the Principality of Theodoro was powerless.  It was Ottoman Turkey, which had completely captured Byzantium by that time and fixed its eyes on its former colonies.  Having invaded the <span>territory of Crimea, the</span> Turks easily captured the lands belonging to the Genoese, and made the local khans their vassals.  The queue was for the Theodorites. </p><p>  In 1475, Mangup, the capital of the Principality of Theodoro, was besieged by selected Turkish units, reinforced by the troops of their vassals, Crimean khans.  At the head of this army of many thousands stood Gedik Ahmed Pasha, who by then had become famous for his victories on the shores of the Bosphorus.  Caught in a dense ring of enemies, the capital of the mountainous state for five months reflected their onslaught. </p><h2>  Tragic denouement </h2><p>  In addition to its inhabitants, the city‚Äôs defense was attended by three hundred soldiers sent there by the Moldavian ruler Stefan the Great, married to Princess Mangupa and thus having family ties in Theodore.  This detachment of Moldavians went down in history as ‚Äúthree hundred Spartans of Crimea‚Äù.  He, with the support of local residents, managed to defeat the elite Ottoman corps - the Janissaries Regiment.  But due to the numerical superiority of the enemy, the outcome of the case was a foregone conclusion. </p>

    <p>  After a long defense, Mangup was still in the hands of enemies.  Unable to succeed in open battle, the Turks resorted to tried-and-tested tactics - having blocked all food delivery routes, they took the city and its fortress starved.  Of the fifteen thousand inhabitants of the capital, half was immediately destroyed, and the rest were driven into slavery. </p><h2>  Descendants of Theodorites </h2><p>  Already after Mangup fell and Ottoman rule was established, for several centuries Orthodox communities remained in the lands where the principality of Theodoro was formerly located.  The tragedy that played out here deprived them of the many churches and monasteries built earlier, but did not force them to abandon the religion of their fathers.  The descendants of those who formerly inhabited this state that had sunk into eternity were able to preserve the beautiful traditions of gardening and viticulture. </p><p>  They still grew bread and handicrafts.  When in the XVIII century Catherine II issued a decree on the resettlement of the entire Christian population to the territory of Russia, thereby dealt an irreparable blow to the <span>economy of Crimea.</span>  The immigrants in their new homeland gave rise to two independent national entities - the Azov Greeks and the Don Armenians. </p><h2>  Forgotten past </h2><p>  The Principality of Theodoro, whose history is limited to only two centuries, managed to survive its once powerful metropolis of Trebizond and even Constantinople.  Becoming the last bastion of Orthodoxy in the Crimea, the principality for many months resisted the onslaught of superior enemy forces and fell, only having exhausted all the possibilities to continue resistance. </p>

    <p>  It is disappointing that the feat of this fearless people was practically not preserved in the memory of posterity.  Few people even know the name of the capital of the Crimean principality Theodoro.  Modern residents of this area are extremely poorly informed about the heroic events that took place in it five and a half centuries ago.  Only tourists visiting the ruins of an ancient fortress listen to guides' stories about them and read brief information in the colorful booklets they offer. </p>
