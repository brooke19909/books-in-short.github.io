  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to install theme on iPhone?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Man is a creature, in general, inconstant, and anything can bore him over time.  Sooner or later, we all want to change our place of work, social circle, make some, albeit small, changes in our appearance.  Some even decide on more significant changes in life.  What can I say about the standard iPhone theme, which any owner of this phone wants to change soon after its acquisition.  In this article, we will tell you how to install a theme on the iPhone, what methods exist for this. </p><p>  Each owner of this gadget is well aware that changing the theme on the device, so to speak, officially, is impossible.  You will, of course, ask how to install themes on the iPhone. <strong> </strong>  in this case? </p><p>  There are three ways to install the theme on iPhone.  We will tell you about each of them, and you will already choose from them the one that seems most convenient to you. </p><p>  <strong>How to install themes on</strong> <strong>iPhone</strong> <strong>using the WinterBoard app?</strong> </p><p>  If this application is installed on your phone, you can change not only the wallpaper and ringtone, but most of the graphic elements - qwerty keyboard buttons, icons, docks, battery indicator, phone screen lock elements, etc. Where can I get themes for the phone?  Typically, iPhone owners find them in one of the following ways: </p><ol></ol><ul><li>  Download from the Cydia application; </li><li>  download topics on various sites on the Internet; </li><li>  create themes yourself using special applications. </li></ul><ol></ol><p>  So, let's see how to install a theme on iPhone using the Cydia application.  By the way, today this is perhaps one of the easiest ways that any iPhone owner can use. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, select and download from Cydia the theme that you would like to install on your device.  Launch the WinterBoard program.  Now you need to make some changes to the program settings.  Select the ‚ÄúSelect Themes‚Äù submenu.  The downloaded program should already be there.  Mark it with a tick, click "Home".  The theme should restart. </p><p>  If you did everything correctly, the installation of the theme of your iPhone screen will be installed. </p><p>  <strong>How to install theme on</strong> <strong>iPhone</strong> <strong>using</strong> <strong>iPhone PC Suite?</strong> <strong> </strong></p><p>  So, to use this method, SummerBoard must be <span>installed</span> on your device, and iTunes and the iPhone PC Suite (better than the latest versions) must be <span>installed</span> on your computer.  And, of course, the theme that you plan to install on your device should be downloaded and unzipped on your PC. </p><p>  So, if everything is there and ready to go, let's get started.  Connect iPhone to PC, open ‚ÄúiPhone PC Suite‚Äù, click on ‚ÄúThemes‚Äù in the program‚Äôs working field.  The next step - click on SummerBoard - the theme editor will open.  Here you will see what topics are in your gadget.  In order to install a new theme, click on "Add theme".  The application will ask you to specify the path to the theme folder.  Do it.  When asked by the application, answer ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  If the selected theme is <span>not compatible with your device, the program</span> will let you know.  In such a situation, it is better to pick up a new topic and not take risks.  If everything is in order, installation will begin.  As they say, use it for your pleasure.  As soon as this topic gets bored, you can easily change it to a new one in the same way. </p><p>  <strong>Installing themes downloaded from the Internet to your desktop computer</strong> </p><p>  And now let's talk about how to install themes on your Android device, if you found something interesting on specialized sites and downloaded the theme to your computer. </p><p>  So, you have an archive with a theme.  To install it on your phone, you need to prepare a theme for the installation process - unzip it. </p><p>  Now connect the device using the usb cable to the personal computer.  Your task is to throw the theme on your iPhone.  But you need to do this in a strictly defined place - "/ var / mobile / Library / SummerBoard / Themes /".  Half the job done. </p><p>  The next step is to activate the theme.  To do this, use the very first method described by us - through the WinterBoard application. </p>
