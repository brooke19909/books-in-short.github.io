Here we are used to seeing netbooks, ultrabooks and chromebooks, that is, a full-fledged computer device with a keyboard and display. </p><p>  Typically, these gadgets are a double-edged sword.  Yes, they have a more effective visual impact: watching movies, playing games and drawing on such devices is much more comfortable.  But the increased diagonal implies a large weight, as well as specific design features.  Therefore, the ergonomic part of the device in this case is very lame. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the demand for large mobile gadgets, albeit small, but still there, and well-known manufacturers sometimes delight their fans with large tablets.  No matter how much the minimalists want such devices, they still find a buyer.  We will try to highlight this issue and consider the most remarkable models, most of which can be found on sale. </p><p>  We present to your attention an overview of the largest tablets in the world.  Photos of devices, main characteristics, as well as other features will be discussed in our article.  We will keep the list from larger to smaller.  So let's get started. </p><h2>  Ardic Technology London Edition (diagonal screen 383 ") </h2><p>  The world's largest tablet has a diagonal of 383 inches and is located in London.  The model was specially made for the capital of Great Britain.  The apparatus was installed by a dozen workers almost all day, and the next day specialists set it up. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.taand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ardic technology london edition" class="if uuid-3090866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3090866.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the massive display, a keyboard of the appropriate size is connected to the world's largest tablet.  Between the buttons, you can see special tracks for users, allowing relatively quickly to get to the desired key. </p><h2>  Device features </h2><p>  Despite more than a workable stuffing, the world's largest tablet is more of an art project, because the practicality of such a device is a big question.  The device runs on the Windows Mobile platform. </p><p>  As for the technical characteristics, the gadget can not boast of high performance.  The world's largest tablet copes well with video playback and photo display, as well as with ordinary OS applications.  But something serious to run on it, alas, will not work. </p><h2>  Ardic Technology Mobile (65 ‚Äù) </h2><p>  Another brainchild of the same company, which can be safely called the largest tablet.  The model is noticeably smaller than the device installed in London, and is more like a large TV than a handheld tablet.  This device is also more likely an indicative art device, because it is deprived of the practicality that you expect from a mobile gadget. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="gigazine.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ardic technology mobile" class="if uuid-3090863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3090863.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the large tablet (photo above) runs on the Android operating system, and not on Windows Mobile.  To smooth ergonomic angles, the developers made a small copy of the gadget with which you can control this device.  But even without it, he has all the necessary qualities of a tablet. </p><p>  The touch display allows you to control a large tablet in the same way as with small gadgets.  The model received a rather impressive set of chipsets and a powerful enough battery to power it all.  There are a couple of cameras - front and rear, as well as USB, HDMI and Wi-Fi support. </p><p>  The model is used, as a rule, for presentations, due to the lack of ergonomic qualities for the tablet format.  In addition, you can‚Äôt take such a device on a trip. </p><h2>  Panasonic Toughpad 4K UT-MB5 (20 ‚Äù) </h2><p>  The third largest tablet can be called a model from the famous Panasonic brand - Toughpad 4K UT-MB5.  This is one of the best large tablets of our time.  The gadget received 256 GB of internal memory, 8 GB of RAM, as well as a powerful processor from Intel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onmsft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panasonic Toughpad 4K UT-MB5" class="if uuid-3090864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3090864.jpg"></div><p>  The model allows you to run even the most demanding gaming and graphics applications.  The tablet works under the control of the Windows platform and supports all the software specific for this model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The device has all the necessary tools for communication: wireless Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and also has a slot for a SIM card.  In addition, there is support for USB 3.0.  Designers have not forgotten about the cameras.  The front device can shoot in a resolution of 1280 by 1024 pixels, and the rear - 1920 by 1080. </p><h2>  Device features </h2><p>  The tablet received an intelligent sensor that supports up to ten simultaneous touches.  The model is positioned as a tool for designers, artists and layout designers, so the company prudently put an advanced stylus in the kit.  The latter greatly facilitates the work of the above specialists. </p><p>  The model also pleased with the build quality and materials used.  There are magnesium alloys, fiberglass, and other noble elements.  In addition, the device has good protection and calmly survives a fall from a half-meter height to a hard surface. </p><p>  All components work fine, but the tablet has the same weakness as other mobile gadgets of this plan - a short battery life.  If you properly load the device, then the maximum that you can squeeze out of it is a couple of hours of fruitful work.  In other cases, such as music and web surfing, the battery lasts for five to six hours. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy View (18.4 ") </h2><p>  Another far from small tablet from Samsung.  With its dimensions, the model easily closes even some laptops.  The brand rarely experiments with monster screens due to the specifics of this segment, but this gadget turned out to be very successful and in demand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.samsung.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy View 18.4 ‚Äù" class="if uuid-3090862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3090862.jpg"></div><p>  Screen sizes could not affect the weight of the device.  2650 grams are felt on the knees not as a tablet, but as a serious laptop.  But the manufacturer foresaw this moment and suggests using the model in a stationary mode using a special stand that comes with the device. </p><p>  The technical part of the tablet is not so hot, but for designers and layout designers it is enough.  For gamers, the "filling" does not suit, because in serious gaming applications you have to reset the graphic settings to average, or even minimum values. </p><h2>  Device features </h2><p>  Exynos 7580 branded processor with eight cores, 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal are responsible for the performance.  Cameras are also available, but you can‚Äôt make great photos with them.  The front peephole is suitable only for video messengers, while the rear peephole takes ordinary pictures, which can be rated as good.  But the manufacturer did not position his device as a photographer‚Äôs tool. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy View" class="if uuid-3090865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3090865.jpg"></div><p>  There are no questions about the build quality and materials.  The case does not play, does not creak and behaves quite adequately.  Pleased with the battery life.  The impressive battery capacity of 5700 mAh allows you to work up to 4 hours when fully loaded or up to 8 with moderate. </p><h2>  Apple iPad Pro 2017 (12.9 ") </h2><p>  This balanced model is designed to solve almost any problem.  Thanks to a powerful set of chipsets, the gadget is good both in work and for entertainment.  Not only designers and layout designers leave positive reviews about the model, but also ambitious gamers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="uae.souq.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple iPad Pro 2017 12.9 ‚Äù" class="if uuid-3090867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3090867.jpg"></div><p>  The 12.9-inch gadget received an excellent quality matrix with high resolution.  The speed of the device is comparable to mid-range laptops, and in some cases (application layout) of the premium segment. </p><p>  On sale you can find several modifications of this series.  They differ only in the volume of the internal drive - 64, 256 and 512 GB.  The processor does not change, as well as the size of RAM - 4 GB. </p><h2>  Device features </h2><p>  As a rule, in the production of large gadgets, designers save on cameras, but not in the case of the iPad 2017. The tablet offers the user excellent quality of shooting at the rear camera and good at the front camera.  The optical stabilization system alone is worth it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.turn-on.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple iPad Pro 2017" class="if uuid-3090868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3090868.jpg"></div><p>  As for the build quality and materials used, here we have the classic representative of Apple, even without a hint of structural flaws: there are no any backlashes, creaks or crevices.  Despite the decent dimensions, the ergonomic part suffered to a minimum.  The tablet is convenient to use and just hold it in your hands. </p><p>  Also pleased with the battery capacity.  Even if you properly load the gadget with everything you can, it will calmly work up to 9 hours.  In mixed mode, it will be enough for a day.  Well, for those who want to use the device as an e-book or surf the Internet, you can not worry about recharging a couple of days. </p><p>  Naturally, all these pluses will have to pay a lot of money, but judging by the reviews of popular reviewers, there is no overpayment for the brand.  In addition, this model has been on the market for two years and its prices have fallen markedly. </p>
