  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Computational Linguistics</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Computer linguistics is gradually exhausting itself.  Such a conclusion is accompanied by unsuccessful research in the field of "highly intelligent" information products, carried out for half a century.  We are talking about automated adequate translations or the search for information within the meaning of documentary arrays in a particular language. </p><p>  Machine processing of any texts by itself can only be carried out using super-linguistic technologies that are capable of analyzing information at the level of understanding the basic meaning as an ordinary person. </p><p>  Unfortunately, computer linguistics together with cybernetics was not able to invent the perfect machine translation or create a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù dialogue system.  Scientific and technological progress put everything in its place.  And the scientists working at that time were able to prove that the solution to the problem of ‚Äúmachine thinking‚Äù can be carried out only with a full understanding of the working procedure of natural consciousness.  And only in this case, researchers will be able to subject all procedures of thinking to computer algorithms.  In other words, automatic <span>processing of information</span> will contribute to a new view of human thinking. </p><p>  When comprehending any message, people never compare the information received with the models and concepts of the behavior of images that are in memory.  For each model obtained, a person in memory discovers a correspondence in the accumulated experience, and only then with further rethinking of the text does he begin to concretize and refine the information received.  In contrast to the above, computer linguistics is aimed at establishing exact correspondence of word meanings, while trying to overcome the problem of the ambiguity of toolkits in the form of words that are characteristic of any language.  This is what distinguishes the considered concept from the action of human thinking.  There is an opinion that a person understands a text or speech not at the expense of special knowledge of morphological loads or the establishment of syntax between words, but through initial associative assumptions to form a picture of perceived information in accordance with its internal content. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In close interaction with computer, mathematical linguistics is used, which is a discipline responsible for the development of a formal apparatus for describing artificial and natural languages.  This subject of study arose in the 20th century in order to clarify the basic concepts of linguistics.  The basis was laid on the basic methods and ideas of algebra and <span>mathematical programming.</span>  Close interaction with the linguistics of this discipline is confirmed by the use of the mathematical apparatus in linguistic studies. </p><p>  For the first time, the mathematical description of the language was substantiated by F. de Saussure, who introduced the language as a mechanism that functions in <span>speech activity</span> through its speakers.  As a result of this activity, the so-called ‚Äúcorrect texts‚Äù can be obtained, which are a sequence of speech units and are subject to general laws that can be described using mathematical expressions. </p><p>  One of the structural parts of mathematical linguistics is the theory of formal grammars, which was created by <span>N. Chomsky.</span>  This theory allows us to describe the patterns that characterize not every text individually, but a complete set of correct texts.  At this stage, computer linguistics can be used quite successfully, which can build a kind of mechanism called ‚Äúformal grammar‚Äù, which allows using the special procedure to form the correct texts of the language being studied in combination with a description of its structure. </p>
