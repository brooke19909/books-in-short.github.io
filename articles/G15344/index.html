    <h2>  Negative guest reviews </h2><p>  Not all guests of the Baikal 3 * complex (Bulgaria, Sunny Beach) liked the quality of local service.  According to tourists, the hotel has a number of serious drawbacks that can ruin your vacation.  We list the main ones: </p><ul><li>  The rooms have old TVs that are impossible to watch, because the image quality is just awful. </li><li>  The floor on the balcony is very dirty, and the cleaners did not wash it during the rest. </li><li>  Cold water in the pool, so you can‚Äôt swim with children here. </li><li>  In August, a lot of algae swims in the sea, which is unpleasant to touch with your feet. </li><li>  Soap and shampoo are only given out upon arrival and are not supplemented if hotel guests have spent them. </li><li>  Internet is paid and works very poorly. </li><li>  There are few sun loungers by the pool, and tourists occupy them in the early morning. </li></ul><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  We can say that Baikal 3 * ("Baikal" 3 *), the description of which is presented above, will be a good option for a cheap vacation in Bulgaria.  For a small cost, the complex offers all the necessary amenities for living and recreation, as well as a good selection of entertainment.  It can be recommended for those who like to spend time on site, relaxing on the beach.  The convenient location makes the hotel a good option for tourists who prefer an active holiday.  Near Baikal there are many places and attractions worth visiting.  Staying here, it is worth considering that most of the guests are families with children and youth companies who like a relaxing holiday. </p>
