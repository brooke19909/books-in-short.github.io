    <h2>  Rome: geographical location </h2><p>  The capital of Italy is located on the hills formed on the plain of Campagna Roman, not far from the Tyrrhenian Sea.  It washes Rome from the west, a river flows into it, dividing the city into two parts - the Tiber.  The weather in Rome is determined by the Mediterranean subtropical climate.  The city is not characterized by sharp temperature changes, due to its location near the sea, surrounded by mountains: Sabatini, Sabini, Prenestani, Albani.  Summer in Rome is mild, but the inhabitants of the city suffer from a strong south wind - sirocco.  In winter, temperatures with a minus sign are rare, but there is a north wind - tramontana. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather in Rome" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40448/1264194.jpg" width="600"></div>

This epithet is explained by the unusual history of the city.  Over the centuries, he underwent destruction and fall several times, but he always managed to survive and become even more beautiful. </p><p>  Legends of Rome connect the emergence of the city with the names of Romulus and Remus, the sons of the god Mars.  They founded the city together, but, as legend has it, Romulus removed his brother from power and became the first king of Rome.  The founding date of the city is 753 BC.  Its influence spread first to the entire Apennine Peninsula, then to other European lands.  By the 2nd century AD, Rome, which became the center of a world superpower - the <span>Roman Empire,</span> began to dominate a vast territory from England to North Africa, including the entire Mediterranean and southern shores of the Black Sea.  By the 4th century, Rome was becoming the center of the Christian world, but economically losing its position.  In the same century, a terrible event in the history of the population of Rome.  Vandals from the northeast captured the city.  They destroyed most of the historical monuments, cultural centers, did not reckon with the Roman population, with its customs.  It took Rome several centuries to recover.  The empire was destroyed - the eastern part began to be called Byzantium.  But already in the 15th century, the Eternal City once again became the world cultural center - the center of the Renaissance.  In the 18-19 centuries, Rome was subjected to French conquest.  The heads of the Catholic Church were several times taken out of the city, which was considered the center of Catholicism.  Only towards the end of the 70s of the 19th century Rome recovered from endless conflicts and became the capital of the <span>Italian kingdom.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Country in Rome? </h2><p>  Unique is the state of the Vatican.  This country, located on the territory of Rome, is the smallest state officially recognized. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy city Rome" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40448/1264197.jpg" width="600"></div>  The Vatican was formed under Mussolini in 1929 and is a theocratic state in which power is in the hands of religious institutions.  There are none like him in the world.  Only Athos in Greece, which is a community of 20 Orthodox monasteries, has such a device.  Even in ancient times, the territory of the present Vatican was considered sacred.  And in the 4th century, above the tomb of St. Peter, the Basilica of Constantine was erected.  Since then, this place has hosted thousands of pilgrims from all over the world.
