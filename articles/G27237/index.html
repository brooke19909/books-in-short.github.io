    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  The phone is not much different from other devices in the Xiaomi Redmi line.  The design has calm notes, it does not look very attractive.  Sold in three different colors: black, gold and pink. </p><p>  Designers tried as much as possible to create such an appearance that would allow the device to be universal.  The frames are thin, the body has contours.  Glass type 2.5D.  In the case there are metal parts.  Such a set is standard, there are no bright accents at all. </p><p>  Many owners note that the developers have overdone it.  They created an uninteresting device that does not have any distinctive features.  As a comparison, you can use Meizu and its products.  They are very similar to each other, but due to the design of the camera and some details, such as the keys under the display, the phones look more recognizable and interesting. </p><h2>  Arrangement of elements </h2><p>  All elements are located as standard.  On the front side there is a display.  It also has a speaker and a front camera.  There are sensors right there, however, they are camouflaged and difficult to find right away. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Under the display there are touch keys that are responsible for the next set of commands "Back", "Home" and "Task Manager".  There is no backlight, which does not please buyers.  Indeed, in the dark, it is impossible to make out the buttons.  Previously, they used reflective paint in such phones, but now they have refused to use it.  Under the Home button there is an indicator of missed events. </p><p>  There is a special tray on the left side of the device.  One is designed for a "micro" type SIM card, and the second is formed under a "micro" or "nano".  On the right side you can see the volume rocker, as well as turning on the device.  In this, the characteristics of Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16Gb are excellent. </p><p>  At the top there is an infrared port, a hole that is a microphone and a headphone jack.  The lower edge has speaker and microphone grilles.  Between them you can see the port for USB. </p><p>  The back of the device is made of metal.  At the bottom and top there are plastic inserts.  In the left corner there is a camera and flash.  Fingerprint scanner is located a little lower, then comes the manufacturer‚Äôs logo, which is fully connected to the black background. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the phone does not have sharp edges, it is easy to hold in your hand.  Thanks to this, all the buttons on the side faces and the fingerprint scanner are exactly under the fingers.  The assembly is of excellent quality: there are no creaks or backlashes.  The keys are tight, the scanner is fast, no errors are observed. </p>

Created using OGS technology.  In other words, there is no air gap.  Given that this model is budget, the presence of backlighting, a deep black color and the complete absence of impurities in a white shade is simply a luxury.  The viewing angles are excellent.  However, with a strong deviation of the screen, slight distortion is still noticeable.  FullHD resolution is not available, however, the cost does not allow us to consider this a drawback. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When exposed to sunlight, the brightness levels will suffice, however, end-to-end.  The minimum indicator will allow you to successfully use the device in the dark.  These characteristics of Xiaomi Redmi 4X 2 16Gb please buyers. </p><p>  Allowed to change the temperature of the screen.  This is done in the phone settings.  However, many owners say that this is unnecessary.  The standard version suits almost everyone. </p><p>  The device simultaneously recognizes up to 10 touches.  There is an oleophobic coating. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The device pleases its owners with a 13 megapixel camera.  PDAF mode supported. </p><p>  The matrices are not particularly brilliant in quality, however, as for an inexpensive device, everything is fine.  In difficult situations, the device will not be able to create a high-quality and good image.  Also, sometimes the system does not cope with noise reduction or does it too much.  About such characteristics Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16Gb is written in the reviews.  The owners note that if you look at the camera as a whole, then there are no critical flaws.  Autofocus is fast, accurate.  There is a white balance.  It is working correctly.  The sharpness and contrast of the photos is excellent. </p><p>  Video is recorded with a resolution of up to 1,080. Speed ‚Äã‚Äã- 30 frames per second.  The interface is as simple and convenient as possible.  No superfluous elements, all functions are at hand.  Owners criticize the manual mode.  It has only two changeable functions: white balance and ISO. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone xiaomi redmi 4x 16gb black specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2050183.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  Battery life is considered a powerful indicator for this device.  Of course, these are not some records, but the indicators are good.  Battery power - 4 thousand mAh.  The work environment is optimized and the screen resolution consumes little. </p><p>  The manufacturer claims that the device can last about 36 hours during conversations, 15 hours in the video playback mode, 13 hours even playing heavy games, 18 days with the fourth generation mobile network turned on, and 15 hours with navigation activated. </p><p>  What do the owners say about this?  They use the smartphone Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16Gb Black, the characteristics of which please many, at full brightness.  When watching high-quality videos (720 r), the phone lasts 12 hours, in a browser a person can "sit" for no more than 9 hours, and play games - 7 hours. </p><p>  In what conditions does the device show itself perfectly?  If you use it in average mode during the day and at maximum in the evening, then the phone will exceed all expectations.  At the same time, you should not wake up the phone every 15 minutes, otherwise the results will noticeably worsen.  <span>The standby mode is</span> optimized, so the battery charge is slower. </p><p>  Owners use their phone like this (based on reviews): about 10 minutes of calls, an hour of browsing sites and reading with average brightness, 1.5 hours of listening to tracks with the display turned off, 30 minutes.  on social networks, regular chatting and viewing mail, creating ten photos, 20 min.  to use cards.  At the same time, mail, Twitter and Telegram are working on the background.  In this mode, the device shows the balance of 60% of the charged battery 15 hours after disconnecting from the network.  At the same time, the screen is turned off on average for about 4 hours. </p><p>  If you wish, you can draw out better characteristics.  It is only necessary to activate the energy saving mode, as well as use the utility from the manufacturer, which detects and turns off applications that work in the background and require a lot of energy. </p><p>  The only minus in the characteristics of the smartphone Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16Gb is the lack of a quick charge option. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The phone runs on the MIUI shell.  This is the hallmark of all Redmi devices.  However, this firmware for beginners can become strong and sometimes not very pleasant surprises.  Experienced users will not be able to figure it out - this is stated in the official characteristics of Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X 16Gb. </p><p>  This is due to the fact that the installed shell differs from the usual Android.  It combines the best qualities of the operating system from Apple and the ‚Äúrobot‚Äù itself.  The manufacturer is in no hurry to adjust its shell under Google.  Because of this, for new users the interface may seem somewhat unusual and even repulsive. </p><p>  However, the factory still installs the usual Google Play services.  Russification has problems, however, in general, they are not critical.  But owners do not recommend purchasing a phone directly from China. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xiaomi redmi 4x 16gb specifications and reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2050185.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  For a long time, Xiaomi has occupied a special place in the budget segment in the phone market.  The company provides inexpensive, but high-quality devices.  They are multifunctional and do not disappoint.  All specifications of Xiaomi Redmi 4X 16Gb Black are excellent. </p><p>  If we talk about PCT devices and compare the described model with them, then Redmi 4X is considered average.  The combination of price and quality is perfect.  Buyers note that the design is a little boring, but there are no complaints about the work. </p><p>  There are a lot of competitors in this model.  Which one to prefer is strictly everyone's business.  The first model, which should be noted, is known to many - Meizu M3s Mini.  During his release, he was considered one of the best and balanced in its price category.  However, today it is considered obsolete.  This is noticeable at least because it functions on the Android operating system of the fifth version.  If this is what repels, it is worth paying attention to the Meizu M5.  She has slightly improved specifications and a larger screen size.  It differs from Redmi 4X in a greater ideology.  Meizu devices have a slightly different shell and there is a common feature of all devices: a multifunction key instead of a block of touch type keys. </p><p>  If a person is already tired of using inexpensive Chinese models, then you should pay attention to Zenfone 3 Max from the American Asus.  The cost is a little more, but the iron is more powerful and the display is better.  The design also looks much more solid, the battery life is excellent, the version of the operating system will please many fans of new products.  The shell, although branded, is almost analogous to the pure ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  In addition, for not too much cost you can get not only a good device, but also a famous brand.  Otherwise, the characteristics of Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X 16Gb are better. </p>
