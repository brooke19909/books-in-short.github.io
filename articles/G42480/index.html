  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Taxation "Income minus expenses": features, advantages and disadvantages</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every entrepreneur starting his activity should understand what tax system will be applied to them.  Individual entrepreneurs and companies have the opportunity to take advantage of a simplified regime called USN.  It is presented in two varieties, since revenue or net profit can act as a tax base.  If the company is engaged in the sale of various goods with a minimum margin, then the taxation “Income minus expenses” is ideal.  In this case, to determine the tax base, it is necessary to initially find the difference between the cash proceeds of the business and the costs of doing business. </p><h2>  Features of USN </h2><p>  A simplified system can be used by both private entrepreneurs and various companies.  "Simplified" for IP and firms has numerous undeniable advantages.  Each entrepreneur can choose one option for this mode: </p><ul><li>  payment of 15% of net profit; </li><li>  payment of 6% of the total revenue of the company. </li></ul><p>  If the margin on goods is low, then it is advisable to choose the taxation "Income minus expenses".  To switch to this mode, you must submit an appropriate application to the Federal Tax Service.  The complexity of such a system lies in the specificity of accounting, since KUDi will have to be maintained, and all expenses must be confirmed with official documents to reduce the tax base. </p><p>  Most often, this system is chosen by representatives of small or medium-sized businesses.  Tax features of the STS “Revenues minus expenses” are listed in Sec.  26.2 Tax Code.  Here are the requirements for entrepreneurs, the nuances of using the system, set tax rates, and also lists the nuances of determining the tax base. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="camattersonline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simplified taxation system income minus expenses" class="if uuid-3044868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3044868.jpg"></div><h2>  Who can use it? </h2><p>  The simplified tax system “Income minus expenses” can be applied by both individual entrepreneurs and various companies.  Net profit acts as the tax base, therefore, to determine the tax base from all cash receipts of the business, it is necessary to subtract expenses. </p><p>  The main requirements for entrepreneurs include the following: </p><ul><li>  income per year cannot exceed 45 million rubles; </li><li>  the transition to this regime is not allowed for companies that have different representative offices or branches; </li><li>  the value of fixed assets belonging to this organization should not exceed 150 million rubles; </li><li>  it is not allowed to use the system by different insurance companies, banks or foreign organizations; </li><li>  the regime does not apply to non-state PFs or market participants in which various transactions with securities are carried out; </li><li>  USN does not apply to companies that are representatives of the gambling business or manufacturers of excisable goods; </li><li>  the company should employ no more than 100 people; </li><li>  notaries or owners of pawnshops do not use this system. </li></ul><p>  It is forbidden to combine the simplified tax system with the unified agricultural tax, therefore if an individual entrepreneur or company specializes in agriculture, then only the unified agricultural tax should be used. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  System Nuances </h2><p>  The tax system “Income minus expenses” has certain features.  These include: </p><ul><li>  a single tax is paid instead of several fees represented by property tax, personal income tax, VAT or income tax; </li><li>  by reducing the amount of taxes paid, the tax burden on the taxpayer is reduced; </li><li>  a declaration on this regime is submitted to the Federal Tax Service annually; </li><li>  tax is paid in advance, after which the final amount is calculated and paid at the beginning of next year. </li></ul><p>  The declaration is considered simple in compilation, so entrepreneurs who are just starting their activities can independently engage in the process of reporting, which saves on the cost of an accountant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.czechinvest.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tax system income minus expenses" class="if uuid-3044872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3044872.jpg"></div><h2>  How can I switch to mode? </h2><p>  Before using this system, an entrepreneur must understand the mode.  The system "Income minus expenses" - what is the taxation?  It is represented by a variety of STS, in which the tax base is represented by the net profit of the enterprise. </p><p>  You can switch to this mode in various ways: </p><ul><li>  when registering a company or individual entrepreneur directly, you can immediately file an application on the basis of which the entrepreneur selects the appropriate tax regime; </li><li>  if the individual entrepreneur works on UTII, then he can switch to the simplified tax system at any time; </li><li>  if another taxation regime is used, for example, OSNO or PSN, then the transition is possible only from the beginning of the next calendar year, and the application must be submitted to the Federal Tax Service before the end of December. </li></ul><p>  Before submitting an application, you should understand what is included in the STS “Income minus expenses”, what are the pros and cons of this system, as well as what difficulties entrepreneurs face. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The pros of the regime </h2><p>  Simplified regimes are specifically introduced by the state to facilitate the work of many entrepreneurs or companies.  If the simplified tax system “Income minus expenses” is chosen, then businessmen can enjoy some undeniable advantages.  These include: </p><ul><li>  multiple taxes are replaced with one tax, which reduces the tax burden on the company or individual entrepreneur; </li><li>  the process of preparing a declaration is considered simple and understandable, moreover, this documentation is submitted to the Federal Tax Service only once a year; </li><li>  if an individual entrepreneur on a simplified tax system does not have employees, then accounting is not required, since the availability of KUDiR is sufficient; </li><li>  apply this mode when working on virtually any type of activity; </li><li>  entrepreneurs independently decide which type of STS will be used during operation; </li><li>  the amount of tax depends entirely on the proceeds or profit, therefore, if there is no income, then only the minimum fee is paid, and it is also possible to draw up and submit to the Federal Tax Service a zero return. </li></ul><p>  It is advisable to apply for the transition to this mode directly in the process of registration of LLC or IP.  Another significant advantage is that newcomers to the business can rely on using the simplified tax system for tax holidays.  This relief is offered to entrepreneurs who register for the first time until 2020.  They must choose a field of activity related to the provision of domestic services, the production of various goods, or to work in the scientific or social sphere.  For various reasons, the local authorities of each region can reduce the rate, which significantly reduces the tax burden. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.india-briefing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="down payment" class="if uuid-3044871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3044871.jpg"></div><h2>  System flaws </h2><p>  Taxation “Income minus expenses” has not only significant advantages, but also some disadvantages. </p><p>  They are as follows: </p><ul><li>  it is not allowed to hire more than 100 hired specialists, therefore this system is suitable only for companies that are small or medium, and not only full-time employees, but also people with whom a civil law contract is drawn up are taken into account; </li><li>  per year, profit from activities should not exceed 50 million rubles; </li><li>  the value of assets should not be more than 150 million rubles; </li><li>  It’s not possible to switch to another simplified mode until the beginning of next year. </li></ul><p>  In fact, the shortcomings of such a system are considered not too significant and serious.  Therefore, the regime is used by numerous entrepreneurs and companies. </p><h2>  Reporting Nuances </h2><p>  When choosing the tax system “Income minus expenses”, businessmen should prepare for the need for an annual preparation of a fairly simple and understandable declaration. </p><p>  The rules for its design are as follows: </p><ul><li>  the document can be filled in by hand or on a computer; </li><li>  it is allowed to use special programs created and published in the public domain by employees of the Federal Tax Service, which can significantly simplify the procedure for entering information into this document; </li><li>  the calendar year serves as the tax period for this regime; </li><li>  Until March 31 of each year, it is necessary to submit a declaration to the Federal Tax Service; </li><li>  monthly and quarterly reports are only handed over to insurance funds, if the entrepreneur has employees; </li><li>  annual reports are submitted containing information on the average number of employees in the company; </li><li>  in addition, in the presence of hired workers, one must submit a 6-personal income tax return and 2-personal income tax certificates. </li></ul><p>  Entrepreneurs should understand the rules of maintaining KUDiR, since only in this document you can specify what the income and expenses of the individual entrepreneur or company are.  If during a tax audit it turns out that this document is missing or is being conducted incorrectly, this will be the basis for holding the entrepreneur accountable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cpacanada.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="income minus expenses is what taxation" class="if uuid-3044874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3044874.jpg"></div><h2>  For whom is this regime beneficial? </h2><p>  Often they choose the system “Income minus expenses” of the entrepreneurs and business owners, but it is important to make sure that working under such a regime will bring certain benefits to the business.  It is advisable to use this method of calculating taxes in the following situations: </p><ul><li>  the entrepreneur specializes in retailing with the help of small stationary commercial premises, but the simplified tax system is applied only on the condition that it is impossible to use UTII in a specific region; </li><li>  the system is ideally suited for small companies represented by entertainment organizations or enterprises providing various services to the population; </li><li>  it is optimal to use the calculation of income and expenses if the margin is small, so it is advisable to calculate the net profit represented by the tax base. </li></ul><p>  It is not too profitable to use a simplified system if the company interacts with counterparties that use VAT, since in this case it will not be possible to return some of the funds from the state in the form of a VAT refund.  Additionally, this mode is not suitable for large enterprises, as they simply will not meet the requirements of the simplified tax system.  When using this system, it will not work to participate in tenders. </p><h2>  Accounting Features </h2><p>  The object of taxation under “Income minus expenses” is net profit, therefore, the specificity of accounting is the need to calculate the tax base.  To do this, all officially confirmed and justified expenses must be deducted from income. </p><p>  Income derived from activities includes: </p><ul><li>  transfer of funds by customers to the account of an entrepreneur or company; </li><li>  receipt of money from retail sales of goods; </li><li>  income from differences in exchange rates; </li><li>  receipt of intangible assets; </li><li>  remuneration in the form of a commission; </li><li>  return of advance payment by buyers. </li></ul><p>  All of the above cash receipts are certainly registered in KUDiR.  Under the “Income minus expenses” system, how many percent are charged from the tax base?  As soon as the net profit is correctly determined, it is charged 15%. </p><div class="photo" data-original="radevlaw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simplified for un" class="if uuid-3044870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3044870.jpg"></div><h2>  What is included in the cost? </h2><p>  Before applying for the transition to "Income minus expenses", the entrepreneur must make sure that he really can cope with the correct calculation of the tax base.  Tax inspectors have a lot of requirements for expenses, with the help of which business revenues are reduced.  They must be confirmed by official documents, and must be justified.  As a confirmation, primary payment securities are used, represented by various checks, invoices, invoices or contracts. </p><p>  The main costs faced by entrepreneurs include: </p><ul><li>  purchase of fixed assets; </li><li>  purchase of direct goods for resale, as well as materials or raw materials for production activities; </li><li>  transportation costs associated with the purchase of goods for business; </li><li>  services provided by third parties for a fee; </li><li>  rent for used commercial premises; </li><li>  value added tax claimed by companies with which the entrepreneur cooperates; </li><li>  salaries of hired specialists; </li><li>  taxes and insurance premiums for themselves and employees. </li></ul><p>  Simplified for IP is an excellent option, but the entrepreneur must be well versed in how to properly take into account costs and income.  The correctness of tax calculation depends on this.  Advance payments under the simplified tax system must be paid quarterly, therefore, it is necessary to fill in the KUDiR in a timely manner.  Particular attention is paid to the expenditure side, as entrepreneurs often encounter the fact that after a tax audit, inspectors charge additional taxes due to the lack of confirmation of certain expenses. </p><h2>  Rules for maintaining KUDiR </h2><p>  Reporting with “Income minus expenses” is presented by the declaration of the simplified tax system, which is submitted annually.  Additionally, a book is required, which indicates all cash receipts, as well as officially confirmed expenses. </p><p>  The KUDiR filling rules include the following: </p><ul><li>  all entrepreneurs using USN are required to complete this book; </li><li>  the document has two parts, since one part is intended for income, and the other is used to enter information on business expenses; </li><li>  data is entered on an accrual basis; </li><li>  it is allowed to fill out in paper or electronic form; </li><li>  a separate book is made for each calendar year; </li><li>  if a paper version of the document is used, then before entering the information, the book is numbered and stitched; </li><li>  if a computer is used to maintain the document, then when submitting the USN declaration, a book must be printed and endorsed. </li></ul><p>  All IEs on “Income minus expenses” should understand the rules for maintaining this reporting.  Otherwise, entrepreneurs may be held accountable by tax inspectors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rcbadvisors.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="object of taxation income minus expenses" class="if uuid-3044873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3044873.jpg"></div><h2>  How is tax calculated? </h2><p>  It is important to pay advance payments on a quarterly basis.  The following algorithm is used to calculate tax: </p><ul><li>  for three months, all official income from activities is summarized; </li><li>  costs are calculated that are documented and justified, as well as included in the KUDiR; </li><li>  expenses are deducted from income; </li><li>  the tax base is adjusted if there is a loss in previous periods of work; </li><li>  tax deduction is used if the entrepreneur has already paid the trade fee; </li><li>  as soon as the tax base is determined, you should find out if any reduced tax rate is applied in the entrepreneur's region of residence; </li><li>  the amount of tax is calculated, for which the standard rate (15%) or the reduced rate that the entrepreneur can use is used. </li></ul><p>  The calculation is carried out on an accrual basis.  The last payment is made at the beginning of next year, and for its calculation, all cash receipts and expenses for one year of work are taken into account.  After determining the tax base and the amount of tax, the payment for funds previously transferred to the budget is reduced.  Based on the obtained values, the USN declaration is correctly filled out, surrendering to the Federal Tax Service until March 31. </p><h2>  Rules for filling out a declaration </h2><p>  Entrepreneurs using this regime are required to annually submit to the Federal Tax Service a USN declaration.  It includes the following information: </p><ul><li>  information about the entrepreneur or company; </li><li>  rules for calculating the tax base; </li><li>  income received for the year of work; </li><li>  expenses that should be justified and supported by official documents; </li><li>  the deduction is indicated if the entrepreneur can use it; </li><li>  The exact amount paid by the company or individual entrepreneur in the form of tax is given. </li></ul><p>  It is allowed to use special programs to fill out this documentation, greatly simplifying the procedure for generating a declaration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="abdullahfirm.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="taxation of income minus expenses" class="if uuid-3044867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3044867.jpg"></div><h2>  The nuances of paying the minimum tax </h2><p>  Often, entrepreneurs are faced with a lack of profit.  In this case, they can submit a zero return to the Federal Tax Service, but at the same time they pay the minimum tax for “Income minus expenses”.  Its size is 1% of all cash receipts from the business. </p><p>  The difference between the standard tax and the minimum may be included in deferred expenses of the company. </p><p>  The minimum fee is calculated only at the end of the year, since when calculating advance payments there is no way to determine whether there will be profit from the company at the end of the tax period.  Therefore, quarterly advance payments must be calculated, for which 15% is determined and paid from net profit.  At the end of the year, you can determine what kind of tax you have to pay: standard or minimum.  If it turns out that you need to pay a minimum fee, then it may be reduced by the previously listed advance payments.       ,     . </p><p>          ,          .     ,       ,      ,          - . </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  <span>   ,</span>    15%     ,      .      ,     . </p><p>           ,        .     . </p>
