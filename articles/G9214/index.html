  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to see the rest of the Internet on "Tele2" (instructions)</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Internet is used not only on computers.  Modern people have access to the World Wide Web even on smartphones.  Due to the huge interest in the Internet, mobile operators have launched various tariff plans, including traffic packets, the size of which starts from a few megabytes and ends with tens of gigabytes.  At Tele2, for example, such tariff plans as My Talk, My Online, Premium, etc. Periodically, subscribers of this operator are faced with the question of how to view the rest of the Internet on Tele2.  Let‚Äôs figure out how the remaining megabytes and gigabytes are checked. </p><h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  Each subscriber has a personal account.  You can enter it if you have Internet from any computer.  On the main page of your personal account, the user is invited to look superficially with the basic information regarding his mobile phone number.  Here you can see the rest of the Internet on Tele2, and find out the balance, the available minutes and SMS balances, the number of connected services, expenses. </p><p>  For more detailed information, the upper menu in your account is intended, which includes buttons such as "Tariff and balances", "Balance", "Services", "Expenses". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pefikt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Login to your account" class="if uuid-3207315" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3207315.jpg"></div><h2>  Login Methods </h2><p>  Those subscribers who first encounter the question of how to see the rest of the Internet traffic on Tele2 sometimes do not know how to enter their personal account.  If you are among such persons, then first go to the official website of the mobile operator.  At the top of the screen in the right corner you will see the "Enter Cabinet" button.  Click on it.  You will be redirected to the page with the entry form. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are 2 ways to enter your personal account: </p><ol><li>  No password.  This method is suitable for those who are not particularly often going to use their personal account.  Only a number is required on the form.  After that, a message will be sent to the phone with an additional one-time code, which will need to be entered on the site.  Well, after that, your personal account becomes available. </li><li>  By number and password.  This method is provided for those who plan to often use their personal account.  The fact is that the first method is not entirely convenient.  SMS messages may be delayed.  When choosing a method of entering by number and password, the subscriber will not have to wait for anything. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Personal account &quot;Tele2&quot;" class="if uuid-3207338" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3207338.jpg"></div><h2>  Traffic remaining </h2><p>  After choosing a way to enter and enter a one-time code or password, you will be in your personal account.  The question of how to see the rest of the Internet on the Tele2 account will disappear immediately.  You will see the name of the tariff plan valid on your number.  And the rest on it.  For more information, click on the button "More about balances" at the bottom or click on the button from the "Tariff and balances" menu at the top. </p><p>  On the page that opens before you, you will see more detailed information about your Internet: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  total traffic </li><li>  The number of transferred megabytes or gigabytes from last month; </li><li>  current balance; </li><li>  Internet traffic update date. </li></ul><h2>  Connection of additional packages </h2><div class="photo" data-original="bfm74.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ways to Check Internet Traffic" class="if uuid-3207341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3207341.jpg"></div><p>  So, you were able to watch the rest of the Internet on Tele2.  What if there are very few megabytes or gigabytes left?  Right on the page with detailed information you can activate an additional package with Internet traffic.  To do this, click on the ‚ÄúConnect Package‚Äù button.  On the page that opens, select "Renew."  You will see a list of additional packages and set prices. </p><p>  There is a very important nuance.  Tele2 has its own services for each region.  For example, in Moscow and the Moscow Region, you can connect the following additional packages: </p><ul><li>  5 GB for 30 days for 250 rubles; </li><li>  3 GB for 30 days for 200 rubles; </li><li>  500 MB until the end of the day for 50 rubles; </li><li>  100 MB until the end of the day for 15 rubles. </li></ul><p>  And now compare with the services operating in another region of our country.  For example, take the Novosibirsk region.  For 30 days, subscribers are invited to connect either 3 GB for 200 rubles, or 1 GB for 120 rubles.  Until the end of the day, you can activate 100 MB for 12 rubles. </p><p>  To obtain relevant, accurate information on additional packages, services, be sure to indicate your region.  The corresponding button is in the upper right corner. </p><h2>  Single teams </h2><p>  Familiarization with the information in your personal account is not the only answer to the question of how to see the rest of the Internet on Tele2.  The mobile operator has provided several more single commands with which you can learn about the balances on the phone number in a few seconds. </p><p>  Checking the balance of Internet traffic is performed using the command * 155 * 00 #.  To send, the call button is pressed.  After that, information is displayed on the phone screen that the request has been accepted, and an SMS message will be sent.  After a while, a message is actually sent indicating the remainder of the Internet traffic.  To check the balance of other packages there is a command * 155 * 0 #. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jonathonaslay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Command to check" class="if uuid-3207325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3207325.jpg"></div><h2>  Application "My Tele2" </h2><p>  Especially for its subscribers, the mobile operator has developed the application "My Tele2".  You can download it on your smartphone from the App Store or Google Play (today the required versions of Android are 4.4 and higher, iOS - 9.0 and higher).  The application is very convenient, because it has all the functions of a personal account.  The subscriber who installed ‚ÄúMy Tele2‚Äù can both check the balance of Internet traffic on ‚ÄúTele2‚Äù, and change the tariff plan, connect the necessary services, replenish the account with a credit card, use the ‚ÄúPromised payment‚Äù, order a detailed expense report. </p><p>  The application is also convenient in that with it you can manage multiple numbers at once - not only the main, but also the additional one.  The additional number is linked on the official website of the mobile operator in your personal account.  It should be noted that the mobile operator has created a convenient entrance to the application.  The user only enters the password once.  For repeated visits, you do not need to enter a password. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chinasocialmedia.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Application &quot;My Tele2&quot;" class="if uuid-3207326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/3207326.jpg"></div><p>  We learned how to see the rest of the Internet traffic on Tele2.  As you can see, this is not difficult at all.  The easiest way is to check with the command.  Enter it in the phone book on your smartphone.  You can use the team at any time.  If you wish, you can install the application.  It will greatly simplify the process of using communication services and provide an opportunity to quickly replenish the balance of a mobile phone. </p>
