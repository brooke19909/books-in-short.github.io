    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resorts of Egypt </h2><p>  Before moving on to listing hotels, I want to first tell you what resorts in Egypt are.

    <p>  All these hotels are famous for their water activities, they have many pools, slides, while both adults and children.  Kids in these hotels will certainly not be bored.  They are under the constant supervision of instructors.  Parents, the only thing they need is to stock up on sunscreen, and also choose the right time to visit the water park.  As for the prices for these hotels, they are quite acceptable - from 2 to 5 thousand rubles per day with meals on the system “All inclusive” and with the ability to use the full range of entertainment. </p><h2>  Holidays with children in Hurghada </h2><p>  To be honest, this resort is more than Sharm El Sheikh, suitable for families with children.  After all, it is much calmer here, especially at night, and nothing can interfere with your baby’s sleep.  In addition, the best hotels in Egypt for families with children in Hurghada (you can read more about them in the article) are mainly located on the first beach line. </p><p>  Almost on the entire coast of the resort, the entrance to the sea is gentle, and this already suggests that this place is perfect for families with small children.  They can splash freely in the water, and parents will be calm for them.  However, this is not so important if the hotel has a water park or at least a few water slides.  Children, of course, will constantly strive for them. </p><p>  In Hurghada, there are also a lot of separately operating giant water parks, for example, “Jungle” and “Titanic”, however, the guests are good because they do not need to go anywhere, there is no need to purchase an entrance ticket (for guests), you do not need to think about food ( everything is close at hand), etc. That is why parents who are going on vacation to Egypt choose the best hotels in Egypt for families with children with a water park.  Their rating changes with each season, if not more often.  This suggests that the administrations of the complexes are constantly improving water parks operating in their territories, and this allows them to adequately perform on the market.  The best hotels with water parks in Hurghada are: </p><p>  1. “Beach Albatross”. </p><p>  2. “Jungle Aqua Park”. </p><p>  3. “Sinbad Beach”. </p><p>  4. “Iberotel Aquamarine”. </p><p>  5. “Titanic Aqua Park and Resort”. </p><p>  All of them are just great for relaxation for both adults and children.  However, unlike Sharm el-Sheikh, the prices here are slightly lower.  At least five-star hotels here cost the same as 4-star hotels in a nearby resort. </p><h2>  When is it better to relax with a child in Egyptian resorts? </h2><p>  Egypt is very hot in summer.  The sun burns mercilessly almost all year round.  And this means that you can not show your children the most interesting of the sights located in the open.  But in the autumn period the heat decreases a little, but the sea still remains warm and gentle.  Autumn in Egypt, rainfall is a rare, even exceptional event.  And this means that your vacation will not be spoiled by bad weather.  Doctors do not recommend traveling with children to Africa, even North, in the summer.  A trip to Egypt with a baby is also convenient in the spring.  The weather is not hot, but the air feels fresh.  In addition, during this period there are few people here, which means that the prices for tours are lower.  Moreover, Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh are more suitable for recreation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best egypt hotels for families with children 5 stars" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/856344.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to choose the right hotel?  <strong>Hypet: holidays with children, the best hotels, reviews</strong> <strong></strong></h2><p>  Many families traveling on holiday to Egypt think that they do not have to choose hotels with a lot of stars.  Perhaps when it comes to Turkey or Greece, this is actually not so important.  In principle, some “treshki”, and even more so, “fours” may well serve as an excellent refuge for the whole family.  However, when it comes to Egypt, especially Sharm el-Sheikh, it is better to choose among five-star, sometimes even four-star hotels belonging to world brands for families with children.  Africa - it is Africa.  In these hotels you will not need to worry about the cleanliness of the premises, for quality food, etc. At the same time, you will have to take care of children's entertainment.  After all, you may, after workdays, want the most ordinary lazy rest, complete relaxation, and this will not be enough for the children.  They want to frolic and enjoy life.  Therefore, choosing a hotel, stop at those options in which, among other entertainment, there is a water park or at least a few slides.  That is, this means that your choice should fall on the best hotels in Egypt for families with children with a 5-star water park. </p><p>  Reviews of people who have already rested in them will help you navigate and not make mistakes.  After all, even top-class hotels also do not always correspond to the level to which we are already accustomed. </p><p>  The main component of your successful holiday can be a well-organized animation.  The child should be interesting and not bored.  While you will enjoy your vacation, professionals will do the trick.  If you are going on vacation with a child under 3 years old, then ask if the hotel has babysitting services.  This is also very important.  And you also need to find out if the hotel restaurant offers a children's menu.  Eating sometimes becomes the biggest problem that can ruin your vacation.  Even if you have a buffet with a huge variety of dishes, it happens that for your child there is nothing suitable for all this.  After all, you will not feed him with sharp and salty delicacies, etc. In principle, this is what distinguishes good five-star hotels - all wishes and all the needs of vacationers are taken into account here. </p><p>  When traveling with children, it is also very important that the hotel has a pharmacy and 24-hour medical assistance.  Sometimes during the acclimatization of a child, the temperature can rise sharply, and parents must be sure that they will be helped in such a situation.  From the reviews of vacationers, it becomes clear that many 5- and 4-star hotels are perfect for families with children. </p><h2>  The best hotels in Egypt for families with children in Sharm El Sheikh and Hurghada: Albatros hotel chain </h2><p>  Among all the <span>Egyptian hotels with a water park, the</span> most successful are the Albatros hotels.  In Hurghada, the four-star Albatros Jungle Aqua Park Hotel is located.  It is perhaps the largest of all existing water park hotels.  On its vast territory there are as many as 16 pools with 35 slides for different age categories.  Such a wide range of water activities compensates for the lack of a private beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best egypt hotels for families with children reviews" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/856343.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another hotel of this chain - Albatros Aqua Blu Sharm - also belongs to the 4 * category.  It is located in the most prestigious of the Egyptian resorts - in Sharm El Sheikh.  Its water park is practically no inferior to what is in Hurghada.  There is only one slide less than in the “Jungle”.  This hotel is also not located on the first beach line.  The sea is 700 meters away.  Of course, families with children rarely go to the beach, preferring to relax near the pools in which their kids frolic. </p><p>  Another of the Albatros hotels - Royal Albatros Moderna 5 * - is located in the Nabq district.  It is also great for kids.  Here, as in all hotels of this network, there are pools with slides and other water activities.  Interesting leisure activities of the younger generation are organized by professional animators.  Children will definitely not be bored here: on the territory of the hotel complex there is a rather large water park with slides for both children and their parents.  Pools are heated in the winter.  From the reviews of former guests, we become aware that from the point of view of the interior, not everything is perfect here.  Most rooms need renovation.  Nevertheless, this is a very comfortable hotel, and you can spend a wonderful vacation here.  With food, everything is also at the highest level.  The restaurant has dishes for children.  But lovers of swimming in the sea is better not to come here.  In this area it is prone to ebbs and flows, that is, there is no stably outlined beach line, which is quite dangerous, especially for children.  In a word, the establishments of the Albatros chain are the best hotels in Egypt for families with children in Sharm El Sheikh and Hurghada. </p><h2>  Iberotel Aquamarine 5 * </h2><p>  For many, the best hotel in Egypt for families with a child is “Iberotel Aquamarine 5 * ″ (Hurghada).  Here tourists are provided with the highest level of service.  Everything is pleasing to the eye in the hotel: magnificent stylish interior, chic restaurants, bars, cafes, a fitness center, SPA, etc. Two water parks are waiting for water lovers here: for adults and for children.  In the cool season, the pools in the water park are heated.  For children, the complex has a mini club, a games room and a playground, animation, as well as a special menu in the restaurant.  As you can see, “Iberotel Aquamarine” can safely carry the title “The best hotel in Egypt for families with children.” </p><h2>  “Titanic Waterpark and Resort” </h2><p>  Another four-star hotel complex can be called the best among Egyptian hotels designed for families.  Representatives of the younger generation will especially like it.  This is the Titanic Waterpark &amp; ​​Resort.  Unlike the previous ones, it has its own vast beach.  Some of the 28 slides are set next to the sea.  The rest are located at 9 pools.  All of them are heated in the winter and create comfortable conditions for enjoying water activities.  The hotel also has tennis and volleyball courts, a five-a-side football field, a fitness center, billiards tables and table tennis.  It can also be safely added to the list of "The best hotels in Egypt for families with children."  Guest reviews speak of this.  Sometimes guest ratings are much more truthful than the various ratings compiled by advertising companies. <strong> </strong></p><h2>  Three Corners Kiroseiz </h2><p>  The list of "The best hotels in Egypt for families with children" 5 stars "(Sharm-El-Sheikh)" continues the hotel "Three Corners".  It is very comfortable, owned by the Belgian owners.  Three Corners Kiroseiz Resort is located very close to the beach.  It takes only 10 minutes to get from the airport to it, which is very convenient when the baby travels with parents.  After all, not all children tolerate a long ride in a car.  By the way, while relaxing in this hotel, you can choose either a room in one of the three-story buildings, or a two-story villa.  The latter option is simply ideal for families, as the cottages are equipped with kitchens, as well as washing machines.  Every mother understands how important this is, especially if you came to Egypt not for a week, but for two or three.  As for the entertainment zone, there is no such variety as in the hotels of the Albatros chain, however it is rather quiet and calm here. </p><h2>  Tia Heights Aqua 5 * </h2><p>  This hotel also has every reason to be called the best for family vacations.  It is located in Hurghada, on the coast of Makadi Bay.  Due to its gigantic size and developed infrastructure, it is more correct to call it a hotel megacomplex.  The water park is just gigantic!  The largest outdoor pool in Europe (6400 m²) is located here.  He's just gorgeous.  In the very center of the water grows a bar.  Of course, there are much more adult slides here - 14, and only 3 for children, but there are enough of them so that the kids, riding on them, would be completely delighted.
