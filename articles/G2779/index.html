This is a convenient and relatively affordable way to travel around such a huge country.  However, trains are very different.  The Arktika train is one of those that stand out both in direction and in other interesting features. </p><div class="photo" data-original="economics.unian.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Trains in Russia" class="if uuid-2600639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2600639.jpg"></div><h2>  There are different trains </h2><p>  In total, there are three types of rolling stock.  Namely - branded, speed and speed trains.  The difference between them is significant.  The fact is that the concept of branded trains, such as the Arctic train, is based on several basic requirements.  Each company car must be new and comfortable.  It should also be clean and well equipped.  These cars often have wider shelves, air conditioning, clean bio or vacuum toilets, and additional services.  For example, very often on such trains they give out rations or food, which, unfortunately, is very mediocre and not worth the money.  It is these trains that are most preferred on long trips, such as from Moscow to Murmansk.  In this case, the journey takes about 35 hours, which is best spent with pleasure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  High-speed trains differ in capacity, an abundance of seated cars, affordable prices and, of course, travel time.  It is generally accepted that only Sapsans, Swallows and Allegro are such, but this is not entirely true.  Any non-branded train that can reach speeds of more than 140 km / h can be recognized as a high-speed train.  Ordinary trains with seated cars, making a minimum of stops and developing speeds of more than 140 km / h, are also considered to be high-speed. </p><p>  Fast trains are ordinary rolling stocks of various layouts.  They differ from ordinary ones in that they make stops only at large stations - due to which the travel time is reduced. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://www.europebyrail.eu/return-of-a-direct-overnight-train-from-paris-to-berlin/" data-original="www.europebyrail.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Named train Russian Railways" class="if uuid-2600634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2600634.jpg"></div><h2>  Non-branded branded train cars </h2><p>  Many Russian destinations are provided with trains not densely enough.  In this case, branded rolling stock, such as the Arktika train, are equipped with additional trailed wagons that are not branded.  That is why very often passengers do not see the difference between the cars.  The existing probability of buying a ticket at the price of a branded one, but into a trailed ordinary car, turns ticket purchases outside the end stations into a lottery.  Unfortunately, such cars are often not in the best technical condition and equipped much worse.  For example, they can have very few outlets, which creates great inconvenience on long trips. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Train "Arctic" </h2><p>  During the Soviet Union, there were many <span>branded trains</span> operating long-distance flights.  However, the country was changing, at one point it did not disappear at all.  Shocks affected the railways. </p><p>  This branded train runs in the direction Moscow - Murmansk since the days of the USSR and it was far from always that it had the status of branded.  With the collapse of the Soviet Union, this is not the best time for this train.  He lost his status until 2010.  With the newly acquired status, the composition has changed.  Old, far from the most comfortable cars were replaced with new ones and are still regularly updated. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://rusmania.com/transport/trains-between-moscow-and-st-petersburg" data-original="rusmania.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Train arctic" class="if uuid-2600632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2600632.jpg"></div><h2>  Wagons </h2><p>  Trains are unthinkable without wagons.  It is known that there are a huge number of wagons with different classes and types of service.  However, for many people, their classification by location is more common.  So, there are reserved seats, compartment, CB and luxury cars.  The Arktika branded train includes 7 reserved seats, 6 compartment wagons, 1 NE and 1 restaurant car.  All cars in this rolling stock are new.  Even in the reserved seat there are air conditioners, sockets and dry closets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rusmania.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Arctic Train Coupe" class="if uuid-2600633" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51393/2600633.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Before studying any reviews, you should understand that most of them are written under the influence of emotions, most often negative.  Satisfied with the quality of service, passengers take it all for granted and leave no feedback.  However, in this case, reviews about the Arctic train make us think about exceptions.  This is one of those trains about which there are a lot of positive opinions.  Passengers note cleanliness, modern wagons, convenient location of outlets, polite conductors, clean toilets and air conditioning.  This train is often preferred to other branded trains and, if possible, try to get tickets for it. </p><p>  Almost all negative reviews are associated with trailed cars, which can differ significantly from regular branded ones. </p>
