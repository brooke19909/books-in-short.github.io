    <h2>  Summary of Recovery Procedure </h2><p>  If your credit card is lost, stolen or damaged <em> </em>  full card recovery is expected.  Sberbank performs this procedure in accordance with the current regulations of the credit institution.  Based on the current banking rules, the term recovery refers to reissuing a lost or damaged card.  This happens when the card account is saved and the balance of funds is transferred to a new debit or credit card. </p>

    <h2>  What determines the action plan? </h2><p>  The further action plan directly depends on the reason for which a full restoration of the card was required (Sberbank is one of the largest Russian banks offering a similar service).  For example, you need to act quickly in cases where your card has been stolen or lost.  At the same time, your first step should be to block bank plastic.  And you can perform it in one of the following options: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  independently (using remote banking); </li><li>  for a personal visit or a phone call to the bank; </li><li>  by sending an SMS message with the word "Block" to the short number 900. </li></ul><p>  Let's see how the Sberbank card is restored in case of loss. </p>

    <h2>  How to recover a card after a loss: visit to the bank </h2><p>  So, when you are horrified to find a lost or stolen card, first of all, block it with any of the proposed methods.  But when your Sberbank card is already blocked, you can safely go to the bank branch, where it was received earlier.  To do this, you will need a passport and a statement indicating the reason for re-issuing the card.  At the same time, you can expect to receive a new bank plastic from 15 minutes (if you have an instant and non-personal card) and up to 10-14 days. </p><p>  If you were a holder of a name card, then you will be notified by telephone or SMS about the release of a new one. </p>

    <h2>  Money remained on the account: what to do? </h2><p>  Sometimes it happens that a certain amount remains on a lost or stolen card.  In this case, it is necessary, firstly, to urgently block the card, and secondly, to find out the account balance from the bank representative.  Thus, you can find out if the money was lost from the card or the attacker did not manage to use it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Next, you should write a new application with a request to issue the amount available in the account in cash.  After your identification and certain verification of data, you can receive the requested money through the cashier of a credit institution.  However, one should be patient, as often such a check can drag on for 5-10 days.  A little more time will take and the restoration of the card itself.  Sberbank will gladly make concessions to you, but only on condition that you are not trying to deceive the representative of the bank. </p>

    <h2>  Can I order a new card online? </h2><p>  When the old <span>Sberbank card is blocked</span> after theft or loss <span>,</span> you can always order a new one via the Internet.  To do this, log in to your “My Account” mobile or Internet banking and perform the following steps: </p><ul><li>  Choose “Maps” from the menu and go to a new page. </li><li>  Click on the card reissue tab. </li><li>  Fill out the form that appears (specify contact details, reason for contact, other information about yourself). </li><li>  Select the appropriate branch of the financial institution and confirm the action. </li></ul><p>  However, to clarify the details and, finally, get a new plastic, you still have to come to the bank.  Therefore, it will be appropriate to say that you can order a card online.  But to receive, you still need your personal presence. <em> </em>  In this case, the recovery time of the Sberbank card will take exactly the same number of days as the standard credit card reissue procedure (10-14). </p>

    <h2>  What to do when a card is blocked? </h2><p>  Sometimes the owner himself may become a cause of difficulties with the card.  For example, it is not uncommon for a user to lose or forget their PIN code.  And of course, all attempts to introduce a slightly more familiar combination lead to automatic freezing of the card.  In this situation, he does not need to re-issue or restore the Sberbank card after blocking.  To regain full control over the account, he only needs to call the hotline and answer the questions asked by the operator. </p><h2>  When a card is stuck or left at an ATM </h2><p>  There are also frequent cases when a payroll, credit or debit card is forgotten at an ATM.  It happens that she’s simply stuck or the ATM “chewed”.  In this case, you may not even have to block and reissue the card.  It is enough to contact the bank support service or a company engaged in servicing ATMs and terminals. </p><p>  As a rule, the contact phone number is indicated on the device itself.  There is also a special number assigned to the equipment.  Or you will be asked to give an address and a store or any other point of sale where the ATM is located.  The situation is even simpler if the banking equipment is located directly in a credit institution.  It will be enough here to call for help from representatives of the bank. </p><p>  If the card was forgotten by you at the ATM, it must be blocked first.  And after that you can return to the device, where bank plastic was previously left.  Then repeat the whole procedure with a call to the bank, find out the balance in the account and ask for an unlock.  After that, the card can be used.  If the card was not in the ATM, go to the bank and apply for a reissue of your credit card. </p><h2>  Card recovery (Sberbank): cost </h2><p>  Despite all the advantages of reissuing a card, the service has a significant minus: obtaining a new credit card is a paid procedure.  Its cost depends on the type of card.  On average, you will have to pay only 150 rubles to reissue a card. </p><h2>  When is it still necessary to reissue a card? </h2><p>  You need to order a new card also in the event that your contact or personal data has changed.  For example, last name and address of residence.  In this case, you can contact any branch of a financial organization.  However, if the card was received only recently (for example, if an error was made when writing the name or surname), then reissue is possible only in the department where it was originally issued. </p><h2>  Is it worth reissuing a card when changing a phone connected to banking? </h2><p>  When changing the number connected to mobile banking, it is not necessary to do this.  It is enough to write a statement about disconnecting the previous one and connecting a new phone number.  And then it remains only to change the number at the entrance to online banking. </p>
