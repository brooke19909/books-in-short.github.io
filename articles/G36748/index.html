    <p>  <span>The Carpathian Mountains</span> are nothing more than an eastern branch of the Alps.  These mountain ranges arose in the Tertiary period, which is marked by a powerful uplift of the earth's crust.  At present, the mountain system of the Carpathians, as well as the Alps, is in many ways different from its original appearance.  Multiple faults, erosion processes, local glaciations and volcanic activity have led to their current appearance.  This is mainly reflected in the state of the Carpathians, they have a rounded shape.  Only the relief of the Tatra Mountains, as well as part of the Transylvanian Alps, has an alpine character.  The Carpathian Mountains are a chain of amazing beauty, the slopes of the mountains to the very peaks are covered with green forests and colorful mountain meadows.  In the Carpathians, the animal and plant worlds are more diverse.  However, the Carpathian and Alpine flora and fauna have much in common. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Peaks and arc of the Carpathians </h2><p>  Most of the Carpathian peaks reach elevations from 1,500 to 2,000 meters.  The highest massif is the High Tatras, located on the border between Slovakia and Poland.  Their height reaches 2655 meters.  Hoverla Mountain is located on the territory of Ukraine, its height is 2061 m. The large Carpathian arc has a length of 1300 kilometers, it stretches through several states: Romania, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Poland, Slovakia.  It originates on the plains of the Danube, between Budapest and Vienna and stretches to Polish Krakow.  The eastern part of the arc crosses Western Ukraine and again merges with the Danube already between the Iron Gate and Belgrade. </p><h2>  Where is Goverla Mountain </h2>

    <p>  Hoverla is the highest point in Ukraine.  It rises above sea level by 2061 m. Mount Goverla is located on the border of two regions: Ivano-Frankivsk and Transcarpathian.  The border with Romania is approximately 17 kilometers away.  Hoverla belongs to the Carpathian ridge of Montenegro.  What does the name mean?  From the Hungarian word Hóvár - "snow mountain". </p><p>  As early as 1880, the first route for tourists with climbing to the top of the mountain was opened here.  Nearby are the cities of Vorokhta, Yasinya, Rakhiv.  At the foot of Goverla is the source <span>of the Prut River.</span>  Where water comes out of the rocks, the most beautiful waterfall of Ukraine is located, it is called the Prut.  This cascading waterfall reaches a height of 80 meters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The mountain opens from its peak an amazing panorama of the Ukrainian Carpathians.  The height of Goverla Mountain in good weather allows you to see the cities of Snyatin and Kolomyia, Ivano-Frankivsk, and from the south - the Romanian Sighetu-Marmatiei.  Also from the top you can well see Petros (2020 meters), located nearby.  From the southeast, a panorama opens to the peaks of the Montenegrin ridge, even an observatory located on Mount Pop Ivan Chernogorsky is visible.  From the south-west you can admire the peaks of the Marmorosh Range, it is on it that the border between Ukraine and Romania passes. </p><h2>  Description of Hoverla </h2>

    <p>  The shape of Hoverla is cone-shaped.  At the top there is a flagpole with the <span>Ukrainian flag,</span> here you can also see the coat of arms of Ukraine - a trident, as well as a cross, which marks the highest point of Goverla.  There is an obelisk right there, whose height is several meters, it marks the highest point of the border that once passed here between Czechoslovakia and Poland.  In addition to the flag, coat of arms, obelisk and cross, a marble slab is placed on top, it contains twenty-five capsules, they contain a piece of land from each region of Ukraine. </p><p>  The winter view of Hoverla is especially mesmerizing.  The mountain is a huge white pyramid, the top of which is crowned with a large icy cross.  There is a feeling of looking at the <span>other world,</span> Mount Hoverla as if from heaven examines our mortal, vain life.  The foot of the mountain is covered with coniferous, beech forests, rising higher, you can see the slopes with beautiful subalpine meadows.  More than forty-five species of various animals and plants, which are listed in the <span>Red Book of Ukraine,</span> live on Mount Goverle <span>.</span>  In the second half of summer (July-August) the slopes of the mountain are simply strewn with blueberries.  This significantly slows down the tourist climb to the top, because it is simply impossible to tear yourself away from juicy, tasty berries.  Currently, Goverla is part of the Carpathian National Park, and this is a protected conservation area.  For tourists, this object has become very popular. </p>

    <p>  Lovers of overcoming obstacles on long hikes choose a long three-day trip to the Carpathians.  The hike includes an overview of the mountainous surroundings, including Petros 2020 meters, as well as climbing to the top of Goverla. </p><h2>  What you need to know </h2><p>  Climbing Mount Hoverla begins in May and ends in November.  When going on a hike to the mountains, it must be borne in mind that weather conditions can change dramatically at altitude.  Although climbing is very popular, remember that if certain rules are not followed, climbing can be dangerous, sometimes even <span>accidents occur.</span>  Winter in the mountains is often a danger due to the convergence of snow avalanches. </p><p>  Do not imitate those tourists who go climbing in T-shirts, slippers, shorts.  Although the routes are well trodden, slippery, uncomfortable sections often come across.  Weather in the mountains can change dramatically.  Sometimes a clear sun disappears in a matter of seconds and a rain or chilly wind begins.  For hiking in the mountains, it is always recommended to take warm clothes, wear comfortable shoes, and in case of rain, have a raincoat.  If a thunderstorm suddenly catches you up when climbing, it is best to go down to the forest zone, on the tops of the ridge there is a high probability of being struck by lightning discharges.  Weather out, do not risk your own life. </p>

    <h2>  Hoverla Mountain - the most visited peak </h2><p>  The most popular route in the Ukrainian Carpathians is a trip to the Montenegrin ridge with climbing to the top of Goverla.  Every mountain hiker dreams of conquering this highest peak of Ukraine at least once in his life.  However, one must remember that in summer it is Mount Goverla that is very popular among tourists, it can easily be found on the map of Ukraine.  On the routes there are always several hundred tourists, most often these are one-day “mattresses”, they come on sightseeing buses.  Keep this in mind if you come to the Carpathians and want to visit wilder, deserted places.  In this case, the routes along the Gorgan are suitable, these are the less visited ranges of the Carpathians. </p>
