In this small European country they go not only to sunbathe on the beaches and swim in the sea.  Tourists rush here to learn the language, hang out in the best night clubs, explore the numerous castles and bays, take a walk in the cities that have not lost their medieval charm.  In this article we will try to describe what kind of accommodation can be found in this country, which is more suitable for relaxation and how to approach the choice of a hotel in Malta.  Let's start with general advice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="onsitemalta.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malta, Valletta" class="if uuid-2293958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2293958.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of Malta Hotels </h2><p>  This state is located on several islands.  Malta is the largest of them.  But there is also Comino and Gozo.  Of course, many tourists go to the largest island.  Although hotels are available on all three.  When choosing a hotel in Malta, you also need to decide what is more important for you - a vacation at sea or proximity to nightlife.  On this island you have to choose: there are no hotels that would satisfy both needs.  But this country is small in size.  So if you prefer a hotel on the beach, then you can go to a disco or a nightclub by public transport and spend no more than thirty minutes on the road.  For lovers of partying and nightlife, the St. Julian's area is suitable.  In season, he never sleeps at all.  Well, for those who came here to enjoy the scenery and relax in solitude, experts advise the island of Gozo. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  4 star hotels </h2><p>  Even some of the guesthouses are of a similar type on the islands.  The rooms are usually clean and comfortable.  Food can be at the level of "five", it all depends on the hotel.  Since water in Malta is greatly saved, towels will not be changed every day, but only if you throw them on the floor.  Of Malta's hotels of this class, the most popular are hotels in the north of the island.  These are Ramla and Mellieha Bay.  Good reviews about the Dolmen Resort hotel.  It is located in the resort of Aura, near the old pagan altar, between two picturesque parks.  The hotel consists of apartments with panoramic windows and huge balconies, suitable for romantic dinners.  The hotel has a lot of entertainment, including a casino and a night club. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best hotels of Malta" class="if uuid-2293825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2293825.jpg"></div><h2>  5 star hotels </h2><p>  On the islands of the state, hotel lines of international class are very widely represented.  The most comfortable and luxurious hotels in Malta are Hilton, Kempinski, Radisson and Intercontinental.  Here you will not only be offered a huge range of services, but also a very fast and professional service.  Since international seminars are often held at such hotels, they are equipped with huge conference rooms.  Almost all employees understand English.  These hotels have gyms and spas, as well as several pools.  Some of them are heated in the winter.  If you want to relax inexpensively in the suite, and even in the "five", come out of season.  Then housing prices and services fall sharply.  Most high-end hotels are located in the St. Julian's area.  The Excelsior Hotel in the capital of Valletta is also very good.  It is located in the city center, close to historical sites.  At the same time, all conditions for a beach holiday are created there, there is a private yacht marina, 3 gourmet restaurants and five bars, as well as infinity pools known throughout Malta. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.excelsior.com.mt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="spa treatments" class="if uuid-2293925" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39080/2293925.jpg"></div><h2>  Power and All Inclusive </h2><p>  Most local hotels only include breakfast.  In many, you can order morning and evening meals.  But you will be covered on the menu.  As a rule, many varieties of cheeses are served, as well as delicious salads.  The buffet in this country is a rarity, as is the all-inclusive system.  Malta hotels with their own beach and all inclusive have just a few.  Among them, one of the best is Mellieha Bay.  This "four" is known for having its own bay, with gorgeous views of the bay and the village.  Water sports are included.  Guests at the restaurant have breakfast and dinner, and dine during the hot season on the pool terrace.  During the day, the hotel runs animation, including children‚Äôs animation, and in the evenings there are various entertainment shows.  The tourists are fed buffet style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.excelsior.com.mt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="All Inclusive Malta Hotels" class="if uuid-2293817" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2293817.jpg"></div><p>  Not far from this hotel there is another hotel with the all inclusive concept - Sibank Resort and Spa.  There are several restaurants and bars, a pizzeria, and a diving school.  Not far from the hotel there is a nightly disco. </p><p>  The Five Corinthia Marina, located in St. George's Bay, has a spa and kids club, and the Four of Kavra Palace has a saltwater pool and coffee shop.  Most of the services are in the all inclusive system. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  In Malta, there is a rocky coast, and several places with a sandy entrance to the water.  In St. Julians and Sliema, the beaches look like stone slabs, where they descend the stairs to the sea.  Most of the four and five star complexes in this region of Malta are hotels with beaches.  Therefore, their guests there and bathe.  Although a public, municipal beach in St. Julian's is sandy.  Examples of such hotels with their own coast are Corinthia San George, Westin Dragonara (Five) and Cavalieri and Golden Tulip Vivaldi (Four). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malta Hotels with Private Beach" class="if uuid-2293837" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2293837.jpg"></div><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  If you come to the island with your family, then tourists are advised to pay attention to the country's northern resorts.  In Chirkey, Golden Bay or Mellieha are the best hotels in Malta.  With children, you will not have any problems if you stay here.  Sandy beaches, a gentle entry into the water, plenty of entertainment by the sea - it‚Äôs safe for the kids, you won‚Äôt worry, and they will miss.  The Mellieha Bay already described by us is extremely popular among Europeans - French and British - who come here to rest with their newborns.  After all, there is a private beach with sand and a shallow shallow entrance, which is a rarity for Malta.  For parents with older children, a hotel on Slim Plaza Regency is suitable.  Here you can combine a beach holiday with sightseeing and other attractions.  Near the hotel there is a park with numerous playgrounds.  Not far from it is a five-star hotel ‚ÄúLe Meridian‚Äù, where you will find even more comfortable conditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oyster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malta hotels with children" class="if uuid-2293821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2293821.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel rating of Malta </h2><p>  According to the reviews of tourists, ‚ÄúMellieha Bay‚Äù is recognized as the most popular hotel in the country.  The five best hotels in Malta also included the Hilton, Carlton, Westin Dragonara Resort and the Sunset Beach Resort Complex.  Some of them are large hotels, almost like mini-cities, with passages, shops and offices.  This is the Hilton.  Its restaurants can be envied by Paris and New York.  The panoramic windows overlook the ocean.  From Carleton, not far from both Sliema and St. Julian's.  He does not have his own beach, but guests can use the coast of the Exiles Beach Club hotel.  But Westin Dragon Resort has not only all the necessary range of services, but also its own piece of the sea.  Sansiker Holiday Complex is conveniently located in Bugibba.  This is a cozy hotel with beautiful design, responsive staff and everything you need for a comfortable stay and relaxation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malta hotel reviews" class="if uuid-2293960" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2293960.jpg"></div><h2>  Malta hotel reviews </h2><p>  The level of service in the local hotels, according to travelers, often depends not on the network or the star rating, but on the particular hotel.  Of course, the "five" in Malta allow guests to feel delightful.  But good hotels are also found among the "fours", and even budget "three rubles".  Tourists recall that in Maltese hotels three-way sockets of the English type.  The voltage in them is 230 volts.  To charge your phone, tablet or laptop, you will have to ask for an adapter at the reception.  Sometimes it is given on the security of a certain amount.  The all inclusive system in Malta, as well as in Turkey or Egypt, involves spirits exclusively of local production, and not foreign.  Although the Maltese wine is very good.  Almost all products are brought from Italy. </p>
