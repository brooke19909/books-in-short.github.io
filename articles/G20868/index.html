    <h2>  Definition </h2><p>  What is a transport tax (Samara region or any other - does not play a role)?  You should always know what we pay for.  Especially when you consider that many drivers recently are not happy with the huge bills for their vehicles. </p><p>  This tax is the annual registration fee for your vehicle equipped with an engine.  It is important.  Anyway, what region are we talking about - about Samara, Moscow or Kaliningrad.  The fact remains.  Transport tax is paid for registration of a car in the traffic police and for the possibility of driving on the roads of the country and around the world. </p><p>  The main feature of this payment is its regionality.  What does it mean?  The transport tax in the Samara region and in any other locality will differ from each other.  Its calculation, beneficiaries, as well as the terms and procedures for payment in each subject are established individually.  Therefore, we have to take this issue very seriously. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How much to pay </h2><p>  Transport tax 2013 (Samara region), like it, but in any other time period, has certain deadlines for payment.  In principle, it is customary for taxpayers to believe that they have the right to ‚Äúdelay‚Äù the moment of payment until the end of the tax reporting period.  To be more precise, then until April 30 of each year.  This is not true. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax rates" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1199361.jpg" width="510"></div>

    <p>  Indeed, in Samara, <span>the transport tax</span> must be paid, according to the rules, until December 1.  This applies to individuals.  But the so-called advance payment - until April 30.  Organizations, by contrast, have less time to pay.  They are allowed in Samara to pay the tax return until March 1.  Such rules are currently established.  No one knows for sure whether they will act next year.  After all, the tax system is constantly undergoing certain changes. </p><h2>  To pay? </h2><p>  Many drivers are interested in whether this tax is so important.  Do I have to pay it?  Or can you just wait a while until it is canceled?  Undoubtedly, if you are a person without plans for life who is going to walk in the next 2 years, not work and hide from the law, the answer is simple.  Yes, then you can not pay. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But in all other cases, so that there are no problems in the future, payment will need to be made without fail.  Transport tax (Samara region 2014 and for all other years) is important.  Yes, it is increasing from year to year.  But the car is expensive.  And you have to pay for its content.  Only in some cases can one legally evade such extortions.  Or hope for a discount.  Who in the Samara region belongs to these categories of citizens? </p><h2>  Exemption </h2><p>  The fact that the transport tax is regional in nature is both good and bad.  Each entity has its own payment rules.  They relate to everything from a banal rate to beneficiaries.  What can be said about the Samara region? </p><p>  The fact is that here, as in most cases, many are exempted from paying this payment.  Yes, there are fewer applicants, but they are still there.  Who exactly?  For example, people with disabilities and health problems.  Transport tax for disabled people is generally absent in all regions.  Such people do not pay it under any circumstances.  Even if they receive an appropriate receipt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax 2015" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1199366.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Veterans, <span>heroes of labor,</span> retired military personnel, as well as their families in the event of the death of a "hero" - all these citizens also have the right to full release.  Transport tax (2015-2016) is not paid by them.  It is not known what will happen next, but so far it is this rule that applies in the Samara region. </p><p>  Organizations that repair and create roads, as well as transport disabled people, are another exception to the rule.  Large families are also beneficiaries.  True, the car transport <span>tax</span> has its own characteristics in the Samara region.  Not in all cases the listed categories of citizens are completely exempted from contributions. </p><h2>  rules </h2><p>  What is necessary for the listed beneficiaries to have full exemption from such a payment as transport tax (2015 and beyond)?  Not so much really.  Firstly, you will have to declare your rights to the tax office.  As practice shows, you will still be sent payment notifications until you yourself report the benefits. </p><p>  Secondly, keep in mind that exemption is only possible with respect to a particular transport.  Although, as practice shows, most often the listed categories of citizens do not need to comply with them.  If you want everything to be according to the rules, then consider the following facts: </p><ul><li>  a car with a low-power engine gives a benefit (up to 100 horsepower); </li><li>  mopeds with low power (up to 40 "forces"); </li><li>  boats, boats, water transport allows beneficiaries not to pay (with an engine up to 30 "horse"); </li><li>  ‚Äúself-propelled‚Äù vehicles and tracked vehicles of up to 100 horsepower are not subject to contributions for beneficiaries. </li></ul><p>  If we talk about large families, then for them in Samara there are rules.  Exemption from payment of transport tax is possible only in 2 cases.  If they do not apply to you, you will have to pay.  Not the full amount, but only part of it.  However, you will not be fully exempted from payment.  So, large families have the right not to pay a fee for cars with a low-power engine (up to 100 horsepower inclusive) and for buses with an engine up to 150. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax for the disabled" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1199362.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Senior citizens </h2><p>  What you need to know more?  Transport tax in the Samara region for pensioners, for example.  It's no secret that this category of persons has always been beneficiaries.  True, you will have to take into account the rules indicated above in order to have a kind of discount from the state. </p><p>  It turns out that pensioners are citizens who cannot be fully exempted from paying transport tax in Samara and the region.  But they are given a discount.  In what sizes?  The transport tax for 2015-2016 provides a 50% discount for pensioners, subject to the general rules for all beneficiaries. </p><p>  By the way, this privilege applies only to one transport.  That is, one payment, if the elderly person has several cars in the property, will have to be fully covered.  And for another it is possible to receive a kind of discount.  It is very comfortable.  Pensioners are satisfied.  But remember, you must declare your rights to the tax office. </p><h2>  Settlement Rules </h2><p>  How much do you need to pay to citizens living in the territory of Samara and the region for their means of transportation?  This question is controversial and complex.  Why?  To get the exact amount you will have to find out a lot of information, as well as study the calculation formulas in a particular case.  Fortunately, this process is the same for all regions. </p><p>  To solve this question, tax rates are useful to us.  In each subject they are different.  And in Samara, as well as its region, as practice shows, the tax is lower than in Moscow.  The tax rate is a kind of "cost" of one horsepower for a particular vehicle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="transport tax Samara region 2014" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1199363.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Next, drivers must know the tax base.  Or, as it is also called, the amount of horsepower a vehicle has.  These data are written in TCP.  And they depend on each car model. </p><p>  The number of months of ownership is another point worthy of attention.  The formulas for calculating the transport tax vary depending on this indicator.  More precisely, this applies to cases when the car is owned less than a year.  In the end, for correct calculations of the amount that will have to be paid as a tax on transport, a raising factor may be useful.  It is relevant only for luxury cars with a value of more than 3 million rubles. </p><p>  How to correctly calculate the amount that you will have to give?  The standard formula is when tax rates are multiplied by the amount of horsepower in the engine.  If the car is owned for less than a year, then you have to multiply all this by the quotient from dividing the number of months of ownership by 12. </p><p>  Luxury cars also have certain features.  When a car is owned for a year or more, it‚Äôs enough to multiply the standard formula by an <span>increasing factor.</span>  And if less than this time, then our second option will come in handy.  It is also multiplied by a multiplier <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Bets </h2><p>  Well, as you see, everything is not as difficult as it seems.  But what is the transport tax rate (Samara region) in one case or another?  At the moment, certain coefficients are set.  They change from year to year, but so far have been preserved throughout 2015-2016.  Each category of transport has its own rates. </p><p>  Cars: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr align="center"><td>  Engine (horsepower) </td><td>  Rate (in rubles) </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  up to 100 </td><td>  16 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  101-120 </td><td>  24 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  121-150 </td><td>  33 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  151-200 </td><td>  43 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  up to 250 </td><td>  75 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  more than 250 </td><td>  150 </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  For motorcycles: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr align="center"><td>  Horsepower </td><td>  Tax rate (in rubles) </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  up to 20 </td><td>  7 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  21-35 </td><td>  14 </td></tr><tr align="center"><td>  from 36 </td><td>  33 </td></tr></tbody></table>

They are not so common, so citizens are usually not interested in them. </p><h2>  For luxury </h2><p>  Among other things, you need to know the increasing coefficients for transport.  They are a must for luxury cars.  And in the Samara region are established, based on several factors - the final price of the transport and the time of its release.  What is obtained in practice?  Not so often, people buy luxury cars.  Nevertheless, it is worth knowing the raising factors.  Everything is not so difficult to understand. </p><p>  If your car costs from 3 to 5 million, and the year of manufacture stops in the range from 2 to 3, then you will have to take into account a coefficient of 1.1.  When this period decreases to 1-2 years, 1.3 should be taken as a unit.  If the issue term is not more than 12 months, it will increase to 1.5. </p><p>  When the cost of the vehicle is from 5 to 10 million rubles, and no more than 5 years have passed from the moment of issue, the increase coefficient is 2. With a cost of up to 15,000,000 and a release earlier than 10 years (inclusive) - 3. But if the passenger car costs more than 15 million and was released earlier 20 years ago, then a similar figure - 3 will have to be taken into account as a raising coefficient. </p><p>  Paying attention is another interesting fact.  When choosing a coefficient, only the average cost of the car is taken into account.  And such rules apply only to passenger cars.  As you can see, the transport tax in the Samara region is quite simple to calculate. </p><h2>  Documents for benefits </h2><p>  So, what if you have benefits?  For example, it has already been said that in most cases there is no transport tax for people with disabilities.  But in order to receive privileges, you must declare them to the tax office.  What documents will be required for this?  There is nothing difficult or special.  Just take with you: </p><ul><li>  transport tax (payment receipt that does not need to be paid); </li><li>  passport; </li><li>  SNILS; </li><li>  pension certificate (if any); </li><li>  certificates confirming benefits; </li><li>  Title </li><li>  certificate of ownership of transport; </li><li>  application (of the established form, you can fill in the tax). </li></ul>

    <h2>  In case of payment </h2><p>  What if you already paid a transport tax, but should not have done it?  You can issue a refund for the last 3 years.  And nothing more.  To accomplish this, you will also have to attach receipts for paying taxes to the entire list above. </p><p>  Of course, the details of bank accounts or cards are also necessary.  You will have to transfer a return here.  Be aware of your rights in each region.  Then you won‚Äôt have to worry about refunds, unpaid taxes and payments.  By the way, the rules for applying to the relevant authorities are the same for all subjects of the Russian Federation, and not only in the Samara region, they have legal force. </p>
