Nevertheless, the city has already become famous around the world.  Unlike Side, Belek itself has no historical attractions.  However, this is not so important, since lovers of antiquity should only want to, and they can easily go on an excursion to Antalya or Side.  Belek itself is located between these two cities.  In addition, he is known for popularizing golf. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="papillon zeugma relaxury 5 reviews" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1465976.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The city is located in the land of cedar, eucalyptus and pine forests, striking in its beauty.  Rare birds are found in them, one of which even became a symbol of Belek.  This is a tito alba owl.  Belek is the most presentable, and therefore expensive resort, because there are few young people.  The region itself has wide and beautiful beaches stretching for twenty kilometers.  And the swimming season lasts from May to October.  It is thanks to the even, clean, with a gentle entrance to the water Belek has become so popular.  Its coast is well equipped and leads among other resorts in Turkey in terms of the number of blue flags.  The blue sea and white sand complement the most beautiful forests, approaching almost to the coast. </p><p>  Almost all hotel complexes in Belek have a category of 4-5 stars and are located on the first line along the entire coast.  As a rule, these are quite prestigious good hotels with a high level of service.  Here are the hotels of the Papillon chain, including our Papillon Zeugma Relaxury 5 *.  The rating of these hotels is quite high among the best resort complexes. </p><h2>  Attractions Belek </h2><p>  Resting in Papillon Zeugma Relaxury 5 * (Belek), you should definitely visit the famous Belek to see all its attractions.  Not far from the city are the ancient ruins of Side, Aspendos and Perge.  There is also a eucalyptus-cypress national park-reserve called "Kaprylu Canyon", an area of ‚Äã‚Äãfive hundred hectares.  In it you can go horse riding, mountain climbing and many different water sports, among which the most popular rafting.  In the park you can see huge carriage-caretta turtles that go ashore to lay eggs in the sand.  Several hundred plant varieties grow in the reserve, including pistachios, cypresses, eucalyptus trees. </p><p>  In Belek, on the territory of the Rixos complex, there is a beautiful Troy water park, which is decorated in the style of the ancient city.  Its main attraction and pride is a large horse, built in full size.  The park has a lot of water activities, including an unusual slide, which raises people upstairs.  At many high-speed attractions children are not allowed.  In addition, the water park has its own dolphinarium.  Shopping enthusiasts can visit the local bazaar. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="papillon zeugma relaxury 5 services" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1465977.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In Perga, tourists should see the ancient theater, which is part of the architectural and historical complex.  It was built by the Romans on the site of the same Hellenic building.  This theater is better preserved than all similar buildings in all of Asia Minor.  It has the most beautiful bas-reliefs that have survived to this day.  Many of the most beautiful fragments have long been stored in museums in the country. </p><p>  Among tourists, a shopping complex in Kadriye called YKM Sport is very popular.  It was opened in 2012.  In it you can find entertainment for every taste, as well as go shopping.  The atmosphere here is always calm and there are no crowds, as in local markets, and therefore it is very convenient and convenient to make purchases.  The modern four-story building offers its guests to visit many shops with fashionable clothes, perfumes, accessories of famous world brands.  It hosts cultural and recreational activities, and tourists can visit the cozy cafes and restaurants. </p><h2>  Papillon Zeugma Relaxury 5 *: tourist reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I would definitely like to turn to reviews, which can be used to judge the real situation in Papillon Zeugma Relaxury 5 *.  Reviews of tourists about the complex are contradictory at some points, so let's talk about this in more detail. </p><p>  What attracts many tourists with Papillon Zeugma Relaxury 5 *?  The description of the complex speaks of its excellent location, a very high level of service, which is very important for demanding customers.  The hotel positions itself as a place for a comfortable holiday for families with children.  In principle, this is indeed so.  This point should be taken into account by those vacationers who consider this hotel as a vacation destination.  There is no better place to stay with children than Papillon Zeugma Relaxury 5 *.  The deluxe hotel is really great for families.  But for young people who want to attend night discos or are looking for new acquaintances, it will be boring here, since only married people live in the complex, you simply cannot find lonely tourists here.  Evening entertainment is organized daily: dance and acrobatic groups arrive.  The Turkish Night festival is very interesting for tourists.  But noisy parties all night, of course, are not talking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="papillon zeugma relaxury 5 hotel description" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1465978.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Inside the hotel has a beautiful interior, welcoming guests with a chic lobby.  The reception staff speaks Russian.  More precisely, one employee knows Russian well.  All other representatives of the service staff own several on-duty phrases.  It‚Äôs not easy to explain with them. </p><p>  Settlement is almost always fast and without hitches.  The staff is very polite and smiling.  The maids clean the rooms daily and efficiently.  Bathrobes and towels are changed every day.  After cleaning, an inspection service looks into the apartment, if something does not suit you, then you can immediately say so, so that the maids will be in the know.  Anything can happen, some guests of the complex are unhappy with the cleaning of the apartments, even if you leave a tip to the staff.  In this case, it remains only to complain about the reception. </p><p>  Belek is a young resort, but, on the other hand, the best hotels on the coast are far from new buildings, many of them have been restored more than once.  Although in general, the administration of any complex is interested in maintaining the image of the institution.  This also applies to Papillon Zeugma Relaxury 5 *.  Reviews of tourists confirm the rather good condition of the rooms.  The hotel was last renovated in 2010.  According to vacationers, in some places the apartments need to be freshened up.  But overall they are in good condition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="papillon zeugma relaxury 5 description" class="if" height="385" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1465979.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The rooms have a minibar, the range of which is replenished daily.  The hotel has a unified air conditioning system, for which there are many complaints from guests in 2016.  For unknown reasons, there is no desired level of cooling either in the rooms or in the main restaurant, which is extremely inconvenient in a hot climate.  Regular customers of this institution note that they have never noticed anything like this before in this complex. </p><h2>  Food quality: reviews </h2><p>  What are the nutritional reviews for Papillon Zeugma Relaxury 5 * <span>(Belek)?</span>  <span>Belek</span> is not a cheap resort at all, only five- and four-star complexes are located here.  And therefore, nutrition should correspond to a high level.  According to tourists, the food system in the hotel is set up properly.  The main restaurant serves delicious and varied dishes.  There is always a lot of meat: poultry, lamb, beef.  They cook meat very skillfully.  Grilled fish is present every day.  A fish day is arranged twice a week, then on the tables you can find an unprecedented variety of seafood.  In past seasons, red and black caviar were even served at such a time.  However, the past assortment, unfortunately, is not observed in 2016, which is associated with the Turkish crisis.  A similar situation this year is available in all hotels in Turkey. </p><p>  The restaurant has a large selection of pastries and all kinds of desserts.  All of them are incredibly tasty, which affects the presence of extra pounds after a vacation.  The waiters service is good, but many of them do not understand Russian well.  In the evenings, guests can enjoy live music and theme programs at the restaurant.  There are always a lot of different salads and snacks on the tables.  There are also enough fruits, their variety sometimes changes.  In general, the food in the hotel is now very good and of high quality. </p><p>  In addition to the main restaurant, the complex has a la carte establishments, which can be visited if desired.  All offer a variety of delicious dishes. </p><p>  As for alcohol, the hotel had previously offered branded imported drinks, as well as drinks of local production.  Everyone knows that Turkish alcohol is not of the best quality, and therefore it is not popular among tourists.  Currently, the assortment is less diverse, but branded imported drinks are still present. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="papillon zeugma relaxury 5 tourist reviews" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1465984.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  During the day, you can eat well at local bars if someone is hungry (pizza, burgers, donners).  Ice cream is distributed from two in the afternoon until six in the evening.  As for plain bottled water, it can be found anywhere in the hotel: both on the beach and around the pool. </p><h2>  Beach Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel has its own beach, which is its indisputable advantage.  On the coast there are free sunbeds with mattresses and umbrellas.  In the afternoon, animators work with vacationers on the beach, inviting to their programs.  Every day they clean the coast, but, unfortunately, tourists themselves throw a lot of cigarette butts.  Sunset at sea is gentle and comfortable, which is famous for the entire coast of Belek.  The sea is warm and clean with rich underwater flora and fauna.  Here it‚Äôs interesting to just snorkel.  On the coast, guests will find a huge variety of various water attractions.  According to tourists, the beach of the complex is not very large, and therefore sometimes a decent concentration of vacationers is observed on it. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel has a not very large, but well-groomed area, which is nice to walk with the children.  A special delight among tourists is a kids club.  Animators work very well and fruitfully with young guests.  Kids just don't want to leave there.  And that speaks for itself.  Adult animation also works pretty well.  In the evenings, guests are entertained with show programs, inviting artists and acrobats.  For children, there are also discos. </p><p> Of particular interest to tourists of all ages are water activities, there are pools and children's slides.  According to vacationers, the hotel staff treats children very well, which makes parents very happy.  It is felt that the complex seeks to attract the attention of just married couples.  Children's animation is what is worth a visit to Papillon Zeugma Relaxury 5 *.  The services provided by the staff in terms of children's entertainment are provided at a decent level.  All the kids are very satisfied, and with them their parents.  Agree that it is very important to take the child, providing him good leisure.  No one will like the lack of children's entertainment, since they will have to occupy their child on their own.  And so a group of animators is skillfully engaged in this, providing free time for parents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="papillon zeugma relaxury 5 pics" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1465985.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Special attention deserves excursions to the sights of Belek.  Experienced tourists are still advised to carve out a few days and devote to their trips.  This will give a lot of unforgettable impressions and will allow you to see a lot of new and interesting.  Belek himself is worthy of close attention from the guests.  Even just sitting in a cafe on its quiet streets and trying freshly prepared fish from a mountain river, this is already an interesting lesson.  Walking the streets of the city, tourists understand that it is beautiful and no less interesting than the famous Antalya and Istanbul. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation about Papillon Zeugma Relaxury 5 *, I would like to note that this hotel can be recommended for a good family vacation with children.  It has everything you need for a quality and carefree vacation: sea, beach, good infrastructure, silence and distance from noisy places. </p>
