    <h2>  Bars and Restaurants </h2><p>  You can safely say that staying at this hotel, you won‚Äôt have to worry about food.  There are three restaurants, the ability to deliver drinks and breakfast to your room, and even diet menus.  The only thing - the last of the listed services is provided upon individual request.  By the way, one of the restaurants works according to the "buffet" system, and the other - according to the menu.  Another institution is a-la carte.  If the declared tourist group has stayed at the hotel, the administration of the complex offers dinners, lunches, coffee breaks, cocktails, and banquets upon request.  The best chefs of the city prepare dishes of European and Russian cuisine for guests, always serving only fresh delicacies.  By the way, <span>the a-la carte restaurant</span> has its own zest: it, like the whole hotel, is made in a special national Russian style.  In general, this is a thematic atmospheric institution. </p>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  Potential guests, before booking a room in a particular hotel, also look at what services this option can offer them.  Thus, the administration of the Bogatyr complex (Sochi) provides its guests with car rental, an accelerated check-in and check-out procedure, and even services for pre-selling tickets.  More guests can be met at the airport or escorted to any place.  There is also a tour desk, the services of which are definitely needed for those people who like to see the sights.  There is even an ATM on the territory.  Thus, the Bogatyr Group (Sochi) is really rich in terms of services.  Guests can take advantage of dry cleaning, luggage storage, laundry facilities and even a trouser press.  And, of course, one cannot ignore the fact that the hotel has its own beauty salon, business center and banquet hall. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Additional offers </h2><p>  Another hotel complex ‚ÄúBogatyr‚Äù (Sochi) can provide its guests with something that often cannot be seen in the list of services of other hotels.  For example, rooms for people who cannot tolerate tobacco smoke, or for those who have limited physical abilities.  That is special conditions.  If guests want, they will be provided with a safe.  And if they have a desire to buy something, then this will not take much effort, since there are several shops in the complex where you can buy anything from food to souvenirs.  In general, I must say, few hotels are so good in terms of service.  The level of service is truly commendable.  Perhaps for this reason, tourists from different cities and countries stop here. </p>

    <h2>  Reservation and Accommodation Features </h2><p>  Perhaps the only thing that the Bogatyr Hotel (Sochi) prohibits is the placement of pets in rooms, as well as <span>smoking in public places.</span>  Otherwise, the conditions are very favorable.  So, for example, if guests come with a child who is not yet three years old, he can live for free.  If his age is 4-5 years, then you will have to pay 600 rubles per night.  At the age of 6 to 11, this amount increases by 500 rubles, that is, the total is 1100 rubles.  It should be noted that the arrivals are registered from 15:00 until midnight, which gives absolute independence from the time of arrival or arrival in Sochi.  By the way, departure is allowed until noon.  In general, the hotel administration has created all the conditions for a comfortable stay, relaxation and settlement, so that its guests are satisfied. </p>

    <h2>  Number of rooms and living conditions </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the number of large hotels is quite impressive in the city of Sochi.  The Bogatyr complex is also far from miniature - in its number of rooms there are 278 apartments.  By the way, they almost never empty.  Due to the great popularity of the hotel for a short period of time has become one of the most visited and sought after throughout the Krasnodar Territory.  The hotel offers three categories of rooms: "suite", "superior" and "standard".  The conditions, it must be said, are beyond praise.  Comfortable new beds (some apartments even have children's, bunk beds), a sofa, armchairs, a minibar, climate control system, satellite TV, and a safe.  The modern bathroom is equipped with everything necessary for personal care: a hairdryer, new sanitary ware and elite shower cosmetics.  There is also a telephone connection and a button calling the staff.  There is even a set for making coffee or tea.  And, of course, free wireless internet access. </p><h2>  Accommodation cost </h2><p>  Of course, one cannot fail to mention how much the room in such a luxury hotel will cost.  Take, for example, the duration of the reservation for a week.  If you take a standard room with all the amenities and special conditions (bath, soundproofing and plasma TV), then for two it will cost 23 thousand rubles.  These same apartments for one will cost 21 thousand rubles.  So it‚Äôs profitable to come with someone, then rest will cost quite cheaply.  In an improved room, accommodation for two will cost 30 thousand rubles.  Well, in the "Junior Suite" - 37,000 rubles.  You can see that the prices are really small, taking into account what conditions the hotel offers for the money.  But the cost, I must say, varies depending on what season it is planned to book a room.  So, for example, the most expensive apartments are during the New Year holidays, that is, from the last day of December until January 8 of the next year. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews and impressions </h2><p>  The Bogatyr Hotel (Sochi), whose park receives a lot of reviews every day, is also worthy to touch on the comments made by grateful guests.  Satisfied guests overwhelmingly note only the good.  Many people like understanding polite staff, patient workers, cleanliness and comfort in the rooms, stylish interior decoration, breakfasts - just beyond praise.  Even the most spoiled service tourists definitely remain satisfied and leave the hotel "Bogatyr" with positive impressions.  <span>Hotel Sochi,</span> whose <span>park</span> serves as a profitable ‚Äúbait‚Äù for guests, is not inferior to other complexes of the highest class.  And some tourists who stayed here, comparing it with other hotels, even argue that ‚ÄúBogatyr‚Äù is not ‚Äúfour stars‚Äù, but a full-fledged ‚Äúfive‚Äù.  In general, guests are satisfied with everything.  Especially the sea, of course, and the sights.  The beach here is within easy reach, and modern architecture is simply amazing.  If you want to go to Sochi, then you should not put off your vacation until later.  This city is beautiful, especially now, after the Olympics, and there is something to see. </p>
