M. Gorky - the building is an adornment of this place and a city attraction.  City festivities are held at Theater Square - Rostovites and city guests love this place. </p><p>  The architectural ensemble of the square includes: the Stela memorial complex, the building of the Railway Administration, the M. Gorky Drama Theater, a group of fountains and a Ferris wheel. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  At the end of the XIX century there was a wasteland on the site of the square. </p><p>  The first building, the Railway Directorate, was built here in 1913.  The architecture is made in the Art Nouveau style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Railway Administration in Rostov-on-Don" class="if uuid-2755973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96890/2755973.jpg"></div><p>  The place in front of the building was named - Revolution Square.  The park that has survived to this day near the square is still called the "Park of the Revolution." </p><h2>  <span>Drama Theater</span> .  M. Gorky </h2><p>  The history of the creation of the object is as follows: at first, a competition for the best work of architects was announced. </p><p>  The first place was taken by the work of Moscow architects: V. A. Schuko and V. G. Gelfreikh.  Built in 1930-1935.  The building is included in the list of architectural masterpieces. </p><p>  In Russia, only two buildings were honored to be marked at the World Exhibition in London: St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow and the building of the Drama Theater.  M. Gorky in Rostov-on-Don.  Rostovites are rightly proud that in their city on Theater Square stands a masterpiece of architecture of the 20th century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How did he earn such appreciation? </p><p>  The exterior of the building is striking in its dynamism and monumentality.  In its outlines, a moving tractor is guessed: the side structures resemble caterpillars, and movement dynamics is felt in the entire composition of the building - this is achieved due to frontal semicircular viaducts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Drama Theater. M. Gorky in Rostov-on-Don" class="if uuid-2756047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96890/2756047.jpg"></div><p>  This is the indisputable success of the architect - he managed to create a masterpiece of constructivism in combination with the impeccable functionality of the building. </p><p>  The building suffered great damage during the battles for the liberation of the city.  For a long time restoration work was going on, requiring large funds. </p><p>  The building of the theater determined the further appearance of the Theater Square of Rostov-on-Don. </p><h2>  Group of fountains </h2><p>  A complex of fountains was erected next to the theater in Revolution Park in 1936.  The author is a graduate of the art school in Rostov-on-Don E. Vuchetich. </p><p>  The fountain looks beautiful and monumental: in the center of the square pool on the pedestal there is a group of Atlantes supporting a spherical bowl;  vertical jets of water beat out of it.  On the sides are various amphibians, spurting jets of water towards the perimeter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fountain on Theater Square in Rostov-on-Don" class="if uuid-2755953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96890/2755953.jpg"></div><h2>  Ferris wheel </h2><p>  Not far from the fountains in the park of the October Revolution there is another structure that stands out for its size - this is a Ferris wheel.  Its height is 65 meters - this is one of the highest attractions in Russia of this type. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Ferris wheel works year-round due to the fact that closed cabins are equipped with air conditioners, operating both in cooling and heating mode.  Fountains, a park, a Ferris wheel - all these are favorite vacation spots of citizens on the Theater Square of Rostov-on-Don. </p><h2>  Memorial Complex </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a memorial dedicated to the feat of the liberating soldiers was born back in 1943 at a meeting of city residents immediately after the end of the battles to liberate the city.  In 1953, a competition for the best project of the memorial was announced among the city‚Äôs architects.  The first place was taken by the work of R. Sheker (sculptor) and N. Sokolov (architect). </p><p>  The composition of the authors was a stele, which was crowned by a red star with a frame in the form of a laurel wreath.  Behind the stele was a colonnade. </p><p>  But the project was not implemented due to lack of money.  A few years later a competition was announced at the union level - and again the first place was won by the Rostovites.  And again, there was no money for the project. </p><p>  The monument to the soldiers-liberators was opened on May 8, 1983 - it is a stella on the Theater Square of Rostov-on-Don.  The height of the stele is 72 meters.  Upstairs she is crowned by the gilded goddess of victory Nick, facing the Don River. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wikimapia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Memorial to the soldiers-liberators in Rostov-on-Don" class="if uuid-2755956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96890/2755956.jpg"></div><p>  Theater Square Rostov-on-Don - a decoration of the city.  The most significant celebrations and holidays, both local and federal, are held here. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="47.227578" data-lng="39.74604369999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/9/9/5/7995.png"></div><p>  Address: Rostov-on-Don, Theater Square, 1. </p>
