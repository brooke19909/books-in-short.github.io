But even before the start of the main stages of the construction of the facility, it is necessary to carry out a number of measures, which are also included in the general list of construction tasks.  As part of the overall project, this will be a zero cycle, which combines elements of organizational and technical work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mit24h.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zero cycle in construction with foundation" class="if uuid-2970446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2970446.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparation for the organization of construction </h2><p>  By the time the site is under construction for construction, all legal and technical documents with a design solution should be prepared.  Only after this can we begin to determine the responsibilities of the contractor of work activities.  As a rule, the contract with the customer defines the organizational and technological requirements for the implementation of the project, which prescribe not only the list, but also the sequence of specific operations.  In addition, the implementation of the zero cycle should be clearly planned in time, for which a schedule is compiled.  It is necessary first of all to take into account seasonal climatic features, since the nature of the implementation of land work within this cycle will largely depend on precipitation and temperature.  Acceptable for use tools, methods and materials may also be prescribed during the initial construction phase. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Preparation of the site for work </h2><div class="photo" data-original="jamesbuilt.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Site preparation for construction" class="if uuid-2970426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2970426.jpg"></div><p>  Prior to construction, a layer of fertile land with all vegetation must be removed.  As a rule, a layer of 10-15 cm thick is removed. However, it is not worth taking out or throwing out humus, since it may be required in future engineering and landscape works when arranging a personal plot near the house.  It is necessary to remove this layer not only within the immediate area under construction, but also in technological zones where materials, equipment and machinery will be placed. </p><p>  If trees grow on the territory, they must be cut down and uprooted.  It is important to keep in mind that the remaining root system can harm the foundation.  But this only applies if trees or green spaces are located directly on the site or near the building.  According to the regulations, such vegetation may well be located at a distance of 3 m from the house.  Shrubs can be left in 1 m, but if they do not become a serious obstacle to the construction process.  Another thing is that closely spaced plantations themselves need protection for this period - this should also be taken care of by arranging special fences with insulation materials. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Organization of work of the zero cycle at the construction site </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gcahomebuilding.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Site preparation in the zero construction cycle" class="if uuid-2970425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2970425.jpg"></div><p>  On the vacated plot in preparation for the construction and surveying is carried out.  In contrast to geodetic land surveying, in this case, the territory is planned in terms of the technological organization of work in different zones.  The construction site, storage facilities for building materials, parking of vehicles, access roads, etc. are determined.  For the correct zoning of the site, the composition of the zero-cycle work, which is usually formed from land activities, the construction of the foundation and the creation of the main engineering and communication units, should be initially determined.  By the way, access to certain energy resources should be provided at the stage of preparation for work.  A power source and water supply channel may be required.  In extreme cases, the installation of autonomous generators and delivery schemes for water tanks should be organized. </p><h2>  Earthwork </h2><p>  The implementation of this part will depend on what type of foundation is planned to be used for the target.  This decision is determined by the characteristics of the soil and geological conditions, not to mention the parameters of the building itself.  For example, during large-scale development, a foundation pit is arranged.  Usually this is done with the help of special equipment - excavators and bulldozers, the characteristics of which are also determined by the depth of the pit and the working conditions at a particular site.  If small constructions are planned without significantly deepening the foundation, then the production of the zero cycle will be limited to the creation of trenches along the outlined contours of the walls.  When digging a trench, it should be borne in mind that the edges will have to have a slight free indent.  On average, a strip of 50 cm is calculated - it will be needed as a technological safety section that prevents the collapse of dug land.  At the final stage, waterproofing measures are carried out.  At the bottom of the trench or pit, a sand-gravel cushion is formed in the form of a backfill, after which a layer of geotextile is laid. </p><h2>  Drainage system </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.harvestowneirrigation.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zero-cycle drainage" class="if uuid-2970434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2970434.jpg"></div><p>  The basic level of engineering in the general household.  This part is included in the list of organizational and preparatory measures for the reason that drainage will be required already at the stage of foundation construction.  The drainage system is an extensive network for collecting and discharging water outside the work site.  In the future, it will be improved technically, but at this stage it is necessary, at a minimum, to form channels through which storm drains will naturally go into the ground.  At the zero cycle stage, this problem is solved by trenches 30-40 cm deep with the point placement of drainage pits with the same waterproofing.  In the future, after the construction of the house, pipes are laid in these channels, and septic tanks can be used instead of soil drains. </p><h2>  Foundation work </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.waconstruction.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Building the foundation of a house" class="if uuid-2970431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2970431.jpg"></div><p>  If not the only one, then one of the few structural parts of the building that is carried out as part of this cycle.  On the basis of the prepared foundation pit or trenches, the shuttering structure is made of boards.  It will act as a form for pouring concrete, which will form the supporting foundation of the foundation.  The zero cycle provides for the implementation of the reinforcing cage to strengthen this design, as well as the subsequent waterproofing of the already passed stage of polymerization (solidification) of the concrete platform.  In the case of the use of fixed formwork, the task of installing the foundation is facilitated, since additional reinforcement of the structure by reinforcement is not required, insulation on the walls to the level of the grillage is excluded and there is no need to dismantle the form itself for the mortar. </p><div class="photo" data-original="buildersontario.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Foundation of the zero-cycle foundation" class="if uuid-2970438" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33143/2970438.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The quality, speed and efficiency of construction and installation activities is to a large extent determined by how the work was organized at the very first stages of the project.  The way in which the zero cycle was carried out with the erection of the foundation, can affect the sequence of further work.  This is especially true for the construction of floor ceilings on grillage.  If the foundation was completed comprehensively and does not need to be finalized, then with a greater likelihood the developer will be able to count on saving resources when installing supporting frame elements. </p>
