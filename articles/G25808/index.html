A local massage parlor is also available.  Experienced travelers recommend that all vacationers in Turkey do not spend all their time at the hotel, but be sure to take excursions, because this country is rich in interesting sights.  Moreover, our compatriots advise not to buy tours from a guide in a hotel, but in one of the bureaus in the city.  According to them, the quality of the trip will be the same, but the price will be much lower. </p><p>  As for the youngest guests, then at Grand Yazici Marmaris Palace they took care of their leisure.  So, in the daytime, children can attend the mini club.

According to tourists, most of the hotel staff are professional, friendly and always happy to help.  So, for example, maids do their job well, and this is not affected by the fact you leave a tip or not.  According to our compatriots, they are not too lazy to wet-clean their rooms every day, unlike many other hotels. </p><p>  The tourists were satisfied with the work of the waiters.  Of course, sometimes they do not have time to immediately clean the dirty tables, but this is due to the large influx of visitors. </p><p>  Our compatriots considered the fact that many hotel employees speak, or at least understand, Russian as a big plus.  So you will not have any communication problems here. </p>
