    <p>  Appearance HTC Desire 320 carries a distinct mark of the manufacturer.  The device in terms of design took a lot from its predecessor.  However, it will not be difficult to recognize a smartphone among competitors, in fact, recognition is the main trump card of the company. </p><p>  Like the model 310, the phone has got small dimensions, a similar style and even similar problems.  The front side is a fingerprint collector.  Although <span>an oleophobic coating is</span> present in the device <span>,</span> apparently, its quality fails. </p><p>  In principle, this is the disadvantage of all cheap devices.  Although in HTC Desire 320 it is expressed very clearly.  In just a few minutes, the display of the device is covered with a layer of prints. </p><p>  The roundness and arrangement of parts on the case allow you to identify HTC emblems in the media device.  The front panel houses a screen, sensors, a speaker, sensor elements, a logo and a front camera.  On the side of the right is the volume control and the power button.  The back side sheltered the main camera, flash, speaker and, of course, the logo.  The headset jack is located on the top, and the USB jack is on the bottom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You don‚Äôt have to wait for special frills, although the smartphone is made of plastic, the quality is quite acceptable.  Also, there is no doubt in the assembly of the device.  Very rarely, squeaks or gaps can be found in company products. </p><p>  Although the phone is compact and made of plastic, the weight is very impressive, as much as 145 grams.  This is another company problem.  The manufacturer‚Äôs devices are always weighty, and with prolonged use the hand gets tired.  The only good news is that the smartphone is in the palm of your hand like a glove. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  Equipped smartphone HTC Desire 320 with a 4.5-inch screen.  A very good size, but the display has its drawbacks.  This novelty has installed a long-outdated TFT-matrix.  Such a decision is excusable for second-tier companies, but certainly not for one of the production leaders. </p><p>  The matrix used affects many characteristics.  For example, the HTC Desire 320 does not have good viewing angles.  Even with a slight tilt, the picture is distorted.  Affects the matrix and image quality.  The device does not produce the proper brightness and saturation. </p><p>  It should be noted and the behavior of the screen of the device in the sun.  The brightness is not enough for acceptable work in high light conditions, and the picture fades. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The user will encounter with a terrible resolution.  They installed only 854 by 480 pixels in the device, which is 218 ppi.  Without even looking at the image, you can see the graininess.  This feature definitely does not improve the impression of the smartphone. </p><p>  Complement the overall picture and the lack of protection of the display.  The screen is very susceptible to scratches, and the oleophobic coating leaves much to be desired. </p><p>  It is very strange to see such a screen even on a state employee of such a famous company.  It would be possible to justify the manufacturer at a low price, but this is not so.  Perhaps this is a miscalculation or an attempt to save, but the Desire 320 got a definitely bad display. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  Available in HTC Desire 320 characteristics of the pictures also will not please users.  The camera of the device was equipped with only five megapixels.  The standard turned out to be 2592 by 1944 pixels. </p><p>  Actually, the owner, even under ideal conditions, will receive a medium-quality image.  In other situations, noise and some graininess will be present in the photograph. </p><p>  There is also a possibility of video recording in HTC Desire 320.  The clips are shot in HD quality with a resolution of 1920 by 1080. There is also nothing to boast of here.  Recorded videos look quite normal on the screen of the device, but on a larger diagonal they look unpresentable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is also a front camera in the smartphone.  The role of the front camera is performed by the 0.3 megapixel eye.  The user does not have to take self-portraits, but the front camera is quite suitable for video calls. </p><p>  Against the background of 2015 devices, the camera is not able to surprise.  Such characteristics are likely to confuse the user.  Almost all competitors have long switched exclusively to eight-megapixel cameras. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  Somewhat improve the impression of the HTC Desire 320 its "filling".  The manufacturer has equipped its brainchild with the MTK processor model 6582M.  A very good choice, allowing the state employee to get high performance.  In addition, the processor has four cores, each of which operates at a frequency of 1.3 GHz. </p><p>  As in most cheap devices, the Maili-400 video accelerator is installed here.  Of course, the choice is not the best, but it fits perfectly into the overall picture. </p><p>  The more unpleasant feature of the Desire 320 is the RAM.  The device provided 512 megabytes of memory.  For a budget device, this characteristic is minimal.  Considering that the system consumes 200 Mb in standby mode, the owner remains to work with crumbs. </p><p>  Summed up and the native memory of the smartphone.  Only four gigabytes, of which only 1.5 GB is available to the user.  Most of it is Android.  Fortunately, there is an opportunity to increase the amount of memory due to a flash drive up to 32 gigabytes. </p><h2>  System </h2>

    <p>  The device works on the Android platform with version 4.4.  Unfortunately, for a smartphone in 2015, the system is not the most successful.  It is already definitely outdated and simply will not work for most new programs. </p><p>  However, "Android 4.4" looks quite acceptable on state employees like Desire 320. "Stuffing" will allow the device to cope with almost all the games and applications available for this version. </p><p>  On top of the system is the manufacturer‚Äôs shell.  Together with the device, the user will get a proprietary interface and many installed applications.  The owner will not be able to get rid of unnecessary programs without root rights. </p><p>  If necessary, the smartphone can be updated.  The new firmware will be available for download via FOTA.  It is also possible to update the system using <span>custom firmware.</span>  In this case, you can immediately get rid of unnecessary applications. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2>

    <p>  Equipped the device with a battery having 2100 maH.  The expected battery capacity in a cheap device.  Of course, such a battery will not provide much duration, although the phone is not particularly functional. </p><p>  In passive mode, the phone will last about a day.  But more active use reduces the life of the device to 8 hours.  A very good result for such a battery. </p><p>  Naturally, phone requests are very modest.  A minimum of charge is spent on the display and camera.  Consumes significantly more work with Wi-Fi and entertainment.  Installed graphics accelerator is very gluttonous.  At full load, the battery lasts approximately 4-5 hours. </p><p>  There is no particular relevance in a more powerful battery if the phone is not used very actively.  In the case of continuous operation of the device, you can replace the battery with an analog, a larger capacity. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Together with the device, a headset, an adapter, a USB cable, and instructions are also supplied.  In addition to the standard set, the owner will need additional equipment. </p><p>  The reviews left about HTC Desire 320 report the need for a protective film.  Also, the user will definitely need a flash card.  Given the case material, buying a case is also a smart decision. </p><h2>  Price </h2>

    <p>  The cost of such a device varies around 12 thousand rubles.  The price is definitely overpriced and very unattractive.  HTC competitors offer more powerful devices at a very affordable price. </p><p>  The asking price does not match the capabilities of HTC Desire 320. Reviews of fans of the company show a similar look.  It is completely unclear what increased the price of the smartphone. </p><h2>  Negative sides </h2><p>  The novelty has a lot of unpleasant sides.  You should start with the display installed in the HTC Desire 320 phone. Owner reviews describe the poor quality and problems that arise in the sun.  The implemented screen is nowhere worse, in absolutely all respects. </p><p>  The camera was also a painful point.  The small matrix and low resolution allow you to take very mediocre pictures. </p><p>  The design, or rather the lack of protection, has also been criticized.  Not only do fingerprints prevent the sensor from working adequately, but the screen collects scratches quickly.  The owner just can not do without a protective film. </p><p>  I also want to highlight my native memory from the ‚Äúfilling‚Äù.  Just 1.5 GB is just ridiculous.  This amount is not enough for the most basic needs. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2>

    <p>  Also, HTC Desire 320 smartphone has many advantages. Reviews highlight the productive "stuffing".  Although the RAM failed, but for most tasks it is enough. </p><p>  Good autonomy has also become a plus of the device.  The owner is not particularly dependent on the outlet, one charge per day is enough. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  We can confidently say that the HTC Desire, released in 2015, has become a minor fiasco.  It seems that the manufacturer deliberately slows down the evolution of budget smartphones. </p>
