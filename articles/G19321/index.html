    <h2>  How to pedal Maxim saved Nikolka </h2><p>  Nikolai Bulgakov in 1918 entered the medical faculty of Kiev University.  Time was already hectic.  In student status, he was about two months old. </p><p>  By mid-November of the same year, martial law was declared in Kiev.  For this reason, all educational institutions of the highest rank were closed in the city.  Students at Kiev University eagerly supported the volunteer squad of the National Guard of Kiev, then it was commanded by Lev Nilovich Kirpichev with the rank of major general.  The team was created under the auspices of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, headed by Kistyakovsky.  The volunteer of this squad was Nikolai Bulgakov. </p><p>  In 1918, detachments of volunteers from the front line went to Kiev, they were pursued by the troops of the Ukrainian units.  A little later, volunteers were captured in the building of the Pedagogical Museum.  Young Kolya realized that this was a trap.  He jumped through the window of the second floor into the courtyard, where he met Maxim's pedal.  The guys exchanged the junk form for a civilian one.  Nikolai in civilian clothes freely left the gymnasium and headed home.  The rest of the guys were shot. </p>
