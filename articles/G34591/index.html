History of origin</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Toponymy knows many examples of how the name of the same settlement changed throughout the entire time of its existence.  From the distant past, the name of one of the ancient cities came to us.  Read about what <span>European city</span> used to be called Lutetia, where it came from and why it has not survived to our time - read below. </p><h2>  Origin of names </h2><p>  Cities and villages receive their names from the people who inhabit them.  But the meaning of a name is hidden from contemporaries.  For example, for many London is a typical English name, and no one doubts that the city was named by the British.  Few people guess that this name was given to the settlement by the ancient people, who even before the Celts inhabited this area.  Most scientists are inclined to believe that this name means "stream of water."  The <span>German</span> Saxon <span>tribe, which</span> replaced the original Celtic population, changed the ancient name, and the Romans changed the name of the village again.  Thus, the name of a city or a village can change many times, sometimes lost over the centuries, and sometimes reaching our days in a form that has been changed beyond recognition.  Only in extreme cases, cities survive several centuries, preserving their ancient name, understandable to contemporaries. </p>

    <h2>  Origin of the city </h2><p>  Finding the right answer to the question of which European city used to be called Lutetia, gave scientists food for many guesses and hypotheses.  This name was found in ancient chronicles and manuscripts of the period of the Roman Empire, which means it was a rather famous city.  In fragmentary information of antiquity it was said that Julius Caesar led his troops to the walls of Lutetia.  Even then, the city was famous.  Presumably he was on the island of Cit√© and was the capital of the Parisian tribe.  Archaeologists have discovered traces of stone piles on which the ancient inhabitants built their houses.  Ancient buildings and traces of structures characteristic of the late Neolithic era have been preserved.  Finally, archaeologists found several ancient coins - statirs, which were minted in Lutetia before its conquest by the Romans. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  City location </h2><p>  Traditionally, Lutetia was located on the <span>island of Cit√©,</span> which is currently located in the central district of Paris.  But it should be taken into account that over the entire period of the existence of this city, the Seine has repeatedly changed the outlines of its shores.  What European city used to be called Lutetia has long been clarified, but scientists still argue about where this place was located.  Research is hindered primarily by the fact that the area has been repeatedly conquered, was the scene of ancient battles and modern battles.  All the finds of that long time can be counted on the fingers.  Nevertheless, it is clear that Lutetia really existed and was a large European city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which European city used to be called Lutetia Rome or Paris" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/667078.jpg" width="600"></div>

The name of Rome has not changed much over the millennia of its existence, but Paris began to be called so only after the Romans left this settlement.  Prior to this, the city was known as Paris.  Which meant "the place of settlement of the Parisians", a large tribe of Gallic origin, which made up the majority of the inhabitants of this area.  From the time that the ancient notes of Julius Caesar were found and subjected to painstaking analysis, the debate over which European city used to be called Lutetia stopped.  Pictures of the original life of the ancient Gauls give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe houses built on stilts, of the streams of silt and river mud that the Seine applied every year during its floods.  On the one hand, this created inconveniences for the life and movement of people within the city, and on the other, it caused additional difficulties during the siege of Lutetia.  The mud of the Seine fed many tribes living through agriculture.  After all, the annual spills gave the necessary moisture and fertilized the fields near the walls of the city. </p>

    <p>  The ancient name Lutetia comes from the Latin ‚Äúdirt‚Äù, as the Romans expressed their indignation at the constantly dirty city streets.  It was unlikely that it was about the cleanliness of its inhabitants: the ancient Roman and the ancient barbarian were in approximately the same conditions.  It is natural to assume that the Romans, accustomed to a dry and sunny climate, were unpleasantly surprised by the spills of the Seine and accumulations of silty sediments near its shores. </p><p>  Thus, the name Lutetia appeared on the maps of the Ancient World.  But the very name of this locality is undoubtedly connected with the Parisian tribe living in it.  So, the name Lutetius refers only to the period of the conquest of Gaul by the Romans.  Before and after Rome, Lutetia was called Paris, later changed to Paris. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Only the painstaking work of archaeologists, linguists, historians helped to answer the question of which European city used to be called Lutetia.  Photos of antiquities from the island of Cite say that the Parisians were engaged in fishing, willingly mastered the banks of the Seine and knew the art of building river vehicles.  The remains of the buildings speak of the defense structures of the city.  The Arena of Lutetia, whose ruins have survived to the present day, gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe strong influence of Roman civilization on local peoples.  Finally, Caesar's notes for 53 and 52 BC.  e.  confirm the existence of Lutetia. </p><p>  The answer to the question of which European city used to be called Lutetia can be given only one.  This name was given to ancient Paris during the Roman conquest.  After the Romans left, the Gauls returned the old name to their hometown.  And it has reached our days almost unchanged. </p>
