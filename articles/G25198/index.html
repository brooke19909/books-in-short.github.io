    <h2>  A few words about the hotel complex </h2><p>  <span>Hotel Island Beach Resort</span> Annex is presented in a variety of tourist catalogs a little differently.  Some speak of him as a three-star hotel, while others give only two stars.  This causes some bewilderment of potential travelers who do not quite understand what star they still have to pay for.  In reality, the hotel positions itself as a solid "three-ruble note", but its guests often say that it does not reach this level.  However, this fact is not too frustrating for young people who come here for fun and good mood.  After all, in the rooms they spend a minimal amount of time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Island Beach Resort Annex 3 * is a fairly comfortable hotel complex, consisting of several buildings.  They contain about three hundred rooms of eleven categories.  Such a large selection allows guests to stay on the most suitable option for themselves.  This can be attributed to the advantages of the hotel, because here often come big and noisy companies. </p><p>  The hotel has a small but well-groomed area with everything you need for a comfortable stay. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Located on the Island Beach Resort Annex in Kavos.  This resort town is located on the seashore and is a place of pilgrimage for young people.  If you are not ready to stay awake at night, listen to music until the morning and funny songs coming from the street, then you should opt for another hotel.  After all, according to guests of Island Beach Resort Annex 2 *, every night here turns into a real holiday, with euphoria from which the entire resort village is embraced, without exception. </p><p>  From <span>Corfu Airport, the</span> hotel complex can be reached by breaking about forty kilometers.  About thirty meters from Island Beach Resort Annex 3 * (Corfu) is a public transport stop.  From here you can easily go anywhere in the city. </p><p>  The hotel is located on the first coastline, so the sea will not need to go too long.  The distance depends on which building the guests are accommodated in.  Four blocks are quite distant from each other, so the road to the beach is from fifty to four hundred meters.  Naturally, this factor also affects the cost of rooms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel has a fairly developed infrastructure, so guests are never bored or uncomfortable here.  There are two restaurants and five bars on the territory, and they are located in such a way that each building has its own institution, where you could buy drinks and snacks. </p><p>  Also, almost every building has its own pool, so some guests believe that you can not go beyond the limits of your block.  After all, there is everything you need for a fun holiday. </p><p>  The reception is open around the clock, which is very convenient for guests.  There are safes here, where for a small surcharge vacationers are free to leave their belongings. </p><p>  The hotel perfectly catches Wi-Fi, which is very important for young people who can not imagine their lives without the Internet.  If desired, guests can rent a vehicle and leave it in free parking for any time period. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the hotel has a laundry service, the services of which are often used by young people.  Indeed, in the interval between night and day parties it is so difficult to choose the time for self-washing clothes. </p>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  In the assessment of the numbers, our compatriots did not agree.  However, you should not blame anyone for bias, just the condition of the apartments very much depends on the building in which the guest is accommodated. </p><p>  We will not list all categories of rooms presented in the hotel complex, because for the most part they differ only in the number of beds.  However, in addition to standards, the hotel complex has apartments with equipped kitchens.  They are often booked by our compatriots. </p><p>  Each room is equipped with a TV, telephone and air conditioning.  But the latter only works at an additional cost.  This is a fairly common occurrence in Greece.  If you are not ready to pay for air conditioning, then you will have to sleep with an open balcony, from where bloodsucking insects will constantly fly. </p><p>  The rooms are equipped with a bathroom with shower and hairdryer.  Some apartments, as already mentioned, have a kitchenette.  It is equipped with all necessary items, so you can cook breakfast, lunch and dinner on your own. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews about Island Beach Resort Annex 3 * </h2><p>  There are many conflicting rumors about this hotel on the Internet.  He is often praised, but no less often carried to smithereens.  What doesn‚Äôt suit our compatriots in this hotel complex? </p><p>  We analyzed the written comments and identified several significant shortcomings of the hotel: </p><ul><li>  The hotel often encounters such a thing as overbooking.  It lies in the fact that a trip to the Island Beach Resort Annex 3 * sold more than there are rooms.  Therefore, tourists can be relocated to another hotel for several days, and this can happen even after several days of stay. </li><li>  The lack of Russian-speaking staff. </li><li>  Location relative to the beach.  If you find yourself in the most distant buildings, then do not expect to get to the sea in no time.  You will have to go to the beach for at least fifteen to twenty minutes.  And this is not suitable for all tourists. </li><li>  Modest apartment in need of renovation. </li><li>  The abundance of young people who are not distinguished by culture and does not provide an opportunity to relax for other guests. </li><li>  Bad service. </li></ul>
