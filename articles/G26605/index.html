Nevertheless, it can complicate the work with some of its shortcomings.  Let's try to figure out what's what.  Let's start with an analysis of the main characteristics and what the manufacturer gives with the station. </p>

    <h2>  Basic equipment </h2><p>  <span>The</span> Lukey 702 soldering <span>station</span> , the price of which is slightly higher than the mark of 2,000 Russian rubles, is packed in a rather dense box.  It is nice that the manufacturer made sure that even with mail forwarding all the contents remained safe and sound.  Each element is packed in a separate bag and tightly closed in case of sudden moisture. </p><p>  In addition to the station itself with a fixed hot air gun, in the box you can find a standard soldering iron and a stand for it.  In some packages it happens to meet a stand for a slightly different model of a soldering iron, but this is more an accident than a pattern.  And the enclosed sponge for soldering pleasantly pleases the recipient. </p><p>  With the holder for the hair dryer, which lies there, such troubles do not happen.  At least, such a conclusion can be made based on reviews. </p><p>  In addition to the operating instructions and all of the above, in the box you can find three nozzles for a hot air gun.  It is a pity that the manufacturer does not provide for several replaceable tips for the soldering iron.  But what is is a nice bonus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Although, if you treat the station more openly, you can immediately note that it is simple both externally and in operation.  It will be the perfect gift and assistant for both the professional and the novice master. </p>

    <h2>  Hot air gun </h2><p>  Unlike previous models, Lukey 702 soldering station receives positive reviews most often for a hot air gun.  It is lightweight, durable and pleasantly lies in the hand.  But its main advantage is in the compressor.  Namely - in its location. </p><p>  The fact is that the manufacturer did not save on this model and the compressor was made as a turbine directly in the hair dryer handle.  What did it give? </p><ol><li>  Sound.  In the 702nd model, the hot air gun is almost inaudible.  Thanks to this, several workers became more pleasant and quieter to work in the workshop. </li><li>  The wire.  Since everything you need is located in the handle itself, a thick and impractical hose does not go to the hairdryer.  Now it is a light cable that supplies power and is responsible for the readings received at the temperature sensor.  No more.  Work has become much easier. </li><li>  Aesthetics.  This appearance made the station more mobile and flexible.  Working with a hairdryer is easier and more enjoyable. </li><li>  Productivity.  Surprisingly, this structure of the handle not only left the possibility of driving 120 liters of air per minute, but also allowed it to be done without lowering the temperature for which the heating coil is responsible. </li></ol><p>  Another point that distinguishes this station from others was the ability to turn off if the temperature of the air supplied by the hairdryer dropped below 50 degrees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Soldering iron </h2><p>  All Lukey 702 soldering stations are designed in such a way that almost all soldering irons of the same brand are suitable for them.  It is absolutely standard, with a ceramic heating element and stings that easily replace each other.  As mentioned earlier, there are no replaceable stings in the set, but this does not spoil the overall impression of working with this station.  Yes, and you can buy them in almost every specialized store. </p><p>  One of the most striking advantages of a soldering iron can rightly be considered a quick heating of the tip.  This allows you to start soldering almost immediately after turning on the soldering station.  As for temperatures, they can reach 480 degrees. </p><h2>  Station </h2><p>  The station itself looks like a small black box with six buttons on the front panel, two small windows for displaying temperatures and a small knob on the right.  If we talk about the dimensions, they are only 16 cm in length, 19 cm in width and 16 cm in height.  And this with a weight of just over 2.5 kilograms. </p><p>  All Lukey 702 soldering stations are designed to work as comfortably as possible.  A vivid proof is the ability to control the temperature regimes of both the hairdryer and the soldering iron.  At the same time, the value that is displayed by a pleasant green glow on the scoreboard has an error of only one degree.  This is really a great indicator for such a budget model. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Surprisingly, the Lukey 702 hot-air soldering station is able to save data with the latest parameters, which allows you not to waste time tuning in the same systematic work.  Even if the light was suddenly turned off in the room where the master is working, the station will save the data and when necessary 220 V is returned, it will warm up to the required temperature in a short period of time. </p>

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  There are really many reviews on Lukey 702 soldering stations.  And, unfortunately, among them you can find negative ones.  They may not be considered grandiose, but, for example, the soldering iron connector does fail quite often.  Why it happens? </p><p>  The reason for this is the insufficiently deep connector for the soldering iron plug.  It‚Äôs rather unpleasant when, during delicate work, the soldering iron becomes cold, because the cord just fell out.  The solution to this problem can be hot glue, which must be carefully applied to the problem area.  If we talk about the hair dryer of the Lukey 702 soldering station, then there will not be such a problem with it, since it is monolithic with the station. </p>

    <h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  If you have to look for flaws, then there are really many positive aspects.  After all, the station is suitable for working with different materials and the most complex rations.  This is a small and stylish assistant for both a novice master, and for someone who has been engaged in electronics for a long time.  And antistatic protection conquers from the first seconds of work. </p><p>  The plastic case of the station greatly facilitates transportation.  And a small box takes up very little space on the desktop. </p><p>  The hot air gun itself is made in such a style that it easily lies in the hand and is almost silent.  The cooling system and the circular impeller was a breakthrough in this type of technology. </p><p>  Replaceable <span>ceramic heater</span> allows you to quickly reach the required temperature, which is easy to set and control using the keys and the controller on the station. </p><p>  Of course, you can find a lot of opinions about the station, but it's better to compose your own, because, as mentioned above, her green eyes fall into the soul for a long time. </p>
