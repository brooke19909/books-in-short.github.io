    <p>  The three-star Corina Paloma Garden Hotel (ex. Paloma Garden) welcomes tourists who have decided to visit Crete all year round.

Despite the fact that it stands almost in the center of the village, at the same time it is hidden from prying eyes by the garden surrounding it.  Around - the mountainous landscape characteristic of Crete and a magnificent view of the sea coast.  Near Paloma Garden Corina is located Malia (3 km) - a popular tourist destination, especially among young people.  There you can find hundreds of nightclubs and entertainment for every taste.

    <p>  The beach (pictured above) located near the hotel also earned the highest score.  You can reach it in a few minutes.  The coast is clean, sloping, which is convenient when relaxing with children.  The beach is equipped with everything you need.  This is a very picturesque place surrounded by hills and greenery.  The beach at the peak of the season is very crowded, and this does not always contribute to a good rest.  Travelers visiting Crete recommend to go to the sea early in the morning, when the coast is still almost empty, and the sun is the most gentle. </p>
