    <h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The city was first mentioned in 903, when Prince Igor married Olga.  The annals indicated that she was from Pskov.  In the XII century, the city became part of the Novgorod lands, and later became an independent center of the <span>Pskov Republic.</span>  In 1510, this settlement was part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and from 1777 it became the center of the Pskov province. </p><p>  From the 10th century until the reign of Peter I, Pskov was a rather famous city both in Russia and abroad.  However, after the founding of St. Petersburg, its development began to decline.  In 1944, the Nazis occupied the city, as a result of which many historical monuments were destroyed.  Its modern appearance is completely the merit of restorers and architects who restored the main attractions of Pskov and its environs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Local Kremlin: general description </h2><p>  The Pskov Kremlin or, as it is also called, Krom is considered a wonderful example of Old Russian architecture.  It is located on a rocky shore at the place where the Pskov River flows into the Great.  This ancient structure consists of two parts: external and internal fortress.  The entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Kremlin is like a triangle stretched from north to south.  Here is also located the Trinity Cathedral, erected around 1683-1699, as well as the former Veche Square, where the veche used to be held.  The cathedral is well visible from the other end of the river.  In the south is Dovmontov city.  Earlier in these places there were many churches and buildings.  Now basically you can see only the foundations of the temples, since all of them were destroyed at different times. </p><p>  The Pskov Kremlin occupies 3 hectares of territory, which is surrounded by stone walls.  Here, running platforms covered by a wooden roof are preserved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pskov map with landmarks" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/386786.jpg?1399047850986" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Take a look inside </h2><p>  In the northern part of the Kremlin is a 5-tier tower.  It is called Kutekroma, and its height is 30 meters.  The eastern wall of the Kremlin stretched for 435 meters, and the western - 345 meters. </p><p>  In the heart of Krom is the five-domed Trinity Cathedral.  This building is the fourth in this place.  Initially, in the middle of the 10th century there was a wooden church, which was erected by Princess Olga.  In the XII century, by order of the Pskov prince Vsevolod-Gabriel, a stone structure was founded in its place.  In the 15th century, there was a third Trinity Cathedral instead, which played a significant role in the development of the architectural traditions of the region.  The most recent cathedral was built in 1699 and decorated in all-Russian traditions.  The Pskov Kremlin is a truly unique place.  Here the relics of the saints rest and buildings of different styles and times merge into a single complex. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  History of the Pskov Kremlin </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the chroniclers for some reason did not record when the fortress walls of the Kremlin were laid and its first tower was built.  It is worth noting that Crom is mentioned in written sources only in 1065.  Nevertheless, archeology notes that people came to the shores of Pskov as early as the 1st millennium AD.  They were engaged in hunting, fishing and even made jewelry.  It is believed that the city was founded by <span>Princess Olga.</span>  At the same time, on the basis of the found artifacts, we can conclude that by this time Pskov was already a fully formed pagan city with a large population. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pskov city sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/386794.jpg?1399047897843" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Like any other large and prosperous city, Pskov needed reliable protection from enemies.  In this regard, they decided to build a powerful and impregnable fortress.  The first wooden walls of Krom were erected on a clay shaft in about the VIII-X centuries, at least, this fact speaks of history.  The Pskov Kremlin began to grow gradually.  In the X-XIII centuries, stone walls began to be erected here, which were folded ‚Äúdry‚Äù (without fastening mortar).  The walls, folded on the mortar, began to appear only in the XIII century and adjoined the shaft from the outside.  Later, the construction of new towers began, strengthening the walls and building them in height. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The fate of Crom from the 12th to the 16th centuries </h2><p>  The first was the tower of Smerdye (later Dovmontov).  It was on the left side, near the only city gates at that time.  However, the city developed rapidly, and there was an urgent need for the construction of a second city gate.  In this regard, the Trinity (or Great) Gates appeared, which have survived to this day. </p><p>  In 1337, the most powerful wall of Crom was updated.  During this period, expanded the road to the Kremlin, and also increased the opening of the Great Gate.  In 1400-1401, two more towers were completed.  In general, during the 15th century, the Pskov Kremlin was strengthened 2 times.  During this period, another tower also appeared - Vlasyevskaya.  It is located on the corner of the Dovmont city.  It became a kind of checkpoint: it was here that control was exercised over all foreigners arriving in the city. </p><p>  The last tower - Flat - was built in 1500 and is considered the most picturesque.  She stands near the confluence of the Pskov River in the Great.  In 1510, Pskov became part of the Moscow Principality.  In the sixteenth century, Crom became the residence of the spiritual authority of the city - first the lord, and then the metropolitan.  In the Kremlin there were "sovereign granaries" and ammunition was stored.  In 1537, the Lower Lattices were placed at the mouth of the Pskov River, which blocked the river bed.  In the middle of the XVI century, the city clock was on the <span>Trinity Tower</span> , but it collapsed in 1787 and was restored only in 1988. </p><h2>  From the 18th century to the present </h2><p>  Under Peter I, the Pskov Kremlin (you can see the photo of this magnificent building below) continued to perform a defensive function.  In general, it remained a reliable defensive border of the northwestern part of Russia until the end of the 18th century.  Until the 20th century, Krom practically turned into ruins and required serious reconstruction.  Large-scale restoration work began only in the 60s of the twentieth century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pskov sights photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/386777.jpg?1399047943895" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Towers of the Pskov Kremlin </h2><p>  The majestic Kremlin has 6 towers: </p><p>  - Vlasyevskaya Tower (XV century). </p><p>  - Rybnitskaya (XV century).  Now it houses a souvenir shop (in 1780 it was dismantled, and in 1970 the building was recreated in its original form). </p><p>  - Middle Tower. </p><p>  - Trinity, or Sentinel (was reconstructed after full permission in the XVII century). </p><p>  - Kutekrom Tower (1400). </p><p>  - Smerdye, or Dovmontov‚Äôs tower (from the 19th century this rather powerful tower was turned into a small ‚Äúfaceted‚Äù tower). </p><h2>  Other sights of the city </h2><p>  In addition to the old Kremlin, there are many other places in Pskov that you should definitely look into.  Many tourists are attracted to the Basil‚Äôs Church on the hill, which was erected in the 16th century.  Previously, at the foot of the church a small trickle of the Pupil flowed. </p><p>  Near the temple was also located Vasilyevskaya Tower, in which the belfry was located.  According to an ancient legend, a bell hung in it, which informed the residents of the city about the advance of the Tatar-Mongols and other enemies.  The global restoration of the temple began in 2009. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of pskov and its environs" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/386785.jpg?1399048009534" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Mirozhsky monastery </h2><p>  You are interested in what else can the city of Pskov surprise?  Sights can be seen in many corners of this village and its environs.  For example, here is one of the oldest monasteries in Russia.  Its main advantage is the pre-Mongol frescoes made in the XII century.  This building is included by UNESCO in the list of the most outstanding world monuments of art. </p><h2>  Pechersky Monastery </h2><p>  The Pskov-Pechersky monastery is located 50 km from Pskov and was founded by the Monk Jonah.  This temple is more than 500 years old.  Jonah moved here with his family to serve God for the rest of his life.  He began to cost a cave temple, but at this time his wife fell ill and died.  After burying her, the next day the saint discovered that her coffin was again on the surface of the earth.  After repeating the burial by the next day, he again stood on the ground.  Jonah decided that this was a sign from above, and did not bury his wife. </p><p>  Since then, the bodies of all the deceased inhabitants of the Pskov province were not interred, but left in crypts.  Surprisingly, even despite the fact that the coffins were blackened, the bodies of the deceased almost did not succumb to any modifications since those years.  Representatives of many noble families are buried here: the Buturlins, Pushkins, Kutuzovs, Nazimovs, etc. The monastery also has such shrines as the icon of the Mother of God and the Hodegetria of the Psokovo-Pechora.  In addition, it is the largest <span>monastery</span> in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="towers of pskov kremen" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/386796.jpg?1399048045523" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  What to see more? </h2><p>  In the northern part of Pskov, on the banks of the Velikaya River, is the Snegorsky Monastery dating from the 13th century.  Since 1993, he became female.  Not far from here is the current church of Peter and Paul. </p><p>  Nevertheless, this is not all the amazing places that Pskov can show you.  Sights, photos of which are touching, are closely related to the history of the city and its famous inhabitants.  Here is a monument to Princess Olga, the monument ‚ÄúTwo Captains‚Äù, the composition ‚ÄúPoet and Peasant Woman‚Äù, as well as a sculpture in honor of the 300th anniversary of the defense against the troops of Khan Batory, and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pskov Kremlin photo" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/386793.jpg?1399048080091" width="600"></div>
