Jewelry Making Workshop</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Embroidery with cords, beads and stones on clothes or in the manufacture of jewelry is the suture embroidery.  Patterns can be very different, but more often needlewomen take as a basis zigzag <span>floral patterns</span> and even the color of animals and birds.  Soutache technique is distinguished from simple bead embroidery by the presence of special flat cords, which, due to their color variety and flexibility, can create unusual ornaments. </p><h2>  Where did the suture embroidery come from? </h2><p>  The clothes of wealthy people were embroidered with cords and jewelry back in the 16th century in France.  Further, the Dutch adopted this technique and made a lot of innovations.  Russian beauties and rich men could boast of embroidered outfits under Peter the Great.  Souture embroidery resembled elegant lace. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the 19-20 centuries were not the best time for the development of this technique.  This needlework was handled by narrow specialists for the decoration of theatrical costumes.  And only from the end of the 20th century, the Israeli works of M. Nagrin revived interest in the training technique.  True, many designers and craftsmen make jewelry in this style. </p><p>  Nowadays, with embroidered embroideries, necklaces, bags, bracelets, earrings, brooches, fans, agraffes, cufflinks, hairpins, headbands, belts are decorated.  But the embroidery of clothes by modern needlewomen is not yet in fashion.  When creating jewelry and accessories, suture cords, accessories (beads, beads, bugles, fasteners, etc.), stones, shells, felt, leather, needles, monofilament, scissors, glue are required. </p><h2>  Souture embroidery: master class for making a jewelry set </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the soutache cord is thin, quite flexible, it takes a lot of time to create different elements.  Therefore, you can save time and buy ready-made suture clasps.  It can be circles, leaves, and the shape of clover.  Of particular interest are loop-shaped elements into which beads or beads can be sewn. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="soutache embroidery on clothes" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/403485.jpg" width="200"></div>

At home, lay out all the elements on the table and make a composition of a necklace and earrings.  Beads can be laid out between soutache elements or in loops. </p><p>  Now it remains a needle for beads monofilament or to match the elements to connect all the details.  The advantage of the cord is that a groove runs in its middle, where all the stitches are hidden.  After the main element is ready, string the beads of the required length on both fishing lines or a special tourniquet and attach to the fasteners.  You also make earrings. </p><h2>  Hair band </h2><p>  The combination of ordinary beads, faceted beads, rivoli and soutache cords forms unusual noble patterns.  The wealth of the product gives an unusual soutache embroidery.  A master class on the manufacture of the rim is as follows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Souture embroidery master class" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/403477.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <ul><li>  Sew Rivoli on felt. </li><li>  Sew it in three rows of beads of different colors in a mosaic technique. </li><li>  Sew the last edge of the beads to the non-woven fabric. </li><li>  Trim the edges of the fabric, leaving 3 mm. </li><li>  Take three soutache cords, matching in color with beads and rivoli, sew a stone on both sides. </li><li>  To get unusual ‚Äúsquiggles‚Äù, in the middle of the stone from each edge, bend the ends of the cords, and in the resulting circle sew a bead. </li><li>  Since in the middle you get two circles, then sew a bead between them so that the pattern does not merge. </li><li>  The ends of the cords are hidden on the inside (first burn them with fire, and then glue them). </li><li>  On one half between the two circles, use two cords to create three petals, into which sew oblong beads in the form of petals. </li></ul><h2>  Main bezel pattern </h2><p>  A feature of soutache embroidery is that the product can be created from elements.  If we consider the example of the rim, then the three petals can be created separately with a needle and thread, applying to the stone.  And as the last step, sew the finished element to the main pattern.  It is precisely this "design" property that attracts many needlewomen to the technique of southeast embroidery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="technique of suture embroidery master class" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/403478.jpg" width="332"></div>

Sew the bead with a soutache cord of one color, on top of which sew the beads simultaneously with a cord of a different color scheme.  It turns out that bead sheathe bead and get a petal.  It must be done in duplicate. </li><li>  Sew these petals between two circles at the main pattern from two sides. </li><li>  Next, with the third color suture cord, sheathe the obtained petals, making circles at the base, into which the beads are sewn. </li><li>  Cut a piece of leather to the size of the inside and stick to hide all the ponytails of the cords. </li></ul><h2>  "Snake" hair band </h2><p>  The main decoration for the rim is ready.  Now you need to make the "foundation" of the accessory.  Since the finished rims cannot be combined with the resulting pattern, we will create a bandage in the same technique (soutache embroidery). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="suture embroidery mk" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/403481.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Snake manufacturing workshop: </p><ul><li>  Measure the volume of the head.  Draw where the decoration will be and how much space it will take.  Make room for the elastic bands, that is, the pattern of snakes will end around your ears. </li><li>  Take 6 pieces of cords around the circumference of the head (two of each color) and sew their edges, creating a dense braid.  You will have two pieces, which individually attach to the decoration. </li><li>  Now spread the cords evenly and sew the beads between them. </li><li>  Next, flash the cords. </li><li>  Sew the bead again.  Repeat the pattern to the end. </li><li>  Next, sheathe all the segments with beads and fix them with a second seam. </li><li>  Sew the resulting pieces and decoration onto a velvet strip.  They can be glued first, and then sewed around the edges with kapron threads. </li><li>  Sew elastic bands along the edges of the velvet and cover the velvet from the inside. </li><li>  So that the rim does not move out on the head, embossed braid is glued or sewn to the wrong side. </li></ul><h2>  Brooch in the technique of soutache embroidery </h2><p>  Consider how to make a simple brooch in this technique.  If there are several such elements and interconnected, then you can create a bracelet or necklace.  The main thing is to pick up stones and cords by color, then the soutache embroidery will be more elegant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="suture embroidery patterns" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/403482.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  Brooch workshop: </p><ul><li>  Glue the stone to felt and cut the fabric along its edges two centimeters more. </li><li>  Place the stone in the middle of two suture segments, different in color, and sew on both sides. </li><li>  Reaching the middle, sew beads into the cords in the opposite direction. </li><li>  After finishing work, make a loop around the edges and sew into it along the bead. </li><li>  On the reverse side, sew a loop from the three bundles symmetrically. </li><li>  Decorate with beads and beads on each side from the loop to the bead in a circle, getting a kind of small fence: beads, bead, three beads in the form of a triangle. </li><li>  Sew or glue the felt on the inside, onto which the fastener is sewn in advance. </li></ul><p>  An elegant brooch was created thanks to the smooth curved lines of the cords created by the soutache embroidery.  MK jewelry requires small additions: </p><p>  1) do not save on suture segments if you are doing large parts, as is the case with rim snakes; </p><p>  2) the ends immediately singe over the fire and press with your fingers; </p><p>  3) do all the stitches in the groove of the cord; </p><p>  4) initially create a decoration pattern on the table from the details or draw on paper. </p><p>  Create, and you will succeed! </p>
