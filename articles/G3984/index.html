Even a seemingly unnecessary newspaper can acquire a second life in capable hands.  Newspaper tubes are ideal for creating floor vases.  It can take its rightful place in the house or become an original gift. </p><h2>  A few words about the classic version </h2><p>  Here we will consider in more detail how to create a floor vase from newspaper tubes.  The following description is the simplest, but here you will have to make every effort.  The thing is that the parts are small and require careful handling.  Photo vases from newspaper tubes are presented in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ggsis.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself floor vase" class="if uuid-2258086" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2258086.jpg"></div><h2>  What do you need to do crafts </h2><p>  Before you try yourself in the role of the creator of a newspaper vase vase, you must have at hand a set of the following tools and materials: </p><ul><li>  several newspapers; </li><li>  knife; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  a tube of paper towels; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  scuba diving; </li><li>  thin knitting needle. </li></ul><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><div class="photo" data-original="kirubaarts.blogspot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="newspaper tubes" class="if uuid-2258081" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2258081.jpg"></div><p>  To make a vase from newspaper tubes, beginners need to adhere to the following recommendations: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Sheets of the newspaper must be cut into strips 5 cm wide. For faster work, you can cut strips at once in the amount of several pieces, and not one at a time. </li><li>  Each strip must be screwed onto a knitting needle.  Put the knitting tool on the paper and make a few turns.  After the tube is ready, one edge is smeared with glue, and the needle is removed through the opposite one.  Subsequently, it is also fixed to prevent the tube from expanding.  If desired, you can immediately glue the workpiece with glue and attach it to the tube, but it is still recommended to prepare a certain number of tubes, and only then deal with their placement. </li><li>  To create a vase from newspaper tubes, it is necessary to glue blanks over the entire circumference of the tube.  The glue base will be better set if you squeeze the paper using tape or elastic. </li><li>  After drying, the rubber bands are removed, and the top is given the shape of a zigzag, cone or uneven oval with scissors. </li><li>  At the last stage, the tubes are laterally glued to make the vase more original.  Now you need to mix scuba diving with any color and paint the craft. </li></ol><p>  It would seem that the vase is almost ready, but one more detail remains, namely the formation of the bottom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="niftydiys.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Newspaper vase for beginners" class="if uuid-2258071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2258071.jpg"></div><h2>  How to craft a bottom for crafts </h2><p>  <span>Weaving a vase</span> from newspaper tubes will not be complete if you do not know how to make the bottom: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  It is necessary to select the tubes in an amount of 16 pieces and divide them into 4 parts with an equal number of blanks. </li><li>  To facilitate the work of the press, you can slightly press the paper in the middle, then it will be convenient to lay the blanks in a cross. </li><li>  After that glue is used for fixing. </li><li>  Now the formation of the bottom begins.  Here you need to use another paper stick, which will braid the cross. </li><li>  Following the above instructions, it is recommended to make several rows. </li><li>  Here you will need to divide the sides, consisting of 4 tubes, in half and weave a few more rows. </li><li>  The base of the bottom is formed.  If you wish, you can continue to work using a different color or pattern. </li></ol><h2>  How to make a vase that has a curved shape </h2><p>  Yes, such a craft is also quite possible to do it yourself.  The use of racks and circles, having a dense base, allows you to get a very diverse work, as well as <span>paper vases</span> with an original unique shape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="weaving newspaper vases" class="if uuid-2258062" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2258062.jpg"></div><h2>  Step by step recommendations </h2><ol><li>  How to twist, paint and dry the tubes has already been described above.  It is worth knowing that a large vase may need more than a hundred blanks. </li><li>  At the first stage, the bottom is made. </li><li>  Put the rack on the bottom and fix the first circle at the desired height.  Weaving is performed in a circle until a circle is reached, as soon as this happens, it must be removed. </li><li>  Attach another circle to the stand, which will have a smaller diameter compared to the previous one.  Now you need to weave three rows, raise the base. </li><li>  At this stage, again you need to change the circle to the next and weave to its edge. </li><li>  To complete the work, you need a tube that will help form the neck of a vase from newspaper tubes.  Thick cardboard is located in the center of the roll with paper towels.  Weaving continues until the edges are reached. </li></ol><p>  An important stage of work is that with each installation of the circles, the vase should be covered with several layers of varnish, and only after the craft dries, you can create a masterpiece further. </p><h2>  Vase decoration </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="paper vase" class="if uuid-2258104" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2258104.jpg"></div><p>  And now the craft is ready.  You can leave it in the form in which it is, or decorate it a little.  If we talk about decor elements, then things that are at hand are used, so as not to run to the store for additional purchases.  For example, the following materials are used: </p><ul><li>  satin ribbons; </li><li>  glue of the Moment brand; </li><li>  thread matching the color of the ribbons; </li><li>  decorative multi-colored beads, size does not matter; </li><li>  buttons can also be used. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decor elements" class="if uuid-2258097" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2258097.jpg"></div><p>  Flowers are formed from ribbons by collection on a string, and the role of the core is assigned to the button.  If such work seems too complicated, you can make several bows, which will be fixed in the future on a vase.  All the same buttons or beads are placed in the center of the decorating elements.  Some needlewomen collect beautiful laces from beads, and then braid them around a vase.  Any fantasy can be realized. </p><p>  The options presented in the article allow each person who is fond of needlework to create an interesting vase that will take its rightful place in the interior of the house. </p>
