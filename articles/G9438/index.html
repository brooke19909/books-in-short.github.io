Where to get them?  What is required for this?  Answering these questions is not so difficult.  Especially if you prepare for the process in advance.  MHI policies of a new type appeared in Russia relatively recently.  But it‚Äôs easier to use than the old model.  Therefore, the population more and more often thinks about how to produce exactly the new medical certificates.  Not everyone understands where and how to get them.  So what should every citizen know about new policies?  Where can I get them?  What is required to issue paper? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new type of health insurance policies where to get" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1487813.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Definition </h2><p>  What are a new type of health insurance policies?  Where to get them is another question entirely.  First you need to understand what kind of document in principle we are talking about. </p><p>  The indicated paper is a kind of certificate that allows you to get medical care.  The new sample is represented by a plastic card.  It resembles bank plastic.  It serves as an analogue of a compulsory medical insurance policy, helps to receive free medical care. </p><p>  The advantage is the durability of the document.  On it, as well as on a paper counterpart, are information about the owner.  But data processing through information technology is faster.  Yes, and it‚Äôs more difficult to spoil a plastic card.  That is why it is best to use such a policy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Insurance companies </h2><p>  Now a little about where and how to get the specified document.  The thing is that modern citizens have a certain freedom of choice.

The first and most common option is to contact an insurance company.  That is, a citizen submits an application for the release of this document, then takes it after a while. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="a new type of health insurance policy where to get" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1487814.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Contact is required to the insurance company that issued the old-age compulsory medical insurance policy.  But if you wish, you can once a year, in principle, change the organization serving the citizen for insurance. </p><h2>  "Government services" </h2><p>  But this is only the first scenario.  In fact, there are several places for obtaining these documents.  A new sample health insurance policy where to get?  Choose the exact place of receipt is offered on the portal "State Services".  There, when applying for the production of a document, it will be offered to choose the organization (depending on the registration) that will issue the card. </p><p>  In each city, it is proposed to take a document: </p><ul><li>  in the MFC, which serves a particular area; </li><li>  in an insurance company that originally produces plastic. </li></ul><p>  The exact address of the place of receipt will be indicated at the end of the application.  Or a citizen will be able to see him after he receives a notification of the successful submission of an application for the manufacture of a policy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  MFC </h2><p>  It is not so difficult to guess what other organizations you can contact in a particular case.  Where can I get new insurance policies?  In Russia, it is proposed to apply for this service in multifunctional centers.  They are in every city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new type of health insurance policies where to get in yekaterinburg" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1487811.jpg"></div>

    <p>  You can either use the State Services, or go to the MFC yourself in the area in which the citizen is registered.  In the first case, it is enough to file an electronic application for the manufacture of a new policy, in the second - personally through a multifunctional center to make such a request.  The process is no different from contacting an insurance company. </p><h2>  Moscow </h2><p>  And now a little about where exactly to apply in some cities to implement ideas.  A new model policy is a kind of innovation.  It has not yet been distributed to all insurance companies.  And this fact must be taken into account by every citizen.  It is likely that in a particular locality, certain insurance companies are not yet making new policies.  Then it is best to implement the idea through the MFC. </p><p>  But policies of compulsory medical insurance of a new sample where to get in Moscow?  At the moment, it is worth paying attention to some insurance companies offering a similar service.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  Sogaz-MED. </li><li>  UralSib. </li><li>  "Consent-M". </li><li>  Ingosstrakh-M. </li><li>  "Spassky Gate-M". </li><li>  "MSC Medstrakh". </li><li>  <span>"VTB Health Insurance."</span> </li><li>  "RGS-Medicine". </li></ul><p>  This is not the whole list of organizations that offer residents of the capital to receive new health insurance policies.  But they are most often used by citizens.  Of course, do not forget about the multifunctional centers.  The exact addresses of these companies can be clarified on the official sites of the MFC.  There are a lot of them.  Therefore, listing everything is clearly not worth it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new type of health insurance policies where to get growths" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1487812.jpg"></div>

More precisely, it is proposed to contact similar insurance companies, as well as multifunctional centers. </p><p>  Residents of the Moscow region are more interested in the second type of organization.  After all, they often get a card for further free medical care easier.  Where exactly to apply?  Exact information should be clarified regarding each locality.  For instance: </p><ul><li>  Svirskaya street, 2a, Shchelkovo - MFC No. 50. </li><li>  Lenin, 96A, Orekhovo-Zuevo - MKU MFC. </li><li>  190 Oktyabrsky Avenue, Lyubertsy - Lyubertsy MFC. </li><li>  Sovetskaya, 4, Balashikha - a multifunctional center in Balashikha. </li></ul><p>  Quite often, in the regions of the Moscow region there are several multifunctional centers.  Accordingly, you can contact any of them.  It is desirable in the one that serves a particular area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city. </p><h2>  Ekaterinburg </h2><p>  Now a little about other settlements in Russia.  Health insurance policies of a new sample where to get in Yekaterinburg?  In this city, as in all others, you can use the MFC.  What about insurance companies?  What organizations today issue plastic card policies? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new type of health insurance policies where to get kirov" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1487810.jpg"></div>

Simply, these companies are in great demand with respect to the manufacture of new policies. </p><h2>  Rostov </h2><p>  And what about the residents of other cities?  In all cities of the Russian Federation, similar principles remain.  Either the person turns to the insurance company, or he embodies the idea through the MFC. </p><p>  New sample health insurance policies where to get it?  Rostov-on-Don - the city is not so small.  In it, unlike all the previously listed regions of the country, it is insurance companies that are in great demand.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  "MSC-Maximus." </li><li>  "Spassky Gate". </li><li>  "MSC-Panacea". </li><li>  "RGS-Medicine". </li><li>  AsStra. </li><li>  Sogaz-Med. </li></ul><p>  In general, almost all modern insurance companies already issue MHI policies of a new type.
