Thanks to this fascinating creative process, very beautiful things are obtained that are unlike the others - those that can be seen in large numbers on store shelves and markets.  Knitted hats are very necessary and even necessary in a winter wardrobe.  We will figure out how a good hat with a lapel should be connected.  With knitting needles, this work is easy.  It is important that the product is not only nice, but also comfortable. </p>

    <h2>  How to knit: straight or in a circle? </h2><p>  Ordinary knitted hats are a fabric with a seam at the back.  True, some models are knitted in circular rows.  Then the knitter should be very careful in work and follow a few simple rules: </p><ul><li>  at the top of the headgear, loops should be reduced evenly (this rule is relevant for any product); </li><li>  the place where the rows are connected must be done carefully.  If this is not provided by the pattern, then the number of knitted loops should not arbitrarily be increased or decreased; </li><li>  if knitting is carried out in a spiral, then experienced craftswomen do not recommend using stripes of different colors, because it will be difficult to compare the beginning and end of such rows, and they will turn out to be open. </li></ul><p>  When a hat with a lapel, knitting <strong> </strong>  make straight and return rows.  So much more convenient. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Seamless way </h2><p>  How to connect the most ordinary <span>hat with a knitted lapel</span> ?  In this case, the circuit is not needed - everything is so simple to perform.  Used gum 2x2.  It is necessary to put on the knitting needles the number of loops, a multiple of four, and plus another loop - an auxiliary one. </p><p>  To begin with, you should dial ninety-seven loops on the knitting needles and tie a 2x2 elastic band. </p><p>  The resulting fabric should be closed in one ring either from the initial row or by knitting the first two rows. </p><p>  When the fabric is closed in a circle, you can continue knitting with an elastic band.  What a lapel, such will be the length of the cap. </p><p>  For example, if there is a single lapel on the headdress, then its depth can vary between 25-27 cm. If it is supposed to be double lapel, then the depth will slightly increase and will be approximately 37-38 cm. </p><h2>  Seamless way.  Decrease in work </h2><p>  Further, a knitted hat with a lapel is done like this.  After the desired dimensions of the depth of the product have been reached, one should gradually begin to make reductions.  To reduce the number of loops, you need to knit them in two together with the wrong side.  In the next row, you need to alternate a pair of facial loops with the same number of purl. </p><p>  In the third row, you need to again reduce the number of loops.  All facial knit two together.  Having reached through the fourth row by such simple manipulations, it can already be knitted with an ordinary 1x1 elastic band. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="women's knitted hat" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/1993707.jpg" width="500"></div>

To do this, knit them two at a time, so that all the loops in this row become facial. </p><p>  In the next - sixth row, it is necessary to knit exclusively in the facial way.  Pull all remaining loops into a ring.  Now the thread can be fixed. </p><h2>  How to make an inflection line? </h2><p>  If we take the classic version as a basis, then in it (at least the beginning of the cap) an elastic band is knitted - 1x1 or 2x2.  After the first five to seven centimeters have been passed from the start of work, you need to stagger the knitting: where the front loops were, knit the wrong ones, and vice versa.  Exactly so, in a completely uncomplicated way, an inflection line of the lapel itself will be outlined, along which the edge will then bend.  After this, you need to tie another five to seven centimeters with an elastic band.  That is, exactly as much as was tied up to the lapel. </p><p>  It is easy to knit a women's hat with a lapel with knitting needles;  An experienced needlewoman can do this in just a few hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted hat with lapel" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/1993714.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Important information: it must be remembered that the gum stretches very well, so it must be done either by the size of the head, or a little narrower.  After this part is connected, then you should continue to work with the main pattern that was chosen for the female headdress. </p><h2>  Which pattern to choose? </h2><p>  Consider two simple patterns with which you can knit a very nice product. </p><p>  To knit a hat with a lapel with knitting needles, use the ‚ÄúRice‚Äù pattern, which is suitable for both thin and bulk yarn.  The process itself is very simple: it is required to alternate front and back loops.  But in the next row, the front loop fits on the wrong side, and vice versa. </p><p>  Another pattern that can be used to knit a hat with a lapel is ‚ÄúHoneycombs‚Äù. </p><p>  They fit with a draped thread.  An even number of loops are typed.  In the first row, one front is knitted, then a thread is thrown on the right knitting needle, and a loop is removed from the left.  So you need to repeat to the end of the row. </p><p>  The second row is done as follows: one wrong side, the yarn is thrown onto the right knitting needle, two front knitting, translation, two front knitting and so on, until the loops end. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted cap" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/1989345.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <p>  Third row: you need to throw a thread, remove the loop, knit the front with the crochet.  So do with all subsequent loops. </p><p>  Fourth row: two front, translated double crochet.  Continue to the end of the row. </p><p>  Fifth row: the thrown thread and a loop are knitted, the loop with a crochet is removed.  So to the end of the row. </p><p>  Sixth row.  Do the same as the second. </p><p>  From the seventh row it is necessary to begin the repetition of rapport: the third or sixth row. </p><p>  When choosing a pattern, you should pay attention to its density.  For winter hats, it should be very tight.  For spring and autumn, it is permissible to choose openwork and nets. </p>
