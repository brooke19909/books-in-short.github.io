    <h2>  TOP-432NA </h2><p>  CAME is today considered the highest quality and most reliable.  At her you can find many good remotes.  According to consumers, the highest quality model is TOP-432NA.  What is the reason for this?  This remote control is two-channel, which allows you to work with several devices at once, namely it is possible to open several devices at once, for example, gates and barriers.  Its frequency is 433.92 MHz.  This model is capable of working at a fairly large distance - 140 meters.  How to program the remote control from the gate CAME? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  At the first stage, you must close the remote control to the gate. </li><li>  Next, you need to press 2 buttons.  Hold them until the indicator light starts flashing. </li><li>  After that, click on any button, only you need to choose which one will be used for the gate.  If the indicator starts to burn evenly and stops blinking, then you did everything right. </li><li>  We take the old remote that came with the gate, and click on the button to rewrite the code.  It should be remembered that everything must be done quickly while the light on the CAME remote control is on. </li><li>  When the indicator on the new remote control blinks several times, the dubbing will end.  Now you can use it to work with the gate. </li></ol><h2>  Four-channel TOP-434NA </h2><p>  This remote is similar to the first model.  The only difference is the size and number of devices that can be programmed.  The frequency remains the same.  TOP-434NA - remote control from the gate.  How to program it? </p><ol><li>  As in the first case, you need to bring the remote control to the gate and press two keys simultaneously.  We wait until the LED lights up. </li><li>  Click on one of the buttons to start recording on it. </li><li>  Next, press the button on the special remote control to rewrite the code. </li><li>  After the indicator blinks 3 times, you can start using this remote control.  The data was successfully overwritten. </li></ol><h2>  TOP-432EE </h2><p>  Recently there was a new keychain from the TOP series - TOP-432.  It can allows you to work with devices for the programming of which various encodings were used, such as TAM and TOR.  To start working with this remote control: </p><ol><li>  You must click on the new key fob the key that you want to use in the future to work with the gate.  We wait until blinking appears on the indicator, and release the button. </li><li>  Repeat clicking on this button. </li><li>  After completing the steps, you need to quickly bring the old remote to the TOP-432EE.  We press on it a key that allows you to open the gate.  When the LED blinks 3 times, you can start using the device for its intended purpose. </li></ol><h2>  TOP-432EV </h2><p>  This remote control is considered an improved version of the previous model.  It has a fairly small size, which allows you to carry it in your pocket.  TOP-432EV may also contain 4096 code operations.  How to program this keychain? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  As before, we hold down two keys until you see a blinking light bulb.  Next, release them and move on to the next action. </li><li>  Select the button on which the data will be moved. </li><li>  We wait a few seconds until the LED lights up continuously. </li><li>  We bring the new remote control to the bottom of another remote control and wait for the dubbing to be performed.  This usually takes about 10-20 seconds.  When the LED flashes 3 times, you can be sure that the recording has completed successfully. </li></ol><h2>  Came twin </h2><p>  Another novelty is the Came Twin keychain.  It has one feature - code protection.  Outsiders will not be able to so easily get the code to open your gate.  They are also available in various variations - on two and four buttons.  Came Twin is able to work with dynamic code.  How to program the remote control from the gate? </p><ol><li>  First you need to make sure that this keychain can already be used and it has a button for receiving a signal. </li><li>  We bring the remote control as close to the receiver as possible. </li><li>  Next, take the old keychain and press the key where the necessary code is recorded.  We wait until the LED lights up. </li><li>  After 10 seconds, click on the button that is on the old remote control. </li><li>  After about 20 seconds, the code writing process will end. </li></ol><h2>  Nice company </h2><p>  The Italian company Nice is in the top for the production of automated systems for various equipment.  Their products are quite high quality and reliable.  Of course, they have universal remotes that allow you to control some processes at the same time.
