For this reason, a huge number of mothers strive to make this item of clothing for their daughters.  However, understanding technology alone is not always possible.  For this reason, we have prepared the material presented below. </p><h2>  Preparatory stage </h2><p>  Bolero looks very stylish and original.  However, before starting to knit the product, it must be carefully thought out.  After all, you can bring your idea to life in different ways.  Traditionally, a bolero for a girl is crocheted across.  That is, the finished product consists of two parts.  Both are connected from the sleeve cuff to the spine, and then neatly connected.  The second option involves other actions.  In this case, the bolero is knitted from the bottom up, with a rectangular cloth.  The result is a long scarf, in which the sleeves are then isolated, making the seams in the right place.  The third option is suitable for masters who are well versed in basic knitting skills.  It involves the use of an oval napkin pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kvartalmuz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet bolero pattern" class="if uuid-2981726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2981726.jpg"></div><p>  From which you need to throw out the middle and tie an even cloth, leaving holes for the hands.  What version of a crocheted bolero for a girl to please her daughter, each mother must decide for herself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Selection of tool and yarn </h2><p>  The needlewoman, who planned to crochet the studied product, most often wants to perform an elegant openwork thing.  In this case, experienced knitters recommend not to choose a motley, patchwork, gradient and other unusual knitting thread for knitting.  It is much more reasonable to consider a monophonic, in extreme case, a pastel gradient.  In addition, it is important to remember that the knitter crochets a bolero for a girl.  For this reason, it is better to give preference to light or juicy shades. </p><div class="photo" data-original="manualidadyreciclado.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet bolero from a napkin" class="if uuid-2981424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2981424.jpg"></div><p>  It is also important to take a hook seriously and responsibly.  Masters recommend stopping your choice on what is made of metal, but not too soft.  Otherwise, the tool will bend strongly during operation.  When performing patterned products, you should choose a hook whose diameter is equal to the thickness of the thread.  It is better to refuse to buy a very long instrument, ideally it should fit in your hand.  It is still necessary to study the tip, it will be inconvenient to work too sharp. </p><h2>  Determination of the parameters necessary for knitting </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen are convinced that it is not difficult to tie up a conceived product.  Having chosen a good hook and yarn, the bolero for the girl will be able to be performed very quickly and efficiently.  However, first you need to measure the model - a young lady who will wear a finished wardrobe item.  This requires an elastic centimeter, a notebook and a pen.  After that, we measure important parameters: the desired length of the product is the distance from the base of the neck to the lower edge, and the width is the distance from the cuff of one sleeve to the other, as well as the length of the sleeve from the cuff to the shoulder. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Loop and row calculation technology </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet bolero how to make" class="if uuid-2981722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2981722.jpg"></div><p>  The taken measurements will not help much in the work, if they are not converted into the necessary units of measurement.  It is very easy to do.  It is only necessary to prepare a square sample of the selected pattern with dimensions of 10x10 cm. For its implementation, it is important to use the purchased yarn and hook.  When it is possible to make a sample, we count the loops and rows in it.  We divide each value by 10. After the first, we multiply by the horizontal parameters of the model, and the second by vertical.  Depending on the style, they will change.  If necessary, round the final value to the nearest whole, and then fix it in our records.  It is for them that we will carry out crocheting of a bolero for a girl with a dense pattern, openwork, voluminous or another needlewoman and her daughter who liked it. </p><h2>  We knit a bolero across </h2><p>  To perform the second version of the description of a bolero for a girl with a crochet, you can choose any pattern scheme.  Openwork will look especially interesting.  All thanks to the fact that the finished product will turn out seamless.  If the reader decided to implement this style, the desired length of the product will be measured in loops, and the width in rows.  Therefore, the first thing we knit is a chain equal to the calculated number of loops.  We lock in a ring and knit a sleeve of the desired length, moving in a spiral.  Then we divide the resulting "pipe" and knit to the spine, moving back and forth.  The total length of the canvas is 1/2 the desired length of the bolero.  By analogy, we carry out the second part.  Then carefully connect both parts together.  To do this, it is better to use a needle with a thread. </p><h2>  Knit bolero from bottom to top </h2><div class="photo" data-original="funer.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet bolero for girls" class="if uuid-2981718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2981718.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, the length of the product will be measured in rows and the width in loops.  Therefore, we knit a chain of the calculated number of loops, then raise to the desired height.  And we sew the finished fabric, separating the sleeves.  If desired, we knit the bolero around the circumference with ruffles or leave it like that. </p><p>  As you can see, it‚Äôs easy to crochet a bolero for a girl according to the description.  You can choose any pattern scheme.  The main thing is to comply with the technology. </p>
