Some still at their own risk continue to keep their savings at home.  But in the modern world there are a large number of options for storing funds, and one of them is the use of a bank cell.  This service has long been used in the process of buying and selling real estate and for the duration of a long trip.  Next, you will learn all about bank cells from Sberbank. </p><h2>  All about bank cells </h2><p>  Bank safes are standard metal boxes stored in financial institutions.  The dimensions of the provided cell are different, depending on the needs of the client.  They are located in specially equipped rooms, most often basements.  Safe rooms are securely guarded with several armored doors and alarms. </p><p>  The security service of a financial institution imposes very strict requirements on citizens who wish to find themselves in a vault.  These conditions apply not only to customers who have rented a cell, but also to bank employees.  The latter must obtain special permission for this and present it upon request.  Visitors are allowed to visit the safe depository an unlimited number of times, but at any visit, the client must present a personal passport and put a mark in the visit log. </p><p>  There are two types of safes: with two sets of keys (one is stored at the client, the second at the bank branch) or with a combination lock (the character set is known only to the tenant).  When choosing the second one you will have to pay a lot more, but his level of protection is much higher. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="roinvest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank cell rental" class="if uuid-2504759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2504759.jpg"></div><h2>  Cell Terms </h2><p>  Any person has the right to use the bank cell of Sberbank, the only requirement is the presence of an identity document.  You can rent and use a safe only after signing an agreement with the bank.  This document can be of two types: </p><ol><li>  Lease agreement.  The text of the contract indicates that the financial institution does not have information about the contents of the box, but only provides a rental service. </li><li>  Storage agreement.  According to this document, Sberbank commits itself to preserving the values ‚Äã‚Äãin the safe.  For this, an employee of the organization draws up an inventory. </li></ol><p>  Bank cells from Sberbank for storing valuables are issued on the conditions specified in the agreement.  The tenant has the following options: </p><ol><li>  The choice of units where such services are provided.  You can find out the location of the representative offices on the official portal or by calling the hotline. </li><li>  Use the cell at any convenient time, but only during office hours on weekdays. </li><li>  The possibility of access to the safe depository of third parties with the client himself. </li><li>  Opening a cell by a trustee.  With him, he must have permission certified by a notary. </li><li>  If necessary, the banking institution may allocate equipment to verify the authenticity of the contents of the cell and the recount of bills. </li><li>  Independent choice of the duration of the lease of a bank cell. </li><li>  Ability to select the dimensions of the box. </li><li>  Confidentiality. </li><li>  Advanced security and fire fighting equipment. </li><li>  Modern banking equipment. </li><li>  The cell is opened in the presence of a bank employee.  He uses two types of keys for this: electronic and mechanical.  One of these items is in the hands of the client. </li><li>  The possibility of reducing the rental value subject to an agreement for a long time. </li><li>  Advantageous offers for regular customers. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.sandersteads.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank bank cells in Moscow" class="if uuid-2499866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45096/2499866.jpg"></div><h2>  Safe rental at Sberbank branch </h2><p>  In order to conclude an agreement, a potential client must provide a passport to the banking department.  Leasing a bank cell in a financial institution is carried out by the client on the basis of a user agreement, which records all the main points of the transaction, such as the box number, validity period and payment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After observing all the formalities, the lessee is issued: </p><ol><li>  Agreement. </li><li>  The key that will be stored with him. </li><li>  Card confirming the right to use the cell. </li></ol><h2>  How to get to the repository </h2><p>  To go to a bank cell in Sberbank, a visitor needs to: </p><ol><li>  Show the employee of the institution the key, card and passport. </li><li>  Wait until the system lock is turned off. </li><li>  Open the safe with a key. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.fakt.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank cell sberbank Price" class="if uuid-2499868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45096/2499868.jpg"></div><h2>  Auto Storage Service </h2><p>  You can use the latest banking equipment systems at almost any Sberbank office, with the exception of the Baikal and Northern divisions. </p><p>  Such branches of Sberbank with bank cells are a lot of armored drawers and an automated feed device that delivers the box directly to the window of the subscriber terminal.  The device is placed in a separate room where access is allowed only if there is a special magnetic card.  A safe delivery request is made by entering a PIN code. </p><h2>  Lease agreement </h2><p>  Between the tenant and the financial institution, two agreements are concluded: for the rental of a safe and for storage, in order to fully regulate all parties to the contract.  The main points of the document are: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Validity. </li><li>  The price of a bank cell in Sberbank (rent). </li><li>  Tariff for payment of services. </li></ol><p>  In addition, the text of the agreement spells out all the rights and obligations of the parties.  The main ones are the absolute liability of the banking institution and the need for the tenant to follow all the conditions for making payment and access to content. </p><p>  The agreement guarantees confidentiality of contents for other employees of the institution who are not authorized to participate in the transaction. </p><p>  Also, bank employees do not have data on the contents of safes stored in the Sberbank depository, with the exception of a number of force majeure circumstances (seizure of the tenant‚Äôs property, expiration of the lease term without subsequent action by the user within the number of days specified in the contract). </p><p>  The bank employee accompanying the client at the opening of the cell has the right to ask for a visual inspection of the item that causes suspicion in order to make sure that the list of values ‚Äã‚Äãallowed for storage is consistent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.globalhealthpolicyforum.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Depository" class="if uuid-2499870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45096/2499870.jpg"></div><h2>  What is taken into account when calculating the cost </h2><p>  The price of a bank cell in Sberbank (rent) depends on several important points: </p><ol><li>  The term of the agreement (the larger it is, the lower the cost will be). </li><li>  Dimensions of the safe (on the official portal there is a special plate with indication of sizes and other data). </li><li>  Quantity and type of key. </li><li>  The number of persons who have access to the cell. </li></ol><p>  Before concluding a lease, all details should be clarified and the conditions specified in the document should be followed subsequently.  In this case, there will be no questions to the client and all kinds of unforeseen situations. </p><h2>  Service cost </h2><p>  As noted earlier, the price depends on the dimensions of the safe and the duration of the lease.  For example, the amount for renting a box of 55 * 50 for a period of 1 to 30 days will be 166 rubles per day.  Using a safe of the same size, but for a period of 361 to 1096 days, will cost the client 82 rubles per day. </p><p>  The size of the commission increases by 2 thousand rubles for the use of a bank cell of Sberbank in settlements with real estate and other similar operations. </p><p>  The list of free services: </p><ol><li>  Operations with a proxy cell. </li><li>  Providing the bank with special devices (calculating machine, equipment for checking the authenticity of banknotes). </li><li>  Search for a safe at the request of the client. </li></ol><p>  The service fee is debited from the client account after signing the documents in one payment for the entire lease term.  In the case of an extension of the contract, the lessee is required to deposit the specified amount. </p><div class="photo" data-original="allbanks.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank branches with bank cells" class="if uuid-2504761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2504761.jpg"></div><h2>  For whom is this service relevant? </h2><p>  The service of renting a <span>depositary cell is</span> very popular among individuals, especially for those who are going to acquire real estate or to complete some other transaction. </p><p>  Renting a bank safe allows the buyer to reduce the risks associated with the registration of property.  The seller can be sure of receiving the full amount prescribed in the contract. </p><p>  In addition, citizens who want to be sure of the safety of their valuables and be able to pick them up at any convenient time are actively using the Sberbank banking cell rental service in Moscow.  At the same time, they are guaranteed complete secrecy, since even the bank branch employees themselves do not have information about the contents of the safe. </p><h2>  How to rent a cell for a property transaction </h2><p>  Sberbank provides citizens with a cell rental service to complete a real estate transaction or purchase and sale of an apartment.  The cost in this case will be from 23 to 145 rubles.  The size of the amount depends on several factors, on the period for which the agreement is drawn up, and on the dimensions of the box.  All of them are determined by the tenant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.maxpixel.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="depositary cell" class="if uuid-2499873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45096/2499873.jpg"></div><h2>  Real estate transaction </h2><p>  Renting a Sberbank bank cell when selling an apartment is a rational decision that will help you not become a victim of scammers.  The safe can only be opened in the presence of a bank employee.  To save money, it is recommended to choose a longer rental period, but it should be borne in mind that the minimum amount to be paid is 700 rubles for the entire period. </p><p>  Safe boxes of the following dimensions are available in Sberbank: </p><ol><li>  Width - from 30 to 65 cm. </li><li>  Length - from 4 to 60 cm. </li></ol><p>  There are several ways to pay rent: </p><ol><li>  At the bank cash desk. </li><li>  By transfer from a depositary account or bank card. </li><li>  By cashless payment. </li></ol><p>  After signing the contract, each party has a package of documents: </p><ol><li>  Agreement. </li><li>  Inventory and Act of transfer to use. </li><li>  Key. </li></ol><h2>  Features and Benefits </h2><p>  When making transactions of any type, accompanied by the exchange of cash bills and documents, renting a safe at Sberbank's depository will be a reasonable step.  This is explained by the presence of the following positive aspects: </p><ol><li>  Information about the contents of the cell is not disclosed to third parties. </li><li>  Only the tenant or his authorized representative has the right to open the box with values. </li><li>  The storage is equipped with video surveillance and a protective system around the clock, which guarantees a high level of security. </li><li>  Values ‚Äã‚Äãare reliably protected from technological disasters. </li><li>  The contents of the safe can be obtained at any time, as part of the work of a banking institution. </li><li>  Sberbank provides special equipment to verify the authenticity of banknotes. </li><li>  No security payments. </li><li>  The list of banking divisions that provide the safe deposit box service in Moscow and St. Petersburg is quite wide. </li><li>  The choice of conditions (contract duration and box dimensions) remains with the client. </li></ol><p>  From all of the above, it can be concluded that renting a bank safe helps people ensure reliability, preserve values ‚Äã‚Äãand at the same time be confident in confidentiality.  A lease of a bank cell in Sberbank is drawn up, as a rule, immediately after signing the preliminary property purchase and sale agreement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nur.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bank cell for settlements with real estate Sberbank" class="if uuid-2504760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2504760.jpg"></div><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  This storage of values ‚Äã‚Äãhas small flaws: </p><ol><li>  The funds contained in the box are not accumulated. </li><li>  The banking institution, under the terms of the agreement, is not responsible for the contents of the cell, that is, it is only responsible for the fact that it will not be opened.  To change this condition, it is necessary to conclude a special contract, which includes an appendix, an inventory, and an appraisal report.  If money is stored in a safe, then you can simply count it, but to assess the values ‚Äã‚Äãyou need to invite an expert.  Each autopsy is done again and confirmed. </li></ol><h2>  Why exactly Sberbank </h2><p>  This financial institution is the most popular and reliable institution of the entire banking system.  It occupies the main position in almost all indicators: the value of assets, capital, net profit and so on.  In addition, the study of reviews of a bank cell in Sberbank suggests that customers are attracted by the following points: </p><ol><li>  A large list of banking units providing this service.  Currently, in only one city of Moscow, there are more than 190 offices equipped with a safe depository. </li><li>  Ensuring a high level of security for the contents of the box  This is achieved through the use of advanced equipment and security systems. </li><li>  Data safety. </li><li>  The presence of a loyalty program for users of premium packages is Sberbank Premier (20% discount) and Sberbank First (30% discount). </li><li>  Possibility of joint ownership of the cell (up to four people). </li></ol><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  In general, customers who have tried this service are satisfied.  They are attracted by the reliability and accessibility of the process, but most often they rent cells for property transactions.  Few risk the risk of storing valuables in a bank safe on an ongoing basis, since there is a lot of information on the Internet about the loss of some products or money.  Everyone independently decides whether to take risks or not, but if you still decide on bank storage, then choose reliable and trusted banks, such as, for example, Sberbank. </p>
