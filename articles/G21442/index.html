Often he was invited to appear in films and television series, but not in banal melodramas, but in thrillers, dramas and detectives, where he could fully reveal his talents. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Among the best roles of Alexei Nesterov, Petrov‚Äôs role in the Justice series of the famous series Kulagin and Partners should be highlighted.
