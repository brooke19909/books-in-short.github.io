Real opinions of users about Modulbank</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The only Russian financial institution that works solely with small businesses is Module Bank.  Feedback from individual entrepreneurs suggests that many useful products are offered to facilitate their work.  For example, free bookkeeping, using any cards for employees' salaries, opening any current account from the phone, and much more.  Moreover, <span>‚ÄúModul-Bank‚Äù (reviews</span> mention this) willingly works even with the smallest business, its size does not matter.  His clients are both novice entrepreneurs and companies with dozens of employees.  The conditions that <span>Modul-Bank</span> presents to its customers <span>, reviews</span> are called acceptable. </p><h2>  Customers </h2><p>  Individual entrepreneurs are offered not only free bookkeeping, but also a tariff with no monthly fee, bank cards for cash and purchases, as well as tariffs with a percentage on the balance.  The work with larger companies, which is carried out by Module Bank, is very safe.  The reviews of the employees of these companies indicate the complete convenience that this service creates.  Firstly, the manager has a personal assistant, lawyer and accountant from the bank.  Deposits give out 9% per annum, and for employees the salary goes to any cards.  Currency control is carried out within two hours and is without fines.  All this provides Modulbank customers.  Feedback from individual entrepreneurs (individual entrepreneurs) suggests that working with this financial institution is pleasant and safe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="module bank reviews" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2023382.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Retail stores also often choose this particular bank for cooperation.  This is convenient, because payment cards are accepted as a means of payment for services, work, goods (that is, acquiring is carried out - mobile, commercial, and with the use of Internet resources).  The cash desk is equipped directly on the tablet.  In the event of a <span>cash gap</span> , <span>lending (overdraft) is</span> offered <span>.</span>  In cash discipline, accounting is provided by the bank.  According to a study by the Marxweb agency, in the ranking for the cost of all this service, Modulbank was in first place.  IP reviews note that such cooperation is beneficial.  For servicing legal entities, this bank occupies the second level of this rating.  High technologies and rather low costs allow the bank not to raise tariffs. </p><h2>  Bank Offices </h2><p>  There are few costs because the bank does not rent and does not build for itself a whole network of expensive offices, it does not have many branches, and therefore there is no rent or construction fee, you do not need to purchase furniture and other accessories for staff.  That is why customer service is cheaper than other banks.  And all the difference is deducted from the tariffs of Modulbank.  Reviews of legal entities indicate a very high level of computerization and automation of all work.  This with the help of programs is obtained not only almost accurately, but also cheaply.  The computer itself searches for errors in translations, and fills in the documents itself.  And all this leads to the fact that the staff is not inflated, which means that Modulbank is again in financial gain.  Responses of legal entities highly appreciate this method of work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The financial institution also does not contain extensive networks of its own ATMs, but uses partner networks: customers at virtually any ATM in the country can withdraw cash without any additional fees.  And therefore, <span>"Modulbank"</span> user <span>reviews</span> receive mostly grateful.  And if the client is dissatisfied with something on the bank‚Äôs website, if he has questions, then he receives answers quickly and to the point.  What is most attractive in such cooperation is the speed of service and the completeness of the proposals.  Not every bank can open an account to get their own team of employees, albeit partially virtual: a lawyer, accountant, personal assistant.  Almost all cases requiring professionalism are carried out by specialists instead of an entrepreneur.  A rare person knows how to do everything himself - to calculate taxes, draw up contracts, even fill out payments or look for candidates for vacancies.  Helps in this, and very effective, "Modulbank".  Customer reviews confirm this state of things. </p><h2>  More about pleasant </h2><p>  This bank answers customer calls immediately, without an answering machine.  In addition, they immediately react in chat rooms, Skype and social networks.  Questions are resolved quickly and with full attention to the user.  On average, an operator spends seven minutes per client.  But if the question is difficult, naturally, the time for its resolution increases.  The only good news for the client is that you don‚Äôt have to retell already voiced a hundred times, because the same person will deal with his problem, even if it takes an hour, two, or more.  In communicating with customers, bank employees have no officialdom, and they do not allow the use of special banking terms.  Without any statements and trips to the bank office, all services are connected, new accounts are opened, and currency is bought using the Internet.  The client carries out all operations in his personal account. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Not all customers know what API is (API).  And the only bank that fully uses this interface is Modulbank.  Reviews of services often talk about how convenient the application system is - ready-made classes, procedures, functions, structures, constants that are offered in the banking operating system.  A single software service is used in external products offered by the bank.  Thanks to this, the client can check account balances at any time, receive statements and the like, without even having to visit his personal account on the website of a financial institution.  Mobile applications and personal account, including updated monthly for speed and security.  Therefore, the entrance to the application is less than a second, and no one will be able to intercept the verification code. </p><h2>  About the possibility of cooperation </h2><p>  But all this does not mean that any person from the street can become a client of Modulbank.  This is not true.  Here, the legality and legal purity of each business will be thoroughly checked.  The bank works only with small businesses, and therefore does not invest resources in extraneous matters.  Here, risky loans are not issued to individuals or transnational corporations.  Existing products in the bank are sent only to small businesses.  All deposits, that is, all money on Modulbank accounts, are insured by the Deposit Insurance Agency, and therefore, if the account of an individual entrepreneur is less than 1,400,000 rubles, security is guaranteed.  Even if the license is revoked, the insurers will return it to the owner.  The main shareholder of Modulbank is Sovcombank, which has a 24% stake.  It is a strong and reliable financial institution, which gives even more stable trust to Modulbank depositors. </p><p>  Feedback from legal entities often raises the issue of deposit security.  It is very carefully monitored to ensure that the law is fully respected.  We are especially attentive to paragraphs that speak about countering money laundering (Article 115-FZ).  Therefore, the bank very clearly defines the business reputation of the client company, its financial situation, goals pursued in economic activities.  This is especially true for potential customers.  Details of the refusal will not be disclosed under any circumstances, but if the opening of the company account is denied, then there were good reasons. </p>

    <p>  Why without reason?  Because the bank does not have the right to disclose them, since this applies to measures that apply to unclean capital.  Sometimes an already opened account is blocked under the same pretext.  All documentation is checked - agreements with partners, tax returns, acts and everything that relates to this.  Moreover, the bank has the right to request any document at any time.  This, of course, creates some inconvenience to customers and threatens with the loss of potential users, but you can‚Äôt sacrifice the safety of other investors and the reputation of the bank.  And if a financial institution fulfills absolutely all the requirements of the Bank of Russia (Central Bank), then this is undoubtedly a plus.  This is how Modulbank works. </p><h2>  Is license revocation possible? </h2><p>  At the end of September 2017, any information about this is not true.  The Bank is not only active, but also successfully operating.  Therefore, the fears that Modulbank has a license revocation is possible and groundless.  People are afraid, because the past few years have been very generous with the deprivation of licenses of successful, seemingly, credit organizations with big names. </p><p>  In 2015, Modulbank also experienced some deviations from the standards, but they were not so deadly, and since then not only the slightest violation has not occurred, but the bank has strengthened its position in the financial market.  This financial institution fully complies with the standards of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, shows constant profits, and increases current funds invested by legal entities.  It should be noted that their growth is significant - 89.4%.  So, thinking now about revoking a license from Modulbank is an absolutely in vain exercise. </p><h2>  Internet acquiring at Modulbank </h2><p>  Reviews talk a lot about this service, and quite rarely users reject this system.  Usually indicated pluses.  Firstly, payment is made through the site, using social networks or even simply via the phone, that is, it works like a regular cash register, only electronic.  It stands on the site and receives money.  The bank does not take bribes for servicing, only for purchases - the established commission.  No purchases - free acquiring.  In your personal account, sales are calculated, statistics are collected, where everything is visible: how many and what customers appeared, what exactly they bought and when. </p>

    <p>  Information is updated with each new purchase, and therefore the seller can not be up to date with their sales.  He knows exactly what customers prefer, and therefore you can regulate purchases in favor of popular ones, come up with discounts and promotions and much more.  The possibilities of acquiring are very great.  Connecting is very simple - upon request.  Then, within three days, the client will receive a message about the result from Modulbank.  Employee reviews say that this service is very popular. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  Advantages of acquiring are highly appreciated.  It is very convenient for both customers and the store.  Money for the purchase appears on the account on the next day, including payments from abroad.  Purchases are paid anywhere - all over the world.  There is an acquirer bank for working with foreign payments, and the user only has to receive the money.  The bank account of Modulbank existing in the mobile application on the phone is mentioned especially often because it is difficult to imagine a more convenient way of working. </p><p>  Even when the owner is far from his laptop, he can control all income and expenses, send payments and receive them.  It‚Äôs as good as on the big screen, you can see all the basic information about the financial situation of the company: how much money is located and on what accounts, where it comes from, where it goes, and statistics can be viewed for the year, quarter, month, week and day.  Even if there is a need for cash, the mobile application at the location of the person will determine the nearest ATM, where commission fees are not required. </p><h2>  Personal account and much more </h2><p>  To open a current account for an individual entrepreneur at Modulbank, reviews suggest submitting an application and waiting for an answer.  It is not a fact that it will be positive, but if everything is fine with the reputation of the enterprise, the refusal is unlikely to follow.  Further, all procedures pass very quickly.  If questions arise, they can be asked directly in the chat, where <span>bank employees</span> will immediately give answers.  There you can ask employees to perform a particular service if you suddenly cannot perform any action yourself (for example, a client is in a traffic jam).  The mobile application allows you to send account details to partners, for this you can use e-mail, SMS or inform via messenger. </p>

    <p>  To work with Modulbank your personal account is enough, no additional programs are required.  The entrance is very simple, none of the options will cause labor or inconvenience.  If the company has several individual enterprises or LLC, all elements of its structure will be connected to the same personal account with all their separate accounts.  Access can be not only with the head, you can provide him with deputies, accountants and his assistants.  This will facilitate the work with bills, payments and the like.  There you can prepare documents for the director to sign.  But access can have completely different levels: you can only watch information, you can only work with payments, you can only transfer money. </p><h2>  Bookkeeping </h2><p>  Internet accounting is connected to an account in Modulbank.  It can be "My business", "Elba" or 1C.  Account statements will be executed automatically, in the same way accounting will calculate contributions and taxes, prepare payments without the slightest participation of the human factor in this process.  At any time, you can get an extract from your personal account in any format - csv, pdf, 1C or html.  Some payments, especially often recurring, can be placed in favorites to save time, you can also repeat any payment, even if it was last made many months ago.  All information is scrupulously stored in history, so you don‚Äôt have to fill out a payment again, unless you need to edit the purpose and amount of the payment. </p><p>  The Modulbank client can open accounts as many as you want, but this only applies to ruble accounts.  Often, judging by the reviews, this is necessary in order to pay for different services in different places.  For example, sales of sports equipment and staff training.  Convenience is also noted in the fact that notifications are sent simultaneously from the personal account at the same time as payment, therefore, payment partners can not worry if the notification is received that the money has already been withdrawn from the account.  You can always analyze the state of the company's finances, since statistics in your personal account, as already mentioned, shows any moment of activity and any period.  Therefore, an entrepreneur can draw up a schedule that shows how the growth in company revenue depends, for example, on the season.  In addition, the personal account analyzes all financial statistics on its own and sends a financial weekly report to the entrepreneur at the email address. </p><h2>  Some details </h2><p>  Feedback from Modulbank employees very often suggests that customers themselves offer to improve their personal account program, and their ideas are often used.  The previous version has undergone one hundred and thirty such changes, as customers have proposed very competent improvements.  As a result, we got the first place in the competition of the best banking programs (the founder is the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Russia), where they selected the best according to thirteen criteria.  If the phone has a fingerprint recognition function, then the Modulebank application will be let into your personal account in the same way.  This is convenient because quickly.  You can log in using a four-digit PIN code so that you do not remember long passwords and do not enter them for a long time.  Reviews about "Modulbank" talk about many interesting bonuses.  For example, with just one click from the application, you can send a link to a colleague and invite him to cooperate with the bank.  If this partner signs a contract with the bank, then both clients will receive a free service for a month. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="acquiring at modulebank reviews" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/2023380.jpg" width="478"></div>

    <p> The cost of servicing at Modulbank is the most favorable, judging by the rating.  The closest competitor takes exactly twice as much for this.  And the bank manages the money of depositors very carefully, the risks are minimal.  Invested only in the most reliable securities recommended by the Central Bank, even if their yield is not the highest, but the risk is low.  If banks have deposits with twelve percent per annum, they need high returns, which is why they take risks, providing profits by investing in the most highly profitable instruments.  There are no such deposits at Modulbank.  But safety is on top.  If an unusual payment appears on the customer‚Äôs account, the details are immediately specified by phone.  Having suspected fraud, the bank stops the payment, and the personal account blocks, so that fraudsters could not harm the client's deposits. </p>
