Many visitors prefer to stay in mini-hotels.  But if you want to not only relax near the sea, but also comprehensively improve your health, then you need to buy a ticket to one of the resort's resorts.  There you will receive a bronze tan on your own hospital beach, and undergo a course of procedures.  In this article we will talk about a unique place.  It is called the FSBI Office of the President of the Russian Federation "Sochi Sanatorium". </p><p>  It sounds long, ornate and confusing.  Therefore, here we will reduce its name to the sanatorium "Sochi".  Why "united"?  Because this Federal State Budgetary Institution has several buildings with its receptions and administration.  Thus, you can buy a ticket to a certain part of the health resort.  And in this article we will consider the living conditions in the Primorsky building of the Sochi sanatorium.  Photos, reviews about the rest, a description of the rooms, infrastructure and medical facilities you will find below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mir-hotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bar of the Primorsky building of the Sochi sanatorium" class="if uuid-3234151" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3234151.jpg"></div><h2>  Where is the health resort located </h2><p>  "Big Sochi" stretched a hundred kilometers along the Black Sea coast.  The resort is divided into districts, and the most attractive for tourists is ‚ÄúCentral‚Äù.  Most entertainment venues are concentrated in it.  Also in the center of Sochi beautiful buildings of the times of the Russian Empire have been preserved.  There is a train station and a market.  Many Russians have heard the Riviera Park.  So, this amazing vacation spot adjoins the territory of the Sochi sanatorium.  As for the sea, it is also located a few tens of meters.  We will tell you more about the beach later.  In the meantime, let's talk about the namesake of our corps. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When taking a taxi from the airport or train station, you must clearly indicate the address.  It often happens that drivers deliver tourists to the Primorsky building of the Belarus sanatorium (Sochi).  Pictures of the beach and the high-rise building are really very similar.  But the sanatorium of the Russian president is located on Vinogradnaya street, 27, and the property of the head of Belarus is in the same Central District of Sochi, but on ul.  Polytechnic, 62. It will be enough to tell the taxi driver that you need the Riviera park.  The health resort, as mentioned above, adjoins it. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="43.597798" data-lng="39.715134000000035" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/8/5/1/17851.png"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  The Sochi Joint Sanatorium is located in the middle of its own park.  Its territory is truly huge - as much as 30 hectares!  A park of gardeners carefully monitors the park.  It is planted with Mediterranean evergreen trees and shrubs.  In addition, landscape design specialists are trying to ensure that the entire territory of the health resort becomes a wonderful backdrop for colorful photos.  Sanatorium "Primorsky" (Sochi) is only one part of the FSBI.  The name of this case is not accidental.  The building of 11 floors rises literally on the beach.  It should be said that for a long time this building was closed for reconstruction.  And just recently, he again received the first guests. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to the "Primorsky", in the health resort there is another building - "Sochi".  If the sign of the first building means ‚Äú4 *‚Äù, then the second is decorated with five stars.  This is a real four-story palace, with balustrades and spiral staircases, erected in the style of "Stalin's Empire".  There is a fountain in front of this building - a wonderful background for photographing.  The so-called "Summer Cottages" are hiding in the park.  These are separate cottages to accommodate VIP guests.  In addition to the housing stock, the territory of the joint sanatorium has a medical building, a sports complex, a tennis court, volleyball and playgrounds, and even its own museum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turbaza.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanatorium &quot;Sochi&quot; - territory" class="if uuid-3234155" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3234155.jpg"></div><h2>  Sanatorium "Sochi", the building "Primorsky": rooms </h2><p>  The four-star hotel can accommodate 600 people at a time.

All rooms for guests have their own bathroom and a balcony. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  And what about the rooms? </h2><p>  To better imagine the luxury and comfort that the guests of the Primorsky building of the Sochi sanatorium (Sochi) are surrounded by, let's look at what is in the simplest category - economy.

But the breakfasts in the sanatorium are good.  There are boiled eggs and sausages, oatmeal, yogurt. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  According to tourists in the reviews, the Primorsky building of the Sochi sanatorium is closest to the sea, on the first line.
