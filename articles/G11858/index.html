Almost everyone has them, and you won‚Äôt surprise anyone.  Although not so long ago, about 15 years ago, not all could boast of such devices.  Phones were expensive, their functionality compared to the modern one was ridiculously small, and the connection itself was expensive.  But gradually everything changed, mobile phones became available and people used to always be in touch. </p><p>  However, even if you are the owner of an unlimited tariff, it may still sometimes be necessary to urgently replenish the balance of the room, and payment terminals and communication salons are not everywhere.  In this case, the Internet comes to the rescue, through which you can top up your account.  By the way, almost everything can be paid through it now, from loans to utilities.  So <span>how to put money on the phone via the Internet?</span>  And what you need to do?  This we will understand. </p><h2>  Security </h2>

    <p>  In order to replenish a mobile phone account via the Internet, you need to have certain things - access to the Internet and a bank card or another electronic account, suitable for paying for services on the Internet with a positive balance.  If all this is available, then you can easily put money on the phone through the Internet.  However, it is worth remembering that, like any financial transactions, these payments can only be made on the official services of providers or inside the offices of other electronic payment systems, otherwise there is a risk of becoming a victim of scammers and displaying your credit card details. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Payment </h2>

    <p>  To put money on the phone via the Internet, for example, you can use the provider's sites.  Almost all of them support payment via the Internet, and to make it you need to go to the operator‚Äôs website and find the appropriate section.  Next, you will be asked to fill in the details - phone number, <span>payment method</span> , etc. </p><p>  For example, in order to replenish an MTS account via the Internet, you need to select the ‚ÄúFinancial services and payments‚Äù section on the operator‚Äôs website, then ‚ÄúTop up your account‚Äù and additionally select a method (and several of them).  You can do this with a credit card or with another mobile phone number. </p><p>  Depending on the type selected, you will need to fill in the data, and after that the funds will be debited from the indicated account.  So now we know how to fund your MTS account online. </p><h2>  The big three </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recharge a megaphone account via the Internet" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1255062.jpg" width="490"></div></h2><p>  The so-called Big Three, MTS, Megafon and Beeline, have firmly strengthened in the Russian mobile communications market for more than a decade.  They are not the only providers - there are some in their own regions, and recently Tele2 and Yota are also gaining popularity - but still, most of the market is behind them.  Therefore, we will analyze how to fund a Megafon account via the Internet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To do this, go to his official website, select ‚ÄúPayment‚Äù, then - ‚ÄúTop up balance‚Äù and select the desired system (bank card or some kind of electronic wallet).  As you can see, nothing complicated. </p><p>  But it is worth noting that when paying with a card, it must support electronic payments on the Internet.  But what if there is no such card, but you still need to replenish the account?  In this case, various <span>e-wallets</span> come to the rescue <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Electronic payment systems </h2>

    <p>  Every year, such systems are developing more and more, and if before people trusted them a little, now the vast majority are actively using them, and not only those who want to make a purchase on the Internet, but even businessmen and entrepreneurs.  This is due to the simplicity of opening an account.  For example, a Qiwi wallet only needs a mobile phone number, which in the future will be an identifier.  So you can top up your phone account over the Internet in various ways. </p><p>  Despite the difference in payment systems, almost all of them operate according to a single principle - you need to log in to your personal account, then find the necessary operator in the possible payment lists and indicate the number with the amount.  In Russia, Yandex.Money, Qiwi and Webmoney are the most popular. </p><p>  It is very convenient to pay for something via the Internet, as the need for it can arise at any time when banks or shops have long been closed.  In addition, every year the number of different purchases through the network is also growing. </p><p>  But the most important thing is that you always need to remember about security.  Payment system employees will never ask for passwords with logins, or the number of a special SMS message to confirm the operation.  Also, all payment and purchase need to be made only on official and reliable sites.  And when installing a mobile application on the phone, it must be protected by antivirus. </p>
