The form of the pyramid from ancient times was endowed with an extraordinary effect on objects inside it.  The shape effect, which formed the basis of the Hunger construction, was studied for a long time, and the proportions of the <span>Golden Section</span> used in the calculations should have given a fantastic result.  A stake was made on the interaction of form and space, which were supposed to remove the negative impact of phenomena common in modern reality.  Having lost sight of global problems, such as conflicts and wars, epidemics and rampant crime, natural disasters and social tension, the engineer wanted to positively influence space and events by erecting a pyramid, bringing peace and harmony to the surrounding reality.
