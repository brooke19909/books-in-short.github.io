    <h2>  St. Peter's Castle </h2><p>  It was built in the fifteenth century.  Building material - green granite.  He was brought from the western part of Bodrum.  In ancient times, the castle served as the seat of fifty knights and one hundred and fifty ordinary soldiers.  Their task was to defend the village.  The fortress is distinguished by thick double walls.  It has several towers - Italian, German, English and French.  The latter is the highest - 47.5 m. The walls of the structure are covered with evergreens.  In addition, knight's arms are preserved on <span>green granite</span> . </p><p>  The castle was officially recognized by the museum in 1960.  You can get into it through a long wooden suspension bridge.  The Museum of Underwater Archeology is open on the territory of the fortress and a rich collection of sarcophagi is presented. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Amphitheater </h2><p>  What else is interesting in <span>Bodrum?</span>  <span>The</span> resort's <span>attractions</span> allow you to get acquainted with the most ancient monuments of architecture.  So, the Hellenistic amphitheater was erected as early as three hundred years before our era.  Its capacity at that time was considered simply huge - 13 thousand people.  The steps of this unique structure were hollowed out right on the slope and faced with marble.  The best preserved to this day is the lower tier.  As for the upper ranks, they were seriously affected by earthquakes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Bodrum" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/471206.jpg" width="466"></div>

    <p>  The scene is in the southern part of the theater.  This is a two-story structure in the shape of a rectangle.  In 1973, the oldest architectural monument acquired the status of a museum.  This happened after excavations were carried out on its territory.  Not so long ago, Turkcell and Ericsson specialists completed work on a joint restoration project.  Many travelers who come to Bodrum seek to see this place.  Sights of the resort have long attracted lovers of antiquity.  Thanks to the stories of experienced guides, walks in memorable places will become even more informative and interesting. </p><h2>  Mindos Gate </h2><p>  In ancient times, they served as the entrance to the city from the west.  Initially, three towers towered above the gate, and a fifteen-meter ditch was dug in front of them.  At one time, <span>Alexander the Great</span> tried to pass through the Mindos Gate <span>.</span>  This ruler was very interested in Turkey.  Bodrum was not fortified enough to resist a powerful army for a long time.  As a result, the soldiers of Macedon broke through the fortification and mercilessly dared everything in their path.  During modern archaeological excavations near the gates, it was possible to find the burial places of the Romans and Greeks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bodrum Sea" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/471207.jpg" width="466"></div>

Nevertheless, today tourists can see only the ruins of a once magnificent structure.  Local authorities took this facility under their care.  Minor <span>restoration work is</span> carried out as needed. </p><h2>  Mausoleum </h2><p>  The impressive marble tomb of Tsar Mavsol in Helicarnassus (formerly called Bodrum) has no equal in the whole world.  The uniqueness of the mausoleum lies in the fact that this is the only building of the Seven Wonders of the World, fragments of which have survived to this day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bodrum map" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/471204.jpg" width="466"></div>  This construction began to be erected shortly before the death of the king (he went to another world in 353 BC).  <span>Turkey (Bodrum</span> including) has not yet seen such a large-scale and luxurious project.  Many ancient authors describe the mausoleum as a huge tombstone made of white marble with ionic columns.  The dimensions of the building are also impressive: the perimeter is 30 by 40 m, the height is 45 m. The tomb had two floors, they were crowned with thirty-six columns.  The ashes of the royal people were stored in golden urns.  At the entrance to the mausoleum were large stone lions. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bodrum beaches" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/471205.jpg" width="380"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The monumental building was destroyed by the 1304 earthquake.  In the sixteenth century, fragments of the mausoleum were taken out by the Knights-Johnnites for the construction of St. Peter's Castle.  The first excavations at the site of the ancient tomb started in 1850.  They were led by Charles Newton, an archaeologist from England. </p><h2>  Gyokova Bay </h2><p>  This bay with its cozy bays, wooded islands and beautiful beaches is called the treasure of Turkey.  From Bodrum, tourists can go on a multi-day cruise on the Gokova on a yacht.  One of the most interesting stopping points is Cleopatra Island.  On it is a beach covered with unusual sand, as if consisting of millions of pearls. </p><h2>  Kara Ada </h2><p>  This picturesque island is located six kilometers from Bodrum.  It is popular mainly due to its hot springs.  The healing properties of local mud and water are confirmed by doctors.  People come to Kara Ada who want to get rid of skin ailments, arthritis or radiculitis.  There is a legend that Queen Cleopatra retained her beauty and youth thanks to the amazing <span>mud of the Black</span> Island. </p><h2>  Dademan </h2><p>  Are you interested in not only excursions, but also entertainment?  Go to Bodrum!  The water park in this resort city is the largest in Turkey.  Twenty-four water slides are installed on its territory and a man-made river flows more than three hundred meters long.  Anyone can swim in the numerous pools with and without waves, soak in the jacuzzi or stand under the waterfall. </p><p>  The water park is equipped with a sufficient number of sunbeds.  On its territory there are three restaurants and a bar.  In the evening, ‚ÄúDademan‚Äù organizes upscale discos.  Twenty euros are taken from adults for admission, eleven from children.  The water park is open daily from May to October from half past ten in the morning to five in the evening.  It is located near the shopping center Metro. </p><h2>  Bodrum beaches </h2><p>  The terrain on which the city stands is hilly and rocky.  For this reason, you should not count on wide sandy beaches.  Most of them are pebble.  Some beaches were created artificially.  To do this, a sufficient amount of sand was poured on the pontoons.  One of the main difficulties is that you have to overcome the difficult path along the steep stairs to the beaches.  Only youth, who make up the bulk of vacationers, do not pay attention to this. </p>
