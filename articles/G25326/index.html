You can personally visit the bank branch, as well as use an ATM or a special terminal. </p><p>  To pay for Tricolor TV with a credit card or other convenient method, you need to find out the receiver‚Äôs ID code.  It consists of 12 or 14 numbers.  It can be found in the contract, in the equipment settings menu or in your account on the company's official portal.  This digital code will need to be entered during the payment process, and regardless of the chosen method. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sberbankin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="payment by tricolor by credit card" class="if uuid-2486301" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/70192/2486301.jpg"></div><h2>  Credit card payment </h2><p>  You can pay for services with a plastic card, which was issued by one of the banks in Russia.
