The device cannot boast prohibitively high technical characteristics, in comparison even with its direct and closest competitors.  Nevertheless, the device managed to occupy a favorable position in the market, and it gained really impressive popularity.  This suggests that there is something enchanting in this once new smartphone market.  Well, if so, let's take a look at the smartphone in detail.  So get to know Sony Xperia Go. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  Today we will not do as usual.  We will not give technical specifications at the beginning, but we will do it at the end of the review in order to draw a line under everything that will be said.  But first things first.  What do we have in this case?  Before us lies the Sony Xperia GO ST27I.  The diagonal of the screen is 3.5 inches, as in the good old fourth iPhone.  Resolution especially does not pamper users, just something 480 by 320 pixels.  I would like to note that with such a budget we have fairly good viewing angles.  In parallel, a good margin of brightness can be noted so that you can read the text in sunlight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, users speak out for the fact that for its class the device has not only a good screen, but, it can be said, an optimal one.  By the way, a special coating is applied to the display.  It makes it possible to work with it even if there is water on the screen itself.  This is useful to those people who often work with smartphones with wet hands.  So to speak, very impatient people.  A great solution for regular use near the sea.  Interestingly, this model stands out from its segment through the use of <span>mineral glass.</span>  For a state employee this is unusual. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2>

    <p>  Sometimes there are cases when the Sony ST27I does not turn on.  In part, this problem is connected with the hardware of the device.  But what is it here?  Immediately make a reservation: on board the smartphone there is an operating system of the Android family.  Its version is 2.3.7.  A number of changes have been made to the shell.  Specialists of the Japanese company worked on them.  The changes affected the design, as well as the interface as a whole.  And now from general words to specific names. </p><h2>  CPU </h2>

    <p>  As a chipset, the NovaThor U8500 fixture is installed.  It works with two cores of the Cortex A9 generation.  The clock frequency of the processor cores is one gigahertz.  The amount of RAM is small - only 512 MB.  As we can see, everything here is within the framework of budget rules.  Another thing is preinstalled software.  This is really a reason for a separate discussion. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Lockscreen </h2>

    <p>  A well-designed lock slider.  When using the Sony Xperia ST27I, you will have to make long movements.  Having left to right, we can unlock the device from the screen.  If we draw from right to left, then activate the camera.  At the bottom, by default, four icons are located at once.  How are they represented?  The first icon is a folder with additional programs.  They can be used by people leading an active lifestyle.  The second is the transition to the company store.  The third is to open the text message menu.  Fourth - to open the menu with calls. </p><h2>  Features </h2>

    <p>  It should be noted that there are branded floating wallpapers here.  They are pretty enough.  By default, they are blue.  However, the user has the right to decide what shade they should be.  The range of active programs is represented by a compass, speedometer, FigureRunner utility, a program for using the flash as a flashlight, and another utility from Adidas.  It is intended for training.  What awaits us besides this software? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Additional programs and widgets </h2>

    <p>  There are not so few of them in the Sony ST27i.  For example, there is a widget that allows you to control wireless interfaces, as well as change the brightness level, activate flight mode, enable and disable navigation and other similar functions.  Its appearance is quite good, the Japanese worked on this, as they say, to fame. </p><p>  The second widget allows you to see what weather awaits us, not only today, but tomorrow, as well as the entire next week.  Perhaps an hourly break to view the most accurate weather forecast.  By default, there is help, which is periodically displayed on the screen.  It contains tips that allow the owner of the phone to optimize its work through the use of chips with the battery.  Help, in general, will be useful for people who have just begun to master the operating system of the Android family. </p><h2>  Do I need a news feed? </h2>

    <p>  Sony ST27I, the characteristics of which we will give in this article, is equipped with a program called TimeEscape.  It displays a tape of actions of users whom the owner of the phone previously added as a friend.  To be honest, there is no practical sense from this utility as such.  Nevertheless, certain categories of users may well be interested in it.  The program Music Unlimited will not only allow you to listen to music, but also download it to your device.  In terms of watching the video, it is useless.  Which, by the way, can already be understood from the name of the application. </p><h2>  Form style </h2><p>  I would also like to talk about the music player, since we got to this topic.  It is decorated in the best traditions of a Japanese company.  Using the interface, files can be quickly transferred, as well as transferred to a playlist, where the user has the right to add the necessary tracks or compositions. </p><p>  If the buyer understands <span>the equalizer settings,</span> then he will be able to please himself with high-quality and surround sound, since the equalizer itself is present in the settings of the multimedia player built into this unit.  Using a special add-on, you can increase the speaker volume.  This is a very useful add-on because the speakers themselves cannot be called loud.  Rather, it is more about colloquial.  We can say that the conversational speaker with the quality of voice transmission of the interlocutor is doing well. </p><p>  A service called Unlimited, which is built into the multimedia player, allows you to find information about the artist of the currently playing song.  Information will be found using third-party services such as YouTube or Wikipedia.  Sony Xperia Go ST27i, whose specifications will be given at the end of today's review, is well suited for listening to music.  In this area, among the analogues of the budget segment, it is probably the leader.  Actually, that's why the smartphone was presented as a youth solution.  You can buy this model for 7 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Social Media Engagement </h2><p>  There is a pre-installed FaceBook application.  There you can share the songs you listen to.  Perhaps this is again one of the factors that was applied in order to show that this model is a youth decision. </p><p>  Tired of music?  No problem!  You can use an analog radio.  The list is quickly selected, it can be edited manually.  The radio is also designed in a Sony style.  To determine the music that plays, for example, in a cafe, you can use a program traditional for a Japanese developer called TrackID.  It works smartly, almost without delay, for which the Japanese can say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù. </p><p>  Not very functional, but really beautiful is the clock widget.  Accessory management is done using a program called LiveWare.  Customization is additionally represented by our own wallpapers and themes, and this is one of the strengths of this model. </p><h2>  Photographic features </h2><p>  It is unlikely that much can be said about the device‚Äôs camera.  However, we can go through the reference points.  First of all, it should be noted that, of course, one does not have to expect a miracle from this model.  The quality here is average.  Even if the pictures are taken under normal lighting conditions, it remains to be desired.  Yes, the main module has a resolution of five megapixels.  But something is not clear, either there are problems with the processing algorithm, or the optics are of poor quality, but still the pictures even of this resolution do not particularly correspond. </p><h2>  There is no silver lining </h2><p>  What saves the situation?  Probably a whole range of built-in effects from the company.  The simplest are 3D panoramas.  The coolest - face definition.  Auto focus on the subject is present, works at medium speed.  Digital zoom can be used, but should not be disappointed.  This is done through the volume buttons.  When shooting a video, the image stabilizes.  Striking results are produced by shooting clips.  Unlike photos, the videos are high quality, they can be shot in HD quality.  Why the Japanese this time focused on shooting video is not clear.  It would be better if they finalized and the creation of photographs, too. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The developer himself said that in the second generation networks, the smartphone will be able to work for six and a half hours, in 3G mode - an hour less.  Music can be played for 45 hours.  However, in order to soberly evaluate such indicators and analyze the situation, we recall that we have an Android operating system on board and take a look at the lithium-ion battery.  It has a capacity of 1305 milliamperes per hour.  The battery, by the way, is built into the smartphone itself, you cannot replace it manually.  With such a small capacity, you immediately start to think that the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù will drop off the device by noon.  However, it turns out that even when used with activity above average, ‚ÄúSonya‚Äù can live until the evening.  The result was surprisingly surprising, and in a pleasant way.  The device is charged from zero to one hundred percent in about two hours. </p><h2>  Sony Xperia Go ST27I: specifications and reviews </h2><p>  So, it's time to talk briefly about what characteristics this model has.  The Sony ST27I phone has a screen with a diagonal of 3.5 inches with a <span>resolution of</span> 320 by 480 pixels.  The camera has a resolution of five megapixels.  There is protection against moisture and dust standard IP67.  A processor on two cores operating at a clock frequency of 1 GHz.  The amount of RAM is 512 MB.  The version of the operating system is ‚ÄúAndroid 2.3‚Äù.  You can upgrade to 4.0. </p><p>  What do customers say about this unit?  In terms of use for ‚Äúgatherings‚Äù on social networks, this is a good device.  It will be interesting to those who regularly use the device to listen to music.  However, users in the reviews complain about poor performance (and what to expect with such a processor and memory size?) And a weak camera.  If you are going to take high-quality pictures in order to share them on social networks or other places, you will have to look for a better analogue. </p>
