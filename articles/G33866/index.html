Metro station closest to the zoo, how to get to the zoo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Zoos have long been popular all over the world, only here you can live see exotic animals, watch them, take pictures.  Children who are now growing up rarely see even representatives of the local flora and fauna, because in the urban jungle there is no place for animals.  Under the current conditions, in order to familiarize the child with the living world, give him some knowledge, and just make a pleasant walk, you can go to the zoo.  They are found in large cities and capitals.  There is a large zoo in Moscow. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The Moscow Zoo was opened in 1864, and, notably, has not changed its location since then.  At the time of the discovery, then still a zoo, there were more than 300 animals, most of them were specimens found on the territory of the Russian Empire.  For many years, the Moscow Zoo combined the functions of a garden, a nursery and a scientific center.  He worked even during the Great Patriotic War, as if cheering the townspeople.  In the late 90's, after the <span>collapse of the USSR, the</span> zoo was repaired, and relations with colleagues from other countries were again established. </p><h2>  Zoo area </h2><p>  Are you curious where is the Moscow Zoo?  It is located in the Central Administrative District of Moscow, a 40-minute walk from the very center, <span>Red Square.</span>  The zoo belongs to the Presnensky district, which was once called Krasnopresnensky.  The area is well developed.  If earlier it could be called industrial, now it is a business center.  Despite the presence in the immediate vicinity of such objects as the Government House and the Planetarium, it is the architecture and idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe zoo that sets the tone for this section of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Location and metro stations </h2><p>  Moscow Zoo Address - ul.  Bolshaya Gruzinskaya, 1, but, as is customary in Moscow, it will be more important to know how to reach your destination.  Visitors are free to choose their own route to the Moscow Zoo.  <span>Krasnopresnenskaya metro station</span> is the nearest point, it is most convenient to go from it.  It belongs to the ring (brown) branch.  In order to get to the main entrance of the zoo, you only need to go to the surface, cross the road through the <span>underpass</span> and turn around the corner.  The entrance to the zoo resembles a fairytale castle with a turret and a fortified wall, so you definitely won‚Äôt be mistaken. </p><p>  It happens that it‚Äôs more convenient to go along another branch, but I want to get to the Moscow Zoo on time.  The metro station "Barrikadnaya" in this case is also perfect.  To pass here from the exit, which, by the way, is only one, you need a little more, but the journey will take about two minutes.  ‚ÄúBarrikadnaya‚Äù is a stop of the violet branch, from it you can get to ‚ÄúKrasnopresnenskaya‚Äù through the transition between stations, located in the center of the hall.  Violet ("Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya") on its way communicates with green, red, orange and <span>yellow branches,</span> which will help to take the metro to the zoo with a minimum of transfers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Hiking trails </h2><p>  Of course, in good weather, especially in summer, I want not to sit in a stuffy subway car, but to take a walk along the way to the Moscow Zoo.  The Belorusskaya metro station of the green line or the 1905 Street of Violet is perfect for this purpose.  From these stations you can walk to the zoo almost in a straight line in just 15 minutes.  At the metro station "Ulitsa 1905 goda" you need to get out of the last carriage from the center, cross the road and go straight along Krasnaya Presnya Street.  In the case of Belorusskaya, it‚Äôs better to immediately go out onto Bolshaya Gruzinskaya Street and follow it. </p><p>  If you wish, you can walk to the zoo from Pushkinskaya, for this you need to follow the boulevard to Malaya Nikitskaya street, then turn onto it and go to Sadovo-Kudrinskaya.  There you need to go through the underpass and go straight past the exit of the Barrikadnaya station. </p><p>  You can also get from Arbatskaya.  To do this, it is better to immediately turn in the direction of the ring, then go along it in the direction of Krasnopresnenskaya skyscraper, then go past it through a small park, and then, turning, straight to the main entrance. </p><p>  Pensioners, families with small children and people with disabilities should know not only the walking route, but also how to get to the Moscow Zoo, because sometimes even one or two bus stops can significantly ease physical activity. </p>

    <h2>  For those who live nearby </h2><p>  Those who live in the center will find it even easier to visit the Moscow Zoo.  How to get, tell almost any passerby.  Geographically, the main entrance is located at the intersection of Krasnaya Presnya and Bolshaya Gruzinskaya streets, not far from the Stalin skyscraper and the Garden Ring.  If you go straight along the ring towards Arbat, you can go to the zoo through an additional entrance, however, in this case, it is worthwhile to specify the <span>schedule of the</span> ticket offices in advance. </p><p>  Fans of surface public transport may need information on how to get to the Moscow Zoo by public transport.  Krasnopresnenskaya metro station is the final stop for buses No. 4, 12, 69, 152, 850, 869. Bus No. 116 will take you from Fili station to Belorusskaya. </p><p>  It is also important for motorists to know how to get to the Moscow Zoo.  Of course, many now use <span>navigation systems,</span> but sometimes the route can be quite clear without special equipment.  The traffic on Bolshaya Gruzinskaya street is two-way, as well as on Krasnaya Presnya, which allows you not to travel far around the area in order to make a U-turn.  On one side of the zoo, parallel to Bolshaya Gruzinskaya, is Volkov Lane, where you can stop for a short time.  Parking a car is recommended at nearby cafes and restaurants, as, alas, there is no parking at the zoo. </p>

    <p>  Ticket offices are located at the main entrance and at the gates on Sadovo-Kudrinskaya.  Additional ticket offices for visiting individual exhibits are located at the zoo.  It consists of the so-called old, historical, part and new.  Between these sections lies Bolshaya Gruzinskaya Street.  These parts are connected by a special bridge, which is located above the roadway.  Around the perimeter, the zoo is fenced. </p>

Not far from the Krasnopresnenskaya metro station is the Nightingale Cinema Center, which will combine relaxation at the zoo with going to the cinema.  Catering facilities such as MuMu, Burger King, ToDaSe, as well as small grocery stores are within a 5-minute walk.  You will always have a place to buy candy or ice cream for your child, so do not be afraid to explore the nearby space.  For those who are still afraid to get lost on the way to the Moscow Zoo, the nearest metro station will be the best guide.  Also inside the zoo there are relaxation areas where sweets and toys are sold.  Enjoy your holiday! </p>
