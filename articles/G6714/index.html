While some users claim that this is perhaps the best way to make easy money in the world, others are firmly convinced that this is only a divorce.  Many complain that they earn money, and when they send applications for withdrawal of funds, they freeze and are not processed for months.  At the same time, it is not clear: are these reviews about the BitOpt24 project real, or is it written by competitors who want to lure potential users.  We‚Äôll try to figure out for ourselves what is true and what is not. </p>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  The system began its work relatively recently, and heated discussions related to it in the Russian Internet sector can be observed since the end of 2015.  Reviews about BitOpt24.net, a project that offers to make money on binary options, boil down to one thing - on paper, the resource promises a lot of money, but really only a small percentage of players get money (if you believe the information from the forums). </p><p>  But if you believe the statement of the resource itself, profit is guaranteed in 100% of cases.  It would seem difficult to believe that this is possible in practice, but people really believe that there are well-wishers who are ready to offer them a method of earning without the slightest risk, with high profitability with minimal labor.  And when payment problems begin, reviews of BitOpt24 on the Web become negative. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Broker or not? </h2><p>  The resource works in a rather non-obvious format.  Typically, brokerage companies offer earnings through binary options, but this site does not have broker status.  You can not call it a full-fledged official signaling service.  That is, the situation is unstable, which is what the authors of BitOpt24.com reviews pay attention to.  At the same time, such legal status gives the resource quite a lot of freedom with minimal responsibility. </p>

    <p>  The reviews of BitOpt24.com allow us to conclude that the company works as a kind of analogue of a trusted direction (or PAMM).  The client has the money that he transfers to the company.  If you believe the information declared by the resource, the project traders are extremely successful, that is, such trust management will benefit the client.  But feedback on BitOpt24 payouts.  com clearly indicate that everything is not as rosy as it is written in the official position of the company. </p><h2>  What if it works? </h2><p>  The system of work chosen by the company is of certain interest, but experienced market players advise not to translate it into a practical direction, but only to study how the company works from the outside.  Why?  Too high a chance to stay, as they say, without the last penny.  This is also hinted at by BitOpt24 payout reviews.  com, or rather, about their absence. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Why is this happening this way?  Yes, just a system, despite all its curiosity, is actually ineffective.  That is, you can make money on it, but only if you are the creator of the project. </p><h2>  Official information </h2><p>  Experts recommend trusting your money only to such a company, on whose website you can find complete information about the company.  But pay attention to the reviews about BitOpt24: there are no participants among those who would see a full official statement describing what the organization is doing and what opportunities it offers its users.  Such secrecy is the first reason to be suspicious. </p>

    <p>  Reviews of BitOpt24 meticulous and attentive people contain quite a lot of interesting data about what the project is doing.  But they learned this by carefully studying all sections of the site.  That is, data needs to be collected here and there, and the project owners do not help in this.  Responsible companies that do not hide anything about their work do not publish information in this way, this contradicts business ethics.  And besides, it rightly raises numerous suspicions - is it worth it to believe such a secretive organization? </p><h2>  And how does it work? </h2><p>  Reviews of BitOpt24 on the Internet are mostly negative.  This is largely due to the fact that the data on the site is not enough so that users understand well by what principle money can be earned. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  So, the logic is as follows.  A trader from the project is given 10 US dollars.  A project participant can transfer his money to other traders so that they multiply them through trade.  The participant makes a decision in favor of the asset, selects a manager, for which he receives a certain percentage of the total financial transactions.  It is permissible to invest no more than a dollar in trade at a time. </p><h2>  A chance to develop: is there? </h2><p>  The project sets the boundary value for the number of successful operations.  If a participant reaches this limit, then he will be allowed to invest large amounts in trading.  But this is not all: only those who bring referrals, that is, new active users, can expand the boundaries of trade.  Of course, reviews of BitOpt24 evaluate this requirement extremely negatively - it reminds too much of the dubious pyramids that snapped back in the turbulent 90s. </p>

    <p>  However, this non-standard system is rather strange for a binary options broker.  Before the appearance of the described site in RuNet there were no such resources where, it would seem, the essence of the work is trading, playing on options, but in fact the owners of the site create a kind of pyramid. </p><h2>  How it works? </h2><p>  For a new project participant, it all starts with registration.  At the same time, the user is allocated $ 10 to get started.  Funds are used in the trading process.  Surprisingly, the operations of entering finance seem to be like no.  That is, the site seems categorically illogical: the project is commercial, allows you to earn money, but does not ask for money.  But this does not happen! </p><p>  So, there are 10 dollars, and there will be no more.  They need to earn money on them.  The initial lot is worth a dollar.  In such conditions, any modern person will suspect a fraud, which, of course, does not stimulate him to continue acquaintance with the system. </p><h2>  Quick reference </h2><p>  The financial market is a platform for making a profit through investing in instruments.  You invest money - you get a large amount.  Unless, of course, invested successfully.  Otherwise, you lose part of the amount or all invested completely. </p>

    <p>  In fact, work in the financial market always begins first with an investment in the project, and only after that the work itself begins.  But for what can one who has not invested anything in the project receive a reward?  But it is precisely this logic that BitOpt24 offers.  A smart user will think about how this site makes money.  How can he afford to survive?  Moreover, how can he take enough money to send payments to all users, as promised? </p><h2>  And what happens? </h2><p>  The questions asked above remain unanswered.  And no wonder, because there is no one to answer them.  The site has contact information for technical support, the creators of the site, but it does not lead anywhere, and waiting for an answer is pointless.  There is no interbank.  There are only numerous promises, assurances that you need to wait a little longer and the money will come.  From time to time, the resource even gives gifts - of course, completely meaningless. </p><h2>  Binary options: buy or not? </h2><p>  Binary options is a slippery topic.  This is not a full-fledged foreign exchange market, option transactions are simpler, but it is very difficult to predict a change in the situation so as to make a profit.  Even when working with well-known, reputable, reliable brokers, there is a high probability of losing money and not getting anything for it, except for unpleasant impressions.  As follows from the reviews of BitOpt24, one does not have to rely on profit here.  You won‚Äôt lose money, but you‚Äôll spend time. </p>

    <p>  On the site, the user has access to a list of options that he can buy.  Of these, you can choose the one that seems the most promising, and indicate how much you plan to invest in the system.  An entry-level player can invest only a dollar, but over time the amount can grow - the conditions are described above.  The site automatically selects suitable traders who will be entrusted with money management.  Of these, the most profitable participant is appointed, the player confirms the transaction.  Its duration is no more than a day. </p><h2>  To summarize: do you believe? </h2><p>  Even at the time of the transaction, you can feel that something is wrong here.  For example, a participant has only the appearance of control over the situation; in fact, the player does not decide anything.  He has a basic asset, he is given a trader who will manage the money.  You can‚Äôt even choose a trader on your own, the system does it itself.  The official position of the site - the most successful trader is selected, but the system for calculating "success" is opaque, so it is impossible to assess whether the choice is correct. </p>

    <p>  On the other hand, one can say for a long time that the logic of the site is incomprehensible and not obvious, and many processes are doubtful and do not cause trust.  The most important fact remains that the project, as follows from the reviews, does not make anyone.  Is it worth the time?  It is up to you to decide. </p>
