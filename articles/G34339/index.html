    <h2>  The relevance of modernization of education </h2><p>  To increase the prestige of working specialties, to develop the <span>personnel potential of a</span> professional educational system, a special program has been created that modernizes the education system of the Moscow Region.

    <h2>  Features of modernization of education </h2><p>  In recent years, the problem of a shortage of workers has grown significantly, since there is no motivation for the younger generation to obtain production specialties.  Working professions do not differ in attractive working conditions, have high intensity at low pay.  In addition, outdated technological processes and worn-out equipment are used in many industries, which makes it difficult to attract new qualified personnel.  The attractiveness of working professions is also declining due to the limited professional growth, the mismatch between the structure of graduates of educational institutions and the needs of the modern economy for specialists.  The modernization <span>of the education system of the</span> Moscow Region involves adaptation to the social needs of educational programs. </p><h2>  Career guidance </h2><p>  It is necessary to change the attitude towards working professions, conducting serious work with adolescents.  The Department of Education of the Moscow Region perfectly understands the timeliness of reforms not only in colleges and technical schools, but also in ordinary educational institutions.  Specialists of vocational-technical institutions of the region, together with school teachers, carry out targeted and systematic work to increase the prestige of working specialties among schoolchildren.  This activity is based on a deep knowledge of the main principles that determine the formation of a system of important factors that contribute to the formation of professional intentions of a growing personality, as well as the search for ways of self-realization. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Work on the identification of abilities and inclinations of personality </h2><p>  The <span>Moscow Region</span> Department of Education is concerned about the negative attitude of schoolchildren towards college education and the desire for higher education.  Experts understand the importance of creating a special system of socio-economic guidelines, production, pedagogical and technical measures aimed at identifying and developing inclinations and abilities, cognitive and professional interests in the selection of a future profession.  The new approach involves the formation of the willingness and needs of the younger generation to market conditions.  The Moscow Region Education Department proposes to implement this approach not only in the process of the direct educational process, but also during extracurricular activities of schoolchildren.  Modernization of Moscow education involves a variety of study tours to existing enterprises, organization of meetings with employees of enterprises, production managers. </p>

    <h2>  Innovative pedagogical technologies </h2><p>  Of particular importance in modern educational institutions is given to the design methodology, as well as to the research and differentiated approach.  Personally-oriented training, the use of Internet resources, information technology by teachers, makes it possible to improve the quality of knowledge, stimulate the process of independent development of the younger generation.  It is important to work individually with specific enterprises that successfully operate in the region.  Among the latest trends in the capital region, it is of particular interest to return to the <span>production practices that were</span> popular during the Soviet educational system.  To increase the authority of working professions, representatives of the education system work directly with enterprises and companies.  An interesting solution is to install a board of honor, material incentives, meetings of schoolchildren with <span>labor veterans.</span>  After conducting a sociological survey regarding the need to modernize the educational system in the metropolitan area, it turned out that more than half of the respondents were convinced of the need to return the system of career guidance in the Soviet school.  Psychologists highlight the moral factor for attracting young specialists to production.  The long-term target program for the reorganization of school and vocational education involves the allocation of financial resources for the transition to new federal state standards.  GEF are based on modern educational technologies, suggest staffing of innovative transformations in education. </p><p>  Modern conditions challenge educational institutions in finding ways to adapt educational programs to market needs and employers' needs.  Shelter must bring in line the level of training of graduates and the demands of the labor market. </p>
