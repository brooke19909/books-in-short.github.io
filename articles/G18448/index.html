    <h2>  Smartphone hardware </h2><p>  Acer Liquid E3 is built on the basis of MT6589 quad-core CPU from Taiwan-based developer MediaTek.  This is a time-tested solution that is based on the architecture of A7.  Of course, it cannot be called obsolete yet, but it is no longer advanced.  Immediately it is worth noting that this chip can only perform 32-bit calculations, that is, you do not have to wait for updates to Android over 4.4.2 for it.  The maximum possible frequency of operation of each of the computing modules is 1.2 GHz.  So, the computing power of this CPU will be enough for most everyday tasks.  The only thing he definitely can‚Äôt handle is 3D toys </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone acer liquid e3 review" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/600815.jpg" width="486"></div>  last generation.  In general, on this gadget you can watch movies, listen to music, read a book, play games and surf the web.

It, like the CPU, allows you to easily solve most of the everyday tasks.  The display diagonal of this smart phone is an impressive 4.7 inches.  At the same time, the image is displayed on the screen in HD-quality, that is, 1280x720 acceptable today.  The touch surface of the display can handle up to five touches.  The screen is built on the most advanced technology to date - IPS.  The only criticism is the presence of an air gap between the screen and the sensor.  Hence the image distortion at an angle close to 180 degrees.  The rest of the picture quality is impeccable.  The matrix of the main camera has a dimension of 13 megapixels.  As expected, its capabilities are complemented by a flash and autofocus system.  There are also many software options that in some cases can significantly improve the quality of the picture.  The second camera is located on the front of the smartphone.  Her sensor has a dimension of 2 megapixels.  It is also equipped with an LED flash.  This nuance favorably distinguishes against the background of similar devices <span>Acer Liquid E3.</span>  <span>User reviews</span> indicate the correctness of this decision.  You can communicate on Skype, even in complete darkness.  The rest is a flawless camera for video communications. </p><h2>  RAM, memory card and internal storage </h2><p>  Only 1 GB of RAM is installed in this gadget, and this is enough for comfortable work.  It is impossible to increase its volume by installing an additional module, as on a stationary PC.  The only thing that can be advised in this case is to use a specialized utility, for example, <span>Clean Master,</span> which will control the amount of free RAM and, if necessary, clean it.  The internal drive has a capacity of 4 GB.  Of these, only half can be used for software and user data.  This is not enough today.  The solution to this problem is to install an external flash card.  You can maximize the amount of installed memory in this way by 32 GB.  And programmatically, you can choose the place where the programs will be installed and the user's personal data will be saved.  But with the help of an OTG cable and an ordinary USB flash drive, this issue cannot be solved.  This technology is not supported by the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Usability </h2><p>  The latest devices of this manufacturer are distinguished by their original performance compared to competitors.  This product was not an exception from Acer.  Mobile phones of this brand are highlighted by a special button on the back of the smartphone.  Its purpose can be programmed.  But, as practice shows, it is best to use it to unlock a smartphone.  The lock button (it is also responsible for turning off the device) is on the upper edge, and even shifted to the left corner.  That is, with the fingers of one hand it will be difficult to reach it.  Otherwise, the ergonomics of the smartphone at an acceptable level.  On the right are the volume buttons and the slot for installing an external drive.  But on the left there are two slots for SIM cards.  The front of the device protects the <span>tempered glass</span> (only which one is unclear).  The rest of the gadget is made of matte plastic. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Smartphone Acer Liquid E3 E380 is equipped with a battery with a capacity of 2000 mA / h.  Separately, it is worth noting that it is built into the device itself, and it is impossible to get it yourself from this device.  On the one hand, this design solution allows the body to maintain rigidity.  But at the same time, in the event of a battery malfunction, the smartphone itself will have to be carried to a service center.  Now about autonomy.  The battery capacity is enough for 2 days of average load.  If you use it more intensively, then this value will be reduced to 12 hours.  This is an acceptable indicator for an entry-level device with such a display diagonal. </p>

    <h2>  OS and application software </h2><p>  The classic version of Android with the number 4.2.2 is installed on the Acer Liquid E3 smartphone.  A review of technical specifications indicates the possibility of upgrading to version 4.4.2 in the foreseeable future.  But whether this will be done remains a question.  The "chip" of the device is a proprietary add-on from Acer.  It allows you to optimize the smart phone interface for your needs.  Moreover, there are a lot of opportunities in it, and this provides the flexibility of its settings. </p><h2>  Communications </h2><p>  An impressive set of interfaces for the Acer Liquid E3.  First of all, this is full support for GSM and 3G mobile networks.  Moreover, as with most devices based on MediaTech products, the first SIM card slot is universal, and the second only works in 2Zh.  As a result, in the first case, the information transmission range varies from 0.5 Mbit / s to 15 Mbit / s, and in the second it is only 0.5 Mbit / s.  Therefore, if you plan to use any one card to work on the Internet, it is better to install it in the first slot.  Information on Wai-Fai is also fully transmitted.  In this case, the speed grows 10 times in comparison with 3G.  Also, developers did not bypass their attention and ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù.  <span>This interface</span> allows you to transfer data over a short distance up to 10-15 meters and in a small amount (up to several megabytes).  There is also a ZhPS transmitter, which in a few minutes allows you to determine your location.  Another important interface is the MicroUSB port.  It allows you to receive and transfer data to a PC.  Also, it is used to charge the battery.  The last jack is a classic 3.5 mm jack for connecting speakers or headphones.  In general, this smartphone has everything you need to exchange information with the outside world. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews on this Smart Phone </h2><p>  Most users characterize only the positive side of the Acer Liquid E3.  The reviews of its owners indicate the following positive points: </p><ul><li>  Good setup of the software environment, the interface runs smoothly, the CPU does not overheat. </li><li>  A good level of performance for a device of this level. </li><li>  The proprietary add-on of the development company allows you to easily configure your smartphone. </li></ul><p>  But he has only two minuses: </p><ul><li>  The lock button is awkwardly located. </li><li>  The battery is built into the device itself, and its capacity is small for such a device. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  An excellent ‚Äúworkhorse‚Äù is the Acer Liquid E3.  The price is only too high (about $ 200 today), the lock button is inconveniently located, as well as the small capacity of the built-in battery.  If the last two problems can be solved, then the cost of the device is really overpriced.  But still, Acer Liquid E3 has a number of advantages that distinguish it from its competitors: proprietary shell, high-quality camera, excellent display.  In general, this is a great solution for those who want to buy a good entry-level smartphone for every day. </p>
