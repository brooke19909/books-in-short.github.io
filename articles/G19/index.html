  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rest in Cuba: a fairy tale in reality</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Choosing a country for a perfect holiday, it makes sense to stop your attention in Cuba.  This island, washed by the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea, will give tourists exciting excursions, chic living conditions, wonderful beach relaxation and will leave only pleasant impressions in your memory.  Holidays in Cuba are a great opportunity to get acquainted with the unique culture and traditions of Liberty Island. </p><p>  The best time for such a journey begins in late autumn and ends in early spring.  Indeed, in May the rainy season comes into its own.  He makes the inhabitants of the Republic of Cuba soak for six months.  And although the <span>average</span> air temperature on this tropical island never drops below 26 degrees with a plus sign, the main tourist season falls in October-April. </p><p>  Holidays in Cuba are a great occasion to get closer to pure untouched nature.  To do this, you can go to the fourth largest island of the state of Cayo Coco - a paradise, whose true owners are important pelicans, snow-white coco ibis and delicate flamingos.  What could be more beautiful than a flight of graceful pink birds against the background of the crystal clear blue surface of the sea?  Probably only calmness and bliss, which can be felt in full only as a guest of the protected Cayo Coco.  In addition, the island will surprise fans of diving with an unusually beautiful and rich underwater world, lovers of the mysterious with wild, unexplored jungle, and lovers of relaxation will be happy to visit one of the best beaches in the world. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Those tourists for whom rest in Cuba - not only sea bathing and communication with nature, will appreciate the stunning architecture of the cities of Trinidad, Sancta Spiritus and Remedios, preserved from the colonial times, will be happy to step on the land of the island of Huventud discovered by Columbus in 1494 and they will not be able to ignore the charm of such cities as Camaguey, Cienfuegos, Matanzas and, of course, the capital of the Republic of Cuba - Havana.  For those who want to ‚Äúexperience for themselves‚Äù the local flavor is suitable Las Tunas, where connoisseurs of folk art and sculpture will be able to absorb the ancient traditions of the <span>indigenous population.</span>  Those who like more lively entertainment - feel free to go to the city under the name of Ciego de Avila.  Here you can simply admire or even take part in an art fair, which presents the best examples of musical and dance art.  It will bring great pleasure and a walk along Independence Avenue, visiting the cathedral and the unique theater. </p><p>  This is what the excursion program of the average tourist looks like.  As an official part - a walk through the stone towns of the times of the conquistadors, at best - a visit to the Museum of the Revolution, the rest of the time - a complete immersion in all kinds of entertainment.  But rest in Cuba is not only rum, cigars and salsa, it is also communication with the wonderful people of the long-suffering, but not lost pride and dignity of the country. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Unfortunately, truly paradise places in Cuba are intended exclusively for tourists.  Locals live in rather difficult conditions.  To the credit of the Cubans, despondency and sadness very rarely appear on their smiling and hospitable faces.  A poor diet consisting of rice and black beans does not undermine the health of Aboriginal people, but on the contrary, allows us to consider the fifth points of their young ladies and ladies as the most seductive in the world.  It is impossible to find a car under the age of 30-40 in the car park, but the main cities look like real museums, and from the seats of old cars you can hear a funny, sweeping whistle - after every pretty girl.  Peasants who work hard all year round without rest can boast only an ancient Soviet-made refrigerator, packed full of plastic water bottles to capacity.  But, thanks to their work, connoisseurs of good tobacco all over the world enjoy the spicy smoke of Havana cigars.  The list of annoying ‚Äúmismatches‚Äù does not end there.  But let's not talk about sad things.  After all, the Cubans are the most optimistic nation in the world. </p><p>  By purchasing last-minute <span>tours to Cuba,</span> it makes sense to draw up your own tourism plan, which will depend on your individual preferences.  So, if you are a fan of pirate stories about <span>Francis Drake</span> and Henry Morgan, the main interest for you is Havana.  Desperate and freedom-loving romantics will be happy to visit the places of military glory of the famous revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara.  And those interested in spiritual practices will be delighted with the unusual rituals of Santeria - a unique mixture of African pagan beliefs and Catholicism. </p><p>  Last minute packages to Cuba is a great choice for both an experienced traveler and a beginner in this fascinating hobby.  Liberty Island will find an individual approach and will completely charm every tourist who has visited this beautiful land at least once. </p>
