    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Gorky Park is quite old, it was founded in 1928.  True, then it was just a place of rest.  In addition, he performed a number of important functions, served as a venue for political, educational and cultural studies.  By the way, initially this place was allotted for agricultural and industrial exhibitions, only then it was converted into a park. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Gorky Park is located along the banks of the Moscow River, which provides a constant flow of fresh air.  The total area is more than 100 hectares.  This is a large green massif, where more than 50 species of trees are planted.  Linden grows the most, because it blooms beautifully and gives a lot of shadow and oxygen.  In addition, oaks, maples, ash, and birch grow here.  The central avenues are planted with nuts and chestnuts.  In order to make the park look attractive, numerous rose gardens, flower beds are laid out, and decorative reservoirs are created.  All open spaces are occupied by flower beds, sculptures and fountains. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How the park has changed in recent years </h2><p>  The reconstruction came to the Gorky Park in the summer of 2011.  Probably many Muscovites remember what he looked like before.  Huge cracks in the asphalt, weedy grass, mountains of beer cans, slender rows of barbecue, smoke and many tipsy people.  Today, the situation has changed dramatically.  First, all old and sometimes faulty rides were dismantled, many of which were potentially dangerous.  At the same time, they removed all the trays and other commercial structures.  This was the first step, sometimes condemned by visitors. </p><p>  Then, on the site of the dismantled structures, they laid new asphalt, smooth as glass.  The flowerbeds were destroyed with a total length of about two hectares.  The territory has become well-groomed, similar to the European urban recreation centers. </p>

    <h2>  Innovations the park boasts </h2><p>  Today, they stopped taking money for entering the recreation park.  This is another reason to come with your family and have a good time.  In order that the rest was not boring, bicycle paths were built.  There are a large number of bicycles and cycle cars for rent.  Walking on a multi-seat bike will be a favorite adventure for adults and children. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Instead of private barbecue and cheburek appeared a normal network of food from city restaurants.  Now you can eat tasty and inexpensively in comfortable conditions, being sure that all sanitary standards are observed in the kitchen.  Throughout the territory there are free comfortable poufs and deck chairs for a comfortable stay.  Special racks will allow you to regularly recharge your laptop and phone, you will not be left without music. </p><p>  For lovers of sunbathing, the Olive Beach is open.  On the banks of the Moskva River, everything you need is prepared: sun loungers and deck chairs, umbrellas and showers, comfortable changing rooms and a toilet.  While the recreation area accommodates 500 people, there might not be enough space on a hot weekend. </p><p>  For lovers of extreme sports, a specialized skate park works.  Beginners and real pros will like it here, you can take mastery lessons, show your level and just go for a drive.  If you come with children, then leave them in a huge equipped sandbox.  It was created recently in the park and is the largest in Moscow.  Here you can create whole sand sculptures and have fun with peers. </p><p>  After spending all day in the park, in the evening you can get your whole family together in an open-air cinema and watch a good movie on the big screen.  Depending on the weather, the audience is given blankets and even comfortable raincoats.  Just imagine the romance - under a warm summer rain on the street to watch an interesting movie. </p>

    <h2>  For athletic youth </h2><p>  Foreign guests say that the park has already reached the European level.  This is a real urban place to relax.  Fashionable activities are yoga in the open air.  Gorky Culture Park picked up this trend, and now at certain hours you can see groups engaged in green glades.  There is something so enticing in it that you want to join in and perform a couple of asanas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are 50 table tennis tables throughout the property.  There is the opportunity to play tennis.  Even a ping pong club has been created, which holds its own competitions.  Muscovites of all ages love to knock balls on the table. </p><p>  What is nature without beach volleyball?  The park realizes the wishes of its guests, offering magnificent sites with white sand.  Do you like to ride bicycles, roller skates, skateboards?  Specially designated tracks will allow you to enjoy the movement without disturbing other visitors.  In addition, there are equipped areas for playing handball, volleyball, football, with an instructor or on your own. </p><p>  What is very pleasing is that smoking and drinking alcohol are prohibited in the park.  You will not be enveloped in puffs of cigarette smoke from a nearby company, and there is little chance of meeting a pesky drunk man.  These are the first steps towards the education of a healthy generation, and therefore the nation as a whole.  Moms with babies can now spend all day here, on the central alley there is a room for mother and baby, where you can swaddle and feed the baby. </p>

    <h2>  Modern lifestyle <strong> </strong></h2><p>  Thanks to the reconstruction, Gorky Park (Moscow) has reached a whole new level.  Now I want to come here, it's nice to relax, and in addition, such a vacation saves time, because you do not need to go out of town.  In addition to a variety of entertainment, the park offers free Wi-Fi access and a large number of outlets for recharging phones and laptops.  Learn, work, read, communicate - and all this in nature. </p><p>  Famous artists and novice groups often perform on the stage: dance, vocal.  Almost every evening, the stage burns with lights, inviting you to see something interesting. </p><h2>  Cultural heritage, flora and fauna </h2><p>  Today <span>Gorky Park (Moscow) is</span> becoming the epicenter of life in the capital.  Here they hold meetings on interests, get to know and walk, have fun and play sports.  To preserve the interest of residents, serious work was done.  Literally in a year, the Golitsinsky and Pionersky ponds were cleaned.  Instead of muddy swamps, covered by dense duckweed, bright bodies of water now flaunt where fish was launched - 400 kg of live individuals of grass carp and silver carp.  In addition, environmentalists decided to settle here black-necked swans, and now Muscovites in the evenings watch these magnificent birds.  Regular work is underway to plant trees and shrubs.  A group of designers every spring creates a new, amazing pattern on flower beds from various plants. </p><p>  Another area is <span>the restoration</span> of cultural heritage monuments.  Work has just begun on the improvement of the ‚ÄúGolitsinsky wall‚Äù on Pushkinskaya embankment, a gazebo named after the 800th anniversary of Moscow, as well as five fountains that are part of this architectural complex. </p>

    <h2>  Observatory </h2><p>  Gorky Central Park (Moscow) includes this interesting object.  The building itself was built long ago, but stood closed for about 20 years.  In 2012, its doors opened again before visitors.  For the convenience of observing the stars, a new powerful telescope is installed.  In addition, architects improved the dome of the building, which became fully automated.  It itself rotates 360 degrees, the sashes themselves adjust to the conditions, opening so as to provide the most convenient view of the sky.  If you want to get an original photo of Gorky Park, then start a photo session here, capturing yourself in the role of a budding astronomer. </p><h2>  Summer park </h2><p>  Usually it is the children who remind us that you can go to the Gorky park.  The rides, however, practically removed everything from here, there was only a small platform for the kids.  There are small carousels, a bungee and a standard train.  And a lot of options for entertainment are provided for older children, just go to the sports equipment rental department.  Rollers, bicycles, skateboards, scooters, balls and other equipment for practicing on the grounds - all this is in demand among young visitors. </p><p>  The rope ‚ÄúPanda Park‚Äù will delight the children, and adults are often happy to pose as tarzans.  There are three routes of different difficulty levels, they run at an altitude of 15 meters.  Of course, there is a safety net at the bottom, but still the experience is unforgettable. </p><p>  Of course, summer is a time for a beach holiday.  You can go sunbathing on the Olive Beach, rent a boat or a catamaran.  There are also developing children's playgrounds.  One of the most striking examples is the Green School.  The teacher shows snails and rabbits, teaches to germinate seeds and plant plants.  Tells a lot of interesting things about the world.  Artists, artists and scientists come to visit the children.  And in Neskuchny Garden there is a small zoo.  Hand-made squirrels, lambs with a sheep and rabbits live here. </p>

    <h2>  How to get to the park? </h2><p>  In the summer, especially on a weekend, I don‚Äôt want to stand in traffic jams for several hours, so it‚Äôs better to use the subway to get to Gorky Park.  Park Kultury metro station is located near the entrance to the park.  It is enough to get out of the subway, cross the Moscow River over the bridge, and you are there. </p>
