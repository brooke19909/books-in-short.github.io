Raiffeisenbank was no exception.  Home loan payers have the opportunity to recalculate arrears at a more loyal interest rate. </p><p>  Against the background of the recent increase in key rates, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation changed its lending conditions and commercial banks that refinance mortgage loans.  At Raiffeisenbank, for example, you can apply for a change in the terms of a loan issued by another company.  Customers with impeccable credit history and constant income can rely on certain preferences.  Consider the features of mortgage refinancing at Raiffeisen. </p><h2>  For its customers </h2><p>  For those clients who apply for a mortgage at Raiffeisenbank, refinancing may be different.  In one case, a change of currency is assumed.  For example, borrowers who filed a housing loan in dollars have the right to pay it in rubles when approving an application for the conversion of debt.  In addition, individually, customers can contact the bank with a request to revise the conditions of the current loan: lower the rate, increase the term for repayment of the debt or change the payment scheme. </p><p>  Raiffeisenbank offers completely standard and loyal terms to borrowers applying for refinancing mortgages.  Of paramount importance here is an official and stable income.  This requirement applies to customers who are employees or private entrepreneurs.  A positive credit history is of great importance for approving an application. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who can count on refinancing </h2><p>  Limitations apply to the number of mortgage loans.  If the client has more than two loans, the application will be rejected.  At Raiffeisenbank, mortgage refinancing is only possible for citizens over 21 years of age, with permanent registration in the region of circulation.  Unlike other banking companies, this organization refinances mortgages of citizens of the Russian Federation and foreigners. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneycontrol.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Raiffeisenbank refinancing other mortgages" class="if uuid-3189966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/3189966.jpg"></div><p>  When considering a refinancing request, special attention is paid to the experience at the last place of work.  Preference is given to borrowers who have been employed for at least six months, but in some cases (for example, if this is the first place of work for the borrower), persons with three months of experience are considered.  To change the terms of the current loan, the size of the constant wage and the observance of the payment schedule are important.  For those who pay a monthly mortgage fee with regular delays, applications are generally not approved. </p><h2>  Housing as collateral </h2><p>  The availability of real estate will help increase the chance of approval of the application.  When refinancing a mortgage, Raiffeisenbank accepts apartments and private houses as collateral.  At the same time, housing must be provided with all conditions for normal living: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  the presence of a separate kitchen and bathroom; </li><li>  satisfactory condition of engineering systems; </li><li>  cold and hot water supply; </li><li>  central sewage system; </li><li>  steam heating. </li></ul><p>  Usually, mortgage housing is used as collateral, therefore, verification is usually not carried out at the stage of initial registration of a housing loan. </p><h2>  For borrowers with a mortgage of another bank </h2><p>  It‚Äôs not only Raiffeisenbank‚Äôs customers who are applying for recalculation.  Mortgage refinancing of other financial institutions is also possible.  Customers of Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Delta Credit and other companies can apply here.  At the same time, it is important that the potential borrower at the time of submitting the questionnaire does not have delinquencies and debts, fines and unpaid interest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gazeta.a42.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mortgage refinancing at Raiffeisenbank" class="if uuid-3189977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/3189977.jpg"></div><p>  The conditions under which it is proposed to change the conditions for refinancing mortgages from Raiffeisenbank and other banks do not fundamentally differ.  However, the bank does not have information about the payment history of customers of other banks, therefore, it will require the provision of additional documents.  These include: </p><ul><li>  certificate of debt; </li><li>  statistics of delinquencies in loan repayments. </li><li>  assessment of collateral (mortgage) property from independent experts. </li></ul><p>  In general, the requirements for potential borrowers do not differ from the requirements offered to Raiffeisenbank customers: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  citizenship of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  at least 21 years of age and no more than 65 at the time of the planned loan repayment; </li><li>  impeccable credit history; </li><li>  availability of an official source of income; </li><li>  for employees, at least one year of service, and for entrepreneurs - at least 3 years. </li></ul><h2>  Thorough check of real estate </h2><p>  The bank is more strictly suited to the state of collateral real estate.  We consider housing, which is located in the region of circulation and the banking organization.  For example, for Muscovites, the following restrictions apply: real estate must be located within a radius of 50 km from the Moscow Ring Road.  An apartment or a private house can be used as collateral for real estate only if: </p><ul><li>  are in good condition and suitable for living; </li><li>  equipped with the necessary plumbing; </li><li>  have windows and a roof. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.saga.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Raiffeisenbank refinancing mortgages of other banks" class="if uuid-3189968" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/3189968.jpg"></div><p>  Moreover, apartments without interior decoration are accepted in case of repair work at the time of refinancing.  The condition of the home should be confirmed by a report of an independent expert appraiser.  The duration of this document may not exceed six months.  The average cost of an examination usually varies between 2-8 thousand rubles, which depends on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe dwelling.  Also, Raiffeisenbank, when refinancing a mortgage of other banks, carries out a check for: </p><ul><li>  illegal redevelopment on the basis of the BTI data sheet; </li><li>  the presence of additional burdens, in addition to housing loans; </li><li>  the duration of the operation of the building and the real state of the premises, based on the reports of the appraisers. </li></ul><p>  Also, when refinancing mortgages of other banks, Raiffeisenbank offers not only to recalculate debts and apply a more favorable rate, but also to combine several loans into one.  For many borrowers, this method of refinancing is considered profitable and convenient. </p><h2>  Terms of refinancing </h2><p>  Raiffeisenbank enables citizens to refinance large loans - up to 26 million rubles.  Such an offer is in demand among residents of the capital region, since the average cost of housing in Moscow and the region is one of the highest in the country.  Today, it offers favorable mortgage refinancing rates.  Raiffeisenbank set this indicator at the level of 9.99 - 10.49%.  Moreover, the interest rate depends on the value of collateral housing.  If, according to the expert, it exceeds 7 million rubles, the minimum rate is applied.  The loan term is 1-30 years. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.raiffeisen.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Raiffeisenbank Bank Mortgage Refinancing" class="if uuid-3189963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/3189963.jpg"></div><h2>  What documents need to be provided </h2><p>  In general, the procedure for refinancing a mortgage at Raiffeisenbank for individuals is no different in principle from how it is done in other banks.  To get approval, borrowers who are being discussed at other financial institutions need to collect an impressive list of documents.  In particular, you need to provide: </p><ul><li>  passport and its copy; </li><li>  certificate of pension insurance (SNILS); </li><li>  income statement in the form of 2-personal income tax or in the form of a bank; </li><li>  copy of the employment record or employment contract; </li><li>  For men under 27 years of age, a military card is required. </li></ul><p>  In addition, you will need to fill out an application form, provide copies of documents confirming ownership of real estate: </p><ul><li>  extended USRN statement; </li><li>  report of the expert appraiser; </li><li>  technical passport BTI; </li><li>  a permit issued by the guardianship authorities if the mortgage was registered using the funds of the capital; </li><li>  copy of the current loan agreement; </li><li>  certificate of the amount of debt. </li></ul><p>  This list of documents must be provided to individuals for refinancing mortgages of other banks at Raiffeisenbank.  Individual entrepreneurs must submit a 3-NDFL declaration, copies of documents of ownership.  Raiffeisenbank customers, in comparison with borrowers from other organizations, need to collect a minimum package of documents, as the bank already has basic information about collateral real estate and solvency, information about credit history.  A complete set of papers is required only from new customers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wrema.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Raiffeisenbank refinancing mortgages of other banks to individuals" class="if uuid-3189979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/3189979.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a statement </h2><p>  If you pay attention to user comments, many people think that the conditions for refinancing a mortgage at Raiffeisenbank are very loyal.  It is not surprising that the bank is in demand among borrowers.  In this regard, some would be interested in how best to send an application for refinancing a mortgage to Raiffeisen - online or visit a bank branch in person? </p><p>  Like many other credit organizations, Raiffeisenbank allows you to pre-apply for refinancing directly on the site.  If the client receives approval, he will need to arrive at the nearest bank branch, present all the necessary documents and submit an application in paper form.  The questionnaire should indicate: </p><ul><li>  personal data (full name, date of birth, permanent or temporary registration address); </li><li>  information about labor activity, education; </li><li>  family composition information; </li><li>  level of income and expenses (total for all family members, including minor children); </li><li>  readiness for insurance; </li><li>  data on the place of work, and it is possible to indicate those places in which the applicant works part-time. </li></ul><p>  Also, the application will need to indicate detailed information about the current loan, including the amount of the debt and the period remaining until the final repayment of the loan.  The application is signed by the borrower personally. </p><h2>  Bank customer reviews, tips and tricks </h2><p>  <span>Mortgage refinancing</span> in itself involves obtaining more favorable conditions in comparison with those on which the loan was originally obtained.  An undoubted advantage of applying to Raiffeisenbank for refinancing a mortgage, according to reviews of Raiffeisen, is the speed in considering applications and a high percentage of their approval.  At the same time, many users complain about the fact that they have to reassemble the package of numerous documents and re-evaluate the collateral housing, which incurs additional costs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yell.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Raiffeisenbank mortgage refinancing for individuals" class="if uuid-3189989" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/3189989.jpg"></div><p>  Users with personal experience in mortgage lending and refinancing are advised to contact Raiffeisenbank if the loan body amount is several million rubles, and the difference between the current rate and the one offered by Raiffeisen is two or more points.  In this case, refinancing allows you to profitably reduce the size of the monthly payment and reduce the overpayment, choose a more convenient payment repayment schedule or change the currency. </p><p>  Wanting to refinance an existing mortgage at Raiffeisenbank, some face serious restrictions on the choice of collateral.  If you believe the reviews, the bank does not warn about an increase in the interest rate by several points, which is used for borrowers with an age of more than 45 years.  Sometimes the rate rises by 2-3 points and can reach almost 15% instead of the promised 9.99-10.49%. </p><p>  Like other banks, Raiffeisen raises the rate in case of refusal of insurance.  Many users recommend that you carefully study the terms of the refinancing agreement, because, according to reviews, other hidden nuances are often found. </p><h2>  How much time will it take to refinance </h2><p>  Today, the whole process usually takes no more than a week.  An application for refinancing is considered by bank managers within three business days.  In the case of a positive answer, the same amount of time is spent on checking the liquidity of collateral housing.  Basically, documents are sent in electronic form, but to sign the contract you still need to visit the bank. </p><p>  The step-by-step refinancing procedure, starting from the moment of application submission, is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Filling out the application form on the website and obtaining bank approval. </li><li>  Checking the liquidity of housing offered as collateral. </li><li>  Signing a loan agreement with Raiffeisenbank. </li><li>  Registration of a new mortgage mortgage agreement due to changes in the lender and the pledge holder. </li><li>  Bank lending by bank transfer to the borrower's account. </li><li>  Organization of registration through partners of the bank. </li></ol><p>  It is important to present the loan agreement with a note on state registration to bank employees within two months from the moment of signing the agreement.  Also, the client will be required to notarize the consent of the spouse, if he acts as a co-borrower, for refinancing and changing the pledge holder. </p><div class="photo" data-original="billionnews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Raiffeisenbank mortgage refinancing rate" class="if uuid-3189970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/3189970.jpg"></div><p>  Unlike new customers of the bank, borrowers who initially filed a mortgage with Raiffeisenbank need to draw up amendments to the current agreement.  If, for example, a change of the settlement currency occurs, the client is offered to sign an additional agreement with the bank, which involves a change in this condition, while the pledge holder remains the same. </p><p>  Those borrowers who take a loan at Raiffeisenbank at a new rate go a slightly different way.  After approval of the application, signing of all securities and receipt of money in a bank account, an individual deposits funds to repay a mortgage loan issued by a previous banking organization.  Then the encumbrance on the property can be removed, and soon registration of a new mortgage agreement will be required.  If during the process of drawing up a new agreement, the pledge holder changes or other changes are made to the contract, the bank can provide the client with more loyal conditions (for example, to calculate the mortgage not at a fixed but at a floating interest rate). </p>
