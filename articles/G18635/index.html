People come here all year round, even in the summer months, when it is very hot.  This is explained by the dry Egyptian climate, thanks to which high temperatures and heat can be easily transferred. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sultan Beach Resort 4" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1092941.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rest in Hurghada </h2><p>  But not only climatic conditions are the reason that many people choose this direction for their holidays.  Tourists like the Red Sea, rich in coral reefs, where you can go snorkeling, diving, feeling all the charm of diving. </p><p>  The Russians are familiar with many Egyptian resorts, including the oldest - Hurghada.  It is believed that it was from here that local tourism began to develop.  Many come to Hurghada to relax with their children.  This is explained by the fact that in hotels the infrastructure for young tourists is quite well developed.  In addition, you can not worry that, swimming in the sea, they can hurt their feet on corals, because the reefs are quite far away. </p><h2>  Hotel Overview </h2><p>  Those who choose Egypt to not only swim or sunbathe, but also to see local wonders, can easily get from Hurghada to Luxor and see the famous pyramids.  Transport accessibility has become another advantage when choosing this resort.  In addition, tourist infrastructure is well developed in Hurghada.  There are a lot of big and small shops, there are water parks and night clubs, restaurants and hookah. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about hotel Sultan Beach 4 Hurghada" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1092946.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The beaches in Hurghada most often represent artificially deepened lagoons.  Many large hotels have their own ‚Äúhome‚Äù coral reefs where you can dive and enjoy fishing.  However, in this case, going barefoot into the water is quite dangerous: you need shoes for swimming. </p><p>  The pricing policy of the resort of Hurghada is very democratic.  Here, any tourist can find for himself an accommodation option - for every purse and taste.  There are many simple and inexpensive three-star hotels, as well as expensive apartments.  But judging by the reviews, most Russians prefer to stay in good ‚Äúfours‚Äù.  The Sultan Beach Resort, which has become quite popular, is no exception. </p><h2>  <span>Sultan Beach Hotel</span> 4 *: description </h2><p>  ‚ÄúDecent Four‚Äù - this is how most Russians characterize this hotel.  It is a large complex consisting of an administrative building, three-story buildings and two-level villas.  Sultan Beach Resort 4 * was built on the beach, eight kilometers from the center of Hurghada.  It opened in 1998.  Since then, his buildings have been repaired several times.  The last major renovation was carried out in 2014. </p><p>  Sultan Beach Resort is a 4-star resort hotel located a few kilometers from the center of Hurghada.  This hotel complex has one significant advantage: it is built in a tourist area, where there is a lot of entertainment.  Another advantage of this hotel is its proximity to the airport - only six kilometers.  Such a short transfer is especially convenient for those who come to Hurghada with young children, because it is known that most of the kids do not tolerate the road. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sultan Beach Resort 4 Hurghada reviews" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1092940.jpg" width="600"></div>
