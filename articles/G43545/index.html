    <p>  As the world's first Legislative Assembly appeared, this is a whole story that takes its roots in France at the end of the 18th century.  The people themselves felt the inferiority of the absolute monarchy, which significantly impeded the development of the state.  People strove for democracy; they wanted to be heard. </p><h2>  Estates in France </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the French society at that time was divided into classes.  The first was the clergy, the second was the nobility.  Representatives of these classes were exempted from taxes.  The third estate, which consisted of peasants, artisans and the bourgeoisie, did not fall under the privileges and paid all taxes to the state. </p><h2>  Reasons for the French Revolution of 1789-1794 </h2><p>  In recent years, absolutism as a form of government no longer considered priority the expression of the interests of the nation, but only defended the privileges that the first and second classes had.  So, the nobility received the exclusive right to own land, trade was monopolized.  These and other prerequisites gave rise to people's displeasure with the actions of the ruling elite. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  But the hunger of the 70s of the XVIII century became a factor provoking changes.  The period of crop failure and unemployment affected primarily peasants.  A wave of uprisings in the villages soon spread to the cities.  In order to prevent the fall of the state and solve existing problems, the head of the country at that time, <span>Louis XVI</span> Bourbon realized the need to convene the <span>General States.</span> </p><h2>  Convening of the General States in France in 1789 </h2><p>  The meeting of the General States took place on May 5, 1789.  It so happened that most of the places here were occupied by representatives of the third estate.  They expressed their dissatisfaction with the rule of the absolute monarch by grouping against him and proclaiming themselves the National Assembly.  Some delegates belonging to the upper classes supported the National Assembly.  The king was requested to adopt the Constitution of the country. </p><p>  The starting point of the beginning of the French Revolution is the capture of the Bastille, a political prison.  The appearance of the National Assembly, and then the Legislative Assembly, is the result of the Great French Revolution, which was the first step towards the democratization of the state. </p>

    <h2>  Establishment of the Legislative Assembly </h2><p>  Thanks to the adoption of the Constitution, 2 rounds of parliamentary elections were held in France, as a result of which the Legislative Assembly was established on October 1, 1791.  It was an organization that consisted of just one chamber, which employed 745 people.  The term of office was limited to two years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Legislative Assembly Functions </h2><p>  The institution performed such functions in the state: </p><ul><li>  had the right to declare war; </li><li>  introduced amendments and adopted new laws; </li><li>  determined the number of ground and naval forces; </li><li>  introduced new tax duties; </li><li>  Approved the adoption of peaceful as well as commercial international treatises; </li><li>  had the right to appeal to an international court with the aim of initiating proceedings and prosecuting those who held ministerial posts and were not members of the Legislative Assembly. </li></ul>

    <p>  The first such institution set itself the goal of combating the unlimited power of King Louis XVI, to uphold the interests of the third estate and the state, and lasted until September 21, 1792. </p><p>  The legislative assembly is the parliament of the country in which it operates.  France in this case is known for the fact that it was in this state that the first parliamentary elections in the history of mankind were held.  Only those citizens who regularly paid taxes and had no debts to the state participated in the elections. </p><h2>  The crisis in Russia of the 90s of the XX century </h2><p>  Another historically important meeting was in Russia.  The period of existence of the Soviet Union ended in 1991, when the republics that had sovereignty and were members of the Union began to withdraw from it. </p><p>  The form of government of the USSR was socialism.  It was characterized by the absence of a class division of society in which the whole people adhered to the principles of collective labor and planning, and in the first place justice and equality of all people were proclaimed. </p>

    <p>  For a while, this political regime paid off.  But Western countries continued to develop, and democracy as a form of government spread more and more. </p><p>  Thanks to the information received in the Soviet Union, its citizens got the opportunity to observe the way of life of the peoples of other countries.  The country itself at that time was going through hard times.  The period of stagnation shook confidence in the correctness of the policy of the President of the USSR Mikhail Gorbachev, since the perestroika carried out by him could not save the country from the crisis.  The people lived in unemployment and poverty. </p><h2>  August putsch </h2><p>  In March 1991, an all-Russian referendum was held in Russia, which legitimized the introduction of the post of president of the RSFSR.  After the elections held on June 12 of that year, Boris Yeltsin was elected president. </p><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãMikhail Gorbachev, Chairman of the CPSU Central Committee, to transform the existing Soviet Union into a Union of Sovereign States was not to the liking of many politicians who adhere to conservatism.  The opportunity to let the republics become independent has become a major stumbling block.  Then on August 19, 1991 there was an illegal seizure of power - the August coup, which lasted three days.  Boris Yeltsin, Chairman of the Supreme Council and President-elect of the RSFSR, together with his associates resisted the putschists and stabilized the situation in the country. </p><p>  The August putsch was a turning point in the complete collapse of the state.  After the coup attempt, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was forced to dissolve party structures such as the CPSU, SKB and others, after which he resigned, and Boris Yeltsin, the elected one, took his place.  But to save the Soviet Union did not work, the country fell apart, and the republics began to separate and proclaim themselves independent states.  So the Russian Federation appeared. </p><h2>  Legislative Assembly of the Russian Federation </h2><p>  In Russia, the first step towards democratization of the state was a nationwide referendum, which took place in December 1993.  The referendum adopted the Constitution of the Russian Federation. </p>

    <p>  The Federal Legislative Assembly is not only a representative, but also a legislative body.  He <span>exercises state power</span> throughout Russia.  <span>The State Duma</span> and the Federation Council are the two functioning bodies that make up the Legislative Assembly.  In essence, this is a permanent bicameral parliament of the Russian Federation, which is prescribed in Articles 95 and 99 of the Constitution of the country. </p><p>  The territory of Russia includes 85 entities, which include autonomous republics, regions, districts, and 86 have become Crimean Autonomous Republic. All these entities are equal.  In each of them legislative assemblies of the region are held.  The purpose of such events is the economic development of the state, the implementation of democracy.  Those deputies who work in this body defend the interests of their constituents. </p><p>  The laws of the Legislative Assembly apply to all spheres of society: budget, health, education and others.  But for them to take effect, the signature of the Governor is required. </p><p>  Like the first ever Legislative Assembly of France, the Legislative Assembly of the Russian Federation is the country's parliament.  Both of these government bodies are focused on leading the country out of the crisis.  Decisions of the Legislative Assembly are aimed at developing the state, strengthening democracy, economic growth and upholding the interests of the nation. </p>
