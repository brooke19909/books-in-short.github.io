    <h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  For each napkin, depending on its purpose, a certain thickness of threads is suitable.  Pure cotton is always preferred; fiber like iris or snowflake is ideal.  Acrylic fiber is also very widely used.  The threads can be in bobbins or skeins on which you will always find the number of grams and meters in one unit.  These parameters will help you determine the number of skeins required for a particular job.  The size of the hook will depend on the selected thickness of the thread, the thinner the thread, the lower its number.  At the initial stage, for test samples, select a thread and a hook of medium thickness.  Once you have mastered simple elements, you can use yarn of any thickness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Legend </h2><p>  Any <span>napkin crochet pattern</span> for beginners consists of certain icons, which are decrypted as follows: </p><p>  An oval is an air loop; it is obtained by pulling a thread through the previous one; </p><p>  A stick - a single crochet, is performed as follows: a loop dressed on a hook remains in place, the hook is inserted into the loop of the previous row, where it is necessary to make a column.  The working thread is captured and stretched.  On the hook, two air loops are obtained.  After that, the thread is again captured and stretched through these loops, as a result, only one remains. </p><p>  A cross or a black dot is a connecting column, designed to complete the row. </p><p>  A long stick with an inclined line is a double crochet. </p><p>  These are the simplest elements, they will be enough at the first stage of training.  Usually, a description of the napkin scheme accompanies the napkin scheme, according to which you can find out moments that are not clear in the scheme.  If you find other notations in the diagrams, it will be more complicated.  For beginners in the first stage, it is better to give preference to simpler options. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet round napkin pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/635600.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Doing the basics </h2><p>  Each crochet pattern of napkins for beginners implies the same beginning, regardless of the subsequent drawing.  A chain of air loops is knitted, the number of which is determined by the density of the product.  If a lacy napkin is supposed, a chain of eight loops will do.  If the product is dense enough, five pieces will be enough. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The resulting chain must be closed, for this, a connecting half-column is used.  In the same way, all subsequent knitting rows will end. </p><p>  The ring that you have formed during the connection is tied around the entire circumference with columns with or without crochets.  It is necessary to start work by lifting the loops, for this, three air loops are knitted at the beginning of each row that will be performed by this element. </p><p>  The second row must be performed with double crochet, therefore, as a lift, it is also necessary to knit air loops, the number of which will vary from three to five.  Knit the air loops from the base of the connection.  Then a double crochet is performed, which is located in the formed loop of the previous row.  After which two air loops are knitted, and using this technology, the elements are repeated.  The napkin crochet pattern for beginners can have another second-row combination. </p><p>  Now you can proceed directly to the drawing napkins. </p><h2>  We knit a small napkin </h2><p>  To do this, you need acrylic yarn and hook number 2. The figure shows a diagram of a small crochet napkin.  The sequence of work will be as follows: </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet of a small napkin" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/635636.jpg" width="264"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  We knit a chain of 6 air loops and connect it into a ring. </p><p>  First row.  We carry out the rise with 4 loops and start the first row, which consists of 30 double crochets. </p><p>  The second row begins with 4 air loops, knit two double crochet.  Then we make air two loops and the next two double crochets.  They are not knitted over the next column, but over the next after it.  The operation is repeated until the end of the row.  After completing the pattern, we close the knitting with a connecting column. </p><p>  In the third row, the air loops of the previous row are tied in the following combination: 2 double crochets, 2 air loops and another 2 double crochets.  Then 2 more side air loops are knitted, and the combination is repeated. </p><p>  The fourth row is performed in the following sequence: 4 lifting loops, 2 double crochet.  On the side loops of the previous row, a connecting column is made.  In the middle air loops, 3 double crochets, two loops and 3 more double crochets, a connecting column.  Repetition occurs until the end of the row. </p><p>  The fifth row is knitted identically to the fourth, only instead of connecting columns 3 air loops are performed. </p><p>  In the sixth row, the scheme of a small crochet napkin includes additional elements that will lead to an increase in the diameter of the napkin.  The row is knitted according to the fourth pattern with an increase of up to 3 double crochets, and 2 air loops are included on both sides of the connecting column. </p><p>  At this stage, you can finish knitting, you get a small napkin, if you need a larger product.  Rows 5 and 6 should be repeated, only in each next row one single crochet column and two air loops are added to the pattern. </p><h2>  Openwork napkins </h2><p>  To make a beautiful openwork napkin, you need to choose a thread as thin as possible, then you will get an exquisite product.  The <span>crocheted openwork napkin</span> scheme does not have any features.  For such a product, you will need 50 grams of yarn from 100% cotton and a hook with a maximum size of 1.5. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet lace pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/635602.jpg" width="503"></div>

    <p>  We collect a row of 8 air loops, connect into a ring in which we knit 15 columns with the crochet of the next row.  In the next row, increase the number of columns to 32. Then we continue to knit according to the pattern shown in the diagram.  The whole pattern of a lace napkin consists of 9 rows. </p><h2>  Rectangular Napkins </h2><p>  Technologies for the implementation of such products are different.  You can immediately knit a whole napkin, or you can make individual fragments or modules, and then combine them into a single whole.  The scheme of a round crochet napkin considered in the previous version is made by knitting technology in a circle.  In this case, the direction of work alternates from right to left and in the opposite direction.  Consider both options. </p><h2>  Simple rectangular napkin <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet napkins description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/635610.jpg" width="468"></div></h2><p>  The size of the finished product will be 15x20 cm. For work, you will need cotton threads of medium thickness and a hook number 1.5.  The crocheted napkin scheme has its own uniqueness, if you finish the work on the second step, you get a square napkin.  You can not stop on the presented number of circuit elements, increasing their number, the length of the product will increase to the required size.  Work begins with 64 air loops and, according to the pattern, the main drawing of the fabric is performed, the change of knitting directions is shown by arrows. </p><h2>  Modular product </h2><p>  Consider the second option.  <span>The scheme of a rectangular crochet napkin</span> is represented by two figures.  In accordance with the pattern, we perform a piece of napkin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted doily pattern" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/635599.jpg" width="334"></div>

    <p>  According to the scheme, knitting starts from the corner, and the direction of the rows changes.  After you get a square, it is tied around the perimeter with a stitch next to which the fragments will be combined into a single product. The size of the napkin will depend on the number of fragments made.  Once the required number of modules has been received, you can proceed with the assembly.  Connection points are shown in the diagram by arrows.  The resulting fabric must be tied with three rows of finishes along the entire perimeter of the scheme. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet rectangular doily pattern" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25817/635603.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Care for knitted napkins </h2><p>  Now you have the first crocheted manual work, and you need to be able to properly care for it.  The finished product after knitting is smoothed and steamed.  A napkin crochet for beginners will hold the necessary shape if slightly starched.  After prolonged use, there is a need for cleaning, it can be done in the following order: </p><p>  We release the napkin from the accumulated dust, for this we shake it. </p><p>  We prepare a soap solution, it is best to use a shampoo or liquid detergent. </p><p>  For a while, we lower the product in a soapy solution.  In no case wipes should not be rubbed. </p><p>  We rinse by lowering into clean water also without friction. </p><p>  Push-ups are carried out with a terry towel, in which a napkin is placed. </p><p>  There are two ways to dry a product.  A natural option when a napkin crochet for beginners is laid out on a towel under the press.  It is also possible to carry out drying using an iron, which will significantly speed up the process. </p>
