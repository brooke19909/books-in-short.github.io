  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Como city, Italy: photos, attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The beautiful Italian resort town of Como is located on the lake of the same name.  To visit here, and even more so to relax in these places is considered very prestigious.  No wonder wealthy Europeans are trying to buy real estate in the city of Como.  Why is he so attracted? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tourist-destinations.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Como" class="if uuid-2278938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2278938.jpg"></div><h2>  Cozy romance </h2><p>  This place is not just beautiful and cozy, here Italian romance meets aristocratic sophistication, the heavenly transparency of the lake and a magnificent view of the Alpine snow peaks. </p><p>  In this picturesque place, it is easy to relax from large industrial cities.  And why?  Perhaps because the city was preserved in the same form in which it was described in the 19th century by Italian novelist poets.  Once in the city of Como, as if transported centuries ago: the calm, measured rhythm of life is very different from the life of any modern metropolis, and the old aristocratic villas still look with their facades on the bewitching blue lake. </p><h2>  Thoughtful beauty </h2><p>  The history of the city goes back more than one century, during which time Como managed to "grow" a huge number of attractions.  Moreover, most of them are completely unlike similar places in Rome, Milan and even Venice.  The beauty in Como (Italy) is not so directional, but mysterious and attractive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  According to the assurances of tourists - from the lighthouse of Alessandro Volta on Brunate.  This is an ideal beginning to get to know the city - to view it from a bird's eye view.  The funicular from the Place de Gasperi delivers everyone here.  He works from six in the morning until half past eleven (in the summer until midnight).  The trip takes only seven minutes, but you still need to climb the mountain to the lighthouse. </p><p>  The illegitimate offspring of a priest and a local aristocrat was born in Como and lived on the lake for his whole life.  After 23 years, the first lightning rod installed by Volta appeared in the city.  He made the bell ringing to let you know about the approaching thunderstorm.  So the lighthouse is also his invention. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lakecomotravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Volta Museum" class="if uuid-2278605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2278605.jpg"></div><h2>  Volta Museum </h2><p>  The temple of <span>Alessandro Volta</span> was opened to the centenary of the great scientist, in 1927.  This is the most visited place in the city of Como (Italy).  The photo clearly shows that the building is a small copy of the Roman Pantheon.  That is, the museum of the famous physicist was created in the form of a neoclassical temple.  Only it is assembled on a reinforced concrete frame.  The Volta Museum in Como presents all the tools and instruments of the scientist, preserved documents and letters, the results of experiments and scientific publications. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Here you can see the prototype of all the power devices currently in use - the famous Volta battery. </p><h2>  Life electric </h2><p>  Another attraction of the city of Como in Italy (see photo below), dedicated to the unrivaled Alessandro Volta.  This is the notorious Life Electric - contemporary sculpture.  Extraordinary waves generated by electric current are installed on the lake.  Work on the sculpture ended just two years ago.  For tourists, it is open around the clock. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.comune.como.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Contemporary sculpture" class="if uuid-2278708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2278708.jpg"></div><h2>  City center </h2><p>  It still remains almost untouched, although the city was founded at the beginning of 59 BC.  e.  The main place of Como is Cavour Square.  The city port used to be located here, which at the end of the last century replaced the modern pier.  Life on it boils day and night.  Motor boats and cruise boats departing from the pier, transporting tourists and local residents to other coastal cities. </p><h2>  Silk museum </h2><p>  This city is famous for textile production, and for the most part - for silk fabrics.  In the museum, as the sights of the city of Como, they talk about the surprisingly modern silk manufacturing cycle and the regular improvement of technologies throughout the history of the factory.  And also about the fact that it was production that made these places so economically developed.  In fact, silk began to be made in Como in the 14th century.  Here and today there are about 800 companies involved in the coloring, design, sale and manufacture of silk products.  Almost 23,000 people work at these enterprises.  Well-known designers of our time order fabrics for the manufacture of their collections at the factories of Como.  Most of the products from Chanel, Prada, Armani, Kenzo, Versace or other famous brands were most likely made using Comas silk or in the city of Como. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Teatro Sociale </h2><p>  An amazing place for a great cultural activity.  The interior of the theater is absolutely not inferior to the famous La Scala.  Legends say that the great Nicolo Paganini once played on this scene. </p><p>  Tickets are available even on concert day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.catellanismith.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Teatro Sochiale" class="if uuid-2278976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2278976.jpg"></div><h2>  Central Temple of Duomo di Como </h2><p>  It is located on the eponymous square of the city.  For entry, it is proposed to make a voluntary-forced donation of one euro.  Usually no one regrets it.  The interior of the cathedral is amazing with its beauty.  In addition, there is a high probability of joining a service (Italy is a Catholic country) or an amazing concert of organ music. </p><p>  Work on its construction began in 1396, ended 400 years later.  The result was a grandiose work of art combining several different styles that appeared in turn.  First Gothic, characterized by severity, then the Renaissance, with its elegance and the last - magnificent Baroque. </p><p>  The cathedral was opened from half past nine to half past five in the morning (except Sunday). </p><p>  What else to see in Como?  Surely the basilica.  About twenty minutes from the center is a modest-looking basilica of St. Abbondio.  Not many dare to come in, but in vain.  Inside, a colonnade is stunningly beautiful, solemnly leading to the altar, painted in the classical style.  In such places they enjoy peace and tranquility and are imbued with the historical importance of the moment. </p><h2>  Villa Olmo </h2><p>  Naturally, it‚Äôs not good to visit the city of Como and not visit at least one of the many ancient villas of the aristocrats.  According to tourists, it's better to start with Olmo.  Moreover, it is considered a visiting card of the greatest architect of Italy - Simone Cantoni.  This is a strikingly beautiful neoclassical architectural complex with an incredible park. </p><p>  The palace was built for more than 20 years.  The Austrian emperors Ferdinand I and <span>Francis II,</span> Giuseppe Garibaldi, the queens of Sardinia, Sicily and other important persons managed to stay in it. </p><p>  At the end of the XIX century, the new owner of the villa started a grandiose repair.  As a result, it acquired its modern look: two balconies were opened, a porch and two stables were demolished, the park was ennobled. </p><p>  However, from the middle of the last century, the palazzo came under the jurisdiction of the municipality of Como.  Various city events are held here. </p><p>  The entrance is free. </p><div class="photo" data-original="viaggi.fidelityhouse.eu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Villa Olmo" class="if uuid-2278986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2278986.jpg"></div><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  There are quite a lot of them, especially dedicated to the discoveries of the era before Garibaldi and archaeological excavations.  Therefore, a true history buff will have something to do. </p><ul><li>  History Museum (Museo Storico).  The exhibits of this complex are dedicated to the history of the country of the XIX century.  This period is known for its movement for the unification of Italy.  And as they say at school, Giuseppe Garibaldi, the famous commander, played an important role in these transformations.  Among the many things in the museum there is an elegant painful helmet of a military leader. </li><li>  Pinacoteca Civica.  This is a place for art lovers.  Here is a huge collection of art attractions.  She, of course, can not be compared with the <span>Brera Pinacoteca</span> in Milan, but she will definitely appreciate the variety.  The walls of the Pinakothek show the most ancient real cave paintings, works of the Renaissance and paintings in the Art Nouveau style. </li><li>  Roman baths (Terme Romane).  These are really Roman baths, or rather, what is left of them.  This archaeological site is considered very valuable.  For it can be understood how the city of Como looked even before the birth of Alessandro Volta and his experiments. </li><li>  Archaeological Museum (Museo Archeologico Paolo Giovio).  Within its walls, experts have gathered a huge collection of antiquities.  She talks about the city from the very moment of its inception. </li></ul><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="45.8080416" data-lng="9.085179299999936" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/4/6/946.png"></div><h2>  Ancient buildings </h2><p>  The oldest church is considered to be San Carpoforo.  It was erected on the site of the temple of Mercury (built by the ancient Romans).  Near Cavour Square, the cathedral of Santa Maria Maggiore attracts attention.  He appeared here in the first half of the XIV century and is a stunning example of eclecticism, plus the Renaissance and the Gothic. </p><p>  Villa Carlotta is also historically interesting.  On its territory is the famous English park, in which statues made by the famous architects of Canova and Torvaldsen are pleasing to the eye.  And also the People‚Äôs House, which for the city of Como (Italy) has a very unusual architectural style. </p><p>  Tourists are also interested in the Municipal Palace, as it is also called - the Broletto Palace.  It was built in 1215.  According to the project, he was attached to the ancient temple (in its place is now the Cathedral).  Such close coexistence was explained by the close connection between the church and the city civil authority. </p><p>  The building is made with two styles: Romanesque and Gothic.  At the same time, on the facade you can see elements related to the Renaissance.  The palace survived several rebuildings, which led to the division of the building into an eastern wing and a western one. </p><p>  By the end of 1764, the palace became a famous theater in the city, and even years later a store was opened in it. </p><p>  In the middle of the last century, in the palace, in fact, the first restoration work took place.  Today, it holds ceremonies of various kinds: art exhibitions, conferences, concerts, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thousandwonders.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Como Bird's Eye View" class="if uuid-2279013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2279013.jpg"></div><h2>  Lake Como </h2><p>  Which city appeared on it first is not known for certain.  But if you take into account the curious shape of the reservoir and the unique climatic conditions, it is clear why well-known personalities have been trying to settle here since ancient times. </p><p>  The lake is surrounded by mountains, and perhaps that is why he had to stretch in three directions.  In the bird's eye view, the pond is very similar to a slingshot. </p><p>  The deepest place of the lake is 410 meters.  Three rivers feed it. </p><p>  The species diversity of vegetation in these places is very large.  The air temperature in the vicinity of the lake rarely drops below zero.  But the water is cool in the summer.  The reason for this is a lot of cold bottom keys. </p><p>  There is a small island on Como - Komachina.  Once it was used to protect the coastal territory, today this place was chosen by connoisseurs of art.  Tourists always try to get to the island and, if possible, acquire paintings with landscapes, both of modern reality and medieval ruins (the remains of an ancient fortress and basilica named after St. Eufemia). </p><p>  In addition to artists, these attractions of the city of Como (Italy) and screenwriters fascinate.  In these places such famous films were filmed as "Ocean's Twelve", one of the parts of "Star Wars" and "Casino Royale". </p><p>  Well, and then suddenly find yourself on an island, be sure to try the local dishes in a single tavern.  His menu has always been several decades. </p><p>  By the way, the lake has another name that came from ancient Roman literature - Lario. </p><h2>  If for everything about everything - one day </h2><p>  Experienced tourists are not advised to spend all the time in museums and temples.  In the city of Como (see photo in the article) it is very important to have time to enjoy its main value - amazing landscapes.  A day can be planned like this: </p><ul><li>  At nine in the morning on the shore of an awakening lake, drink a cup of freshly brewed cappuccino with a crispy croissant. </li><li>  Having received a charge of unprecedented vigor, (and judging by the reviews, Italian coffee invigorates quite seriously), it is time to "climb" the mountain with a lighthouse.  About forty minutes go up, and a little more for inspection. </li><li>  Closer to one in the afternoon, the ideal time for a boat trip on the lake.  It is good to choose the nearest city and buy a ferry ticket.  For example, in Cernobbio. </li><li>  Here, on one of the most beautiful streets, you must definitely go to the cafe and taste delicious dishes of both well-known Italian cuisine and amazing regional cuisine. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.slh.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Como Cafe" class="if uuid-2279000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44017/2279000.jpg"></div><ul><li>  If you don‚Äôt feel like leaving, you can go to Erba‚Äôs villa.  This is an improvised exhibition complex. </li><li>  Toward evening, upon returning to the city, there is enough time left to enjoy a visit to the Duomo, wander the streets and end the day with a delicious dinner with a glass of real Italian wine. </li></ul><h2>  Flying club </h2><p>  It, of course, is not a tourist attraction.  But flying over such a beautiful lake is only possible here.  The club has an official site.  On it you can find a phone number or email address for which ticket reservations are available.  Impressions guaranteed awesome! </p>
