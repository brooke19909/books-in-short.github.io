The birth of fascism as an ideology dates back to the end of the 19th century.  It was then that writers and philosophers appeared who propagated the ideas that formed the basis of the policies of Hitler and Mussolini. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.slate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="history of fascism" class="if uuid-2452341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2452341.jpg"></div><h2>  Origin of the term </h2><p>  Translated from Italian, ‚Äúfascism‚Äù means ‚Äúbundle‚Äù, ‚Äúbundle‚Äù, ‚Äúunion‚Äù.  Quite harmless words.  However, the rise of fascism led to the genocide of the Jewish people and World War II.  In the USSR, after the Second World War, the term was long associated with Germany.  The words ‚Äúfascist‚Äù and ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù were perceived by many in the Soviet Union almost as synonyms.  But the foundation of fascism as a political movement was laid in the homeland of Mussolini. </p><p>  It was in Italy at the end of the 19th century that various radical political groups arose, using fascia as a symbol - bunches of birch or elm twigs, tied with a red cord.  Initially, fasces was an attribute of the power of rulers in ancient Rome. </p><h2>  Friedrich Nietzsche </h2><p>  According to historians, Nietzsche's theses played a decisive role in the birth of fascism.  Soviet researchers called him "immoral singer of cruelty."  He preached war and praised social inequality as an engine of culture.  It was the postulates of his theory that led to the birth of fascism and Nazism.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa superman is the main culprit for the emergence of a political movement that led to World War II.  Such is the widespread opinion about the role of Nietzsche in the formation of fascist ideas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nevertheless, some modern scholars, including Russian ones, believe that the theories of the German philosopher were National Socialists distorted beyond recognition.  Basic information about the origin of fascism should be sought in the history of Fin de si√®cle.  And what does this French phrase mean, is described below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Friedrich Nietzsche" class="if uuid-2452365" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2452365.jpg"></div><h2>  Fin de si√®cle </h2><p>  Translated from French, this term means "doomsday".  Findesk√∂l is the common name for social and cultural phenomena characteristic of the end of the 19th century.  In the last decades of the century, writers, poets and philosophers appeared, in whose works there was euphoria in anticipation of the future.  At the same time, fear of the future was also observed in society.  Doubtful people increasingly started talking about the ephemeral nature of being, and, as often happens in the last years of the century, generated myths about the end of the world. </p><p>  The characteristic features of Fin de si√®cle are individualism, a rejection of social moral standards.  In order to avoid a catastrophe, many thought, one should come up with a new theory - a theory that can save humanity.  Prominent thinkers of this period were Max Nordau, Hans Delbr√ºck, Benedetto Croce and, of course, Friedrich Nietzsche.  The concept of the latter‚Äôs superman had a huge impact on public opinion and the rise of fascism in Italy and Germany. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Background </h2><p>  The lawyer and sociologist Gaetano Mosca developed a theory according to which, in every society, there is an organized minority and an unorganized majority.  The first dominates the second.  The birth of fascism in Germany and Italy was influenced by the ideas of Charles Morras.  The French thinker promoted integral nationalism, which calls for the organic unity of the nation.  His compatriot Georges Sorel - radical measures to overthrow the bourgeoisie and capitalism. </p><h2>  The reasons for the rise of fascism </h2><p>  The war caused a revival of nationalism in most European countries.  The political movement, based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe superiority of one nation over another, was used to mobilize people to achieve victory.  In peacetime, it was necessary to strengthen the foundations of the newly formed states. </p><p>  Nationalism has become a lifesaver for those who lost in the war.  For those who considered themselves offended and looked for the guilty.  The greatest humiliation in the First World War was experienced by the Germans.  But, as already mentioned, the birthplace of fascism is Italy.  The birth of this movement inspired the representatives of the National Socialists in Germany.  German fascism ultimately surpassed Italian. </p><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe superiority of a certain nation over others sooner or later spills into impatience, aggression, as evidenced by the events of 1939-1945.  The creation of the theory of the exclusiveness of the people is the reason for the rise of fascism in Europe.  But not the only one.  Such ideas could resonate with citizens only in difficult times.  For example, during the economic crisis that swept the world in the twenties.  The fascist movement was developed not only in Italy and Germany, but also in a number of other countries.  But it was in these states that such active figures as Hitler and Mussolini came to power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.vox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fascist Germany" class="if uuid-2452373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2452373.jpg"></div><h2>  Battle of Caporetto </h2><p>  Prerequisites for the emergence and development of fascism - defeat <span>in the First World War.</span>  <span>Italy,</span> together with Russia, Britain and France, fought against Germany and England.  In 1917, the <span>Italian army</span> was defeated at the Battle of Caporetto.  The Austrians suddenly broke through the French position, which caused panic and confusion.  Italy lost part of its territory, in addition, was forced to abandon the dream of new lands.  It was a rout, after which the country almost ceased to participate in the war. </p><p>  The defeat at Caporetto plunged the Italian ruling circles into gloom.  Several hundred soldiers simply refused to fight, preferring desertion or captivity.  The results of the Battle of Caporetto showed the world the military weakness of Italy.  But even in this difficult period, there were people who called for rallying and protecting the homeland.  One of them was 36-year-old journalist Benito Mussolini.  It is noteworthy that in his youth he was a socialist and an opponent of war.  In 1914 he turned into an ardent militarist. </p><p>  When Italy entered the war, Mussolini voluntarily went to the front.  In defeat at Caporetto, the future leader of the Italian fascist movement blamed his comrades, gripped by anti-war sentiment.  He also hated the Vatican and the Catholic pacifists.  He considered them traitors who stabbed his country in the back. </p><p>  The enemies of the nation undermined the military spirit of the Italian army - as Mussolini and his like-minded people thought, of whom there were few more during the First World War.  The humiliation under Caporetto turned some political and public figures into militant nationalists. </p><p>  The crisis in Italy Formally, the country won the war (at the expense of the Allies).  But the situation of ordinary residents became harder every day.  Difficulties were both economic and social in nature.  The rise of fascism can be summarized as follows: people who were on the verge of poverty were ready to cling to a national idea, which, as dictators claimed, would lead to a new, happy, comfortable life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Battle of Caporetto" class="if uuid-2452407" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2452407.jpg"></div><p>  But there would have been neither National Socialism, nor yet another, most terrible war, if at some point there had not been speakers in power capable of instilling a crowd of militaristic ideas.  In the rise of fascism, the histories of the rise of Hitler and Mussolini play an important role.  Let's recall interesting facts from the biography of the leader of the Italian NFP. </p><h2>  The son of a militant socialist </h2><p>  A man who wore the title of Duce, and in April 1945 was executed near the outskirts of the village of Mezzegra, was born in 1883 in the province of Forl√¨-Cesena, in the family of blacksmith craftsmen.  Mother was a devout Catholic.  Father is an ardent socialist.  Mussolini Sr. also adhered to nationalist ideas.  He had a huge impact on his son. </p><div class="photo" data-original="skepticism.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini" class="if uuid-2452397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2452397.jpg"></div><p>  Already in 1900, Benito joined the ranks of the socialist party.  After graduating from high school, he got a job as a teacher, but in the teaching field was not successful.  He spent several years in Switzerland, and when he returned to his homeland, broke up with the socialists. </p><h2>  Nationalist journalist </h2><p>  At the beginning of World War I, Mussolini changed position.  While working as a journalist, he wrote articles riddled with militaristic and nationalist theories.  Then he began to travel around the country with public appearances.  After the war, Mussolini finally became convinced of the collapse of socialism and joined the fascist movement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="italy4.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="benito mussolini" class="if uuid-2452427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2452427.jpg"></div><h2>  In power </h2><p>  The fascist organization was founded in January 1915.  Mussolini's political career began in 1917.  Thanks to his categorical judgment of the "strong hand", which is necessary for the Italian people, he quickly gained fans.  In the early twenties, he already firmly held a position in Italian politics.  However, Mussolini had many opponents.  Their number was reduced by the repressions that began in 1924. </p><h2>  Germany in the 20s </h2><p>  In 1929, the global economic crisis began.  In the same year, the Communists won the election in Germany.  Meanwhile, the National Socialist Party was gaining popularity.  In 1932, the number of unemployed in Germany reached six million.  The Communists did not keep their promises - for four years they failed to get the country out of the crisis.  Dissatisfaction grew.  The Germans needed a new leader, tougher and more decisive.  And he soon appeared.  They became Adolf Hitler, who, like Mussolini, participated in the First World War.  Then they were on opposite sides of the barricades.  But in 15 years, much has changed. </p><p>  After winning the election in 1933, Hitler wrote a letter to Mussolini expressing admiration for the policies of the Italian leader.  But there were obstacles to the rapprochement of these two dictators.  <span>Benito Mussolini</span> admitted the likelihood of a Jewish threat, but, unlike Hitler, considered the unnecessary provocation of international Jewry unreasonable.  And the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsterilizing the representatives of "inferior" peoples for Italy was completely unacceptable - the Catholic society did not lose force even after the establishment of the <span>fascist regime.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="igcseedexcelhistorynazigermany.weebly.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Germany economic crisis" class="if uuid-2452417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2452417.jpg"></div><h2>  Adolf Gitler </h2><p>  Originating in Italy, fascism developed in Germany, whose inhabitants suffered more from the outcome of the First World War than Italians.  It is not known how history would have developed if the born speaker Adolf Hitler had not won the election in 1933. </p><p>  For over fifteen years, Germany has experienced terrible unemployment.  Hitler saved his compatriots from this disaster, and then launched large-scale actions to help the needy population.  He managed to improve the quality of life of the Germans and, as a result, gain their trust.  A significant role was played by oratorical talent, in which Hitler had no equal.  Each of his speeches was accompanied by cheers.  And he usually spoke of revenge for defeat in the First World War. </p><p>  Hitler first banned the Communist and then the Social Democratic parties.  He sent all those who disagree to concentration camps.  An important part of German fascism was anti-Semitism.  Pogroms, arrests, executions began.  The solution of the "Jewish question" led to genocide, and since 1939 the operation "endlezung" has already been carried out outside of Germany. </p>
