Many decide to tie some kind of thing with their own hands.  Well, what can be done for representatives of the strong half of humanity and, most importantly, how?  The best knitting ideas for men with a detailed and step-by-step master class are offered in the current article. </p><h2>  Measures required for knitting sweaters </h2><p>  The most popular products for men are those that are worn on the upper body.  For example, cardigans, <span>sweaters, sweaters</span> and more.  To tie a similar product with your own hands, you need to measure a person or a suitable thing from his wardrobe.  To do this, prepare a centimeter tape, notebook and pencil.  After that, draw an indicative pattern, according to which we will then knit for the man, and indicate the following parameters on it: </p><ul><li>  chest circumference; </li><li>  jacket length; </li><li>  the height or level of the armhole; </li><li>  sleeve length; </li><li>  neck width. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knit for men step by step" class="if uuid-2923812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2923812.jpg"></div><h2>  Options for knitting hats </h2><p>  If the needlewoman is not ready to knit a sweater, you can practice a simpler product.  One of the lightweight options is a hat.  To make a simple product with your own hands, you need to measure the head of a loved one or take measurements from the finished hat that he wears.  There are only two necessary parameters: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Caps Circumference.  The head circumference over the eyebrows is measured with an elastic centimeter. </li><li>  Cap depth.  The distance from the top of one ear to a similar place in the other is determined.  Moreover, it is important that the centimeter passes exactly through the crown.  The resulting value is divided into two. </li></ol><p>  If knitting a hat for a man involves taking measurements from the finished product, you just need to measure the circumference of the lower edge and the distance from it to the dome of the hat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.coolkadin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to tie a man" class="if uuid-2923737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2923737.jpg"></div><h2>  How to convert centimeters to loops and rows? </h2><p>  The obtained parameters do not greatly facilitate the work of the needlewoman, since knitting, constantly checking with the finished product or centimeter, is extremely inconvenient.  But you can pre-calculate the desired values.  To do this, you need to tie a pattern.  It should be a square with a side of 10 cm, knitted precisely by those knitting needles and yarn that are prepared for the intended product.  In the finished fragment, the number of loops and rows should be calculated.  Then divide all measures by ten.  And then multiply horizontal ones by the number of loops in the sample, and vertical ones by the number of rows. </p><p>  Thus, we will determine the required number of rows and loops for knitting.  For a man who prefers knitwear, a product made with love and suitable in size will be the best gift. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to knit a jumper? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="stylehaus.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="men's jacket" class="if uuid-2923698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2923698.jpg"></div><p>  To fulfill the plan, it is necessary to prepare ring spokes.  Then dial on them the number of loops equal to 1/2 the circumference of the chest.  Knit a flat fabric with the selected pattern to the very top edge.  After closing the loops in the usual way, getting as a result of their actions a knitted rectangle.  Now, in a similar way, you need to connect the second.  And sew two parts, leaving holes for the head and hands.  Next, take the hook and dial new loops throughout the armhole.  Transfer them to hosiery knitting needles and knit, moving in a circle, a sleeve of the desired length.  At the end, switch to smaller knitting needles or make a small elastic band to highlight the cuffs.  The next step in knitting a sweater for a man will be the second sleeve using the same technology.  In conclusion, you can crochet the gate or leave it in its original form. </p><h2>  How to make a sweater? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="men's sweater" class="if uuid-2923712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2923712.jpg"></div><p>  To surprise your beloved with such an item of clothing, you must act on the same technology that we described in the previous paragraph.  However, the main difference between a sweater and a sweater is pretty commonplace.  The first model of the sweater is designed in a tight version, while the second version should not fit the body.  Therefore, before starting to knit a sweater for a man, it is important to add ten to fifteen extra loops when typing.  It is also recommended to use a denser or even woolen yarn.  In addition, it should be noted that most models are distinguished by a stand-up collar.  To supplement your product with them, you need to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Using the hook, dial new loops around the collar. </li><li>  Spread them on hosiery knitting needles. </li><li>  And knit the desired number of rows with an elastic band. </li><li>  Then we proceed to a very important stage in the implementation of sweaters for men.  The description of knitting with this product requires the preparation of tools of three different sizes.  Now we need to switch from basic to medium.  And add two rows. </li><li>  Next, using the smallest knitting needles, knit two more rows. </li><li>  Finally, close all the loops in the usual way. </li></ol><h2>  How to make a cardigan? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="men's cardigan" class="if uuid-2923717" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2923717.jpg"></div><p>  It‚Äôs also easy to associate a fashionable jacket model for a loved one.  However, for performance it is better to choose not wool yarn, but, for example, acrylic, microfiber, nylon, in extreme cases, wool mixture.  In this case, knitting a model for men is best done as follows: </p><ol><li>  Draw on the ring needles the number of loops equal to the full girth of the chest. </li><li>  Knit with an even cloth. </li><li>  Having reached the level of the armhole, select the hinges for the back and two front shelves. </li><li>  After that, tie each part separately. </li><li>  It is important to note that on the front shelves you will have to reduce the loops to make a v-neck.  To do this, we divide the number of loops equal to the width of the neck into two, and then into the rows allotted for the gate.  Thus, we find out how many loops should be reduced in each row to make a uniform and accurate gate. </li><li>  Finally, we sew the product along the shoulder seams and complement the sleeves. </li></ol><h2>  How to knit a hat? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mycrochet.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting for men" class="if uuid-2923695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2923695.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the description, knitting for men with knitting needles or crochet is quite simple.  Therefore, further we offer one more instruction.  However, it is immediately worth noting that male models should be more restrained.  That is, it is more reasonable for them to choose simple patterns and calm colors.  Traditionally, hats for men are knitted with an elastic band.  The best option is one on one and two on two.  It is better not to include braids and harnesses.  This option is more suitable for a teenager.  Regarding colors, experts also give a recommendation.  For adult men, it is better to use brown, black or gray yarn.  And for the guys - blue, green, burgundy, emerald.  When the necessary materials and tools are ready, we collect on the ring needles the number of loops equal to the circumference of the head and knit seven to ten rows with an elastic band.  After we go to the selected pattern or continue what we started.  When there are eight rows left, we go to the creative stage of knitting hats for men: </p><ol><li>  First, subtract six from the total number of loops, divide the rest by eight. </li><li>  As a result, we find out how many loops need to be reduced in each row. </li><li>  We complete the product by uniformly reducing excess loops. </li><li>  When at the end there are six, we break off the thread and with the help of a hook we pull it through them. </li><li>  Tie and fasten from the wrong side. </li></ol><p>  If desired, a youth hat can be supplemented with a pompom or a brush, and a product for an adult man is best left unadorned. </p><h2>  If a beautiful lady only learns to knit </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen are not at all difficult to complete any of the presented models.  But for beginners it will not be easy to knit for men.  The description will seem too sophisticated and confusing.  As a result, it will not be possible to please the beloved with a thing made by oneself.  Therefore, we offer a simpler workshop.  It will help to knit an original scarf. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="we knit for a man" class="if uuid-2923693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2923693.jpg"></div><p>  To make this product, you need to prepare any knitting needles and yarn.  Then dial an arbitrary number of loops and knit the fabric of the desired length.  The product can be varied with an elastic band, front stitch or garter stitch.  If you want to use the original pattern, you can alternate the back and front loops in each row.  Also, if you wish, it is easy to beat your idea with color, alternating different shades of yarn.  The ends of the finished scarf can be decorated with tassels or pompons. </p><p>  Surprising a man with a hand-made thing is very simple.  It is only necessary to have the corresponding desire and approach the implementation of ideas creatively. </p>
