  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a slow cooker</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, on the shelves of equipment stores you can find many helpers for the kitchen.  The most popular are multicookers.  The crock-pot is a modern convenient assistant in the kitchen for every housewife.  The crock-pot appeared relatively recently and has already managed to win the hearts of many women.  After all, it is possible to cook a lot of varied, tasty and healthy dishes in it, and most importantly save time. </p><p>  If you have already decided to eat healthy food, then the slow cooker is for you.  Now you should decide on the model, and make the right choice.  What needs to be emphasized when buying a multicooker? </p><ol><li>  First, the most important thing is to pay attention to power.  The more powerful your multicooker is, the faster the food will cook in it.  But this does not mean that you need to choose the most powerful model, but just need to choose the "middle ground". </li><li>  Secondly, you need to pay attention to security.  The cord should be well attached to the multicooker, and there should also be a soft steam release system to avoid burns. </li><li>  Thirdly, it is necessary to pay attention to the volume of the bowl.  It should be selected based on the number of people in the family.  On average, the volume of the multicooker bowl should be 4-5 liters.  This will be enough for the average family.  At 5 liters you can cook a good dinner or bake a delicious cake of medium size. </li><li>  Fourth, pay attention to the inner coating of the multicooker bowl.  The lifetime of the device will depend on this.  There are three types of coatings: </li></ol><ul><li>  Teflon or non-stick - around this coating are still debated about its safety and impact on the human body.  But if you choose a high-quality Teflon coating, then there will be no harm.  Teflon is dangerous when heated to a high temperature above 220 degrees.  But in any slow cooker there are limitations.  It must be remembered that if any cracks or scratches appear on the surface of the multicooker bowl, it is forbidden to use it.  Therefore, you need to take care of the non-stick coating very carefully. </li><li>  The ceramic coating is considered the most fragile and wears out quickly, so care for such a coating must be carefully and carefully.  Ceramics are very sensitive to a sharp change in temperature and stains from various dyes can remain on the surface.  But this is not a poor coating quality, but just such a feature. </li><li>  The most durable bowl is considered to be a bowl with a marble coating.  Care for such a bowl is minimal. </li></ul><ol><li>  Fifth, you need to pay attention to the material from which the multicooker bowl is made.  It can be - aluminum or stainless steel.  The stainless steel bowl will heat up for a long time and besides, the heating will not be uniform.  The stainless steel is afraid of acid and therefore it can be oxidized.  And some people may be allergic to nickel, which is contained in it.  A bowl of aluminum or its alloys will be much more preferable and stronger. </li><li>  Sixth, you need to choose the modes that are right for you.  But you do not need to choose a multicooker with many incomprehensible functions for you.  Because of this, the price may be higher.  The slow cooker should have a deep fat fryer, a yogurt maker, as well as: </li></ol><ul><li>  The delay timer is a very convenient feature that will allow you to cook meals without human intervention.  You just need to put all the necessary ingredients and put the right time for you. </li><li>  Preheat or reheat - with this function you can reheat any dish to the desired temperature. </li><li>  The soaking function is useful to those housewives who like legume dishes. </li></ul><p>  And with regard to color, size and shape - this is only to your preference.  The most important thing is that the multicooker saves you from unnecessary trouble, and does not add a lot of new ones. </p></div></article>
