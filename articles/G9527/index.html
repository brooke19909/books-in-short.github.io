    <p>  The biography of Elizabeth Taylor is rich and interesting.  Until the last days of her life, she was in the center of attention, despite the fact that in recent decades she almost never acted in film.  The attention of the public was attracted not only by the work - icons of the cinema, but also by the vicissitudes of her personal life.  The actress has more than 60 films, 8 marriages and 7 spouses.  Actor <span>Richard Burton</span> managed to lead Elizabeth twice down the aisle and divorce twice. </p><p>  The actress was born into the family of Sarah W. Wombrodt and Francis L. Taylor on February 27, 1932.  Her parents were American actors who worked at that time in London.  Probably this was the reason for the skepticism of critics about the early acting abilities of Elizabeth Taylor.  Her biography as an actress began in 1942.  And after the release of the drama "National Velvet" in 1944, its first glory came.  It is worth noting that in 2003 this tape was included in the National Register of Films. <em></em></p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

After filming the drama Place in the Sun, in which Taylor played with Montgomery Clift, critics dramatically changed their minds about it.  The films “Suddenly Last Summer” and “The Cat on a Hot Roof”, filmed based on the plays of Tennessee Williams, are her first confident steps to the heights of fame.  Films with Elizabeth Taylor have become very popular.  These are cult tapes “Giant”, “The Taming of the Shrew”, “Aivengo”, “Father of the Bride”, “Butterfield 8”, “Little Women” and many others.

    <p>  In the "golden age" of Hollywood, Elizabeth became his symbol.  And this is not surprising.  She had a unique gift: the ability to intuitively predict the behavior of her heroine on the screen and embody this vision.  She worked amazingly, and in 1961 it was she who was offered the role of Cleopatra in the historical film of the same name, for which she received an unprecedented fee. </p>

The budget of the film was $ 44 million, a record amount for those times, and won 4 Oscars.  And the biography of Elizabeth Taylor was replenished with another marriage, the result of a stormy romance that broke out on the set with Richard Burton, who played Mark Anthony. <em></em>

It was impossible to predict the fate of her next screen work, and even more so her actions in her personal life. </p><p>  After filming in 1976, Taylor did not work for a long time in the musical fairy tale film “The Blue Bird” based on the play by M. Meterlink.  Her last appearance on the screen in 1994 was the comedy The Flintstones.  The American Film Institute in 1999 placed Elizabeth in seventh place on the list of the greatest movie stars. </p><p>  Elizabeth loved beauty, jewelry and luxury.  The most famous fashion designers sewed her outfits; her jewelry was not just jewelry, but rather a museum rarity.  The appearance of Taylor in high society receptions was admired even by women.  Passion for luxury did not stop her from giving quite large amounts to charity. </p>

    <p>  The name of the legendary actress and after her death brings fabulous incomes.  Elizabeth Taylor in 2012 became the new “queen” in the list of 13 Forbes celebrities who died.  The lion's share of her "income" was obtained at Christie's auction for the sale of actress's outfits, a collection of jewelry, and works of art.  Revenue amounted to 184 million dollars.  The rest of the profits came from the sale of her real estate and films.  White Diamonds, a brand of perfume owned by Elizabeth, also continues to generate revenue.  In 2011, the profit amounted to $ 75 million. </p><p>  The biography of Elizabeth Taylor, the incomparable Cleopatra of the screen, was described in N. Schonberger and S. Kashner's book Furious Love.  Martin Scorsese plans to shoot a biography of the actress. </p>
