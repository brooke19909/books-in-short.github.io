    <h2>  Guests about service </h2><p>  Many tourists were impressed by Aqaba in good terms.  Radisson Blu Tala Bay Resort, of course, is no exception.  The guests pay special attention to the guests.  It can be said to be impeccable.  All guests are treated with respect and attention, always sincerely and friendly smile.  The waiters are incredibly fast, they do not make customers wait, even if there are a lot of people in the restaurant. </p><p>  Chefs and administration are trying to please the guests with gastronomic diversity.  Baking, sweets and fruits abound, as well as different types of meat and fish.  It serves good beer, good wines and other drinks.  All in abundance.  It seems to some monotonous, but it's all individual.  The main thing is that everything is tasty and of high quality. </p><p>  They clean the rooms well, changing towels and linen on demand - to change, just drop it on the floor.  Tips, by the way, are taken. </p><h2>  Who is the hotel suitable for? </h2><p>  This hotel is a good option for couples or single tourists.  People with children rarely go here, since for the latter there is not a very convenient beach here.  There is no special approach, the depth begins almost immediately, and there are also reefs.  Many also noticed that in these places there are quite a lot of smokers, which parents complain about taking care of their children's health.  And the place is busy, you can‚Äôt count on calmness - life is in full swing here.  But for adults there is everything you need. </p><p>  By the way, it was said above that you cannot bring purchased food and drinks to the room with you outside the hotel.  This is true, but if you believe the reviews of many adults and smart people, no one examines the entrance, because something compact can be hidden in a casual bag. </p>

    <h2>  What else you need to know about vacation </h2><p>  <span>Radisson</span> Blu <span>Hotel</span> is located in a very good location.  The underwater world here is beautiful - you must definitely swim with a mask.  And it is better to go into the sea (in those places where the reefs) in special shoes, otherwise there is a risk of stepping on sharp corals.  But the underwater world will delight tourists with sea snakes, <span>balloons, lionfish,</span> sea ‚Äã‚Äãanemones, tridacs and motley fish.  It is also worth remembering that there are many sea urchins near the shore.  Therefore, travelers warn that shoes for entering the sea must be taken, even if the plans do not include a walk to the reefs. </p><p>  And yet, as noted by the reviews, everyone should sign up for a bus to Aqaba.  He walks from the hotel for free.  In the evening there is very beautiful.  And in Aqaba you can buy numerous gifts, souvenirs, fruits, coffee and sweets.  And, of course, it is here that Petra is located - an ancient city, which is one of the new seven wonders of the world. </p><p>  If we conclude, then we can say that this hotel is a good option for people who want to relax on the Red Sea, in a hotel with decent service and get a lot of vivid impressions.  Recently, an increasing number of people have become interested in Jordan, because you won‚Äôt be able to go to Egypt, and your desire to relax will not disappear.  And Radisson Blu is a really good choice. </p>
