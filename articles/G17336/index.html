    <p>  Like Ninel, the reviews this hotel received from residents were not particularly good.  Of course, the rooms rented in it for real suites do not pull.  However, living in this hotel, according to many visitors, is still a little more convenient than in Ninel.  In any case, the Internet at the Versailles Hotel works well, and the staff here are very polite. </p><h2>  Economy Kherson Hotels: Welcome Home </h2><p>  This hotel is located at ul.  Tchaikovsky, d. 60. If desired, visitors can rent here standard or comfort class rooms.  Guests at the Welcome Home are allowed to stay with pets (by prior arrangement).  All rooms are classically decorated and equipped with modern TVs and air conditioning.  Showers and balconies are available in all rented rooms.  For the convenience of the ambassadors, the hotel, among other things, provides for a small dining area, equipped with everything necessary for self-cooking. </p><p>  Kherson hotels can be comfortable or not very.  The Welcome Home Hotel praises most of its former guests.  The advantages of this complex are, first of all, that its residents can use Wi-Fi, billiard room and sauna for free.  The staff of this hotel, like its rooms, tourists in most cases praise.  The disadvantages of the hotel, its guests consider mainly only the lack of signs (the hotel is difficult to find). </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Non Stop </h2><p>  These are the economical Kherson hotels in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe bus station.  Close the list of such centers, we decided to hotel-restaurant Non Stop.  It is rather difficult to attribute it to complexes of the economy class.  However, the cheapest comfort rooms here are only about 900 p.  per night, which, of course, is not so much.  You can also rent junior suites, suites and apartments at this hotel. </p><p>  In the center there is a guarded free parking and service stations.  Wi-Fi network is also what this complex offers its guests (like many other Kherson hotels).  Sweet sleep is provided to residents at Non Stop Hotel with orthopedic mattresses on comfortable beds.  Reviews about this complex on the network are mostly good.  It is located at: Nikolaevskoe highway, 4 km. </p>
