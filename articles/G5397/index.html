Nevertheless, those who want to buy a house have no choice but to accumulate a huge amount of money to buy an apartment is almost impossible.  However, there are pitfalls.  Even if a mortgage loan is issued, citizens need to make an initial payment (PV), the amount of which is up to 30% of the price of the apartment. </p><p>  And what about those who do not have money for the initial payment?  In this case, it remains to try to arrange a mortgage in Yekaterinburg without a down payment.  Large banks have programs that issue such loans, but in this case it is necessary to take into account several important nuances. </p>

    <h2>  Features of obtaining a mortgage without a loan in Sberbank </h2><p>  In this institution, you can really get a mortgage on pretty favorable terms.  However, it is worth considering that in Sberbank of Yekaterinburg a mortgage without an initial payment represents the amount of money that a citizen receives to repay a loan taken earlier in another credit institution.  This means that a person does not need to invest his own savings, but rather to arrange a loan in another bank and use it as a PV. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To obtain a mortgage at Sberbank, you must confirm your solvency and provide a certificate in the form of 2-NDFL. </p><h2>  Mortgage at Otkritie Bank </h2><p>  This is another reliable organization in which you can take out a loan without PV.  For those who wish to apply for a mortgage in Yekaterinburg without a down payment, the Mortgage Plus program is available.  According to her, you can get a loan and not make the initial amount of money in the future apartment. </p>

    <p>  The interest rate will be 13.5% per annum.  Accordingly, if a resident of a city prepares a loan for 5 million rubles, then every month he will pay about <span>60,500 rubles.</span>  Based on this, the total overpayment for 20 years will be about 9 million rubles. </p><h2>  Gazprombank </h2><p>  ‚ÄúRefinancing‚Äù from this bank is a program that gives citizens the opportunity to move into new housing without initial payments.  Mortgage terms without a down payment in Yekaterinburg are quite favorable.  If a citizen takes on credit an apartment worth 5 million rubles, then the monthly payment will be 50 thousand rubles.  In this case, the interest rate will be lower than that of Sberbank.  It will be 10.25%.  Accordingly, the final overpayment for 20 years will be no more than 6.7 million rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Standard conditions for obtaining a mortgage without a down payment in Yekaterinburg </h2><p>  To better understand what to expect from a credit institution, consider the standard situation.  Suppose a resident of a city decided to contact a certain bank and he was offered the program ‚ÄúHousing loan‚Äù.  According to him, a mortgage in Yekaterinburg without a down payment will differ in the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  Loan term up to 20 years. </li><li>  The loan amount can be up to 100% of the total cost of the apartment.  However, the amount of cash will directly depend on the level of income of the borrower. </li><li>  As collateral, property is registered (it can also be a car, securities, etc.) of the citizen himself or his relatives. </li><li>  Guarantors should be from 1 to 4 people.  In this matter, it all depends on the amount of the loan.  If a citizen takes no more than 300 thousand rubles, then it is enough to invite only one guarantor.  With a loan amount of more than 300 thousand rubles, 2 people will be required, etc. </li><li>  The age of borrowers must not exceed 65 years at the time of making the final payment. </li><li>  A citizen must have a permanent place of work, where he has been working for at least 6 months. </li></ul>

    <p>  It is also worth paying attention to the fact that taking a mortgage in Yekaterinburg without a down payment is not the only option that avoids the enormous cost of an initial payment for an apartment. </p><h2>  Exchange </h2><p>  Today, the trade-in is in great demand, since in this case, you can use existing housing as a PV.  In this case, you do not have to wait until the apartment is bought.  In fact, the borrower's housing is overbought by the bank itself against future mortgage payments. </p>

    <p>  However, such services are far from being available at all banks.  Sometimes the exchange is carried out by a real estate agency.  In this case, you should be more careful and carefully choose an agent, since today in this area there are many scammers. </p><h2>  Interest-free installments </h2><p>  If the bank of Yekaterinburg failed to get a mortgage without an initial payment, then it will be much more profitable and easier to invest in real estate under construction.  At the same time, the buyer does not have to overpay a certain percentage to the bank annually throughout his life.  Thus, the final cost of new housing will not double. </p><p>  The only drawback of this method of purchase is that it will be possible to enter a new apartment only after a few months or even years, when the house is finally completed.  However, given that this method will save several million rubles, then this period can be quite lived in a rented apartment. </p>

    <p>  Also, if you refuse a mortgage without a down payment in Yekaterinburg in favor of interest-free installments, all risks must be taken into account.  For example, the developer may not deliver the property on time or simply freeze the construction.  Such problems are common.  Therefore, before issuing securities, it is necessary to carefully study the contract from the developer and make sure that all these nuances are written in it. </p><h2>  Mortgages from partner banks </h2><p>  If a citizen is a client of Brusnika, then when registering a mortgage at VTB 24, he may receive a special offer.  According to it, the interest rate per annum can be reduced by 0.5% of the base value. </p><p>  In addition, it is worth paying attention to such promotions as ‚ÄúMore meters - less bid‚Äù.  This offer allows you to reduce the rate by 1%.  In this case, the citizen must purchase an apartment or any other real estate, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich will be at least 65 m <sup>2</sup> . </p>

    <p>  Since the conditions for such promotions are not summarized, it is necessary to carefully study all the proposed programs and choose the most profitable option. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Each bank provides different <span>conditions for mortgage lending.</span>  In some of them, the length of service of the borrower should be at least several months, and in others - 4-5 years.  The same goes for other conditions.  For residents of the Russian Federation, it is most important to study interest rates on loans.  In some cases, it is much more profitable to make an initial payment and pay a smaller percentage of the transaction amount than not to make an initial payment and ultimately overpay the bank several million rubles more.  That is why, when deciding to take a mortgage or a loan for an apartment, it is worth visiting all available organizations and clarifying their terms of the transaction. </p>
