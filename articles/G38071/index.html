    <h2>  Success </h2><p>  In the period from 1966 to 1970, Kosygin's plans were actively implemented.  This five-year plan is considered the most successful in the country in all of Soviet history.  They even began to call it "golden."  During this five-year period, national income increased by 186%, consumer output - by 203%, retail turnover - by 198%, and the payroll increased by 220%.  This economic success was due to the expansion of the independence of enterprises, a sharp decrease in indicators approved from above.  Instead of the gross volume of production, the volume of sales was established, the cost was replaced by profitability and profit.  In addition, the importance of economic interaction between enterprises and the establishment of contractual relations between microeconomic entities was enhanced.  In 1974, Kosygin again received the title of Hero of Socialist Labor. </p><h2>  Other areas of work </h2><p>  Kosygin also made a significant contribution to foreign policy.  So, thanks to him, relations with China were normalized during the border conflict on about.  Damansky.  Kosygin personally met with Zhou Enlai (Prime Minister of the State Council) at the airport in Beijing.  As a result of negotiations, he forbade the Soviet units to occupy the island after the expulsion of the Chinese.  Accordingly, the troops of China immediately occupied Damansky.  Subsequently, the island was merged with the mainland and from that moment acts as an integral part of the territory of China.  Kosygin also made a great contribution to the organization and holding of the 1980 Olympics.  As Varennikov testifies, in 1979 he was the only one of all members of the Politburo who opposed the sending of Soviet soldiers to Afghanistan.  From that moment, relations with Brezhnev and his closest associates were severed. </p><h2>  Last years </h2><p>  In 1980, on October 21, Kosygin was relieved of his job as a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party.  On the 23rd, he submitted an application to remove him from the post of head of the SM due to poor health.  As Grishin testifies, the then first secretary of the CPSU City Committee, Kosygin, already in the hospital, was very worried about the upcoming 11th five-year plan.  He feared that it would be a failure, because, in his opinion, the Politburo did not want to constructively resolve the economic issue.  Alexei Nikolayevich died on December 18, 1980. A message about his death, however, appeared in the official press only three days later.  Such a delay was due to the celebration of Brezhnev‚Äôs birthday.  In order not to overshadow the triumph, it was decided to postpone the news. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="date of birth kosygin alexey nikolaevich" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1240707.jpg" width="220"></div>

There are two types of burials.  Most of the figures are cremated.  The necropolis near the Kremlin wall includes a columbarium for urns with ashes.

    <h2>  Memories </h2><p>  In their notes, contemporaries called Kosygin distinctive features clarity and efficiency.  He was well-educated, but laconic.  Kosygin could not stand empty talk.  In speech, he was simple and restrained, sometimes harsh.  His whole character was manifested in communication with others.  As Evgeny Chazov recalled, neither Khrushchev nor Brezhnev liked Kosygin.  However, both of them trusted him in managing the economy.  Some sources have criticized the previous leadership.  Kosygin was accused of excesses.  However, according to the memoirs of the same Chazov, the house in which he lived externally and interiorly differed significantly from the huge one, with claims to pompous Brezhnev‚Äôs dwelling in Zarechye.  Kosygin himself was modest and intelligent. </p>
