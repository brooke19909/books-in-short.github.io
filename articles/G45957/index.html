Many people want to have a luxury car, comfortable and spacious residential apartments, a summer house, a yacht and so on.  Moreover, often a person does not feel a special need for these pompous things - he just wants to arouse the envy of friends and relatives.  There is a category of people who, in order to demonstrate their own ‚Äúcoolness‚Äù to others, is ready to do a lot, including getting into a debt hole.  Unfortunately, when choosing a consumer loan, the borrower does not always objectively evaluate his financial capabilities.  As a result, he ceases to make money on time to pay off the debt, as a result of which the bank takes all his property acquired by overwork. </p>

    <p>  Surely this situation is familiar to many.  At the same time, there are a lot of reasons that prompt a person to get into debt bondage.  For example, someone decided to organize their own business, he does not have start-up capital, no one can borrow a large sum of money, except for a bank, so for him to sign a loan agreement with, say, VTB24 or AkBars is the only way out .  Many through borrowed money want to solve the housing problem.  One way or another, before you get into debt, really assess your financial capabilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But here you have decided to take a loan from a banking institution.  It was approved, and the first months you regularly and on time made all payments.  However, then you were fired from work.  And now you do not know how to solve financial problems, because you have lost a permanent source of income.  At first, bank employees remind about debts, then collectors are connected, which begin to annoy with endless calls and threats. </p>

    <p>  You have been cornered, and only now the understanding of the severity of the situation begins to come.  You begin to think about how not to pay loans legally, and is there such an opportunity at all.  Yes, she is.  Firstly, you must know and be able to assert your rights by contacting collection agency employees.  Believe me, they know how not to pay loans legally, but they often try in every way to intimidate the borrower so that he doesn‚Äôt even think that money can not be repaid. </p><p>  So, there are several options for solving debt bondage.  Consider the most common of them. </p><h2>  Wait for the limitation period </h2><p>  Interested in how not to pay loans legally?  As a general rule, the limitation period is three years.  At the same time, the beginning of its expiration will be considered the moment when you last contacted with bank employees on the issue of loan repayment.  Of course, hiding from bank employees or collection agencies is not the most reliable way to solve the problem, but sometimes, for lack of the best, it will do.  Keep in mind that you have to thoroughly ‚Äúlay low‚Äù and end all sorts of relationships with friends, work colleagues, relatives. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  It should not be forgotten that often collectors pour out their anger not at the borrower, but at people close to him.  Naturally, they will not hide with collectors in Antarctica with you, so this method is very doubtful. </p><h2>  Try to find a compromise with the bank </h2><p>  Are there any other options for resolving the issue of how not to pay loans legally?  Of course.  Try to negotiate with the bank so that it enters your position and relaxes its financial claims.  Moreover, this should be done at the very beginning of the problem.  Inform the credit institution that you are having difficulty repaying money, while not completely repaying the debt: you should spend at least 500 rubles a month on these goals.  It is very likely that the bank will appreciate your efforts, consider the issue of <span>debt restructuring</span> and will not sue you. </p><h2>  Help collectors </h2><p>  Of course, many Russians took consumer loans.  How not to pay money to pay them off? </p>

    <p>  Surely everyone puzzled over this issue.  Here you can recommend the help of anti-collection companies.  As a rule, their employees are competent and sensible lawyers who thoroughly know all the subtleties and nuances of lending to individuals.  They are able to provide real help to those who fell into debt bondage. </p><h2>  Adoption of the Law on Bankruptcy of Individuals </h2><p>  Very soon, loans can not be paid due to the adoption of the law "On Bankruptcy of Individuals".  In this case, we are talking about situations where, with a debt of 50,000 rubles, the borrower does not make payments within 3 months.  After that, in court, a person is declared bankrupt, they are given a five-year installment plan for paying a loan, and in parallel with this, a restructuring plan is developed. </p><h2>  How to solve the debt problem in Ukraine </h2><p>  Many are interested in the question of how not to pay loans in Ukraine legally.  In addition to these methods, there is another, but very risky and not too correct.  Sometimes the inhabitants of this country, as well as Russia and other states, may go to court to declare the <span>loan agreement</span> invalid for the reason that, putting their own signature on the document, they did not realize the significance of their actions.  As evidence, they provide a medical certificate of mental illness.  However, it is hardly possible to recommend such a solution to the problem, since it is on the verge of law.  In addition to even greater troubles, this method is unlikely to bring any results. </p><h2>  Some statistics </h2><p>  Russian citizens have already owed 7 trillion rubles to banking institutions; over the past 12 months, loan arrears have increased dramatically. </p>
