In modern life, they are undeservedly forgotten.  But such a rug from T-shirts with their own hands can make any craftswoman! </p><p>  We all have a great many old clothes that we have to throw away due to uselessness.  But there is no need to rush - you just have to dream a little, make some efforts and create interesting functional and original gizmos for the house!  Enough materials, we stock up on patience and forward! </p><h2>  Using rugs from old t-shirts </h2><p>  Such products are great for bathrooms and hallways, as they are quite easy to wash, and they dry very quickly.  They are perfectly cleaned, have a dense texture and are not slippery.  These rugs will look amazing in a rustic interior.  At the same time, you will get rid of old clothes, freeing up space on the shelves of the cabinet.  And the most important thing is that with this work you could show creative talent! </p><h2>  Toolkit for work </h2><p>  First, you need to prepare all the necessary devices. </p><p>  Always wash old T-shirts and dry thoroughly.  Shades are preferably not the brightest, they should more or less be combined with each other.  A plain rug will also be boring, it is better to alternate the colors of "yarn". </p><p>  To get started, stock up on the necessary materials and accessories: </p><ul><li>  Old t-shirts. </li><li>  Very sharp and comfortable scissors. </li><li>  Crochet for knitting a large size. </li><li>  Ruler. </li><li>  Chalk or remnant. </li></ul><h2>  Preparation of "yarn" for work </h2><p>  Before work, we must cut each T-shirt into strips whose width is approximately three centimeters.  This process is long and tiring, and for this we need the most convenient scissors.  They should cut, not chew, matter. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The stripes should be even and of the same width - if you are not sure of your eye, then first draw the fabric.  Of course, it will take time, but the result is worth it! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted ribbons from t-shirts" class="if uuid-2771285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2771285.jpg"></div><p>  It is best to draw with chalk or remnant, since pencils on knitwear do not write. </p><p>  Sew them together into one "thread" and wind them into a ball. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.1dogwoof.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;yarn&quot; from t-shirts, wound in balls" class="if uuid-2771279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2771279.jpg"></div><p>  In the photo you can sometimes see wicker rugs, consisting not only of straight ribbons, but also of rolled up into tubes.  To obtain such an effect, it is necessary to wash and dry the already cut "yarn". </p><h2>  How to crochet a rug from old t-shirts with your own hands </h2><p>  To independently make a rug with a knitting hook, you need to knit it from prepared yarn according to the selected pattern.  For example, you can create a simple rug of a round shape, taking the plan of a flat circle as the basis for knitting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.thesprucecrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitwear" class="if uuid-2771326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2771326.jpg"></div><p>  Alternate multi-colored stripes.  The last loop should be well fixed, you can even flash it with a needle and thread. </p><p>  Here is a crocheted doormat rug!  It remains to find a suitable place for him. </p><h2>  Pigtail mat </h2><p>  There is one more method.  Mats made of t-shirts woven from strips of knitwear with their own hands look very interesting and original.  For this manufacturing method, it is necessary to wind the knitted tape in three balls, then braid them.  In order to make a round carpet, gradually twist it into a spiral and sew. </p><div class="photo" data-original="captaincrafty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="round braid rug" class="if uuid-2771261" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2771261.jpg"></div><p>  For a square shape, take a piece of dense fabric, equal in size to the future rug - for the base. </p><p>  Now cut strips of t-shirts 8 cm longer than the finished product will be.  Weave several braids - do not weave to the ends of the stripes, let it be a fringe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Abundantly glue the base of the mat with glue and lay out all the pigtails in neat rows one after another on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="square rug from t-shirts" class="if uuid-2771300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2771300.jpg"></div><p>  After the glue dries, sew in some places all the braids. </p><p>  The fringe ends must be trimmed for a flat edge. </p><p>  Here you can also make a rug from T-shirts with your own hands - absolutely no special skills are needed here!  Patience, imagination, and again patience - and you will create a masterpiece! </p><h2>  Weaving a round rug from old T-shirts with their own hands on a hoop </h2><p>  Using a simple tool - a hula hoop or a regular sports hoop, you can easily make another doormat. </p><p>  Skillful needlewomen have come up with a lot of options for making rugs from T-shirts with their own hands.  For this method you will need: </p><ul><li>  some old t-shirts; </li><li>  sports hoop. </li></ul><p>  In size, your mat will turn out equal to a hoop. </p><p>  So let's get started! </p><p>  All cooked consumables are cut across into strips whose width is about 7 cm. </p><p>  Now the resulting rings of fabric will need to be pulled over the hoop - carefully filling the entire circle in order. </p><p>  Do not pull the strips very tight so that the product does not wrinkle afterwards, losing shape!  Also carefully monitor the intersection of all fabric bands in the center of the hoop! </p><p>  Having finished this work, start weaving the canvas. </p><p>  We attach a strip of fabric in the middle and alternately skip the top and bottom warp threads. </p><p>  We tie new ribbons with knots and hide them on the underside of the canvas. </p><p>  Weave very tight, trying to ensure that all subsequent rows are tightly pressed to the previous ones.  Gaps and holes in the mat are not allowed! </p><p>  At the end of weaving, it is necessary to cut the strips stretched over the hoop, and either sew them together, or tie them into knots, leaving a fringe.  Cut with sharp scissors, forming a beautiful smooth edge. </p><p>  You can create such a rug together with the children, and it will be used everywhere! </p><h2>  Shaggy rug on the net </h2><p>  And now let's try to make a wonderful cozy accessory for a bedroom or a children's room.  Making a rug from T-shirts with your own hands looks like this step by step. </p><p>  The first step is to purchase a special construction mesh - it must be of high quality and strong, as it would be very unfortunate if, after the time and labor spent, the product falls apart due to contact with the liquid!  This grid will become the basis of the future rug - it is to it that we will attach the knitted villi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.myloveofstyle.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fixing strips to the grid" class="if uuid-2771273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2771273.jpg"></div><p>  If you still doubt the strength of such a foundation, tie it yourself.  This can be done with a hook and a strong synthetic thread.  Take a diagram of a filet grid, but be sure to note that each cell must have a size of at least 1 square centimeter!  This option for making the base is also remarkable in that you can create any shape completely - round, square, oval, heart, animal, etc. The options are limited only by your imagination. </p><p>  You also choose the degree of "shaggy" of your rug yourself - when preparing tapes for pile from old T-shirts.  A rug with hands, without a hook, will be more difficult to do than with it. </p><p>  The most optimal strip size will be a tape with a length of 11-13 cm - the carpet will turn out both soft and fluffy! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="production of a rug on a grid" class="if uuid-2771251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2771251.jpg"></div><p>  We take a thick hook and stretch the knitted ribbons into each hole of the base mesh.  You can mix all the shades, and you can perform a drawing of villi.  Tie strips to knots.  At the end of the work, you can trim the finished product with scissors - and voila - you are the happy owner of a unique carpet! </p><h2>  Backlit mat </h2><p>  And what about this idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa wonderful accessory for you: at night we wake up and go to the kitchen, to the toilet room, to the baby in the nursery - and, of course, we stumble on furniture and make noise, risking waking up the other inhabitants of the apartment.  But I don‚Äôt want to turn on the light either, and it‚Äôs not always possible.  For such cases, this mat is indispensable! </p><p>  To create such a wonderful product, we need an LED strip, old T-shirts and a thick crochet hook.  The ribbon, rolled into a spiral, is used as the basis for the rug, and the ‚Äúthread‚Äù of T-shirts is the connecting harness.  For this purpose, a sealed closed strip with LEDs is perfect.  T-shirts choose neutral shades and cut them into thinner strips than before - about 2 cm. Simply by hand or using a hook, tie a ribbon, gradually wrapping it in a spiral. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="method for tying LED strip" class="if uuid-2771307" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2771307.jpg"></div><p>  Also, this carpet will be able to act as a night lamp for a children's room, gently scattering the light below, on the floor and completely without disturbing sleep. </p><p>  Of course, there are ready-made night-rugs on sale, but just such a rug from t-shirts, created with your own hands, will become much better and more useful! </p>
