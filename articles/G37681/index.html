And this is not surprising.  Indeed, in this city, a beach holiday in luxury hotels in a true oriental atmosphere blends perfectly with many historical sights.  This large archaeological area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe country is often called an open-air museum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Calido Maris Hotel 5" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2055554.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Side has a Mediterranean climate.  It is hot and dry in summer and rainy in winter.  The best time to visit this resort is the period from May to the end of October, when the water in the sea is most comfortable.  Therefore, the end of the summer does not reduce the interest of Russians in holidays in Turkey.  Many of our compatriots come here until the last days of October.  And after that, most of the hotels in this part of the Turkish coast are closed until spring.  Even in September, Russians are actively buying vouchers so that before the onset of cold weather they can relax at sea in the Mediterranean Side.  Moreover, at this time, hotel prices are significantly cheaper. </p><p>  It is generally accepted that Side also includes several small beach resorts that are nearby.  These are Cholakly, Sorgun, Kyzylagach, Kumkoy, Kyzylot.  It is in the latter that the Calido Maris Hotel 5 * is located, reviews of accommodation in which indicate the full compliance of this hotel with its high category. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  What attracts guests to this hotel complex, what services it offers tourists, photos and much more information is presented in this article.  Calido Maris Hotel 5 * is considered one of the newest hotels in Turkey.  It was built in 2016, so our compatriots can be calm about the deterioration of furniture and sanitary ware in the rooms.

    <h2>  Free entertainment </h2><p>  On the territory of Calido Maris Hotel 5 * (Side) there are two swimming pools - outdoor and indoor.  The latter works seasonally.  Those who do not want to swim in the sea can stay on site and spend time on sun loungers around the pool.  And the presence of six water slides will add variety to measured relaxation.  Judging by the reviews, the slides are completely new and fully comply with the required safety standards.  Many teams were satisfied with the service of the animation team.  They carried out quite a variety of work, occupying tourists with water polo, water aerobics, step aerobics, organized children's discos, evening programs for adults.  Many remember the Brazilian and the show of acrobats. </p><h2>  Calido Maris Hotel 5 *: reviews </h2><p>  2017 was the first year the hotel received guests.  Therefore, the number of reviews left by our compatriots after rest in it is small.  Nevertheless, they are, and far from all are positive. </p><p>  To begin with, about the territory: judging by the reviews, it is not large enough for the declared category.  It fit pools and a water park, so guests have nowhere to walk.  In addition, some tourists separately note its weak landscaping, however, given the fact that the Calido Maris Hotel 5 * was opened last year, you can understand why the trees are still low. </p><p>  As for infrastructure, according to the Russians, it is not enough for the "five".  On the fifth day, many became bored at the hotel and had to look for entertainment in nearby towns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Calido Maris Hotel 5 Side Kyzylot" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2055546.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The work of staff by our compatriots is rated highly enough.  Separately, the presence of Russian-speaking reception workers is noted, who immediately delve into the essence of the problem and quickly solve it.  Nevertheless, there are some tourists who say that without a tip their request was not fulfilled. </p><p>  The vast majority of our compatriots separately notes the design of the rooms and their cleanliness.  A huge staff of maids is engaged in cleaning, who enter the rooms only when there are no residents.  The furniture in the rooms is new; marble bathrooms impressed many.  Some in their reviews separately note the chic bedding in this hotel.  In a word, our compatriots have practically no complaints about the numbers of discontent. </p><p>  Reviews about the variety and quality of dishes in the main restaurant are not always positive.  And although many were satisfied with the proposed food, there are those who expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the most popular dishes were quickly running out and trays were not replenished.  However, most Russians liked the food.  A lot of positive reviews about delicious desserts and a huge selection of coffee.  For food, our compatriots gave the hotel an average rating of 4.7 out of five. </p><p>  The beach and the sea did not cause any complaints from anyone.  Of course, there are tourists who found the entrance to the sea poorly equipped, however, in all brochures it is clearly stated that the coverage in some places on their own bathing area is pebbled.  Therefore, it is better to bring rubber slippers with you or buy them on the spot in a store operating on the territory of Calido Maris Hotel 5 *.  Side, Kyzylot are rich in historical monuments.  Therefore, our compatriots do not miss the opportunity and buy tours to local attractions.  Some of them did not like the price difference for excursions in a separate office and in stalls working nearby. </p><p>  Summing up, we can say that this hotel does not correspond to the declared category for all points, however, much can be attributed to the fact that it is still new. </p>
