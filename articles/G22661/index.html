  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Buying an apartment in a new building: what are the benefits?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each of us dreams of his own apartment.  Living with parents, especially if you already have your own family, is simply unimaginable.  And millions of Russians are experiencing this in their own skin.  We are ready to get into any debts, take a mortgage at an unimaginable interest, but to live separately.  Four walls with floor and ceiling are turning into the most important goal.  But, if you are already going to buy an apartment, a new problem arises: what kind of apartment to buy?  And where?  After all, you can take a second home, you can buy the cherished square meters in the new building. </p><p>  But, what all the same you need to know in order not to be mistaken in your choice?  Still, we do not buy an elementary cell phone, where it is not critical to make a mistake.  We spend a huge amount of money, and there really is no room for error.  After all, the main thing for us: to buy - to call in - to live in peace.  So that the desired apartment in the future does not bring any problems. </p><p>  Almost every Russian city has a huge number of offers on the account of the sale and purchase of apartments.  And more and more people do not want to mess with secondary housing: there are too many problems due to scams.  And sometimes the ordinary ordinary owner of the apartment is not all right with the documents.  Either the apartment is generally incorporated in a financial institution, or dozens of people are registered on 100 square meters.  Problems can be different.  And they do not always lie on the surface. </p><p>  It is either a matter of buying housing in a new building.  Not to say that such an apartment will cost much more than secondary housing.  No, there will be a difference, but not so significant.  But always in this case there is a convenient scheme for selling an apartment.  There are no former owners, registered people, and so on.  And, even if you do not have enough money to buy an apartment in a new building, you will always be helped out by a bank with a mortgage.  Provided a good credit history and stable earnings, of course.  Financial institutions willingly agree to give money specifically for the purchase of an apartment in a new building.  And the construction companies that built the new house, willingly offer interest-free installments to future owners of apartments. </p><p>  Do not forget that new homes are being built, mainly in beautiful areas for living.  In new areas, with developed infrastructure and other amenities.  This is not some kind of Khrushchev‚Äôs, in which it‚Äôs scary to be, not that life. </p><p>  Anyway, it‚Äôs better to buy an apartment in a new building.  Then there will be no problems, and you can live in peace in your own apartment.  And no one will come and say that he is registered in it.  The story is clear, and all the documents in your hands.  Make only the right choice! </p><p>  According to the materials of the site: <noindex>  <span>http://www.premierdevelopment.ru</span> </noindex></p></div></article>
