Extremely negatively, they characterize No. 101, which is located on the ground floor, near the reception.  Room shared by vacationers, in itself is not bad, spacious, air conditioning, toilet, shower - everything works.  But in it, the guests complain, it‚Äôs very damp - so much so that it‚Äôs impossible to dry anything, there is no balcony, there is no way to keep windows open: there are no people living at home, they are afraid of mosquitoes (in the evenings). </p><p>  Residents of the hotel recommend that if someone begins to place in this room, "to resist to the last, suddenly lucky and will be able to relocate."  Otherwise, you will have to dry things in the courtyard of the restaurant.  It is possible that a scolopendra can climb into the bathroom.  So, vacationers advise, living here, one must be on guard. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The service at Star of The Sea Resort is characterized by travelers as unobtrusive. </p><p>  For a tip (20 rupees), the authors of the reviews share, the room will be cleaned, the bed will be changed.

The Star of the Sea Resort 2 * menu offers several types of free breakfasts: </p><ul><li>  scrambled eggs, jam / butter, 2 toasts; </li><li>  fruit salad, granola with milk; </li><li>  Pancake with honey and lime; </li><li>  porridge (banana); </li><li>  bruschetta with vegetables, tea or coffee with or without milk. </li></ul><p>  If a vacationer after eating feels hungry, you can order breakfast from a paid menu. </p><p>  Dinner is offered in the Valonia shek (at the entrance to the beach, turn left, walk 100 meters).  Here, according to tourists, very caring and friendly service and delicious food.  The menu is in Russian, the owner and staff know the language. </p><p>  According to reviews, it is prepared in a good and varied way at the Blue Lagoon, a hotel restaurant. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  According to residents, the hotel is very quiet, calm, its neighbors are almost invisible and inaudible, no one is making noise.  Mostly tourists from Russia, Germany, England, Ukraine settle here. </p><p>  The hotel area is small, well-groomed, there is a swimming pool where all the sun loungers are constantly occupied by German senior couples. </p><p>  Residents report that sometimes the hotel turns off the light - not for long, but daily. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  According to reviews, the hotel staff is not annoying.  The hotel staff are quite friendly.  But, as many say about them, they are extremely lazy. </p><p>  The authors of the reviews find it difficult to put in the minus the hotel such a feature of the staff as the inability to speak Russian.  As can be seen from the reviews, vacationers have no special complaints about the staff.  It is advised to give employees chocolates from the very beginning, leave a small tip for cleaning, and be sure to smile.  But many tourists believe that a good attitude towards guests by the hotel staff does not depend on material incentives.  It‚Äôs just an answer to the sincerity and good nature of the guests themselves. </p><h2>  Ocean </h2><p>  The Indian Ocean, according to vacationers, is ‚Äúit's just a song‚Äù!  Those who wish to go to Goa are recommended to bring a couple of boards and flippers with them for body surfing.  You can lie down on the board with your stomach and catch a wave - it will take the bather to the shore, he rolls out to the beach in foam!  The sun here is very hot - you must take a cream.  In order not to sunbathe, vacationers swim in a T-shirt and bandana, because the cream is quickly washed off with water. </p>

    <p>  The weather here is mostly clear and sunny.  Typically, water in the ocean is warm - +29 degrees, air - about + 30-33 degrees, humidity is always high.  Residents of Star of The Sea Resort complain that the towels on the balcony do not dry, they have to be dried in the room. </p><p>  Particularly enthusiastic tourists speak about sunsets on the ocean, post in the networks a lot of beautiful pictures of the local nature.  Sunsets, many believe, are why you should come to Goa in general.  Eloquently conveys the impressions of their greatness and magic by retelling the conversation of one of the vacationers with a Russian-speaking guide, whom he asked: ‚ÄúHave you been tired of seeing the sunsets here for seven years with tourists?‚Äù  The guide answered him: ‚ÄúNot at all.‚Äù </p><p>  The beach in Benaulim, according to reviewers, is great!  The ocean is simply luxurious.  Here you forget about all the disadvantages of everyday life and the unusual features of the local mentality.  Near fishing boats, you should carefully look at your feet, tourists warn: fishermen throw snakes out of nets, which are better not to step on. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Tourists also respond very positively about excursions.  They mark it as the most interesting excursions to <span>Palolem beach</span> and to Cabo De Rama (fort), which can be reached by local taxi (for 2200 rupees).  You can walk to Colva, according to reviewers, in 40 minutes.  unhurried step. </p><p>  Excursions, travelers say, have become a little expensive due to a course hike, but a way out can always be found.  Many advise to go on a taxi excursion.  The authors of the reviews categorically do not recommend using the bus: firstly, it is unrealistic to wait a long time, and secondly, there tourists are called ‚Äúramming‚Äù! </p><p>  And they also advise: the receiving side, according to the authors of the reviews, the cost of excursions is greatly overstated, but still it is not worth contacting local small agencies because of their dubious reliability.  Reviews recommend using the services of a local large company, about which there are already positive reviews - ‚ÄúYour Goa‚Äù. </p><h2>  Benaulim </h2><p>  According to reviews, Benaulim is a picturesque village: bulls, cows, pigs ... Chipmunks are jumping on trees, dogs are everywhere on the ground.  The authors of the reviews urge vacationers to take caution during their walks: along the curb along the road to the beach there are a lot of palm trees with coconuts, you need to make sure that a huge, heavy coconut does not fall on the head of a walker. </p><p>  Benaulim, according to many, is one of the best places in southern Goa.  There is plenty of everything: people, vegetation, the benefits of civilization.  In other places, beaches are either overpopulated, or, according to the authors of the reviews, there is "something, but not enough."  All animals live here in the yards, tourists assure you that you will not see pigs or cows walking along the beach.  A huge number of dogs, but they are mainly sterilized and vaccinated, which can be found on the cropped ear. </p><p>  In Benaulim, there is a currency exchange (near the supermarket at the crossroads) with an acceptable rate.  Travelers are not advised to change money at the airport.  There are also two ATMs. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The guests of Star of The Sea Resort report that the hotel, as indicated in the advertisement, is really located very well: nearby, across the street, is the Kadar store (by local standards, this is a real supermarket).  They sell water and other necessary goods here. </p><p>  You can buy fruits from roadside merchants: strawberries, watermelon, pomegranate tangerines, grapes, etc. The most delicious juice in the heat on the beach, according to vacationers, is made from mango.  Merchants always greet good-naturedly, unobtrusively inviting themselves to their shop.  They also behave very modestly on the beach: they immediately leave after the offer of services. </p><p>  A lot of people speak about the good location of the hotel.  Nearby are shops, a bank, a pharmacy.  Near the hotel there is always a taxi on duty, a little further you can take a tuk-tuk.  The hotel is in the midst of commercial life.  It is convenient to get to the sea: only 5-7 minutes walk or, as vacationers say, you can drive up a tuk-tuk.  Unusually delicious pastries are sold near the supermarket, where you can also drink tea and coffee.  This establishment does not look quite presentable, but the products here, according to vacationers, are very tasty.  It‚Äôs hard to stay hungry in Benaulim, the authors of the reviews say.  They advise you not to be afraid to taste local dishes - this is incredible yummy!  There are many shakes on the beach, each one is good in its own way, there is plenty to choose from. </p><p>  Fans of souvenirs can enjoy: around the Star of The Sea Resort a large number of them are for sale. </p><h2>  About rest </h2><p>  The routine in the hotel is subject to local environmental conditions, as elsewhere in the resorts.  From 13-30 to 16-00 (at lunch), vacationers usually go to the hotel: take a break from the heat, eat fruit and take a little nap.
