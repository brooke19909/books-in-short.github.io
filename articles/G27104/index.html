First of all, we need to form the bottom of our future gadget bag.  To do this, you need to use monophonic elastic bands, preferably a dark shade.  You need to hook the material in the form of an infinity sign diagonally between the rows.  In other words, each gum should be twisted in half.  After that, they need to be hooked on the left peg, which is the first.  In the middle of the gum should be twisted, and then put them on the second peg, located on the right. </p>

    <p>  We continue to figure out how to make a cover using rubber bands.  Colored material should be caught in a sequential manner, starting from the bottom left and ending with a full circle.  After that, you will need to take the hook.  It is necessary to remove the loops.  The tool will need to pry the lower elastic bands of a dark color, stretch them over a multi-colored material and discard.  Such actions will have to be performed throughout the entire circle.  After this, you need to shift the row and string a new one using multi-colored rings.  Continue to act in the same sequence that completed the previous lap. </p><h2>  The final part of the work on creating a cover </h2><p>  How to weave a rubber phone case?  As a final step, you need to perform some fairly simple steps.  It is necessary to stretch the loops into each other.  A similar action will need to start to be performed approximately two laps before the end of the weaving process.  Try to stretch them through each other.  After that, fix them so that they do not come down or get loose.  In one place you will need to bandage the elastic bands using the Loom Band.  At the same time, the specified shade must be observed.  After that, you can, without fear, begin to remove material from the posts using a hook.  At the same time, you should carefully try to straighten the resulting product with your fingers. </p><h2>  Additional decor will not be redundant </h2><p>  Now you know the answer to the question of how to get the original product for your phone.  When the case is completely ready, you can begin to think about how to design it.  Additional decor will not be redundant.  At the present stage, you can find a variety of trinkets and pendants.  They will be able to decorate your creation.  The use of fringe will be interesting enough.  You can use the figures, which will be made of all the same gum.  No costs are expected.  And making figures after creating the cover will be very simple. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>
