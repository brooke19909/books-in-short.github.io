    <p>  The head of the machine weighs 11.5 kg, excluding manual drive. </p><h2>  Sewing machine PMZ instruction </h2><ol><li>  When operating the sewing machine, it is necessary to ensure that the slide plate located above the shuttle is always tightly closed. </li><li>  When the machine is idle, the presser foot should be raised. </li><li>  The flywheel should rotate only towards the working person.  In the opposite direction, it is strictly forbidden to rotate.  This can lead to tangled threads in the hook. </li><li>  There should always be fabric under the teeth of the engine, otherwise they will become dull and the lower surface of the presser foot will deteriorate. </li><li>  Do not push or pull material while sewing, as this may cause the needle to break or bend.  The PMZ sewing machine itself provides the necessary supply of fabric. </li></ol><h2>  Sewing machine bobbin with cap </h2><p>  If it is necessary to replace the bobbin, the front slide plate, which closes the shuttle, is first pushed back, after which you need to grab the latch with two fingers and pull the cap out of the slot.  If you do not open the latch first, then the bobbin cannot be removed, since it is held by a special hook. </p><p>  To remove the bobbin, release the latch and, turning the cap upside down with the open side, shake the bobbin out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to wind a thread on a bobbin </h2><p>  Near the flywheel, on the back of the machine arm, is a special winder.  It works synchronously with the thread tensioner (bottom - which is located in the right corner of the machine platform).  During winding the thread on the bobbin, the PMZ sewing machine should not work.  That is, the flywheel should not rotate.  Therefore, it must be turned off before winding the bobbin.  It should rotate freely without rotating the mechanism itself.  Put the bobbin on the stop pin of the spindle so that it slots into the protrusion.  Then you need to put the spool of thread on a special spool pin.  The thread is pulled down, under the washer of the tensioner itself, and then up again, through the left hole. </p><p>  The spindle with the bobbin on it rotates in the winder frame.  It must be pressed by hand so that its rubber rim touches the surface of the flywheel.  The end of the thread from the bobbin must be held until a sufficient number of turns are wound so that the thread can be fixed.  After this, this end should be cut short. </p><p>  The frame itself will turn off as soon as the PMZ sewing machine winds the thread completely on the bobbin, and automatically takes the bobbin away from the flywheel.  For the correct execution of this option, you must constantly ensure that the rubber rim does not touch the flywheel while the bobbin is being wound.  Otherwise, the frame should be adjusted. </p>

    <p>  To adjust the winder frame, unscrew the screw from the winder adjustment plate located in the adjuster plate, pull the frame down towards the flywheel and, fixing it in this position, screw the screw in a new position.  Threads should be wound evenly over the bobbin and tightly.  If this does not happen, then you need to adjust the lower tensioner by slightly turning the tensioner bracket in the desired direction.  He moves along a special slot in the platform.  Since the bracket is also fastened with a screw, you will have to loosen it before performing this operation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to thread a bobbin case of a sewing machine </h2><p>  With our right hand we take the bobbin with the thread wound, turn it so that the thread with its free end is directed to the right, to the left side.  With our left hand we hold the bobbin case, with the oblique slot for the thread up, and effortlessly insert the bobbin into the cap. </p><p>  It remains to stretch the thread through the oblique slot at the edge of the cap, driving it under the tension spring, and then into the narrow slot located at the very end of the bobbin case. </p><h2>  Installing the bobbin case into the machine </h2><p>  To perform this operation, it is more convenient to put it with the left hand on the shuttle shaft located in the center so that his finger gets into the slot of the patch plate located on the travel case.  Then, releasing the latch, press the cap until it locks onto the shuttle rod.  The free end of the thread is left hanging freely, closing the shuttle after this. </p>

    <p>  To do this, push the plate forward until it stops.  After that, the manual sewing machine is almost ready for work. </p><h2>  Replacing a needle in a sewing machine </h2><p>  In order to change the needle, you must first remove the old one and then turn the handwheel so that the needle is inserted in the upper position of the needle bar.  In this case, the flat side of the needle should be turned to the left, in other words, to the outside.  The long groove on the needle blade itself, on the contrary, is to the right, that is, inward, to the bottom of the sleeve. </p>

    <p>  The needle must be inserted very carefully, because if installed incorrectly, the PMZ sewing machine will make loops or skip stitches.

    <h2>  Preparing the sewing machine for work </h2><p>  Before starting work, the sewing machine PMZ them.  Kalinin, must be properly prepared.  To do this, pull the bobbin thread.  Taking the thread leaving the needle with his left hand, turn the handwheel with the other hand so that the needle first lowers into the hole on the needle plate, and then, grabbing the bobbin thread from the shuttle, rises again upward. </p><p>  When this happens, you need to pull the needle thread by pulling up the bobbin thread.  After that, both ends of the thread are put back under the foot, slightly pulling them.  By lowering the foot on the fabric, you can begin to work on the machine. </p><h2>  Sewing on a sewing machine </h2><p>  The manual sewing machine has a sleeve, on the ledge of which, at the back, the manual drive should be installed and secured.  The manual drive is a housing with a pair of gears (large and small), a drive lever with a special leash (provides adhesion to the flywheel mechanism) and a handle (has the ability to recline) - to rotate the machine by hand. </p><p>  In the idle state, the handle is usually folded, and for operation it must be brought into working position and secured with a locking screw.  The leash also needs to be turned so that the gasket from the skin stands between the two matches of the flywheel, secured by a latch. </p><p>  Use the friction screw to secure the flywheel by setting the stroke and lowering the foot on the fabric.  Then, turning the handle of the machine‚Äôs drive away from you with your right hand, start working. </p><h2>  Foot operated sewing machine </h2><p>  To work on a foot sewing machine, it is necessary to alternately press the foot of the machine, then with heels, then with toes.  Legs should lie with all feet on it, while the right one should be slightly behind the left one.  And you need to swing the bandwagon as evenly as possible. </p><p>  PMZ foot sewing machine is very sensitive to the way the drive rotates.  The rotation of the drive wheel should be only to the side towards the machine.  Movement in the opposite direction will lead to tangling of the thread in the shuttle. </p><h2>  Completion of work on a typewriter </h2>

    <p>  After work, the sewing machine for the home should be stopped so that the lever of the thread attractor is at the top and the needle does not remain in the material.  Having lifted the lever, and then the presser foot, the left hand takes the fabric to the side and cut the threads near the end of the stitch.  The thread cutter has a special edge with which it can be done very easily.  It is located just above the presser foot.  The ends of the threads should be left about 10 centimeters long. </p><p>  Old sewing machines are very sensitive to the condition of the bobbins.  Over the years of work, potholes, burrs may appear on them, which causes the thread to cling to them and create loops or breaks. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the plant has been manufacturing these products for more than 60 years, the Podolsk sewing machine, the price of which is quite reasonable, remains a home assistant.
