The article will consider the formation of his career. </p><h2>  Education </h2><p>  Maxim Vladimirovich Poletaev was born on April 6, 1971 in the city of Yaroslavl, 250 kilometers northeast of Moscow. </p><p>  He was educated at Yaroslavl State University in the field of accounting and business.  He graduated in 1993. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vedomosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maxim Vladimirovich Sberbank" class="if uuid-2690131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44470/2690131.jpg"></div><h2>  Career.  Early stages </h2><p>  After that, he worked as an assistant at the same university in the department of economics and organization of production.  The directions of scientific research in this period were: </p><ol><li>  Modern methodological and theoretical problems of improving accounting and auditing in Russian enterprises. </li><li>  Features of the functioning of the financial system in a transitional Russian economy. </li><li>  Problems of improving accounting, auditing and analysis. </li></ol><p>  In 1994-1995  Poletaev went on an internship to the Sberkasy of Germany (Sparkasse, Kassel).  The system of savings banks in Germany includes 710 institutions in 12 regional associations, 13 land banks, 13 land building <span>savings banks.</span>  During the internship, he studied the system and features of the banking sector in Germany. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.vedomosti.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maxim Vladimirovich Flying" class="if uuid-2690132" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44470/2690132.jpg"></div><h2>  Career progression </h2><p>  An important role in the life of Maxim Poletaev was played by knowledge of foreign languages, in particular English and German.  Thanks to ownership of the latter, the future <span>chairman of the board of</span> Sberbank was able in 1994-1995.  get an internship at Sparkasse Savings Banks (Kassel, Germany). </p><p>  He has been working in the working system of Sberbank since August 1995.  Maxim Poletaev‚Äôs career began at the Northern Bank of Sberbank of Russia, where he was the head of the analysis and marketing department. </p><p>  He later managed the securities trading department.  Since March 2000, he was Deputy Chairman of the Board of the Yaroslavl Bank. </p><p>  In 2002, Maxim Vladimirovich Poletaev went for an increase, namely, he began to manage the Baikal Bank. </p><p>  Such experience promoted Poletaev to the position of vice president of Sberbank in 2009.  Almost at the same time, he was appointed director of the department responsible for corporate development of the bank.  In the same year, in October, he was appointed the chairman of the Moscow Bank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tennisweekend.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maxim Flightev biography" class="if uuid-2690145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44470/2690145.jpg"></div><h2>  Further career development </h2><p>  The transfer in the structure of Sberbank of Maxim Vladimirovich Poletaev to Moscow was not an accident, but for the most part his personal merit.  The 18-year period of high-quality and productive work, during the service of which several generations of employees who left work at this bank, changed, did not go unnoticed.  Decent higher education in finance and knowledge of foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãmade this specialist one of the best candidates for promotion. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Quite quickly Maxim Vladimirovich found common ground in the views with the top of the board of the Sberbank structure.  Particularly close was his working relationship with German Gref, Chairman of the Board. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tennisweekend.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maxim Flightev Sberbank biography" class="if uuid-2690148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44470/2690148.jpg"></div><h2>  Unexpected appointment </h2><p>  By the way, the post of deputy chairman in the bank has been vacant since the fall of 2007, when German Gref assumed his duties. </p><p>  The predecessor in this position was A. Aleshkina, working under the direction of A. Kazmin (Poletaev also worked earlier under his leadership), a representative of the old team. </p><p>  And so, in 2013, Maxim Poletaev was appointed first deputy.  Such a long absence of managers in this position made Poletaev‚Äôs appointment a surprise even in very narrow and informed company circles.  According to sources, the appointment became known only five days before the official announcement of the information. </p><p>  The main directions for the positions were: establishing contact relations and subsequent business cooperation and direct contact with corporate clients, as well as managing various business areas, introducing new ones. </p><p>  One of the vivid examples of the work of this specialist in this area was the cooperation of Sberbank with the Agrocor company.  Her representative office is in Croatia, where Poletaev made several business visits, including regarding the normalization of the aggravated situation with the debt regarding the retailer.  This information indicates progress in the development of international relations of the company during the work of Maxim Vladimirovich. </p><h2>  New stage of development </h2><p>  In June 2018, information appeared in the media and on the official website of Sberbank about Poletaev‚Äôs departure from the company.  In a press release submitted by the company, no specific details were indicated, as well as specific dates, but it was said that this departure of the top manager was his personal initiative, respectively, voluntary.  The bank also indicated that one of the reasons for leaving was the need to change the mode of operation. </p><p>  In the biography of Maxim Poletaev, Sberbank and work in all its divisions took about 23 years, taking a place since 1995.  Only in 2009-2013 he was able to get into the central office of the bank, working since 2013 as first deputy chairman.  Alexander Vedyakhin and <span>Anatoly Popov are</span> applying for the vacant position <span>,</span> but their candidatures still require coordination with the regulator.  As for Maxim Vladimirovich Poletaev (he worked for Sberbank the longest), he will become Advisor to the President.  His responsibilities will include managing large government projects and introducing new initiatives.  Nevertheless, he still remains a major shareholder of Sberbank. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rbc.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maxim Flying" class="if uuid-2690128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44470/2690128.jpg"></div><h2>  Awards </h2><p>  For a voluminous and significant contribution in the field of economics in the banking sector, he was awarded an honorary medal of the Order "For Merit to the Fatherland, II Degree". </p><p>  Also in the biography of Maxim Poletaev there are Silver for 2004 and Gold for 2011 signs of Sberbank of Russia for outstanding success in the banking sector and personal initiative in the working life of the bank. </p><h2>  Achievements </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.riadagestan.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maxim Flightev biography" class="if uuid-2690157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44470/2690157.jpg"></div><p>  Most likely, it was the period when the Baikal Bank was headed that became a turning point in the career of a financier.  Successful work in managing this bank made it possible for employees from higher divisions to notice a relatively young specialist.  For seven years of operation, since 2002, Baikal Bank unexpectedly became part of the TOP-3 of Sberbank's systems.  M.V. Poletaev, as the head of the Baikal Bank of Sberbank of Russia, led his division to the leading position - Baikal Bank was among the top three leaders of Sberbank, and by the end of 2006 it was elected the winner among many territorial banks, and in 2008 the first time Baikalsky became the leader in terms of net profit. This quality indicator of work was recognized as one of the most significant. </p><p>  For the period when Maxim Poletaev managed the Moscow Bank, he took the second place by most indicators among the many territorial banks of Sberbank. </p><h2>  A family </h2><p>  Little is known about the personal life of Maxim Poletaev, whose photo you can see in the article, currently lives in an official marriage with his wife, the couple has three sons. </p>
