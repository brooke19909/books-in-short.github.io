But, unfortunately, a traffic accident can happen to anyone.  Protecting yourself or your car from this is almost impossible.  But you can protect yourself from possible financial costs with the help of car insurance.  Everyone should know how to insure a car and where it is better to do so. </p><h2>  Compulsory insurance </h2><p>  This is a type of insurance, which implies the responsibility of the driver to other participants in a traffic accident.  If the car owner is to blame for the accident, he can be sure that third-party liability insurance will cover payments to third parties.  This type of insurance is compulsory and is issued by drivers regardless of the car model.  Often the driver is not ready for an accident and does not have the financial ability to cover the costs of another accident participant.  This is not a problem if you managed to insure the car in a timely manner.  MTPL usually covers all expenses, and participants in an accident manage to quickly repair their vehicles. </p>

OSAGO offer to issue insurance companies on cars of any brand.  The cost of the policy will depend on several factors.  First of all, the year of manufacture of the car is taken into account.  The older the vehicle, the greater the likelihood of an accident due to a malfunction.  Therefore, an insurance policy can be more expensive. </p>

The power of the motor is also taken into account.  The shorter the experience and the larger the car, the more expensive the policy will cost.  Place of registration also matters.  In those places where car traffic is less active, insurance will be much cheaper.

    <h2>  Should I pay attention to low prices? </h2><p>  You must never forget that free cheese happens only in a mousetrap.  Many insurance companies that exist on the market for only a few years, offer to issue a policy at a lower price.  However, there are no guarantees that the organization will really cover the costs in the event of an emergency.  Preference should be given to companies that have been operating for at least 10 years.  They will offer to insure the car at a higher cost.  At the same time, the client can be sure that in the event of an accident financial expenses will not wait for him. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Should everyone insure a car? </h2><p>  The insurance policy is mandatory today.  There are only a few exceptions.  Participants of the hostilities, invalids of the first group, personally driving their car are completely exempt from insurance of their own vehicle.  As well as persons who drive a disabled car in their presence.  In the event of a traffic accident, all payments are borne by the motor transport bureau.  An exception is when a third party is the culprit.  Then it is the culprit who undertakes the obligation to cover all expenses. </p>

Pensioners, persons who participated in the liquidation of the Chernobyl disaster, people with disabilities of the second group, as well as participants in the war, have such an opportunity.  It is worth noting that these individuals can not always insure a car at a discount.  You can issue a policy only if the engine capacity of the vehicle is up to 2500 cubic meters.  see. If the car does not meet these parameters, you will have to pay 100% of the cost of the policy.

    <h2>  Is it worth making a full hull? </h2><p>  Regardless of where to insure the car, it is worth choosing a policy that will represent the best value for money.  The problem is that many full hull points are completely useless.  For registration of the policy, you will have to pay at least 10,000 rubles.  In this case, insurance is issued only for a year.  If you exclude items such as hijacking a vehicle or stealing equipment from a car, you can save significantly.  The cost of the policy will be about 5000 rubles. </p><p>  Many vehicle owners have a good garage and a reliable alarm system.  Therefore, the likelihood of a car theft is minimized.  So to pay annually for a full comprehensive insurance policy is impractical.  The insurance contract should include such key points as car damage and participation in an accident. </p><h2>  Where to insure a car? </h2><p>  The company with which the contract will be concluded must be selected very carefully.  Before issuing a policy, it is worth paying attention to various market offers.  Preference should be given to companies that offer insurance services for more than 5 years.  There are several criteria that will help you more carefully evaluate the reliability of the company.  First of all, it is worth paying attention to the presence of regular partners.  If large organizations draw up an insurance contract in the same place for many years - this is a good indicator. </p><p>  Before deciding where to insure a car (CTP), it is worth paying attention to the prices of various companies.  The cheapest deals should not be given attention.  Most likely, in this way the insurance company is trying to attract customers.  There is no guarantee that contractual payments will actually be made.  The middle price segment is the best choice. </p>
