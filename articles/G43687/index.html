One of the most beautiful places in the country can be considered the Cretaceous Lakes near Volkovysk, attracting more and more tourists who decided to reunite with wildlife.  Nowadays, these places are popular not only among Belarusians, but also among other peoples, among which Russians and Ukrainians are especially distinguished. </p><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  The Belarusian miracle appeared as a result of Cretaceous developments, the activities of which have been going on for over one century.  Krasnoselskstroymaterialy OJSC produces mixtures, cement, lime, pipes and all kinds of details.  Extraction and further transportation of chalk here is carried out around the clock, but this does not interfere with your vacation, because already formed lakes are located at some distance from the current deposits.  Numerous visitors will confirm the splendor of nature and clean air reigning in these places near such a wonderful place as the city of Volkovysk.  There are chalk lakes in the Minsk region, but we will talk about them a little later. </p>

    <h2>  "Belarusian Maldives" </h2><p>  In recent years, the Cretaceous Lakes near Volkovysk have become a real natural <span>attraction of Belarus.</span>  Shrubs and trees gradually grow on the shores of these man-made ponds, and the water takes on a turquoise-emerald hue.  Despite the fact that there are no good roads to this place, people come here more and more often in order to enjoy the clean air and water that attract ecotourism lovers so much.  It is worth noting that each of the lakes is unique: on the waters of one, steep banks rise overgrown with young pines, and the other greets visitors with gentle slopes.  It was the latter that became the favorite resting place of the townspeople.  Of course, not all ponds are suitable for swimming, although this does not hurt to find a dozen pretty lakes where the water surface is akin to heaven itself.  These waters are also good for fishing enthusiasts, because the lakes are rich in crucian carp, rudd, pike, roach, silver carp and other types of fish.  Nevertheless, the Cretaceous Lakes are completely "unbridled", as they are considered a technical object, and therefore do not expect to find ennobled beaches, bars or recreation centers there.  Be that as it may, the unique landscapes and turquoise waters of the lakes constantly attract many travelers, and the locals who went for barbecue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Route </h2><p>  Cretaceous lakes (or rather, quarries) are located near the city of Volkovysk, Grodno region.  About 270 km will have to be driven from Minsk, 1000 km from Moscow.  Let us clarify the fact that close to the lakes it will not be possible to drive (except on an SUV), and therefore you will have to walk 500-700 meters.  Many tourists go to them with tents and barbecues, in order to have a great weekend away from the bustle of the city.  See the map below. </p>

    <h2>  Warning </h2><p>  We conclude the story about the Cretaceous Lakes near Volkovysk with one significant ‚Äúbut‚Äù.  The fact is that the aforementioned enterprise OJSC Krasnoselskstroymaterialy does not recommend visiting water bodies and swimming in them.  Such a warning is explained by the non-compliance with the sanitary rules and water standards of lakes, which were checked by the Volkovysk Zonal Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology in 2013.  According to him, the number of OKB (common <span>coliform bacteria)</span> and TKB (thermotolerate coliform bacteria) exceeds the norm by 60-100 times.  Of course, this is a very big drawback, but he stops few people.  Another important fact is the great depth of the lakes (over 10 m), which is why you need to be especially careful. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cretaceous lakes near Salihorsk </h2><p>  A similar situation is observed near another city.  This is Salihorsk.  Cretaceous lakes here are also flooded Cretaceous quarries, but mining is no longer carried out near these reservoirs.  The nearest town is the small town of Urechye.  Azure water, pine forests and fresh air for frying kebabs - what else is needed for vacationers?  It is worth noting that in this place there are much fewer water bodies - there are only 2. There are, however, huge, and therefore there are enough places for all vacationers.  <span>The chalk lakes in Belarus,</span> as we succinctly mentioned above, are compared with the Maldives.  90% of people are unlikely to be able to afford a trip to the latter, but why go for such measures if you can have a great time in your native land?  Do not forget to bring a camera with you, because dozens of beautiful pictures are provided for you. </p>

    <h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  As a rule, a visit to the Cretaceous Lakes leaves only pleasant impressions, which are carefully deposited in our memory.  Most tourists praise the beauty of the local nature, clear water and a beautiful bottom with the remains of chalk, which, by the way, gives the ponds that marvelous bright turquoise hue.  The disadvantages include uncomfortable approaches to water, which do not allow you to quickly go down to them.  Along with this, people who don‚Äôt know how to swim well are not recommended to come here, because the lakes are quite deep.  Of course, circles or mattresses can save such a situation, but it is worth paying special attention to this remark. </p>

    <p>  In general, lakes have become one of the most beloved vacation spots among Belarusians.  Families come here for a picnic with their families in order to escape from the gray of everyday life, enjoy plenty of fun, sunbathe in the sun and breathe in amazing air filled with the scent of pine trees.  Those people who are already lucky to get acquainted with these places are advised to stock up on car GPS-navigators, because getting to the lakes is quite problematic.  It‚Äôs simply impossible to drive up to some quarries, but do not be discouraged, because you always manage to find those that are not particularly difficult to reach by car.  In general, rest is remembered for a long time.  Here you can endlessly look at the <span>water surface that</span> goes into the distance.  And the evening sunsets and fascinate with its splendor! </p><p>  Well, the Cretaceous Lakes - this is really an amazing place that is definitely worth a visit on a hot sunny day.  Of course, the choice is always yours, but do not miss your chance. </p>
