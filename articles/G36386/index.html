Numerous offspring played prominent roles in the history of Russia and contributed to its development.  Family members built amazing mansions, had outstanding taste and capabilities, and therefore left behind many architectural monuments that adorn St. Petersburg.  Some of the mansions have been preserved, and after restoration work are available for inspection by everyone.  Each of the houses is of historical value and contributes to the formation of the image of North Palmyra. </p><h2>  House with moors </h2><p>  The mansion on Konnogvardeisky Boulevard belonged to a real state adviser Mikhail Viktorovich Kochubei.  In 1852, the prince purchased from a merchant Solodovnikov a three-story house, located between the street.  Galernaya and Horse Guards Boulevard.  The house in the center of the city was very interesting for its position, but architecture, in the opinion of the new owner, was unsuccessful.  The prince commissioned the famous architect Garald Bosse to reconstruct and remodel the solid house. </p><p>  The master drew inspiration from the architecture of the Italian Renaissance.  The project was submitted to the owner‚Äôs court in 1853, and it was personally approved by Emperor Nicholas I. Construction work was completed in 1857. </p><h2>  Moors Fashion </h2><p>  The mansion received the name ‚ÄúHouse with Moors‚Äù thanks to busts of black Moors with white eyes that adorned the garden fence of the house.  The architectural solution of the building facades is made in the fashionable at that time Florentine style. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Kochubey mansion went out onto the boulevard with two floors, and from the side of the courtyard - with three tiers.  The building rests on a granite basement, the basement is residential.  The decoration of the house was 3 balconies and cast columns supporting a cast-iron canopy.  The house had water supply, arranged bathrooms, heating was provided by ovens.  The owner himself rarely visited his property and soon sold it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.in-city-walks.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="prosecutor's office spb" class="if uuid-2559617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/2559617.jpg"></div><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  In 1867, Prince Mikhail Kochubey sold the mansion to the merchant Rodokonaki, who was rebuilding the house, but kept the facades and the general concept intact.  The reconstruction project was developed by K.F. Muller, who retained the maximum functionality and style of the mansion.  After 1917, the house was nationalized and placed at the disposal of a military tribunal.  The military had their own safety requirements, and therefore the internal ventilation ducts, pipes of the heating ovens were completely cemented, the wings and cellars underwent changes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pikabu.ru" data-author=": Archiphoto, "><img itemprop="image" alt="house with moors" class="if uuid-2559643" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/2559643.jpg"></div><p>  The first reconstruction was carried out in the 60s of the last century - to equip a cosmetic clinic, pretty spoiling the floors and wall decoration.  Since 1987, the Kochubey mansion on Konnogvardeisky Boulevard has been recognized as an architectural monument and taken under state protection. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1990, a competition was announced for the best use of the mansion.  The victory went to Ikar CJSC.  Restoration work began in 1993, and since 1994 the house received the status of a monument.  Now it houses several commercial organizations, the club ‚Äú300 years of St. Petersburg‚Äù, the regional headquarters of the International Association of Prosecutors (St. Petersburg) and other institutions. </p><h2>  Excursions to the mansion </h2><p>  The mansion of Kochubey in St. Petersburg on Konnogvardeisky Boulevard is distinguished by the elegance of the interior.  The main staircase, generously decorated with stucco molding, leads the visitor to the spacious hall, where a large old mirror in an oak frame has been preserved. </p><div class="photo" data-original="droogie.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="house with moors" class="if uuid-2559680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/2559680.jpg"></div><p>  The house has several living rooms, the most impressive is the Music Hall.  The snow-white walls are decorated with a cornice with stucco elements made in the form of massive vases with roses, therefore it is sometimes called the ‚ÄúPink Living Room‚Äù.  The hunting room is also interesting for visitors, where bas-reliefs on the walls depict hunting scenes. </p><p>  Excursions to the Kochubey mansion are conducted by various organizations, you can visit it privately, for this you need to make an appointment.  Various events are held on the premises of the palace, and a restaurant is open.  The house with the Moors leaves no one indifferent and makes an indelible impression of beauty and grace. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Association of Prosecutors </h2><p>  At the end of November 2017, the regional headquarters of the International Association of Prosecutors was opened in the Kochubeev house on Krasnogvardeisky Boulevard.  The Prosecutor General's Office of Russia has been an organizational member of the association for 20 years. </p><p>  The agreement to open the MAP office was adopted in 2014, a non-governmental organization brings together more than 500 thousand professionals from many countries of the world, which includes members of the St. Petersburg prosecutor's office. </p><h2>  In Tsarskoye Selo </h2><p>  In Tsarskoye Selo there are two buildings associated with different branches of the Kochubey clan.  The so-called cottage Kochubeyev was the property of Viktor Pavlovich Kochubey.  The house in the neoclassical style belonged to the ceremonies of the master of the royal court Vasily Petrovich Kochubey.  Today, the mansion houses the Training Center for Executive Training. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tsarselo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kochubey mansion in the royal village" class="if uuid-2559670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/2559670.jpg"></div><p>  Kochubey's mansion in Tsarskoye Selo was built in 1913 according to the project of a duet of architects: A. Tamanov and N. Lansere.  The owner was sincerely proud of his house, the interior decoration impressed every guest.  Vasily Kochubey captured the luxury of interiors in photographic photographs.  The pearl of the house was a collection of rarities, stored in a specially equipped armored room.  The collection of treasures included various items: furniture, books, manuscripts and much more. </p><p>  The family did not succeed in enjoying life in the mansion.  In 1914, the First World War began.  The mistress of the house, Varvara Vasilievna Kochubey, worked at the Tsarskoye Selo hospital, caring for the wounded.  In 1916, Vasily Kochubey sent his collection to Yaroslavl, and after 1917 he emigrated with his family to Belgium.  According to one legend, leaving his homeland, Prince Kochubei left the keys to all the rooms and pantries in the mansion, as well as a note with the text ‚ÄúFrom Russia, I‚Äôm returning to Russia‚Äù. </p><h2>  Recent story </h2><p>  After the revolution, an orphanage is placed in the nationalized mansion of Kochubey in Tsarskoye Selo.  A unique collection of rarities is being transferred to the Palais Palace, but its traces are lost in the 1920s.  In 1926, the building was given to the House of Revolutionary Veterans as a sanatorium. </p><p>  During the war, the city of Pushkin was captured by the Germans.  The Gestapo was staged in the prince‚Äôs house; during the period of the bombing, the house suffered significant damage.  The restoration was completed in 1948.  In the early 50s there was a sanatorium for party workers, the interiors were carefully restored and cherished. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="prince kochubey" class="if uuid-2559673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/2559673.jpg"></div><p>  Antique furniture was obtained from various sources, carefully selecting sets from the old photographs of the prince.  Since 1986, the Training Center has been located in the house, and in 2009 the hotel building was added to the main building.  The mansion is located in Pushkin on Radishcheva street, building 4. To inspect the mansion, tours are organized to find out the history of the legendary Kochubeev family, to see firsthand the preserved interiors and carefully assembled furniture of the early 20th century. </p><h2>  House on Furshratskaya </h2><p>  The mansion on Furshratskaya belonged to Prince Viktor Sergeyevich Kochubey.  In 1905, the prince acquired a land plot with a two-story house, which was immediately intended for demolition - he did not satisfy the taste of the new owner.  Project development and construction were entrusted to the architect Meltzer.  The documentation was ready by 1908, the master received a certain freedom of creativity, taking into account the requirements and tastes of the customer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kochubey mansion on Furshtatskaya" class="if uuid-2559660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/2559660.jpg"></div><p>  Prince Kochubey took an active part in the layout of the interior.  The building was erected for about 2 years, and the main work was completed by 1910, the completion of interior details lasted another 2 years.  The main architectural style is Art Nouveau with elements of neoclassicism and postmodernism.  The facade of the building is lined with <span>ceramic tiles,</span> when designing, all the technical achievements of that time were taken into account.  The house occupies the entire perimeter of the plot, and in the courtyard there is a small garden. </p><p>  To many contemporaries, the Kochubey mansion on Furshtatskaya seemed boring.  <span>Alexandre Benois</span> considered that the mansion was built in the "hygienic style."  Once inside, you realize that luxury is hidden in the details.  In the decoration of walls, floors and ceilings, only natural materials were used, technical equipment left behind many eminent and progressive houses of St. Petersburg.  In addition, the prince arranged with comfort not only his family, but also the servants who worked for him. </p><h2>  After the revolution </h2><p>  The Kochubey family lived in the mansion for less than 10 years.  After the revolution, the house was nationalized, and the owners emigrated.  Until 1918 the headquarters of the air defense of the city was located in the house, and after the 20th year, a women's consultation, later a children's clinic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.citywalls.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kochubey mansion in St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-2559668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31591/2559668.jpg"></div><p>  Fortunately, the main part of the interiors was kept almost intact.  From 2003 to 2008, a complete reconstruction of the interior, repair and restoration of the building facades was carried out.  The works were checked according to the original projects of Meltzer.  Now there is a business center, "Kochubei Club", ceremonial rooms are rented for various events, including excursions. </p><p>  The mansion is located at Furshratskaya Street, Building 24. Inspection of the architectural monument is available by appointment. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="59.9454077" data-lng="30.35533799999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/6/4/9/4649.png"></div><p>  Tours are conducted by both private practitioners and numerous excursion bureaus.  During the inspection, visitors get acquainted not only with the house, but also with the history of the Kochubeev family. </p>
