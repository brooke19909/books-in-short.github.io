Review and rating of the best models</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Listening to music is a favorite hobby of almost any person.  However, it is far from always possible to enjoy your favorite songs outside the home.  Of course, it is impossible to take a computer or laptop with you.  However, for this there are inexpensive MP3 players that play audio tracks without problems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestbuy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Standard player" class="if uuid-2592856" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2592856.jpg"></div><p>  Choosing products of this type, of course, you need to pay attention to the manufacturer.  However, it is much more important to consider the characteristics that are inherent in a good portable player. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  Today there are several types of MP3 players: </p><ul><li>  Clips.  Such products are fixed on clothes with a small clothespin or clip.  Thanks to this, the device does not need to be put into a pocket, carried in one‚Äôs hand or afraid that it will be lost. </li><li>  Classic candy bars.  This type of portable player is considered the most popular today.  The case can be of different sizes, depending on what characteristics the player has.  At the same time, a fairly wide selection of various forms of products is presented.  For example, you can purchase high-quality MP3 players in the form of a circle, square, drop or rectangle.  However, all such products have one common characteristic - they are a single unit that is not equipped with any kind of mounts.  Thanks to such a configuration, in such monoblocks the widest selection of characteristics is presented.  Most often, such compact players can be used not only to listen to music, but also to view video files and photos.  Some monoblocks also have additional applications, for example, for fitness, watches and much more. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecoolist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monoblock players" class="if uuid-2592859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2592859.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Headphones.  In this case, the portable product is mounted directly on the head.  This type of MP3 player is used mainly by athletes or those who do not like wires.  All control buttons are located directly on the product itself, which is located on the user's head.  However, you need to understand that in this case the possibility of using other external headphones of better quality is completely excluded.  In this case, if 1 of 2 ‚Äúears‚Äù ceases to work (a common problem), then such a player can be safely sent to a landfill. </li></ul><h2>  Display </h2><p>  To date, you can find on sale as a player without a display at all, and products equipped with a rather large touch monitor, so outwardly they strongly resemble a smartphone.  Thanks to this, a person can easily see the names of tracks, album covers of artists, view photos and even videos.  However, it is worth paying attention to some display parameters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk about the type of matrix, it is better to give preference to models in the characteristics of which IPS is indicated.  However, keep in mind that their cost will be an order of magnitude higher.  These are the best MP3 players, however, not everyone wants to spend a lot of money on a product that is used only on the way home from work or while jogging.  In this case, you should buy a product with an LCD matrix.  However, in this case, the picture quality will be significantly lower. </p><p>  If we talk about the diagonal of the display, then in this case everything again depends on the wishes of the user.  If he wants to use the player much longer without recharging and at the same time not watch the video, but only read the names of the tracks, then a 3-inch screen will be enough for this.  In this case, a person can easily use the equalizers and other settings, and the device will work longer without recharging. </p><p>  If the user wants to watch movies, then you should choose a larger monitor from 3 to 4.3 inches in size.  The same goes for permission.  If we are talking about players with a fairly large diagonal, then in this case the optimal resolution would be 480 x 800 pixels.  If this indicator is less, then on the big screen the picture will be blurry. </p><h2>  Built-in memory </h2><p>  Considering the ratings of MP3 players, it is worth paying attention to this indicator.  As a rule, modern players have a built-in hard drive or flash drive.  A person can store about 320 GB of music tracks and other files on portable products.  However, in this case we are talking about products with the type of drive HDD.  Unfortunately, such models are considered unreliable.  Therefore, it is worth giving preference to other products. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Best if the final memory capacity is between 64 GB.  It is also worth paying attention to the fact that in many modern products there is an opportunity to further expand the memory.  If you install a microSD card in the player, then in this case you can use up to 256 GB.  However, if a person plans only to listen to his favorite collection of music, then in this case there will be enough internal memory up to 32 Gigabytes.  The best option is to purchase a player with 4 or 8 Gigabytes and expand this indicator with an additional drive. </p><h2>  Playback Formats </h2><p>  In this case, everything also depends on the wishes of the buyer and the cost of the product.  As a rule, even a budget MP3 player is capable of producing <span>MP3,</span> WAV and WMA formats.  This is usually enough to watch videos, listen to music and enjoy photos. </p><p>  It is also worth considering reviews of MP3 players that are most popular. </p><h2>  Apple iPod nano 7gen </h2><p>  You should immediately pay attention to the fact that this player is only available with 16 GB memory.  There are no cheap 8 gig versions.  This is due to the great functionality of the product, as well as the ability to play numerous files.  However, this does not prevent the "apple" gadgets to occupy a leading position in the numerous ratings of devices for playing music. </p><div class="photo" data-original="qq2you.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple iPod nano 7gen" class="if uuid-2592864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2592864.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that this iPod is the only one from the Apple manufacturer that allows the user to listen to FM radio stations.  However, some note that the product display is not so large.  Its size is only 2.5 inches with a resolution of 240 x 432 dpi.  Also, many note a low particle density, because of this, when the image is approaching, the pixels become clearly visible.  However, you need to understand that this MP3 player with radio was designed solely to listen to music.  The display is added only for ease of management and in order to get acquainted with information about the tracks.  By and large, this is only a player, not a multifunctional product that is used for all possible entertainment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the other hand, of course, Apple is famous for its quality, so this product can be considered reliable.  On the other hand, sophisticated music lovers still prefer more professional products (for example, from Sony).  In this case, the whole point is which brand a person likes best.  For fans of the "apple" products, of course, this is the best MP3 player. </p><p>  It is also worth paying attention to another plus of this player.  If a person wants to play a video with subtitles, he can turn them on or off without problems, as well as select a sound track.  Photos are scrolled both in manual mode and in automatic mode. </p><p>  If we talk about the main purpose of this player - playing music, then it is equipped with a built-in equalizer with numerous settings.  In this case, you can put a selection of a random track or find the desired song by its name.  Due to the large amount of memory and the ability to increase its size, the product can store a large number of files.  Also, many note a good battery capacity.  With continuous listening to music, the player will work for 30 hours.  If a person wants to enjoy the video, then he can easily watch 2-3 films. </p><h2>  FiiO X1 </h2><p>  This brand of players is considered little known in Russia, however, this brand is very popular abroad.  Products for this type are distinguished by an acceptable cost of high quality. </p><p>  Fiio X1 ranks second in popularity.  Outwardly, it is very similar to the iPod.  On the control panel there are keys that go in a circle.  The player is equipped with a small display and an aluminum case.  Many note that the firmware of this model is the best of the entire line.  In addition, the player has a quite impressive amount of memory, which is equal to 128 GB. </p><p>  This model is difficult to find on sale today, however it is possible to order it directly from China.  The player is notable for its low cost, reliability, high-quality firmware, a large selection of functions.  Using the product you can listen to music and listen to audio books in good quality. </p><p>  If we talk about the shortcomings, some note that the player is suitable exclusively for listening to music.  However, if this is the only goal, then this is one of the best MP3 players. </p><h2>  FiiO X1-II </h2><p>  This is the next and more modern model.  The FiiO X1-2 provides a digital-to-analog converter.  Why users have noted great sound.  Thanks to such a powerful amplifier, after using this player it is impossible to listen to music using a smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.roe-hifi.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="FiiO X1-II" class="if uuid-2592871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2592871.jpg"></div><p>  If we talk about the portability of the product, then, as a rule, with regular listening to music, this player can be charged no more than 2 times a week.  Products are equipped with mechanical buttons, which is also a priority for many today.  Thanks to this, you can switch the volume, also tracks can be directly through clothes.  The sound quality is excellent. </p><p>  In addition, the player is equipped with a Bluetooth module.  If we talk about the shortcomings, some say that the product sometimes works too slowly.  Also, many drew attention to the new firmware of the operating system, which is much worse than the Fiio X1.  Many believe that it is because of this that a slightly slower reading of memory occurs if a person loads a large number of new tracks.  However, after a few minutes, the product starts to work stably.  If a person prioritizes quality sound, then it is worth choosing this particular model. </p><h2>  FiiO X5-III </h2><p>  This is an even more modern model of a similar gadget, which can be safely put in the third position in the rating.  If the previous products looked more like an iPod and were more compact, then the new player looks much more brutal.  Many note the excellent finish.  The buttons are located in the most convenient way.  Therefore, the management is the most comfortable. </p><p>  There is also a button to turn on the memory, rewind tracks and the volume wheel.  Many appreciated precisely his sensitivity.  Sound level adjustment can be from 1 to 120. </p><p>  It is also worth paying attention to a rather large display with a diagonal of 3.9 inches.  At the same time, the product is equipped with the maximum possible resolution of 480 x 800 pixels.  If we talk about the operating time, then users also note a rather long product life without recharging. </p><h2>  Player Sony NWZ-B183F </h2><p>  This player was released several years ago, but it is still included in the ratings of the best devices of this type.  And today he is in fourth place.  This is due to the low price of the products and the fact that there is nothing superfluous in it.  The player's memory is 4 GB, if desired, it can be increased. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mouthshut.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony NWZ-B183F" class="if uuid-2592875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2592875.jpg"></div><p>  Speaking of the best MP3 players, many distinguish this particular model not only due to the eminent manufacturer, but also the sound quality.  Stereo sound is really at a high level.  If you additionally purchase good headphones (standard ‚Äúears‚Äù of not the best quality are included), then you won‚Äôt want to change this gadget for another for many years to come. </p><p>  Charging via USB cable.  One charge is enough for 20 hours of continuous listening to music.  It is also worth noting the stylish ergonomic design of the product. </p><p>  If we talk about the shortcomings of the Sony NWZ-B183F, then most of all confuses the reset button of the device.  The fact is that there is no special needle in the kit with which you can turn off the player, so you have to torment yourself.  However, today such accessories often come with numerous gadgets, so many already have a ‚Äúneedle‚Äù. </p><h2>  Sony NW-WS413 </h2><p>  This is another gadget from a well-known manufacturer, which is included in the ratings of the highest quality and most popular players.  Users note the perfect sound of the device.  In addition, due to its convenience, the product becomes the optimal solution for athletes. </p><p>  In their reviews of the Sony NW-WS413, many note the adjustable ‚ÄúSurround Sound‚Äù mode, making music playback even higher.  The most interesting thing is that the player is in a waterproof case, so you can safely submerge under water with it. </p><p>  The product is equipped with a fairly powerful battery.  Thanks to this, the player works offline for about 12 hours. </p><h2>  iPod shuffle 4 </h2><p>  Of course, considering the best models of portable players, it is impossible to ignore this most popular manufacturer to date.  The Apple iPod shuffle 4, which is located in the sixth position in the ranking, is distinguished by high-quality sound and compactness. </p><div class="photo" data-original="beginnertriathlete.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPod shuffle 4" class="if uuid-2592879" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2592879.jpg"></div><p>  The player is able to perform many functions.  For example, if necessary, you can lock the keys or sort the tracks in the most convenient way.  The player is equipped with a metal case, so even in a fall situation nothing will happen to it.  Such a gadget is suitable for those who do not like large-sized devices and prefer high-quality sound of music. </p><h2>  Sony NW-A45 16Gb </h2><p>  This is another model from the famous manufacturer, which occupies the 7th line of popularity ratings.  This model is intended solely for listening to music, so it does not realize the ability to play videos or view photos. </p><p>  The product has a built-in memory of 16 GB.  This parameter can be increased if you purchase an additional microSD card. </p><h2>  Transcend MP710 </h2><p>  This Taiwanese manufacturer is also famous for quality compact gadgets.  This model is equipped with 8 GB of internal memory.  The product provides all the functions necessary for a music lover.  The gadget has a good and powerful sound, support for all the necessary file formats (including video).  This compact player is suitable for athletes and those who follow their figure, as it has a pedometer.  You can start listening to music from the place where the user stopped for the last time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hardwarezone.com.ph" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Transcend MP710" class="if uuid-2592882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52769/2592882.jpg"></div><p>  If we talk about the shortcomings, many say that the buttons for controlling the player are too close to each other.  Therefore, it is very difficult to hit them the first time, you have to get used to it.  The product does not have a charging indicator, but in standalone mode the player is able to work up to 20 hours. </p><p>  Also, many note the poor quality of the headphones that come with the gadget.  However, a similar problem occurs in almost all similar products from a variety of manufacturers. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Almost everyone knows how to use an MP3 player and what options it has.  When choosing a model, it is worth checking the quality of the buttons and the body of the product.  Everyone has their own preferences.  Some people categorically purchase gadgets from only one manufacturer, others are ready to try something new.  However, regardless of this, you need to pay attention to the functionality of the product, as well as the quality of music playback. </p>
