  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to knit a sweater for a child?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many fashionistas every season try to update the family wardrobe.  Trying to keep up with the fashion trends of the winter season, each lady sits down with a cup of coffee in front of many magazines with schemes and looks through sections that can tell how to tie a sweater for herself, children or her husband. </p><p>  Here we will consider a scheme for those who wander on the Internet in search of clues.  And also for those who are looking for a description of how <span>to knit a sweater with knitting needles for a</span> child of eight to nine years old. </p><p>  In order to start knitting <span>sweaters with knitting needles</span> for a child of this age, you will need: </p><p>  - woolen threads (about seven to eight skeins). </p><p>  - knitting needles (it is better to use circular) with a thickness of three and a half to four millimeters. </p><p>  Memo for those who started <span>knitting sweaters with knitting needles</span> : </p><p>  - Before you start knitting, decide on the model of the product.  It can be fastened with buttons or be integral.  It can have a V-shaped neckline of the gate or the classic one - rounded. </p><p>  - Do not forget to periodically try on a sweater for a child, since you can knit it not according to the size of your baby. </p><p>  You are invited to a simple sweater scheme with a simple pattern and without buttons.  There are seventy-two loops.  If more is needed, add this way: each size increases the set of turns from six to ten pieces.  An elastic band is knitted: two wrong ones, two front ones, so they fit six to the end (of course, and more, but the number of lines should be even) of rows. </p><p>  In order to knit a simple sweater without a pattern, it is enough to switch to knitting only with facial loops.  If you want, you can add an ornament.  Drawing for the back is optional.  How to connect a sweater with a simple checkers pattern?  - Read below. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The back fits simply; for the front, do the following: </p><p>  The same number of loops is typed as for the back.  The elastic is knitted in the same way (six rows). </p><p>  Then you should knit like this: </p><p>  - Divide the number of loops so that in one "checker" an even number is obtained; </p><p>  - seventy virgo is perfectly divided by six, you get twelve squares; </p><p>  - the front part begins to knit immediately from the pattern; </p><p>  - Six facial, then the same number of purl stitches are knitted (so, alternating, finish the row).  So six rows fit; </p><p>  - the seventh - twelfth line should begin with the wrong ones, then knit on the principle of alternation (6 * 6).  Next you will see how to knit. </p><p>  Since the back and the sweaters are knitted the same way, further actions for both parts are explained. </p><p>  Each half of the product fits to the level of the chest without changes.  From the moment your knitting needles are flush with it, the reduction of loops begins (starting from this row and in each second one piece on each side).  Only eight turns should go. </p><p>  The back is completed when the product is at neck level, and the front part is the clavicle.  Completion is carried out in shares.  First, the right side remains on the spoke (optional), and the left ends - in the center of the canvas and with the edge (one loop in each place of reduction).  Similarly, the rest is completed. </p><p>  How to tie a sweater?  Of course, not forgetting about the sleeves! </p><p>  There is no way to give the exact number of loops for these parts, since the completeness of the rivers in children of this age may be different.  Therefore, gain as much as necessary so that the child‚Äôs hand passes freely. </p><p>  Knit the elastic in the same way as the back or the front.  Then knit similarly to the back fabric.  Approximately to the level of the elbow, then start adding loops.  One in every fourth row, you will get fifteen such additions (maybe more or less).  This inaccuracy depends on the fact that the length of the sleeve can be different.  When you are ready to begin completing the product, start reducing the loops in each second row (this must be done four times).  Now you can complete the part. </p><p>  The second sleeve is knitted in the same way. </p><p>  Before you begin to connect the parts, they need to be moistened and dried.  This is required in order for the product to acquire natural shrinkage. </p><p>  After that, you can sew all the parts together.  Everything, your product is ready.  Now you know how to knit a sweater for the baby. </p>
