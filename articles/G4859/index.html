    <p>  Then we connect this point with the lower and upper points on this vertical line.  We wipe all auxiliary strokes from the sides, mark the places for gluing the shelves and strips for gluing. </p><p>  Now we will prepare the cabinet doors.  To do this, draw a hexagon similar to the first.  Gluing strips will only be on the side.  Then divide the hexagon in half.  Next, we carry out a drawing of the sides, the upper part of the cabinet and the bottom also with gluing strips.  It remains to cut out the details along the intended lines and glue them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before gluing the doors, you must first "install" the shelves.  We fix two ribbons on the doors that will act as a lock.  Now the cabinet needs to be decorated: inside we glue it with black paper, and outside - red. </p><p>  Optionally, you can use stickers that depict cartoon characters, or make your own drawings.  That‚Äôs the closet for the Monster High doll.  Crafts, photos of which can be seen in our article, are very diverse.
