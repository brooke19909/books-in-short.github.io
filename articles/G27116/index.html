Due to the combination of such characteristics, clay products are incredibly popular from ancient times to the present day.  In the old days, dishes and clay figures were made in almost all regions of our country.  At the same time, in each locality, their own forms and copyright traditions of painting and decoration appeared.  The village of Dymkovo (Kirov region) became famous throughout the country thanks to its craftsmen who make small bright figures that can make a variety of sounds.  Curiously, the traditional Dymkovo toy was invented not for the fun of children, but for protection from evil spirits.  In ancient times, it was believed that evil is afraid of loud noises.  That is why in ancient times, all Dymkovo toys could rattle or whistle, they were traditionally made for the holiday of Whistle, during which it was supposed to expel evil spirits and have fun with the whole world.

Today, even in the village of Dymkovo, not only whistles and rattles are made, but also ordinary figurines, figurines that are not able to make loud noises.  A distinctive feature of these toys can be considered a relatively small size.  Masters, faithful to ancient traditions, usually make figures of animals, birds, young ladies, less often - men.  However, quite often there are also difficult-to-form products - women holding a loaf in their hands, or good fellows on horseback.  A simple pattern and the use of a small number of flowers in painting is what distinguishes a Dymkovo toy.  <span>How to make a</span> beautiful do-it-yourself <span>horse out of plasticine</span> in the style of this folk craft?  Everything is quite simple - the shape of the figure should be simple, and simple lines and dots are used to paint finished products.  Note: in the traditional version, the background should be white, but today more and more often you can see toys painted in full with multi-colored paints.

    <h2>  Materials for home creativity </h2><p>  Creating a Dymkovo toy at home is a great <span>idea for the creativity of</span> children in collaboration with their parents.  The most affordable and inexpensive material for modeling is clay.  For the manufacture of figures in the traditions of the village of Dymkovo it would be more logical to use white material.  But since plasticine is often sold in sets consisting of different colors, you can mix everything together and sculpt from the resulting mass.  It is good to cover the finished figure with a primer, and only after it has dried, proceed to painting.  Traditionally, in Dymkovo, toys are not varnished, leaving them with a matte texture.  But if you use ordinary unstable paints, it makes sense to fix them additionally. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dymkovo toy: how to make a horse out of plasticine with your own hands? </h2>
