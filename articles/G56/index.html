Italy ski resorts on the map</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Italy's ski resorts are known to winter sports enthusiasts no less than the Swiss Courchevel or the French San Moritz.  Places such as Cervinia, Courmayeur, Bormio or Val di Fassa are well-known to all.  All these resorts are located on the southern slopes of the Alps.  Of course, there are excellent ski slopes and places in the Apennines, for example, in the mountains of Abruzzo (Prati di Tivo, Monte Piselli), but they work only in the winter season.  But alpine resorts, due to their high altitude and the presence of glaciers, are accessible to lovers of skiing, snowboarding, tobogganing all year round.  And everywhere the guests are awaited by the notorious Italian hospitality, sunny and snowy slopes, tracks of any degree of difficulty and excellent European service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy ski resorts on the map" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/373859.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What place to choose for your vacation </h2><p>  Italy ski resorts on a country map are divided according to administrative provinces.  Thus, we can talk about the ski areas of Lombardy, Piedmont, Aosta, Trentino and Alto Adige.  Alps are in all of them, but this mountain system is too huge to be monotonous. </p><p>  The slopes of Lombardy allow you to combine skiing, <span>shopping in Milan</span> and relaxing on the lakes.  Dolomites surprise tourists with their colors, rocky spurs.  And the peaks of Piedmont and Aosta are the most majestic, in addition, rest in those places allows you to ride in the Swiss resorts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When choosing a place to stay, do not focus on your own level of training in <span>skiing.</span>  Each resort has at its disposal both steep ‚Äúblack‚Äù tracks and ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, gentle slopes for beginners.  Only the time of your vacation should be taken into account (not all places have year-round slopes) and the financial component. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy ski resorts" class="if" height="264" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/373838.jpg?1397667620414" width="397"></div>

    <h2>  Ski Areas in the Aosta Valley </h2><p>  In the triangle that forms the state <span>borders of France,</span> Switzerland and Italy, is the province of Valle d'Aosta.  The region is small in territory, but it is here that the oldest, most expensive and best ski resorts in Italy are located.  All of them are located at a considerable height, at the foot of never-melting glaciers.  Around - solid "four-thousandths" - Monte Rosa, Gran Paradiso and Mont Blanc.  The latter is the highest peak not only in the Grey Alps, but also the entire mountain system as a whole, as well as the "roof" of Europe. </p><p>  Here he liked to ski Mussolini, and with him the entire fascist elite.  The first lifts were built for them, although the resorts of Courmayeur and Cervinia existed even at the dawn of the European enthusiasm for skiing.  The tourist infrastructure of this place continues to develop rapidly - new routes are being laid, new roads are being built.  One of them allows you to get directly from the center of the capital - founded by the ancient Romans of Aosta - to the newest fashionable village of Pyla in twenty minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski resorts italy reviews" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/373839.jpg?1397667951839" width="415"></div>

The highest lift delivers tourists at 3899 meters above sea level.  The tracks are wide, suitable for beginners as well as for the average level of skiing.  Ases can move in the opposite, northern direction and find themselves in Swiss Zermatt.  Returning to the top will not be a problem - there is a single ski pass that connects both resorts and the Italian village of Valtournenche. </p><p>  Freeride fans will also receive a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãadrenaline.  Here is the longest ski track of Grand Pista - twenty kilometers of wonderful descent.  Of the minuses, one can name only some high cost of the resort (the proximity of Switzerland affects).  Therefore, those skiers who are looking for means to reduce the cost of their vacation, stop in the town of Chamonix.  Buses run from there to Mount Cervinia (Swiss name Matterhorn).  Other famous Italian ski resorts are located nearby: Courmayeur, La Thuile, Gressoney-Le-Trinit√©, Monte Rosa Valley and Champoluc, famous for skiing enthusiasts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy ski resorts prices" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/373840.jpg?1397668020892" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Skating in Piedmont </h2><p>  This is the land of nature reserves, clear lakes and hilly landscapes.  Anyone who likes the <span>French Alps</span> will certainly appreciate Piedmont.  The heart and unofficial ski capital of the region is the town of Sestriere.  It is located at an altitude of more than two thousand meters, and therefore there are no problems with snow cover even in warm winters.  Lifts stop working in April. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Most of the slopes here are for intermediate skiers.  But there is in the Grande Galaxy region suitable entertainment for aces, as well as snowboarders and heli-ski fans.  It offers <span>cross-country skiing</span> enthusiasts - about thirteen kilometers of beautiful tracks.  Decent Apres-ski provide 33 restaurants, a nightclub, bowling alley, ice rink, a sports club with saunas and pools.  No less popular are other ski resorts in Italy in Piedmont: Bardonecchia and Souz d'Ulsk, Claviere and Cesana. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best ski resorts in Italy" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/373841.jpg?1397668107458" width="460"></div>

    <h2>  Ski Areas in Lombardy </h2><p>  The proximity to the world capital of shopping, Milan and large lakes make this region very popular not only in winter.  But if you have chosen Livigno as your vacation destination, you will not need to go to Milan to shop.  Since this ski resort is also part of the duty-free zone, and all the shops here are duty-free.  But freeride in Livigno is allowed only with a guide - the slopes here are avalanche-hazardous. </p><p>  The most prestigious ski resort in Lombardy is Bormio.  Italy hosts here the highest level international winter sports competitions.  The town itself is very ancient and has been known since the first century BC due to nine healing thermal springs. </p>

    <h2>  Dolomites </h2><p>  In the Trentino region, you can combine skiing and a board with visits to places of worship such as Lake Garda, Venice, Verona.  Tourism infrastructure here is also very developed.  Guests are offered dog sledding and sleigh rides, rock climbing, ice polo.  Everyone will find Apres-ski to their taste: discos, saunas, gyms, restaurants and bars will create an atmosphere of an enduring holiday. </p><p>  Italy's ski resorts in Trentino are also popular because of the fabulously beautiful nature.  One has only to see how the glare of the setting sun plays on the slopes of the Dolomites - and you will strive here again and again.  The most prestigious resort in this region is Val di Fassa.  For beginners, <span>Madonna di Campiglio is</span> more suitable <span>.</span>  An ideal family vacation awaits you in Cavalese, Val di Fiemme, Passo Tonale, Vigo di Fassa and other resorts of Trentino. </p><h2>  Alto Adige </h2><p>  This area is also located in the Dolomites.  The unsurpassed beauty of these slopes and the riot of colors, the instant transition from the snowy peaks to the citrus groves of Limone on Lake Garda make this region very attractive.  Before the Second World War, this area belonged to Austria, and this fact still affects the appearance of houses, hotels and punctuality in public transport. </p><p>  What are the ski resorts in Italy in the upper part of the Adige River region?  Reviews mention the Val Gardena ski area.  It regularly hosts international freestyle and downhill competitions.  The Val Gardena area consists of three resorts - Santa Cristina, Selva and Ortisei, interconnected by free buses and a single ski pass. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski resort cervinia italy" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/373858.jpg?1397668322513" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure apr√®s ski </h2><p>  In each of the regions mentioned here, the range of services is approximately the same.  Somewhere they hit natural hot springs, in other places they lure with dog sledding, snowmobiling, parakiting.  In some places, such as, for example, in Lombard Livigno, a paradise for shopaholics, in others you can easily meet the famous politician or the world star of show business on the track. </p><p>  In a word, you can go to Italy to the mountain resorts even if you are not skiing at all and are not even going to stand on them.  There is enough entertainment without them.  However, you should not miss the chance to conquer the slope.  Moreover, in each of the resorts there are ski schools for both children and adults.  Experienced instructors (among them there are Russian speakers) will help you get rid of the phobia of falling once and for all. </p><h2>  Ski resorts in Italy: prices </h2><p>  The proximity of Courchevel and compatriots, throwing money, affects the neighboring Courmayeur.  However, this only applies to hotel accommodation and restaurant prices.  The cost of ski passes at different resorts differs from each other depending on the coverage of territories and peaks.  For example, in Aosta they cost 111 –Ñ for 3 days and 240 –Ñ for a week, in Piedmont and Lombardy - 180 for 6 days, and lifts in the Dolomites in a week empty your wallet by 233 –Ñ.  A more significant difference between high and low seasons (about 5 –Ñ per day). </p><p>  If you want to visit the famous ski resorts in Italy and not spend a fortune on your trip, book a hotel nearby.  Public transport in the country is relatively cheap and punctual.  You can also schedule your vacation at the beginning or end of the ski season. </p>
