Located near the Alps, it captivates guests with natural landscapes and a sense of comfort and tranquility.  What attractions are definitely worth a visit in this country?  Why is the <span>capital of Liechtenstein</span> interesting <span>?</span> </p><h2>  Dwarf state </h2><p>  Liechtenstein is considered a <span>dwarf state,</span> since its area is only 160 square meters.  km, and the population is 33 thousand people.  The country is located in Western Europe, surrounded by strong neighbors - Austria and Switzerland. </p><p>  In 15 BC, the territory of the modern state was part of the Roman province, and in the I century belonged to the Carolingians.  After the collapse of the kingdom, all lands were divided into duchies.  The Principality of Liechtenstein appeared in 1719, after the family of Liechtenstein acquired the lands of Shelenberg and Vaduz, and Anton Florian received the status of prince of sovereign dignity. </p><p>  Throughout history, the principality experienced various influences and combined the features of Austrian, Bavarian, Swiss cultures.  Locals speak the Allemanic <span>dialect of German</span> , although standard German is considered official. </p><p>  A hundred years ago, the state did not have a high level of economy, now it is among the first states in terms of living standards.  The lion's share of the budget is industry and taxes from the registration of international enterprises.  The rest adds postage stamps and tourism.  Every year, Liechtenstein's post office issues several rare postage stamps that collectors are happy to purchase.  Their sale is 10% of the country's budget. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Vaduz </h2><p>  The city of Vaduz - the main city of Liechtenstein - is quite small in size, only 5 thousand inhabitants live in it.  Presumably, the city existed even before the XII century, but it was from this period that it appeared in written sources, then its name sounded like Farduzes.  It is officially accepted that Vaduz founded the Earl of Verdunberg in the 13th century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main attraction of the city is Vaduz Castle.  Stadtle Street, on which it is located, is also worthy of attention.  Here is the city hall and the main buildings of Vaduz: joint-stock companies, Bank Liechtenstein, shops and a museum. </p><p>  The country's national museum dates from 1500 and is made in the Gothic style.  Previously, the building housed a hotel, then a tavern, and even later it served for government meetings, and in the basement was a prison. </p><p>  The quarter, with the main buildings of the Liechtenstein government, is an example of architecture of various periods and eras.  The city hall and the government house, as well as a music school deserve special attention. </p><p>  Nearby is the neo-Gothic church of St. Florin of 1873.  In the old part of the city is the Gothic chapel of Gasthof-Leuven, built back in 1388. </p>

    <h2>  Capital Castle in Liechtenstein </h2><p>  The fortress of the Middle Ages is the main symbol of the city and its hallmark.  Vaduz Castle was built around the 12th century.  The original foundation has been preserved to our time, and the castle itself was repeatedly rebuilt until the 17th century. </p><p>  The foundation of the castle is 13 meters and its walls are about 4 meters thick.  On the territory of the castle is the medieval chapel of <span>St. Anne</span> with an altar, which, obviously, was erected later and made in the late Gothic style. </p><p>  During the Swabian war, the Swiss destroyed the Vaduz castle, but the foundation still survived.  In the XVII century it was rebuilt, expanding the western part.  In the XX century, the fortress was restored by order of Prince Johann II. </p><p>  Currently, Vaduz Castle is the residence of the current Prince of Liechtenstein, which is why wide access to the castle is closed.  The prince's family acquired the castle in 1712, together with the county. </p>
