    <p>  Tourists renting rooms in this hotel first fly to Sri Lanka by plane to Colombo airport.  The capital of the country is located about 35 km from Wadduwa.  Bandaike Airport is located about 70 km from this resort.  Therefore, judging by the reviews, the future residents of the Taprobana Wadduwa Deluxe 5 * complex (Sri Lanka) have to get to their buildings, usually, unfortunately, for quite a long time.  In most cases, the journey by tour operator's bus to this hotel takes tourists 1.5-2 hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Features </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">This small relax hotel in lively Wadduwa was built recently - in 2014.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">It takes guests in two four-story buildings of stylish modern architecture.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The small courtyard of the hotel is well landscaped and has, according to many vacationers, a very convenient layout.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Hotel</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Taprobana Wadduwa 5 *</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">belongs</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">to the group of five-star complexes.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">However, the classiness of hotels in Sri Laki, according to many tourists, usually does not coincide with global standards.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">This should be borne in mind by tourists who rented rooms in this complex.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">They should nevertheless rely on the Taprobana hotel to a level of no more than 4 *.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">According to most vacationers, this hotel is most suitable for lovers of a relaxing holiday.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The territory of this hotel is almost always very quiet.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">And the sound insulation in the buildings here, judging by the reviews, is not bad.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">At the hotel, vacationers can also take a walk in a small garden.</span></span></span> </p>

also information about cases of theft in this hotel.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Money and valuables, resting here, should be stored in a safe.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Perhaps the theft in this hotel is nothing more than an accident.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">But caution, the residents of this complex should still be observed unconditionally.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  Taprobana Wadduwa Hotel Staff Reviews </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Unfortunately, there are mixed reviews</span></span></span> <span data-mce-mark="1"><span

data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">on the Web.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">In general, hotel workers are courteous to their guests.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">However, some tourists note the fact that the staff of this recreation center can behave towards the guests somewhat intrusively.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">It so happens that the hotel workers go after the guests literally on their heels, offering them something to buy.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">This, of course, can be attributed to the disadvantages of Taprobana.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Unfortunately, the staff of this hotel cannot speak Russian.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">But they understand English pretty well.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The peculiarity of this hotel, among other things, is that the staff here are almost completely male.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Even rooms in Taprobana are cleaned mainly by boys under the age of 30.</span></span></span> </p><h2>  How to feed at Taprobana </h2><p>  <span

the "buffet" system or by the menu.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The latter scheme is usually used at a time when few people live in the complex.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">There is a dining room in this hotel on the ground floor, next to the reception.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The menu at the Taprobana hotel, according to many vacationers, is quite diverse.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">And actually the food itself in this hotel, judging by the reviews, is quite tasty.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">The work of the cook of the complex as a whole has earned very good reviews from vacationers.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Tourists in the restaurant of the complex are served pancakes, omelets, waffles, burgers, etc. There are, of course, various kinds of drinks in the hotel dining room.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Queues for dishes in the restaurant of this hotel almost never happens.</span></span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1"><span data-mce-mark="1">Even at the peak of the season, hotel guests can take their favorite food</span></span></span> completely free. </p>
