  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Needlework for beginners: crocheted square plaid</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  From time immemorial, fishermen knitted nets.  Today, with the help of it you can create various unique and useful things.  But unfortunately, far from everyone knows how <span>to crochet a</span> plaid.  Although its implementation is not difficult.  The shape, pattern, number of colors, texture of the resulting product is entirely up to you.  Flight of fancy, limited only by your idea. </p><p>  What could be easier than creating a warm, beautiful, fashionable crochet square plaid.  Such a task will be on the shoulder of any needlewoman who begins to tinker, and will be interesting to the master of the season.  It is so simple that anyone can afford to crochet a square blanket with their own hands.  Without spending a lot of money, you will always get the right, stylish, unique thing, a great gift for your loved ones. </p><p>  You will need: </p><p>  1) fantasy (in this case, the most important thing). </p><p>  2) a hook (the hook number depends on the thickness of the thread you have chosen) for thick woolen threads, hook No. 4-6 is acceptable, for thinner yarn - No. 3-2. </p><p>  3) yarn, if there is no necessary quantity, use leftovers, it‚Äôs even more interesting. </p><p>  4) patience. </p><p>  First, select the main background, respectively, this yarn should be more.  Then proceed to the base of the plaid, i.e.  knitting squares. </p><p>  The main elements - squares, can be connected in millions of ways.  The final type of product, its structure, depends on the chosen knitting technique. </p><p>  The square is solid viscous, without a pattern. </p><p>  A plaid of squares is <span>crocheted with single crochet columns.</span>  The basic principle for creating this type of square is straight rows of loops that follow one after another. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Technique of execution. </p><p>  1) We collect any number of air loops (hereinafter referred to as VP), starting from the intended size of the square. </p><p>  2) Plus a couple of loops for lifting to the selected number. </p><p>  3) We knit a single crochet in a third or second loop from the end. </p><p>  4) We knit a row, VP, and repeat a series of columns. </p><p>  5) How to determine the number of rows?  Add the opposite corners of the square diagonally.  Did you get an isosceles triangle?  So the perfect square is ready. </p><p>  The square is openwork. </p><p>  The square, the so-called "grandmother", is best known for needlewomen.  It was used by needlewomen at all times, and is still popular.  The technique of its implementation is also very simple, so knitting a plaid from squares is not at all difficult. </p><p>  Knitting technique. </p><p>  1) We collect 6 VP, connect in a circle with a connecting column. </p><p>  2) 1 row: we knit 6 VP, then 3 columns in a ring. </p><p>  3) Then we make 3 VP, 3 columns in a ring, 3 VP, 3 columns in a ring, 3 VP, 2 columns in a ring. </p><p>  4) We connect a connecting column in the 3rd VP of this row. </p><p>  5) We collect 1 <span>connecting column.</span> </p><p>  6) Next, we make 3 VPs, 2 columns are removed into the arch from the VP of 1 row.  Then we knit 3 VP and 2 columns in the same arch.  We make 1 VP, 3 columns in the next arch, 3 VP, 3 columns in the same arch. </p><p>  7) Repeat the action 2 times. </p><p>  9) We knit 1 air.  We close the row with a connecting column, introducing a hook into the upper lifting loop of this row. </p><p>  10) 3 row: we make 4 VP, 3 columns in the arch of the lower row, 3 VP, 3 columns in the arch.  Next, 1 air loop, 3 columns in the lower arch, then 1 air, 3 columns in the arch, 3 VP, 3 columns in the arch (repeat 2 times).  We knit 1 air, then 2 columns in the arch below.  We close the row with a connecting column.  The square is ready, for larger sizes we repeat the 3 row pattern. </p><p>  The most enjoyable final part. </p><p>  There are many techniques for joining parts.  You can just stitch all the parts, but it‚Äôs better to knit.  Here is one method: we lay out the squares in the intended order with the front side.  Insert the hook into the upper loops of the squares and knit with half crochets.  Such a connection is quite simple and the product looks neat.  Now we wash the plaid by hand, dry it, iron it from the wrong side.  Voila, the crochet plaid of squares is ready. </p><p>  Now that you have the skill in knitting plaids with simple patterns of squares, you can try your hand at knitting complex openwork elements, as well as knitting with two or more colors. </p>
