    <p>  <strong>Base</strong> </p><p>  In order to master tatting for beginners, it will not take much time.  The main things to pay attention to are the materials, technology and the ability to correctly read the diagram. </p><p>  So, in order to start your acquaintance with this technique of needlework, you need to look into the appropriate store and purchase the following items. </p><ol><li>  A special thread that is used to create masterpieces using the hook or quilting technique.  The thickness of the thread itself depends on the project, which will serve as an example for training.  But their basis is largely based on the <span>personal preferences of the</span> needlewoman.  And in this case, both natural (cotton, linen or wool) and synthetic (for example, kapron) can be successfully used; </li><li>  A special shuttle or needle - you can purchase both of these in order to understand which of the techniques of this type of needlework will appeal to you; </li><li>  Needlework scissors or regular manicure. </li></ol><p>  Here is the whole list of necessary materials that will be required in order to begin your acquaintance with this unusual and attractive type of needlework. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tatting technique" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11457/230915.jpg" width="404"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Tatting technique</strong> </p><p>  It is worth mentioning right away that this type of lace weaving, unlike many others, suggests that the craftswoman herself will choose the most suitable tool for herself.  So, there are only two basic techniques: tatting with a needle and tatting with a shuttle.  But it‚Äôs worth starting with the most common one - the shuttle. </p><p>  <strong>Shuttle</strong> </p><p>  Start work with the shuttle as follows.  A thread should be tucked into it, which is captured with the index finger and thumb at a distance of 6 cm from the end.  Next, 4 fingers, except for the thumb, are entwined with a thread from the shuttle so that it again ‚Äúreturns‚Äù to the already clamped end.  After that, the thread from the shuttle (it‚Äôs the leading one) goes beyond the inside of the formed loop, wrapping it around it.  This is the beginning of the work.  It is worth noting that basically the shuttle in the frivolite is held in the right hand, and the left acts as a "machine" for lace. </p><p>  It is worth noting that in the frivolite created with the help of the shuttle, there are two basic elements: the forward and reverse nodes.  Both of them make up halves, with the help of which an already full-fledged openwork knot is created. </p>

    <p>  Very often, lace weaving with a needle can resemble knitting with a single needle.  This is partly true.  In order to start their work with a needle, a beginner needlewoman must cut a thread of the required length.  It is threaded into the eye and, for the most part, forms a circle so that the tip is at the level of the needle tip.  Next, the needle is twisted twice with a thread, after which, holding the semicircle with the <span>index finger of the</span> opposite hand, form a loop, bending around and tightening the semicircle with a needle.  By the way, in the frivolite executed by a needle, other basic elements, such as a pico and a double knot, are more often used. </p><p>  <strong>We read the scheme right</strong> </p><p>  It‚Äôs difficult for beginner needlewomen to tatters because they cannot always read the diagram, despite the fact that they have mastered the technique perfectly. </p><p>  Basically <span>, tatting patterns are</span> made in the form of peculiar colors from arcs, points (otherwise called pico) and circles.  In order not to get confused in them, for the first experiments it is better to choose those that have serial numbers, as well as those that have abbreviations, for example: ds - double knot, ch - arc and others. </p><p>  This is what tatting is for beginners.  It is worth trying at least once to execute it in order to make sure that this technique is really simple, but it is uniquely beautiful. </p>
