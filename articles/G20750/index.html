In addition, real chebureks, lagmans, bashbarmaks, etc. can be tasted in any restaurant.  From the reviews of vacationers it becomes clear that the best option is a pre-paid <span>two meals a day.</span>  But lunch time can be spent in one of the beach cafes. </p><h2>  What is the attractiveness of Crimea? </h2><p>  Firstly, Crimea captivates its guests with its unique nature, natural and historical sights.  Secondly, it attracts with a healing climate, healing and wellness opportunities, such as mineral waters, mud, and, of course, an excellent level of service, which is improved every year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since some resorts of the peninsula are considered balneological centers, people with various health problems often come to Crimea, many of them are kids.  In a word, a <span>vacation with a child in the Crimea with</span> meals is an ideal option for those families who come here both for treatment and for the prevention of diseases. </p><p>  At the same time, it is not necessary to stay in a sanatorium at all.  Today, rest in the Crimea with a pool and meals can be obtained not only in star hotels and resorts, but also in guest houses, recreation centers, in the private sector, etc. All the people of the peninsula are working to provide guests with maximum comfort, regardless what is the thickness of their wallet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest houses in Crimea with meals" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/822656.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rest in Crimea </h2><p>  Many consider this miraculous peninsula as a place intended exclusively for a beach holiday.  However, some resorts are not on the coast, but this does not prevent them from being a great place for spending vacations, summer vacations, etc. It was in these areas that in Soviet times, recreation centers, <span>boarding houses, motels,</span> youth and children's camps were built.  Of course, the establishments planned in those days were not equipped with the best way.  In many of them, the rooms had practically no amenities, toilets, showers, etc., however, <span>rest in the Crimea in a boarding house</span> with meals was always at the highest level. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Modern leisure facilities </h2><p>  Today, everything is a little different: most tourist camps, hotels, and boarding houses have been reconstructed and adapted to generally accepted standards, and at the same time, guest houses operate in almost all Crimean resorts - private comfortable estates providing tourists with the highest level of relaxation.  And if a few years ago, only housing was provided to tourists in them, today vacation in the Crimea in the private sector with meals is also a common occurrence. </p><p>  Sometimes guests of several guesthouses eat in one private dining room, while, like in a hotel, they can choose different types of food: only breakfast, half board, full board.  Of course, most often tourists choose the second position and eat in the common dining room only in the mornings and in the afternoon, and in the evenings they go to try something tasty in numerous cafes and restaurants.  Nevertheless, this option will provide a typical economy vacation in Crimea.  There will be no problems with food. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center in the Crimea with meals" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/822655.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The advantage of tours to the Crimea </h2><p>  Today, a trip to the Crimea will cost tourists relatively inexpensively.  And this is the main advantage of the Crimean resorts.  Giant bus caravans full of tourists have been moving in this direction since the beginning of the beach season.  Most of them chose to rest in the Crimea on the seashore with meals.  The place for settlement can be <span>pensions, recreation centers,</span> guest houses, private mansions, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are also a lot of hotels and hotel complexes in Crimea, however there are not so many star hotels, especially 5 *.  Most of them are similar in structure to holiday homes in Crimea.  Everything is in order with food.  In addition, after the reconstruction, the organization of leisure here is carried out properly, and of course the tourists are ultimately satisfied. </p><p>  As you can see, rest in the Crimea with meals is a fairly common version of tours that travel agencies provide to tourists.  And they are quite in great demand among the Russians.  After all, Crimea, by its climatic conditions, by the beauty of nature, by a large number of natural and historical sights, amazing canyons, waterfalls and stormy rivers, is simply an ideal place for fans of educational, beach, extreme and culinary tours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="economy rest in Crimea with meals" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/822654.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  Rest in Crimea with meals </h2><p>  So, today the number of rooms in Crimea includes a huge number of private apartments, rooms in guest houses of a new type, bedrooms with living rooms in old mansions that once belonged to the Russian nobility, rooms in boarding houses, cottages in recreation centers, as well as rooms of various categories in hotels , hotels and hotel complexes.  By the way, recently on the coast you can also meet fenced green areas with small structures such as bungalows. </p><p>  Some of the mansions and guest houses offer a very high level of service, although they do not have stars on their signs, so comfort lovers can safely book rooms in these establishments, rather than buying tours to expensive star hotels.  Further in the article, we will provide you with a list of some of the tourist sites that provide tourists with an economy vacation in the Crimea with meals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in crimea hotels with meals" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/822652.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Guest House Fortuna </h2><p>  This guesthouse occupies a four-story building on the 4th beach line.  It is great for those who do not like noise: here you can not hear the din of disco and night clubs.  This guest house is very suitable for children.  As already noted, the guests of ‚ÄúFortune‚Äù are provided with meals in the cafe of home cooking.  This, of course, is very important for parents.  After all, their children during their stay at the hotel will receive high-quality quality food, which they are used to.  In a word, this is the same as buying tours to rest houses in the Crimea with meals. </p><p>  However, food is not included in the total cost of living, but the prices here are low and quite acceptable for most vacationers.  The guest house has wireless internet (free of charge) and satellite TV, as well as video surveillance. </p><p>  Many guests are interested in whether there is always <span>hot water here.</span>  Yes, with this issue everything has already been decided here for a long time, the Soviet system regarding the water supply according to the schedule has long been gone.  All rooms are furnished with modern furniture, magnificent bathrooms and fairly spacious balconies.  From the reviews of guests of this guesthouse, we can conclude that vacationers are almost satisfied with everything.  The only negative is the distance from the beach.  Those who come to rest in their own car, of course, go to the beach by car, but for backpackers to get to the beach is a little tiring. </p><h2>  B / O "Surf" </h2><p>  This recreation center in the Crimea with food is located on the Black Sea coast, 10 kilometers from the resorts of Saki and Yevpatoriya.  ‚ÄúSurf‚Äù is a small resort town, on the territory of which are located almost all the amenities that make your vacation truly unforgettable and eventful. </p><p>  The location of this recreation center is simply magnificent.  She has her own sandy beach with a length of 800 meters, on which you can meet almost all the sea attractions.  In addition, the recreation center ‚ÄúPriboy‚Äù has playgrounds, a children's town, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, shops and even the collective farm market.  For children upon arrival, there are significant discounts. </p><p>  Since ‚ÄúSurf‚Äù is a recreation center in the Crimea with meals, most tourists prefer to pre-pay for the provision of food for the entire stay at the hotel.  After all, in the cafe of the base everything is prepared at home, which means that it can be completely trusted.  This is evidenced by the reviews and comments of former guests.  In addition, there is no need to think every day about where and what to eat.  Experienced chefs will take care of this.  Of course, from time to time you can have dinner in some coastal restaurant, but regular food is one of the most important components of a good rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in crimea in the private sector with meals" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/822651.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  An economical vacation in Crimea.  Hotels with meals </h2><p>  ‚ÄúMagnolia‚Äù is a quite comfortable hotel with 198 rooms. It is located on the southern coast of Crimea in Alushta.  Around the complex stretches a giant green park with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã3 hectares.  Among the exotic plants of the park, a special place is taken by magnolias, which with their beauty and fragrance create a fabulous mood.  And immediately it becomes clear why the hotel is called that way.  Other plants in the park are cypresses, pines, cedars, etc. </p><p>  Private pebble beach is 1200 meters away.  Consequently, it will take him about 20 minutes to go.  But for the convenience of guests, the hotel administration has allocated a special bus that first delivers tourists to the shore, and then returns it back. </p><p>  Residential premises are located in a five-story building.  The hotel has an elevator.  The hotel has a fairly large outdoor pool, around which there are comfortable sun loungers and umbrellas.  There is also a bar, restaurant, parking, souvenir shops, lobby, etc.  For all guests, a buffet is served twice a day (morning and evening) in the restaurant hall <span>.</span>  The hotel has a gym, fitness center, sports and children's playgrounds, a cinema room and a library, as well as a modernly equipped conference room with 250 seats. </p><p>  The rooms of the categories ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù, ‚ÄúJunior Suite‚Äù and ‚ÄúSuite‚Äù have everything you need.  They are equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Bathrooms are equipped with a modern shower, hairdryer, and hygiene products.  Room service is quite common, so tourists do not even want to change their linen and ask to come later.  Reviews about this hotel are more than positive.  At first glance, remoteness from the beach seems to many a minus, but an organized transfer solves this problem.  Nevertheless, some tourists are not satisfied with this option, because it puts them in a strict framework, and this in some cases is inconvenient. </p><h2>  Hotel "Salute" </h2><p>  But this hotel is located in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãWestern Crimea, in the village of Golden Crimea.  The beach is a 10-minute walk away.  This hotel is designed for families with children.  Immediately upon entering the hotel you notice that everything is designed here so that the little guests are comfortable to relax and do not have to be bored.  There are playgrounds with slides, swings, a sandbox, a center for organizing children's leisure, etc. </p><p>  Right next to the hotel there are various souvenir shops, grocery stores, restaurants and cafes.  On the territory of this hotel there is a swimming pool, around which there is a solarium area, consisting of trestle beds, umbrellas, etc. There is a place for barbecue with gazebos, tables under a canopy, a minibar and a parking lot.  By the way, tourists who come to rest at the Salut Hotel not by their own cars, but by plane or by train, can pay for the transfer in advance and they will be met at the airport or at the railway station and taken to the hotel in comfort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in crimea with pool and meals" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/822650.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  Apartments Shangri-La </h2><p>  In the legendary Foros, where the summer residence of the Soviet leaders was once located, it is, of course, very prestigious to relax.
