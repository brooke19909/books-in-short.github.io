  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Decoupage for beginners - a DIY gift</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It has long been known that the best gift - made by yourself.  Of course, there are many techniques for making gifts with your own hands and one of these techniques is decoupage.  He is gaining more and more fans, because after some effort the old thing takes on a second life.  An exclusive gift or an item that will decorate your interior can be made even by the most inexperienced person in these matters, you just need to master decoupage for beginners. </p><p>  "Decoupage for beginners" may initially sound like something impossible and unrealistic at home, but in fact there is nothing complicated.  The frightening French word ‚Äúdecoupage‚Äù is translated much easier than it might seem at first glance, namely it means ‚Äúcutting‚Äù.  This type of needlework appeared long before the era of computers and modern technologies, but this does not prevent it from being popular now. </p><p>  The first and perhaps the simplest thing that can be done in the framework of this technique is plate decoration.  <span>Decoupage plates</span> for beginners should begin with the preparation of the necessary materials, as well as familiarization with the little secrets of creating a masterpiece with your own hands.  First you need the plate itself, its shape does not matter at all, it can be either round or square, flat or deep - the choice is yours.  It is desirable that the plate is solid, but it may well come with a pattern, it all depends on what your idea will be. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You will also need a drawing that will be moved to the plate.  As a picture, you can use any paper medium with an image.  The most ideal option is paper napkins (it is desirable that they be multilayer).  You will also need a few sharp scissors to make it convenient to cut the necessary elements out of paper. </p><p>  To attach the picture to the plate, <span>acrylic glue</span> and brushes are needed, and to fix the finished work, varnish is required.  <span>Acrylic paints</span> may also be needed to realize all your ideas. </p><p>  Starting the decoupage of the plate, you should decide which side you need to decorate.  It can be either the front side or the reverse.  Before starting work, the surface of the plate should be cleaned of dirt, grease and moisture.  This is necessary so that after a while the work does not lose its appearance, and is not hopelessly spoiled. </p><p>  After choosing the pattern that you will use, carefully cut all the elements.  In this regard, decoupage for beginners may seem a little complicated, because this lesson is very scrupulous.  After that, lay out the pattern on a plate as you would like to see it.  If there are any inaccuracies, then at this stage you can still change and correct, so that the plate acquires the desired appearance.  When all the elements are in place, you can proceed to the next step. </p><p>  First you need to cover the surface of the plate with a layer of acrylic glue and arrange everything in the right order.  The surface of the fragments should be smoothed very carefully so as not to damage them, and also so that there are no bubbles or folds.  The paper should be completely saturated with glue for better preservation. </p><p>  After the glue has dried well, cover the plate with several layers of varnish.  When it is completely dry, the decoupage of the plate will be completed, and it can be safely used as a home decor or as a gift to loved ones. </p><p>  So that the plate can be used for eating, you should decorate its reverse side.  For such products, plates with a transparent bottom will be most suitable.  The technique is the same.  You can also decoupage mugs. </p><p>  Decoupage is a universal art, with the help of which you can transform any thing, whether it is a wooden board or a glass plate.  Do a miracle with your own hands, because decoupage for beginner needleworkers is the most suitable activity. </p>
