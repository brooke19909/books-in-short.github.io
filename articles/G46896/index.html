Optimization of the telephone network at home knows no bounds, home enthusiasts are constantly looking for a way to make their homes more convenient and place additional telephone lines and telephones in several rooms. </p><p>  Installing a power outlet is very simple, after which you can use the phone in almost any room. </p><p>  The telephone socket and cables must be placed in such a way that they do not affect the public telephone network.  The telephone service provider has the right to check and test any connector and wiring connected to the communication lines in the house. </p><p>  Each line of the telephone network entering the house or office is equipped with a special ‚Äúmain outlet‚Äù, which is installed by the telephone service provider, the consumer is prohibited from interfering in its work and making connections in it. </p><p>  For the production of work, it is necessary to purchase materials: adapter, wall sockets and cable clamps. </p><p>  Installation sequence: </p><ol><li>  Choose a place to connect the telephone jack. </li><li>  Calculate the length of the wire. </li><li>  Select a new connector. </li><li>  Install a power outlet. </li><li>  Connect the new device to the telephone cord. </li><li>  Connect the telephone line and check operation. </li></ol><h2>  Place of installation and tools </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.drdiagram.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Socket Installation" class="if uuid-2316053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2316053.jpg"></div><p>  Before starting the installation, you need to mark out the chosen place for installing the outlet in the house.  First you need to consider where furniture or tables can stand, so that you can carefully lay the wires. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To connect the outlet, you need tools that must be in working condition. </p><p>  The necessary tools are: </p><ol><li>  Hammer. </li><li>  A small screwdriver. </li><li>  Side cutters. </li><li>  Pliers. </li><li>  <span>Hidden wiring detector.</span> </li><li>  Tool for installing telecommunication cables. </li></ol><p>  If the device is installed on the 1st floor, it is recommended to lay a telephone line on the second floor outside the house on the street.  This is easier than laying the cable up the stairs and through numerous doorways.  Do not place wires under carpets and run them under door frames.  Skirting board is the best place for safe and aesthetic placement of the telephone socket and wire.  When calculating the length of the wiring, you need to remember that phones are usually equipped with a 3-meter cord. </p><h2>  Types of Telephone Cables </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.keystone-cable.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Telephone cable" class="if uuid-2316042" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2316042.jpg"></div><p>  <span>A telephone cable</span> usually consists of 4-wire wires, although 6- and 8-wire wires are also not uncommon.  Connection types are 2-pair, 3-pair and 4-pair.  A typical 4-wire telephone cable has 4 colored wires that include red, green, black and yellow.  Although most phones use 4 or 6 pin connectors, standard phones use only two wires.  Single line phones are designed to use two central pins in the telephone jack.  On the 4-pin connector, the external 2 contacts are not used, and on the 6-pin connector, external contacts are not used.  This is important to know when connecting the telephone jack. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Types of Outlets </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Telephone jack on the table" class="if uuid-2316028" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2316028.jpg"></div><p>  When it comes to buying outlets, people first choose a brand and then look at the design.  This is because there are manufacturers on the market who have proven themselves in the manufacture of electrical products.  Therefore, it is best for new electricians to buy sockets of well-known brands. </p><p>  Popular brands of 2018: </p><ol><li>  LEGRAND.

A typical RJ-11 connector has six terminals.  Usually only the middle four pins are used.  Telephone wiring POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) usually contains two pairs of wires for two separate telephone lines.  The central contacts (red and green) contain the first telephone line.  Business (digital) telephone systems can be connected in the same way. </p><h2>  RJ-45 Connector (DATA) </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dignetllc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Telephone socket with wires" class="if uuid-2316016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2316016.jpg"></div><p>  Consider the wiring diagram for the RJ-45 plug in accordance with the T-568B standards.  The telephone double socket of the T-568B standard is the most commonly used.  The connection diagram is shown using the ‚Äúhook clamp‚Äù on the underside.  The connector has a wiring diagram or designated pin numbers / colors corresponding to the color code below.  When connecting the RJ-45 connector, secure the connection as close as possible to the socket or plug.  This ensures that the telephone jack rj 11 meets Ethernet wiring standards. </p><h2>  Pre-installation work </h2><p>  Order: </p><ol><li>  Remove the front cover. </li><li>  The inside of the connector is connected to 4 terminal screws.  Wires should be red, green, black and yellow.  Connect the telephone wires (red and green) to the terminals using the red and green wires.  Although red and green colors are commonly used for hot phone lines, older phones installed in homes may use different colors. </li><li>  To make sure the wires are connected correctly, use the tester to check the telephone line.  Another simple way to check the wires is to connect them to the terminals, connect the phone to the test and listen to the dial tone of the station. </li><li>  If you plan to use a single line telephone for your second line, you must install a modified telephone jack. </li><li>  Remove the front cover of the telephone wall jack and connect the yellow and black wires to the red and green terminals.  This will move your second telephone line to the center connector pins. </li><li>  If you are having problems, use a telephone line tester to make sure the new second line is active. </li></ol><p>  Incorrect wiring can cause malfunction or damage to the system. </p><h2>  Socket Installation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.drdiagram.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Socket Installation" class="if uuid-2316063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2316063.jpg"></div><p>  If the telephone socket will be installed after the construction of the house, it is best to choose a surface socket.  They must be fixed to a wall or baseboard with appropriate fasteners.  Wear protective goggles during drilling.  Before attaching the outlet to the wall, make sure that the selected section of the wall in which there are no hidden wiring or electrical cables, they are checked using a hidden wiring detector. </p><p>  Once the location for the outlet is selected, the corresponding hole for cable entry is carefully cut with a sharp knife.  Install the socket in place using two screws. </p><p>  Mounting holes in the socket box are cut to allow for horizontal and vertical installation before fully tightening the screws.  Secure the cable carefully so as not to puncture or damage it.  A damaged cable can lead to equipment malfunction or damage to the communication system and therefore must be replaced. </p><h2>  Wire connection </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pressauto.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wire connection" class="if uuid-2316716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2316716.jpg"></div><p>  Consider connecting a telephone jack 6p4c.  Structurally, it is designed in such a way that stripping or soldering of wires is not required.  They are connected by a tool for connecting telecommunication cables.  No need to insert wires into sockets with anything other than special tools.  When performing work, it is necessary to use safety glasses, since the ends of the wires can fly off and injure your eyes. </p><p>  Leaving a small amount of slack in the wire, lay the wire to be laid in the corresponding terminal slot.  A strong clamping tool makes the wire firmly connect to the plug, thereby making the connection.  If you need to connect two cables to the socket, then the second wire must be inserted into the same terminal. </p><p>  Each wire must be inserted separately and not simultaneously.  Make sure the wires are fully inserted into the plug, one on top of the other.  The connector is designed for only two cables.  If two wires must be connected on the same terminal, make sure that the colors of the wires from each cable match. </p><h2>  Basic installation guidelines </h2><p>  In order to avoid a safety breach and to correctly install the device, the following rules must be followed: </p><ol><li>  The new connector should not have more than 50 meters of cable from the main outlet. </li><li>  Regardless of how many jacks there are on the telephone line, the number of real handsets that can be connected to it is limited to 4. </li><li>  Do not place extension sockets or junction boxes on doors or where moisture or condensation may occur (such as a shower or bathroom). </li><li>  You can only place telephone wiring in sockets or junction boxes. </li><li>  The telephone socket and cable must be at least 5 cm from the electrical wiring and the power socket to avoid electrical interference. </li><li>  Always unplug the adapter from the main power outlet before changing or adding wiring to the telephone circuit. </li></ol><h2>  Testing </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gunook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wire testing" class="if uuid-2316075" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2316075.jpg"></div><p>  After completing installation work, you need to test the telephone line and the installed outlet for operability.  You can check the tone of the call in each slot, and then ask a friend to call back to the installed telephone to make sure that it is ringing.  If the phone does not ring and the telephone jack is connected correctly, you need to check the communication lines using a multimeter. </p><p>  Procedure: </p><ol><li>  Disconnect the telephone lines to be tested from the test sockets.  After disconnecting, the telephone lines will be fully open and ready for testing. </li><li>  Wait a minute until the telephone lines are completely disconnected. </li><li>  Set the digital multimeter to continuous mode. </li><li>  Connect the test leads of the digital multimeter together. </li><li>  If the multimeter is working correctly, a reading will appear on its digital screen and it will emit a sound signal. </li><li>  Connect one of the digital multimeters to one telephone wire and connect the second wire to another telephone wire. </li><li>  If the multimeter does not detect continuity, the telephone lines do not touch each other. </li><li>  If it detects continuity, telephone lines will not work correctly. </li><li>  Repeat the test for each pair of telephone lines.  Once each pair is tested, it will be possible to determine which telephone lines work and which do not. </li></ol>
