Many applicants come here from all over Russia and even neighboring countries, because it provides a real fundamental education.  The Institute educates the best citizens of its country.  The article will discuss the history of the institute, information for applicants and students.  And also student life in the institution will be clearly shown. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The Voronezh Fire Institute of the Ministry of Emergencies opened its doors in 1967.  But then this institution was called the training detachment of fire fighting activities.  The following year, 2 groups of students were recruited.  In one of them, fire inspectors and trainers were trained, and in the other, commanders. <br>  A few years later, not far from the unit, two new buildings were built, the groups were transferred to them.  Now the institution has received the name "School for the training of junior and middle managers."  After 10 years, the School was renamed the Training Center.  In 1993, a school was created on the basis of the center, and in 2008 the institution acquired the status of a university of the Ministry of Emergencies.  Voronezh Institute immediately gained popularity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Voronezh Fire Institute of the Ministry of Emergencies" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45725/1681293.jpg" width="500"></div>
