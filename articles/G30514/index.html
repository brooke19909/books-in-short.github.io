And Carcassonne, one of the places in the country, is no exception.  Here on this day, not only kids have fun and frolic.  Pets and birds also have a peculiar ‚Äúholiday‚Äù.  Cows, chickens, cats, piglets, sheep are released to be grazed, and animals quickly scatter in different directions.  Thus, the guys have fun - running around the city and its environs, find and drive all living creatures to their homes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  For what age is it suitable? </h2><p>  The creators of the game indicate that "Children <strong> </strong>  Carcassonne "is a board game designed for children aged 4 years and older.

In the game "Children of Carcassonne" <strong> </strong>  2 to 4 players take part.  Each is given figures of men of the same color.  When there are less than four participants, the figures of ‚Äúextra‚Äù colors do not participate in the game, they are put aside. </p><p>  Each card depicts a plot of land of Carcassonne with paths that pass through the card or rest against the object (building, river, well).  Children in clothes of different colors, running along the paths, are also drawn.  Absolutely all cards are joined to each other.  Before the start of the game, the cards turned upside down are mixed up.  From a common pile, players take them one at a time and place the images up on the table or on the floor. </p>

    <p>  The goal of the game is to put their figures on the playing field faster than other players.  The one who managed to do this is declared the winner.  If the cards are over, and no one could arrange all their figures, the winner is the one who exposed the largest number of them. </p><p>  So, in the "Children of Carcassonne" strategy, the rules of the game are as follows: </p><ol><li>  The first player selects a card from the pile and puts it in the center. </li><li>  Other players in a certain order (for example, clockwise) do the same.  Thus, a map of the area with paths, fields, ponds, buildings is gradually being built. </li><li>  The card must be laid out in such a way that at least one of the sides is in contact with the card (s) that were laid out earlier. </li><li>  If the track, the sections of which are shown on the cards, closes (like a circle, loop or rests against both ends of an object), then the players, the little people whose colors are shown on this track, put their figures on top. </li><li>  To get closer to victory, you need to try to build closed paths with men of their color, and at the same time, prevent opponents from doing the same. </li></ol><p>  On average, each batch lasts from 15 minutes to half an hour.  The game does not have time to get bored.  On the contrary, as soon as the party is over, the children will surely want to repeat the game again and again. </p>
