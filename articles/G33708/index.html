    <h2>  Station History </h2><p>  The railway in the city was opened at the very beginning of 1870, stretching from Yaroslavl to Sergiev Posad.  From this moment begins the construction of tracks in other directions.  They were supposed to connect Yaroslavl with Kostroma, Vologda and Rybinsk. </p><p>  In 1898, a one-story wooden station of Vspolye was built - the future station of Yaroslavl-Glavny.  If you look into the explanatory dictionary of V. Dahl, we will find out that the outbreak is the beginning of the field, a place around the outskirts. </p><p>  In 1913, they paved the way from Moscow to Vyatka through the Vspolye station.  Since that time, it becomes the main one in the city and in 1916 receives a new, more spacious building.  In the 1920s, an area was set up in front of the railway station. </p><p>  Gradually Vpolye becomes the central station of the city.  The building in which the station is now located was commissioned in 1952.  The architects were N. Panchenko and M. Shpotov.  The style of the building is the neoclassicism, popular at that time, or the Stalinist empire.  In 1977, the station ensemble was replenished with an underground passage and a ticket office building. </p><p>  The Yaroslavl-Glavny railway station got its modern name in 1958.  Full decoration of the nearby square and adjacent buildings was completed by 1985.  In 2008, reconstruction was carried out. </p>
