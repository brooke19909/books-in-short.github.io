    <p>  There is plenty of information on this topic.  Various knitting magazines feature many articles and mini-courses that describe crochet in the smallest detail, with patterns and tips for beginners.  To master this craft is not difficult at all. </p><h2>  Where to start and how to end? </h2><p>  Crochet always starts with a chain of air loops.  A loop is formed on the free end of the thread.  Then a hook is threaded into it, a thread is thrown over it, it is grabbed and pulled back.  We got a small chain of two air loops.  All subsequent ones are formed in the same way.  The base of knitting is ready.  Next, continue knitting according to the pattern. </p><p>  Virtually no explanation is required for the answer to the question of how to finish.  Crocheting compares favorably with knitting needles in that at any moment of the process, only one loop remains free.  This allows you to not stray and not lose the loop, even for beginners.  To close the loop, you need to cut the thread coming from the ball, fully pull through the last loop and tighten.  The remaining "tail" should be carefully hidden.  That's all the details on how to finish. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54"></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Crochet - Bars </h2><p>  The basis of the fabric for crocheting is a column.  It can be knitted in three basic versions: single crochet, double crochet and half-stitch. </p><ul><li><p>  Single crochet.  We leave two lifting air loops, insert the hook into the third (from front to back), grab a free thread with it and pull it through the loops.  Two loops formed on the hook.  In one motion we stretch a free thread through them.  The column is ready. </p></li><li><p>  Half Column.  As in the previous version, we leave two lifting loops.  But now we grab the free thread and pull it through all the available loops at once. </p></li><li><p>  Double crochet.  This species is used to increase the height of the row.  We leave three lifting loops (since the column is higher), we put the thread on the hook, insert it into the fourth loop, grab the free thread and stretch it through the two extreme loops on the hook.  Repeat the operation several times. </p></li></ul><h2>  Column one, different ways </h2><p>  Using only these three basic elements, but knitting them in different ways, you can get many different patterns </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet with patterns" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19526/432449.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <ul><li><p>  The columns are knitted for the back half-loop of the previous row, while the canvas turns out to be voluminous, with convex and concave rows. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk"></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div></li><li><p>  If you knit the columns for the front loop, the fabric remains smooth, with flat horizontal stripes. </p></li><li><p>  You can also untie the columns for the wrong loops: we introduce the hook for the horizontal jumper located slightly below the top of the previous row.  With this method, a pigtail is formed on the inside. </p></li></ul><p>  In addition to these methods, it is possible to untie the columns of splinter, from the lower rows, on air loops.  Deciding on the most suitable option is quite difficult, especially for those who have just started to master crochet.  Schemes and description will always tell in detail all the nuances of manufacturing a particular product. </p><h2>  What can be crocheted? <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet patterns and description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19526/432450.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><p>  The answer is simple: everything can be connected.  First of all, women, men and children‚Äôs clothes are knitted with a hook, as well as various decorative details and accessories.  For example, recently undeservedly forgotten ‚Äúgrandmothers‚Äù lace collars returned to fashion.  And you can also make cuffs, patch flat and voluminous flowers. </p><p>  Interior items decorated with hand crochet are no longer a rarity.  It can be plaids, pillows, delicate tablecloths and napkins, even curtains and carpets.  And with the help of a hook with skillful hands, you can create cute amigurumi toys. </p><p>  The process of creating products with a hook is extremely exciting.  Stopping is very difficult.  Therefore, there is the expression "knit hard", that is, do it everywhere: in transport, in pauses during cooking in the kitchen, at work during the lunch break, etc. For many craftswomen, the question of how to finish crocheting is completely does not apply to the end of the row - they ask how they should stop and rest a bit. </p>
