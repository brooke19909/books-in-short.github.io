A red-hot stone sack and active car traffic in the streets make dreams of coolness even more attractive.  But where to buy, say, in Krasnoyarsk?  Yenisei, on which the city stands, is a wayward river.  Its shores are not quite comfortable for sunbathing near the water.  A strong current can take an inexperienced swimmer into whirlpools, and changes in water temperatures can lead to convulsions and hypothermia.  Of course, you can choose some kind of pool in the city.  There is a safe and well-established recreation infrastructure.  But nature does not smell there.  You will have to share the tank in hundreds of other people.  Therefore, we bring to your attention Velvet Lake in Krasnoyarsk.  This is a natural body of water.  And the nature around him is just wonderful!  What do the reviews say about Velvet Lake?  Find out if you read the article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Velvet Lake Krasnoyarsk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1939500.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nature </h2><p>  The surroundings of Krasnoyarsk are rich in places for swimming.  You can recall Lake Semiradskoe not far from the airport, and a small quiet river Manu, which is near Divnogorsk.  So the residents of the city have a place to cool off during the short but hot Siberian summer.  They will best tell about the delights of Lake Barkhatovo (Krasnoyarsk) photo.  Saying that this is a natural body of water is not entirely correct.  Once, sand was mined here until they reached groundwater.  As a result, a lake formed at the site of the quarry.  But the photos show that you will not find dull traces of anthropological activity there.  On the contrary, the banks of the reservoir <span>overgrown with reeds.</span>  Barkhatovo is essentially two lakes.  They are connected by a narrow duct.  The territory of the lake shore was leased by LLC Velvet to equip a recreation area.  It is checked every year by the Roskontrol of the <span>Krasnoyarsk Territory.</span>  In 2017, his verdict was positive.  Water quality meets sanitary standards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Velvet lake Krasnoyarsk how to get there" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1939521.jpg" width="600"></div>

The lake is located not in the village itself, but a mile and a half south of it.  Residents call these places "Terentyevsky quarries."  The town of Sosnovoborsk, Berezovsky district, is located seven kilometers from Lake Velvet.  Krasnoyarsk is only 23 km from the reservoir (if in a straight line).  Yes, and along the highway runs from thirty-five kilometers.  This circumstance makes Velvet beach a favorite vacation spot for citizens, because you have to go for about half an hour.  How to get out of Krasnoyarsk to be closer to the lake?  First you need to drive along Semaphorna Street and turn off at the tire factory towards the eastern bus station.  Having followed Glinka Street, you should taxi to the village of New Bazarikha.  Near the local school there is a highway from Krasnoyarsk to Zheleznogorsk.  On it you need to get to the village of Berezovka.  Drive through it and continue straight ahead.  Before you reach Esaulovka, you will see a lake on the right side.  But if you are interested in equipped beach, you need to get to the village.  When you see a road sign indicating the direction to Kidyakovka, follow it.  Soon you will see a barrier. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Velvet lake Krasnoyarsk beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1939517.jpg"></div>

Those who came on foot must pay 100 rubles to the cash register.  For children under twelve years of age, free passage  The beach is open only in the summer months from eight in the morning until eleven in the evening.  Photos and reviews of tourists prove that the recreation infrastructure here is fully consistent with international standards.  There are changing cabins, toilets, a first-aid post.  During the beach, lifeguards are on duty.  There are ground attractions (trampoline) and water activities (catamarans, "bananas", flying "buns", jet skis).  There are two beach volleyball courts on the sandy shore.  The ball can be rented at the sports equipment rental. </p><h2>  Where to eat </h2><p>  One of the frequently asked questions regarding Lake Velvet in Krasnoyarsk is this: “Do I need to take food with me?”  The pond itself is quite extensive, and if you are counting on a “wild” vacation in tents somewhere on the shore, then you should have everything you need, including food.  But if you want to sunbathe and swim on the equipped beach, then this is a completely different matter.  There is a cafe on its territory.  Next to it, you can rent a barbecue to cook on your own grilled dishes.  Also on the beach there are several gazebos for feasts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Velvet Lake Krasnoyarsk photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1939491.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Where to spend the night </h2><p>  Velvet Lake (Krasnoyarsk) also has a VIP zone.  There is a small house on it, which has a separate exit to the beach.  It has bedrooms and a kitchen with everything you need.  Since such apartments are not cheap, many Krasnoyarsk residents prefer to spend their weekends on the lake in tents.  For such accommodation, special places are also equipped.  You can also put up a tent absolutely free of charge - the banks of the former quarry are quite long.  A fish started in the lake, but experts say that you can’t count on a serious catch. </p>
