In order not to think about the sketch and style of execution for a long time, it is worth paying attention to the new trend, which concerns toys made in the tilde style.  Such a product will be interesting and unusual to look in the interior of any room, will be a wonderful gift for adults and children. </p><h2>  Key Features of Tilda Style Dolls </h2><p>  Tilda toys appeared at the end of the last century, but they were widely used.  Popularity has come to this direction of making dolls thanks to simple patterns and an original look of products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="An interesting view of the hare" class="if uuid-2577007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2577007.jpg"></div><p>  Throughout the world, the tilde style is popular in almost all areas: interior, table setting and so on.  Such a manufacturing style involves some nuances in the pattern itself or knitting.  Particularly popular are dolls and hares. </p><p>  If you knit a hare with knitting needles in the tilde style, then you should pay attention to such characteristics: </p><ol><li>  Tilda-style hares are dolls that are identical to the image of a person. </li><li>  The head and body of a hare are not connected, but fit into a single piece. </li><li>  In a hare, it is desirable to knit the head, body and lower legs with one piece. </li><li>  The upper legs should be movable, so they are attached using a button or a hidden seam. </li><li>  Details of the face are made in the style of embroidery.  Elements should be small. </li><li>  For a hare, it is definitely worth sewing or knitting clothes in a certain style. </li></ol><h2>  What tools and materials will be needed to work? </h2><p>  To make a toy, you need a 100-gram ball of yarn.  It is better to choose threads that are 50% to 50% made of wool and synthetic fibers.  According to tradition, the body of the tilde doll is made of beige fabric.  For a hare, you can choose any pastel-colored yarn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For manufacturing, you can use a hook and knitting needles.  Each craftswoman uses the tool with which she knows how to work.  But the best option would be knitting needles.  The tilde hare, knitted with needles, looks more neat and attractive. </p><p>  Knitted clothes will look harmoniously on a hare.  Therefore, it is worth preparing several skeins of multi-colored yarn.  These may be residues after knitting other products.  In addition, it is worth buying a little satin linen, buttons, a snake, silk thread for sewing. </p><h2>  Where to start work on the knitting needles? </h2><p>  How to knit a hare with knitting needles in the tilde style, know more experienced needlewomen who masterfully own the tool.  In the process of making bunnies with knitting needles, it is better to divide the creation of the product into separate elements.  It is worth considering the following scheme for creating a hare: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Possible sketch" class="if uuid-2576988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2576988.jpg"></div><ol><li>  The first detail is represented by the head and neck.  We begin to knit from the neck, moving to the ears.  Type 5 stitches on the knitting needles.  To make the canvas uniform and smooth, it is worth using a garter stitch or facial smoothness.  Having tied 5-9 rows of 5 loops to form a neck, in each subsequent row add 2 loops.  There should be 10 such additions. Then the loops decrease in the same sequence.  Ears can be tied separately.  Collect 6-8 loops and knit in a pattern for the head. </li><li>  The 2nd detail is the trunk, which will later join the head.  Type 5 stitches on the needles.  Knit 2 rows without additions, and then in each 2nd row add 2 loops.  The number of additions and series depends on which species the hare should acquire. </li><li>  The third part will be the lower and upper legs.  It is worth typing on knitting needles 10-12 loops and knit with the selected pattern.  The length of the limbs is determined by the needlewoman.  You can complicate the scheme to give relief to the limbs, make a few additions at the beginning of the work, and then return to the original number of loops through a gradual decrease. </li></ol><h2>  Secrets about assembling toy parts </h2><p>  To knit a hare without knitting parts is almost impossible.  In order not to spoil the idea and design, it is worthwhile to carry out the assembly process correctly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The finished product according to the scheme" class="if uuid-2577005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2577005.jpg"></div><p>  Parts Assembly Algorithm: </p><ol><li>  Before assembling, you need to stuff all the parts with cotton or synthetic winterizer so that plastic remains in the elements. </li><li>  Sew ears to the head using the inner seam, if the item was manufactured separately. </li><li>  Sew the lower foot and upper paws with the inner seam as well.  If desired, the suture may leave maximum limb mobility. </li></ol><p>  Next, the manufacture of embroidery features of the muzzle of the hare.  Embroider the nose with knitting threads.  Eyes can be embroidered or sewn on two black beads.  You can make a tightening for the muzzle, which will give anatomical shape. </p><h2>  Features of making a hare through the use of knitting needles </h2><p>  To understand exactly how to knit a tilde hare with knitting needles, you need to study the product diagram.  It is harder to make the most fused parts with knitting needles, so it is worthwhile to weave all the elements separately.  In the simplest version of knitting, the details will be square, so you will have to adjust the shape by stitching and screed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clothes for a knitted hare" class="if uuid-2576985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2576985.jpg"></div><p>  The pattern of the hare, knitted with needles, may be different.  You can tie the shape of the body and head, which will then be sewn together on the sides.  There may be several options for manufacturing.  First, you should prepare a sketch, and then choose a scheme. </p><h2>  Additional finish toys </h2><p>  Knitting a hare with knitting needles is half the battle.  Of great importance in the manufacture of tilda hare is the right clothing style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to knit a hare with knitting needles" class="if uuid-2576996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2576996.jpg"></div><p>  For such a hare, clothes can be tied, but they can also be sewn.  Such a variety of textures and textures will give a certain style to the doll. </p><p>  The cut of toy clothes should be free.  It is worth choosing natural fabrics with a small and bright print.  Additionally, you should use satin ribbons, beads, jeans. </p>
