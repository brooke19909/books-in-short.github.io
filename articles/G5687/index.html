  <section class="page js-page"><h1>For 15 kopecks in 1980, you can earn good money</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The 15 kopeck coin of 1980 was made according to the 1961 model. Like the lion's share of all coins, it was made of an inexpensive copper-nickel alloy.  The alloy is quite practical: resistant to abrasion, very durable and hard, does not have a ferromagnetic property, the color is gray with a sheen.  The coin has a small size: diameter is 19.6 mm, thickness varies from 1.2 to 1.3 mm, weight - about 2.5 grams. </p><h2>  Brief description of the appearance of the coin </h2><p>  The appearance of the coin is quite simple.  On the obverse, occupying almost the entire space, they placed a simplified version of the coat of arms of the USSR, there is no text on the tape.  Also, we will not find here belonging to the mint.  Under the emblem is the inscription "USSR".  The reverse, in turn, is also not remarkable.  A huge number 15 indicates the face value of the coin.  Ears of wheat, which are decorated with oak leaves below, are depicted on different sides of the number.  Under the number we see the word "KOPEEK", then "1980", which indicates the year of minting of this coin.  The coin has a convex edging on both sides and a ribbed edge. </p><h2>  There are two types of coins. </h2><p>  The 15-kopeck coin of 1980 was made using two different stamps.  Mostly in 1980, the coin was minted with a stamp that was used from 1961 to 1981.  But at the end of 1980, a new one was used, with which they began to make pennies from 1981 onwards.  Thus, during this period, a small number of coins were issued, in connection with which they became rare and acquired some value. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The difference between rare and more common coins </h2><p>  Numismatist experts distinguish three main external differences between mass-issued coins and rare coins.  If you look at the obverse, that is, the emblem, and turn your eyes to the second ears, located to the right and left of the globe, you can see that on the inside of the ears, the common coins have no awns, while rare ones, on the contrary, have them .  Due to this main difference, rare coins are also called "hairy". </p><div class="photo" data-original="static.anumis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="15 kopecks 1980" class="if uuid-2606797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96965/2606797.jpg"></div><p>  The second difference is the star.  On a simple coin, it has narrow beams, and on a rare one, with wide ones.  And the last, third difference: taking a closer look, we see that in the first case the inscription "USSR" is planted slightly lower than in the second.  A photo of the obverse of a common coin can be seen above.  This is the photo of the obverse of the rare "hairy" coin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moneta-russia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="15 kopecks 1980" class="if uuid-2606805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96965/2606805.jpg"></div><h2>  How much does a coin cost? </h2><p>  Lucky holders of a rare coin with a face value of 15 kopecks in 1980 today can make good money.  The cost of a ‚Äúhairy‚Äù coin at various numismatic auctions reaches 45,000 rubles.  An ordinary coin is much cheaper: 5-10 rubles. </p>
