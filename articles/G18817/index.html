    <p>  As for the work of cooks, many tourists praise it.  The cook at the hotel is quite tasty.  Although the menu is not very diverse, nevertheless, the list of standard dishes for the buffet includes meat and fish cuisine, a lot of vegetables, herbs and salads.  Very tasty in this hotel, according to Russian-speaking vacationers, baked cakes.  In particular, many recommend trying cookies.  The assortment of drinks at the bar is also quite good: it is quite rich.  Some left a single gripe about the fact that whiskey, even local, vacationers have to buy. </p><p>  Bitez resort, as mentioned above, is hidden in a cozy bay.  For this reason, the sea is always calm, without waves.  Moreover, it is always very clean on the beach of Costa Bitezhan Hotel, without silt in the water or any other garbage. </p><p>  The disadvantage of the hotel, some consider the lack of interesting entertainment in the hotel.  But there are those who were satisfied with this circumstance.  For example, it is quite pleasant to sit quietly by the pool in the morning or in the evening or swim in it, away from noisy parties.  Some moderation, according to family Russians, is a plus, not a minus, of this hotel. </p><p>  The pool is quite good: it has a little bleach, and the water has a comfortable temperature.  And the sun terrace offers a very beautiful view. </p><p>  Another advantage of the rooms of this hotel, our tourists called the presence of a mosquito net and therefore the complete absence of mosquitoes in the rooms.  Therefore, they advise beginners not to take strong repellents with them on a trip.  The hotel staff, working in good faith and unobtrusive, was also awarded a high score. </p>
