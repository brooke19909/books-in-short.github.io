    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Located Eleana Hotel Apartments in Cyprus in Ayia Napa.  It is located almost in the very center of the city - only eight hundred meters from the main attractions and entertainment centers. </p><p>  The hotel is located on the second coastline, only five hundred meters will separate the hotel guests from the beautiful beach of Limanaki.  The coastal zone, like many others in Cyprus, is a municipal one.  Therefore, sun loungers and umbrellas must be paid to all vacationers, regardless of their place of residence.  Usually their cost does not exceed two and a half euros per day of stay on the beach. </p><p>  Near Eleana Hotel Apartments there are many shops and cafes selling souvenirs and preparing delicious Mediterranean dishes.  The hotel is forty-five kilometers from the international airport, but Nicosia, the capital of the island, will have to travel much longer.  The city is located eighty kilometers from the hotel complex, however, many tourists use public transport to get to the capital. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In tourist catalogs the hotel is often called "urban" because of its proximity to the center of the resort.  This allows its guests to save on rental transport, because any place can be reached on foot in twenty-twenty-five minutes. </p>

    <h2>  The infrastructure of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Choosing for yourself Eleana Hotel Apartments, keep in mind that the hotel does not have too much entertainment and infrastructure.  However, this is typical of Cypriot hotel complexes, they rarely provide their guests with a wide range of services, but this nuance is characteristic of Cyprus. </p><p>  The hotel has a reception desk, twenty-four hours a day.  Its employees are usually quite fluent in Russian, so guests can easily solve problems with staff.  Luggage storage and safety deposit boxes are available at the front desk.  These services are available at an additional cost. </p><p>  Tourists in Cyprus often rent vehicles to move around the island freely.  Therefore, they need parking, so as not to worry about the safety of their cars.  In Eleana Hotel Apartments 3 * (Cyprus), such a parking space is equipped, and vehicles here can be left completely free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Hotel guests enjoy relaxing by the pool.  It is open and large in size.  There are always many guests who are too lazy to go to the beach.  At the pool, they can enjoy cocktails, which the local bartender makes from the very early morning.  Guests eat in a small restaurant where the cook prepares delicious Mediterranean dishes. </p><p>  Eleana Hotel Apartments reviews provide information on the on-site shop.  Here, prices are often lower than average in the city, so guests here prefer to buy souvenirs and Cypriot products, which are often taken away from the island as a present to relatives and friends. </p>

    <h2>  Service and Facilities </h2><p>  It is nice that the hotel complex staff speaks several languages.  This can be considered a rarity in Greece, where employees usually communicate only in their own language and a little in English. </p><p>  The hotel has room service, so guests can order dishes from the restaurant without leaving their apartments.  This service is very popular with newlyweds who prefer to spend most of their time alone with each other. </p><p>  If necessary, tourists will be given the opportunity to send a fax or copy documents.  There is no full-fledged conference room in the hotel, but the necessary equipment is at the reception. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  You should not expect that in the hotel complex you will be constantly entertained.  This is not accepted in Cyprus hotels.  Of the main attractions, guests can relax at the pool, which has a wide sun terrace. </p><p>  Guests can also ride bicycles.  This pastime is quite popular among active youth, because in this way they get the opportunity to see the sights of the island. </p><p>  In the evenings, many hotel guests gather around a pool table.  International teams often organize competitions here. </p>

    <h2>  Numbers: classification and description </h2><p>  We already mentioned at the beginning of the article that guests are accommodated in two-story cottages.  At Eleana Hotel Apartments 3 * (Cyprus, Ayia Napa), tourists can choose one-room or two-room apartments.  They are inhabited by two to four people.  Almost every room is equipped with a small kitchen, where it is nice to cook breakfast and lunch.  Many tourists buy food in stores and prefer to eat in their own rooms. </p><p>  All units are air conditioned and have a TV with several channels.  Almost all of the windows overlook the swimming pool, respectively, spacious balconies also look here.  They have light furniture (chairs and tables). </p><p>  The kitchen is equipped with a fridge, toaster, microwave, kettle and stove.  Many tourists are pleased that the hotel does not have problems with hot water.  Keep in mind that this problem is very common in Cyprus. </p><p>  Rooms are cleaned daily, maids change bed linen twice a week.  I would like to clarify that the quality of cleaning is not satisfactory even for the most picky hotel guests. </p>

    <h2>  Negative moments </h2><p>  In the comments of tourists, we did not find an abundance of negativity, but some nuances are still worth noting.  Many note the presence of ants in the rooms.  They move freely around the rooms, and they are quite difficult to remove. </p><p>  Also, guests do not like the high prices in the local cafe.  If you eat only here, then the rest will be extremely expensive.  This is especially true for families with children. </p><p>  Among the obvious disadvantages are the following: </p><ul><li>  lack of a hairdryer in the bathroom; </li><li>  the presence of air conditioning in only one of the two rooms; </li><li>  inability to swim in the pool after nine in the evening. </li></ul><p>  I would like to say that, according to guests, the hotel is fully consistent with the declared stars and is ideal for a pleasant and economical vacation with the whole family. </p>
