Shelves are bursting with an abundance of goods in this direction.  Accordingly, some of these funds migrate from stores to our cosmetic bags and find their shelter on the shelves of dressing tables.  But girls and women of all ages, who monitor their appearance, love to visit the treasured shops again and again and buy more and more new products in order to make their appearance even more perfect. </p><h2>  When is an organizer needed? </h2><p>  Over time, it turns out that the cosmetic bag is no longer able to contain all the "wealth".  Not only that, new products from frequent friction with their neighbors in a cosmetic bag can scratch each other, damage packages, open up.  The opened lipstick can spoil most of the products and stain your makeup bag. </p><p>  This is where such a convenient and functional thing as an organizer for cosmetics comes in handy.  This device is able to accommodate both caring cosmetics and decorative ones.  The compartments can be placed: brushes, combs, nail polishes.  Yes, and a lot of the most necessary. </p><h2>  Organizer Benefits </h2><p>  Here are some of the advantages of these products: </p><ul><li>  able to accommodate the most used and necessary of the entire arsenal of cosmetics; </li><li>  there is no need to look for something at the bottom of the cosmetic bag, clinging to accidentally opened shadows and lipsticks; </li><li>  if necessary, it is possible to rearrange the organizer itself or its components; </li><li>  Personal care is always a must, so keep your makeup clean and tidy. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="beddingcomfortersets.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful brushes" class="if uuid-2318823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2318823.jpg"></div><h2>  What are the organizers for cosmetics? </h2><p>  The most popular organizers that are used for all types of cosmetics are presented below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Wooden is perhaps one of the most presentable and durable.  Wood is an environmentally friendly material, pleasant to handle, in the case of scratches and damage, it is easily able to "survive" the design update.  Using a wooden makeup organizer, you can safely place it on the sunny side of your room.  The rays of the sun are not able to penetrate inside the wooden boxes, which will save your lipsticks and creams from their destructive effects. </li><li>  Organizer fabric - great for lovers of travel.  The material is impregnated with a special composition to avoid contamination.  Such devices are usually equipped with a special loop for more convenient placement on a suitable wall.  Mobile - easy to fold and unfold. </li><li>  Acrylic organizer for cosmetics - strong enough, able to accurately accommodate many cosmetic products.  The most popular acrylic organizer model is transparent.  Gives sophistication to the entire dressing table.  Most often, special rugs for drawers are sold with such a box.  Mats save the bottom of the organizer from damage and cosmetics from randomly moving around the box. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.theshindigclayton.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="acrylic organizer" class="if uuid-2318830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2318830.jpg"></div><p>  Purchased organizers are great, but, unfortunately, the reality is that not every woman can afford to buy such an organizer for cosmetics.  And cosmetics (if there are many, then especially) require organization.  The procedure for self-care is significantly delayed, because you need to look for each tool in another drawer of the table or cabinet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Do-it-yourself makeup boxes </h2><p>  There is an exit!  You need to make an organizer for cosmetics with your own hands.  For these purposes, you can apply: a shelf for spices, a wicker or plastic basket.  With sewing skills, it‚Äôs easy to stitch a hanging organizer. </p><p>  But now we will consider the simplest way to make an organizer for cosmetics - out of the box. </p><p>  Yes, a regular shoe box is a very versatile container.  It is often used not for its intended purpose, and our case is also no exception. </p><div class="photo" data-original="new.onvacations.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="convenient organizer" class="if uuid-2318816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2318816.jpg"></div><h2>  Components for Future Boxing </h2><p>  We need for the organizer out of the box: </p><ul><li>  the largest, preferably a new shoe box made of thick and rigid cardboard; </li><li>  boxes of small sizes that can fit in the main one - shoe boxes (these little boxes in a previous life could be: boxes from cereals, from tea, from new phones); </li><li>  gift paper (the one wrapped with gifts), you can take wallpaper instead of paper; </li><li>  scissors, gun for hot glue; </li><li>  a simple pencil and a ruler; </li><li>  decorative elements with which we will decorate (if desired) the organizer (decorative elements include ribbons, rhinestones, charms, lace). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="make an organizer" class="if uuid-2318813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2318813.jpg"></div><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  How to make a DIY makeup organizer? </p><ol><li>  We remove the lid (narrow part) from the box and leave the wide part to ourselves.  We unfold the paper, put a box on it, take measurements for the further wrapping of our box.  We mark all the lines of cuts and bends.  In this part of the action, it is very important not to rush.  Otherwise, it is easy to make a mistake with the sizes and spoil the whole thing at the very beginning. </li><li>  Now cut off the desired piece of paper.  Using a glue gun, paste over our cardboard box.  Further, according to the same principle, we perform all actions with small boxes - measure, check, cut, fix. </li><li>  We arrange the wrapped small boxes in a large one.  We try to use the internal space of the future organizer completely.  We place the boxes on the basis of the "Tetris".  We put higher capacities to the rear wall of the organizer, and the middle and smallest boxes should be in front.  Now, after we have arranged the small boxes, we look and evaluate the situation once again.  If you don‚Äôt like something, you can rearrange it.  In order to keep the internal capacity of the organizer more reliable, they can also be glued to the bottom of a large box.  You can leave the boxes not glued. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="hative.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="organizer out of the box" class="if uuid-2318812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2318812.jpg"></div><p>  We decorate the product with decorative elements. Now you have an organizer for cosmetics. </p>
