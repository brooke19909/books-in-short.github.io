  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Insurance: customer reviews, conditions, features</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is impossible to protect yourself and your family members from misfortune, but citizens can reduce financial losses in the event of complete or partial disability.  Insurance, or the protection of financial interests, has long been one of the most popular products in the service market.  Banks and insurance companies offer to protect everything that is of value, from life and health to interior items.  Insurance reviews differ: not all customers believe in the insurance policy.  Is it worth it to purchase a policy and what is it? </p><h2>  Insurance Features </h2><p>  Reflecting on whether insurance is needed or not, first of all, customers think about the financial part of the transaction.  The main reason that citizens insure themselves, family, property and interests is a large reimbursement from the insurance company in the event of an insured event. </p><p>  But not everyone is aware that the purchase of a policy is not a 100% guarantee of payment of compensation.  Insurance reviews partially confirm citizens' concerns about an unnecessary purchase. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thehortongroup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance reviews" class="if uuid-3166694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3166694.jpg"></div><p>  In order not to spend money on protecting what is not at risk, you should choose priority areas.  In this case, the effect of having an insurance policy will be maximum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Insurance options in modern conditions allow you to purchase a policy online, choose only the necessary protection options and buy insurance for those who are expensive (as a gift). </p><h2>  What guarantees the availability of a policy? </h2><p>  Insurance is a chance to receive compensation as a result of an insured event.  But the chances of payments differ depending on the type of protection, the amount of the policy, the insurer and individual conditions. </p><p>  The presence of the policy ensures that the insured person can apply for reimbursement to the company.  According to the results of the investigation, the beneficiary may be paid compensation within the insurance coverage. </p><h2>  The popularity of insurance policies </h2><p>  According to insurance reviews, the largest number of requests comes from vehicle owners.  MTPL policies in Russia are compulsory for anyone who owns a car.  The number of accidents confirms the need to protect the interests of motorists on the road. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zawadagroup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="casco insurance reviews" class="if uuid-3166673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3166673.jpg"></div><p>  The second most popular is the policy of protecting life and health.  Customers can purchase insurance in the process of obtaining a consumer loan.  In this case, he protects the interests of the borrower and his relatives in the event of the death of the client or loss of his legal capacity.  The purchase of a policy outside the loan agreement provides for reimbursement, including in the event of injury (for example, a fracture). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Third place among popular insurance is Casco policies.  The protection feature is the payment of a large financial reimbursement to the car owner.  Casco cost is 70-400% higher than CTP. </p><p>  In the summer and New Year holidays, Russians actively acquire insurance cover for travelers.  It allows you to protect the interests of those who rest in Russia or abroad. </p><h2>  CTP reviews, insurance conditions </h2><p>  Millions of Russians who drive every day, once a year, are forced to contact the insurer for an extension of the CTP insurance policy.  According to reviews, OSAGO insurance from 2017 can be issued via the Internet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.scottinsurance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="osago insurance reviews" class="if uuid-3166672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3166672.jpg"></div><p>  To buy compulsory insurance, the owner of the vehicle must provide a passport, driver‚Äôs license, certificate of registration of a car and a diagnostic card.  When renewing CTP in the same insurance, it is recommended to take the old policy. </p><p>  In reviews of the service, drivers do not always speak positively about the design of OSAGO.  The extension of the policy at the offices of insurance companies takes an average of at least 1.5 hours, taking into account expectations and verification of documents.  Online registration is much more profitable and faster: you can buy CTP via the Internet within 15 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The percentage of payments for accidents depends on the company.  The greatest trust among citizens is enjoyed by the Rosgosstrakh, Sogaz and VSK firms. </p><h2>  Casco purchase terms, customer reviews </h2><p>  Casco, unlike compulsory insurance, is not always acquired by drivers.  The main reason is the high cost of the policy.  Not all motorists are ready to pay 30 to 150 thousand rubles for car protection for a year. </p><p>  Casco has an advantage over CTP, as it implies the payment of compensation to the policy holder.  The client himself chooses what risks to include in the contract, thereby adjusting its value. </p><p>  The presence of a franchise from 0 to 15% can reduce the size of insurance and the amount of compensation.  The option is suitable for those who want to protect the car from damage, but are not ready to pay large amounts for hull insurance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thestar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance reviews" class="if uuid-3166675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3166675.jpg"></div><p>  Casco insurance reviews depend on the reputation of the insurer.  Clients are more responsible in choosing an organization than in the case of OSAGO insurance, since the cost of the insurance premium is 2-4 times higher. </p><p>  Clients are advised to extend hull insurance only at the same insurance company.  This will save up to 50% of the cost.  Complete with OSAGO insurance will cost even cheaper: the insurer will reduce the size of the commission by another 10-15%. </p><h2>  Life insurance when applying for a loan </h2><p>  Life and health insurance when applying for a consumer loan is an additional expense for borrowers.  Therefore, every 3rd client in the bank wishes to refuse to complete the service. </p><p>  An additional risk when applying for a loan is its hereditary attribute: in the event of the death of the borrower, obligations are transferred to his relatives. </p><h2>  Reviews on protecting life and health </h2><p>  Life insurance reviews written by customers who have received a refund make you seriously think about buying.  Despite the high cost (the average price in the bank is 45,990 rubles), insurance is able to protect the interests of the family. </p><p>  The greatest confidence among Russians is enjoyed by Sberbank Insurance, reviews of which are on banking forums.  Clients draw up insurance for Sberbank loans at 2.9% per annum.  It protects the family and the borrower from financial obligations in an insured event.  The payout percentage of Sberbank Insurance is high, and the country's largest bank has a good reputation. </p><p>  According to reviews, insurance is not always able to protect the relatives of the client from the need to repay the debts of another person.  Immediately after the occurrence of the insured event, beneficiaries must contact the insurance company.  If the application is satisfied, relatives will be exempted from the need to repay other people's debts. </p><h2>  Protection of travelers: reviews, features </h2><p>  Travel, in addition to pleasant emotions, can carry a risk not only for life, but also for the wallet.  Clients can protect themselves when traveling in Russia or abroad using a travel protection policy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ceetiz.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="travel insurance reviews" class="if uuid-3166665" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3166665.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews, travel insurance is especially popular with buyers who are going to exotic countries.  Thailand, China, the Caribbean attract their color.  But not everyone likes local cuisine or customs.  Poisoning, injury and robbery - this is what all travelers abroad fear. </p><p>  To protect the interests of those who decided to relax, a travel protection policy can.  Customers can issue it at a bank or insurance company.  The cost of insurance depends on the number of included risks. </p><p>  The average price of insurance is 4990 rubles.  It is issued for a certain period, for example, 2 months.  Feature of protection is a very high percentage of payments: more than 97% of applications of policyholders are paid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insurance reviews" class="if uuid-3166667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3166667.jpg"></div><p>  Customers can arrange protection for themselves and the whole family.  The most common risks are injuries, death, disability, theft and robbery.  To get maximum protection, the policyholder can purchase a policy with a high cost.  The amount of insurance coverage for insurance for 14,990 rubles or more reaches 2-4 million rubles. </p>
