The unique combination of climate, beautiful sandy beaches and clear sea make it a favorite vacation spot not only among the inhabitants of Primorye, but also divers throughout the country. </p><h2>  Bay Location </h2><p>  Vityaz Bay (Primorsky Territory) is located 235 km from Vladivostok between two capes on the southwestern side of <span>the Gamow Peninsula.</span>  At its end there is a village of the same name, and along the coast, waiting for guests are numerous camp sites and pensions. </p><p>  The bay is well protected from cold winds and high waves, and in a single open place, in which only wind from the west flies, its own atmosphere is created.  Dry and sunny weather prevails here, which is important for attracting tourists. </p>

    <p>  You can get to these parts by a dirt road from the village of Andreevka.  Since the road is often washed away by rains, and the path takes 10 kilometers, it is preferable to ride on SUVs. </p><h2>  Bay History </h2><p>  Vityaz Bay got its name because of a sad incident: a shipwreck of a scientific ship of the same name happened here.  During the Second World War, in the wake of the bay, a base for submarines was made, for which it was deepened and special moorings were built. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the 70s, these places have become a scientific center for the study of underwater inhabitants, for which they even used a bathyscaphe.  Since the end of the 80s, Vityaz Bay (Primorsky Territory) has again become a base for the military, who secretly conducted experiments on training dolphins to destroy enemy divers. </p>

    <p>  After the military project was closed, a small village, for a long time consisting of hundreds of houses and several hundred permanent residents, gradually began to grow in cottages and recreation centers.  Today it is a great place for relaxation and diving. </p><h2>  <span>Recreation facilities</span> in Vityaz Bay </h2><p>  It is quite natural that this region began to attract vacationers and scuba diving enthusiasts.  Clear water, picturesque countryside and beautiful sandy beaches became the reason for the construction of recreation centers here. </p><p>  The main attractive quality of the local holiday homes is that they are located directly by the water.  So just 100 meters from the edge of the surf is the recreation center "Pier".  A very small cottage, designed for only 5-10 people, allows you to spend an unforgettable vacation. </p>

    <p>  Vityaz Bay contributes to this in many ways, although the parking lot equipped here, a playground and gazebos with barbecue facilities play an important role in spending a pleasant weekend with family and friends.  Equipped with everything necessary for comfort, the cottage allows you to feel alone with nature, without losing the benefits of civilization. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  150 meters from the sea meets the guests of the Naiad Manor, which is very suitable for people who love outdoor activities.  There are 2 playgrounds for children here, on which there will be enough space for the kids both for riding on a swing, and for active games. </p><p>  Capacity up to 50 people at the same time and the organization of not only food, but also the leisure of guests make it popular for the rest of the family.  At the disposal of clients are walking and horseback riding excursions, boating and catamarans, fishing and just a boat trip. </p><p>  Vityaz Bay, a recreation center which is often associated with diving, attracts tourists from all over the country. </p><h2>  Bay Diving </h2><p>  For a long time, scuba divers avoided diving in these places.  Vityaz Bay was a training camp for seals and dolphins who were trained to attack humans.  Only in 2002, divers began to swim in these waters without fear.  Soon the first diving club appeared with its station, cottage, sauna and necessary equipment. </p><p>  The bay is attractive in that at its bottom there are many sunken schooners and moorings and a large number of interesting marine life.  Sea anemones, sea stars, sea cucumbers, mussels, scallops, octopuses, stone perches, shrimps and kelp live here.  This is not the whole list of marine wealth. </p>

    <p>  According to the reviews of those who plunged into these waters, this is truly a spectacular sight that requires vigilance, as many of the underwater attractions are unsafe.  In some places, the depth reaches 45 meters. </p><p>  One of the favorite places for tourists is the lighthouse, in which the former barracks were converted into a comfortable hotel with a restaurant located right at the edge of a sheer cliff.  Under the lighthouse at a depth of 36 meters are the remains of the ship, to which all divers who come to these parts are immersed. </p><p>  For those who decide for the first time to try themselves as a diver, each camp site in the bay provides the necessary equipment. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  The coastal zone of Vityaz Bay is a nature reserve.  <span>Noble deer</span> and tigers live in the forests, and on foot or horseback you can see the nests of rare black vultures and white-tailed eagles. </p><p>  Of the sea animals, black killer whales, largha seals, dolphins and sea lions are protected here.  Due to the fact that warm and cold currents converge on the territory of the reserve, both arctic and subtropical marine inhabitants coexist here. </p>

    <p>  Vityaz Bay (Primorye) is a place with a limited regime of natural use.  This means that far from everything that lives in the sea can be caught, and even more so taken with you.  Fishing lovers should know in advance where they can engage in their favorite hobby. </p><h2>  Fishing in the bay </h2><p>  Vityaz Bay boasts an abundance of fish, but to catch it, it is better to come to recreation centers organizing such events.  Huntsmen from the protected area strictly monitor that natural resources are not ruined in any case.  In boarding houses there are special paid trips to places where fishing is allowed. </p><p>  For example, boarding house ‚ÄúSea Breeze‚Äù provides such services, and experienced fishermen use them with pleasure.  During a fishing tour you can catch a flounder, crucian carp, goby, perch and even pike.  You can catch from a boat or engage in spearfishing.  The latter type of fishing is considered aerobatics, as it requires experience in diving and skills in handling underwater weapons. </p><p>  Everyone who comes to Vityaz Bay can find entertainment to their liking, but its main attraction is its unusually beautiful nature.  This is evidenced by the reviews of those who have ever been here. </p>
