    <p>  Sviyazhsk Island is separated from Kazan by no more than sixty kilometers.  The island still has pre-revolutionary, old street names: the main street is Uspenskaya, which stretches from the south to the north through the entire island, Troitskaya street runs parallel to it, and to the north - Nikolskaya.  Alexandrovskaya Street crosses them all. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  Sviyazhsk in Tatarstan is inhabited by a little more than two hundred people, which is comparable to a very small village on the scale of our country.  The island is beautiful at any time of the year and in any weather.  Picturesque summer sunsets and snow-covered streets are quiet, without any signs of automobile traffic.  Getting on a fabulous island, you feel like in another dimension.  And if you take into account the ancient structures around, this impression only intensifies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The history of Sviyazhsk is inextricably linked with the development of these places by the Russians, and more precisely, with the conquest and further accession of the Kazan Khanate to the Russian state. </p><p>  In the XV century there was a cone-shaped hill covered with centuries-old forest - Mount Round, around which the Sviyaga and Pike rivers flowed.  And by the middle of the XVI century there was a powerful fortress of Ivan the Terrible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sviyazhsk island" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2137341.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It is known that since 1547 the Russian Tsar repeatedly made campaigns in Kazan, but all of them did not give a result.  Returning after one of them (1550), the young Ivan the Terrible saw the ideal location in the military-strategic plan of the Kruglyaya mountain and decided to be here a Russian fortress. </p><p>  The tsar entrusted this difficult task to the first military engineer Ivan Grigorievich Vyrodkov, who left a big mark in the history of our country.  And it should be recognized that this talented specialist found a brilliant solution.  The fortress was completely cut down under the city of Uglich.  All its details were numbered, fused and assembled on Bald Mountain. </p><p>  It was a grandiose project - the Sviyazhskaya fortress was even bigger than the Moscow Kremlin in size.  They cut it down in 1551, and less than a year later (1552) Kazan fell.  So on the banks of Sviyaga, Volga and Pike in a record time appeared this island-city and a powerful fortress. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Over its nearly five-century history, Sviyazhsk has experienced falls and rises, wealth and poverty, obscurity and glory.  But time steadily advanced, the town grew, developed, the first monasteries and churches appeared on its territory.  After the conquest of Kazan, the powerful fortress turned into a large trading and administrative center for those times, where foreign merchants arrived and foreign embassies were located. </p><p>  Later Sviyazhsk turned into a monastic town, in which life became quiet and filled with grace.  Even later, Sviyazhsk became the county town of the Kazan province, which received its coat of arms in 1781.  The city floating on the ship is depicted on a shield under which fish splash.  This is a kind of tribute to the unusual and very original construction of the city, which was actually brought from the Uglich forests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="excursion to sviyazhsk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2137333.jpg"></div>

    <p>  An unenviable fate awaited the town after the revolution - these were desecrated and looted temples in which correctional institutions and prisons were placed.  And then an even darker time came when the picturesque island of Sviyazhsk in Tatarstan became one of the GULAG camps. </p><p>  At the end of December 1955, a part of the city was flooded.  This happened due to the launch of the Kuibyshev state district power station.  The road that connected it with the land went under water, and Sviyazhsk turned into a real island. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The latest history of Sviyazhsk began in 2008.  Until that time, local residents lived on the island, until a dam was laid with a road, again connecting Sviyazhsk with large land.  Implementation of the well-known Renaissance program began in 2010, during which it is planned to turn Sviyazhsk in Tatarstan into a museum-reserve of republican significance.  Large-scale restoration and restoration work is underway here. </p><h2>  Sviyazhsk: description of the modern island </h2><p>  Today, the ancient fortified city is undergoing a rebirth.  As in the past, participants in excursions in Sviyazhsk are greeted with white stone walls of monasteries, gilded domes of churches, as in antiquity, people live here, and perhaps there are descendants of those who once created this man-made miracle. </p><h2>  City architecture </h2><p>  Sviyazhsk in Tatarstan, thanks to isolation from the outside world, after turning the town into an island, preserved the unique architecture and layout of the county town of the XIX century.  Nowadays, most of the local population has been relocated to municipal apartments, and reconstruction is being carried out in their homes, and they are being transferred to various institutions and organizations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sviyazhsk story" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2137334.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The estate of the merchant Kamenev is a striking example of Sviyazhsk architecture.  It was built in the 19th century.  The building is made in the style of classicism, but with some elements of wooden architecture.  The building was renovated in 2010, and today it houses a hotel. </p><p>  Christmas Square is the architectural and historical center of Sviyazhsk.  Around it there are several interesting objects: fire barracks, a city school, a craft school.  The square offers stunning views of the Volga, so guests who take part in the excursion to Sviyazhsk love to relax here.  They take great photos, but even they cannot fully convey the beauty of these places. </p><h2>  Sviyazhsk in Tatarstan: attractions </h2><p>  This building is deservedly considered the hallmark of the island.  The Virgin Assumption Monastery in Sviyazhsk was founded in 1555.  This happened just three years after Kazan fell.  The first abbot of the monastery was Archimandrite German.  Today he is considered the patron saint of the city.  An interesting fact: when he wanted to desecrate his relics in 1922, such a severe thunderstorm began that the atheists, frightened, abandoned their dirty deed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temples of sviyazhsk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2137344.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The ensemble of the monastery is a unique historical and architectural attraction, which is not equal in the Middle Volga region. </p><h2>  John the Baptist Monastery </h2><p>  Until 1917, this monastery was female, and after the revolution and to this day is male.  It was founded in the 16th century and was called Rozhdestvensky.  The first buildings were wooden, then stone and brick, but the oldest buildings, unfortunately, were lost due to frequent fires and rebuilding. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="monument to the victims of political repression Sviyazhsk" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2137336.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The monastery was actively expanding in 1796, when the bell tower was built and the John the Baptist chapel of St. Sergius Church.  Hard times came for the monastery with the advent of Soviet power: in 1919 it was closed.  True, its entire territory was declared a museum-reserve of architecture and history.  Even in 1959, the restoration of the central cathedral was carried out. </p><h2>  Temples of the Ancient City: Assumption Cathedral </h2><p>  The temple was built in 1560 in the Pskov-Novgorod style.  Ivan Shiryaev and Postnik Yakovlev, the authors of the world famous <span>St. Basil‚Äôs Cathedral in Moscow,</span> supervised the construction work <span>.</span>  This is one of the two churches of Sviyazhsk and Russia, in which the frescoes of the era of Tsar Ivan the Terrible are preserved - their area inside the cathedral is one thousand eighty square meters.  The second temple was preserved in the Transfiguration Monastery of Yaroslavl. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sviyazhsk monastery" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2137346.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Quite a lot of frescoes exist in Russia and are perfectly preserved, from the earlier and later periods of the history of our country, and there are only a few frescoes from the 16th century.  This is a unique monument and a rarity of ancient Russian art of the 16th century.  Of particular interest to specialists is the fresco of the holy warrior Christopher with a horse head.  In iconography, images with a head of a dog were taken at that time, later all animal-like forms were destroyed. </p><p>  Of no less interest are altar images of Tsar Ivan the Terrible himself, as well as Metropolitan of Moscow Makarii.  In the summer of cancer with the relics of Herman is located in the premises of this cathedral. </p><h2>  Trinity Church </h2><p>  The history of the construction of this church is interesting: along with materials for the Sviyazhsky fortress, logs for this temple were brought in 1551.  Surprisingly, they gathered the church within a day, without a single nail.  Researchers and historians consider the founder of the Trinity Church a <span>contemporary of Ivan the Terrible,</span> Prince Nikita Serebryany.  Documents have been preserved showing that John the Terrible himself prayed here on the eve of the <span>capture of Kazan.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sviyazhsk how to get" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2137332.jpg"></div>

    <p>  This is the oldest monastery church.  It was cut down near Uglich along with other structures of the fortress.  The interior of the temple changed several times, but the design of the iconostasis remained unchanged.  The church was completed several times and sheathed with tesa.  Today, the appearance of the temple is fully restored.  Today it is the only remaining of the first wooden buildings that can take pride of place on the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p><h2>  Church of Constantine and Helena </h2><p>  One of the churches that survived on the island, which is not part of the monastery complex.  It was built in the second half of the 17th century on the site where there used to be an ancient wooden temple, erected in the memorable 1551.  In Soviet times, there was a museum in its walls, and since 1993, divine services have resumed. </p><h2>  Church of St. Sergius of Radonezh </h2><p>  This church of Sviyazhsk in Tatarstan was built in 1551.  Initially, it was wooden.  During the reign of Boris Godunov, a stone temple was erected in its place from white limestone, and it was re-consecrated in honor of St. Sergius of Radonezh the Miracle Worker.  This is confirmed by a wall inscription dating from 1604.  For the winter, the cancer with the relics of St. German is transferred to the premises of this church. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sviyazhsk on the ship" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2137347.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  St. Nicholas Church </h2><p>  The oldest monastery church is Nikolskaya.  It was built in 1956 from ashlar.  The work was performed by the Pskov artel Ivan Shiryaev.  Much later, a bell tower (four-tier) was built to it, forty-three meters high.  This is the tallest building on the island.  The cell of St. Herman was preserved in this temple.  Praying is allowed only to the monks of the monastery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting places of tatarstan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2137331.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Memorable places of the island </h2><p>  Many places of Tatarstan attract tourists.  One of the main attractions of the republic is Sviyazhsk, in the history of which, unfortunately, the gloomy events of the Civil War in Russia and the Stalinist repressions left an unhealing mark.  Monuments of the island eloquently tell about this. </p><p>  Now, probably, few people know how many people were killed on the island in custody.  This is due to the secrecy and inaccessibility of archives.  After the victory over fascist Germany, Sviyazhsk turned not only into a prison, but also into a kind of ‚Äúisolation ward‚Äù for the disabled disabled at the front and in the camps.  Stalin did not want people with disabilities to fall into their eyes and arouse sad feelings.  In those years, in the country that defeated fascism, many monasteries turned into the last refuge for mutilated people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zelenodolsky district of Tatarstan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2137345.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In captivity on the island, many intellectuals were killed.  Among them is the talented Tatar poet Hassan Tufan.  He spent ten years in the Sviyazhsky camp, and after that another seven years in Siberia.  All this time he worked: he wrote poems that were dedicated to his wife. </p><p>  The place for the <span>monument to the victims of political repression</span> in Sviyazhsk was not chosen by chance.  When restoration and restoration work was carried out in ancient structures, a mass grave was discovered, which dates back to the forties of the last century.  The remains of the unfortunate did not begin to disturb, and a memorial was created at the burial site. </p><p>  The sculpture depicting an intelligent prisoner who releases a dove through the bars has become a symbol of all the victims of the regime who were innocently imprisoned in the local prisons.  The author of the monument was a sculptor from Tatarstan Mahmud Gasimov. </p><h2>  Wall of communards and stone obelisk </h2><p>  The post-revolutionary period also left its mark in the history of the island.  Near the central square is the "Wall of Communards", as well as a small and rather modest obelisk. </p><p>  This is the place of execution of the Red Guards in 1918.  Every tenth soldier of the military unit that was stationed on the island was killed on the orders of Trotsky after an unsuccessful attempt to drive out white troops from Kazan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hail island" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2137335.jpg"></div>
