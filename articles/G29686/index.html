These models occupy leading positions in modern fashion for many decades, and today they are especially relevant.  Light T-shirts, sweaters, tunics and other original things will be an adornment of a summer wardrobe for both women and men.  A fragment of the net in the form of a part of clothing is suitable for a stylish model, regardless of the season. </p><h2>  Simple mesh </h2><p>  This is a beautiful knitted mesh pattern, the scheme of which is easy to use even for beginners, will decorate any product.  To perform this knitting, you do not need to count the rows and loops, it is enough just to understand the principle of work.  The most attractive pattern will look from cotton or linen yarn, but wool and half-wool are also suitable (if this is a part of demi-season clothing).  The step-by-step instruction looks like this: </p><ul><li>  The rapport is not limited to a certain number of loops and rows, it is preferable that the number of loops be even. </li><li>  In the first row, remove the edge loop, knit all the loops with the front ones and end with the final wrong one (so that the fabric does not stretch, you need to knit the first and last loop as described above). </li><li>  The second row is completely knit with purl stitches. </li><li>  The third row begins with two loops knitted together front, and one yarn.  So continue until the end of the row. </li><li>  The fourth row, like all even rows, knit with purl loops. </li><li>  Repeat pattern from the third row. <div class="photo" data-original="vishivashka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grid diagram" class="if uuid-3089880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3089880.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Wrong mesh </h2><p>  The difference between this type of knitting mesh, the scheme with the description of which is similar to the previous version, is that in this case the pattern will be viewed on the wrong side.  A step-by-step instruction on the job description will make it easy to reproduce the pattern: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Rapport is also not limited to the number of loops and rows. </li><li>  The first row must be knitted with facial loops. </li><li>  The second row begins with two sewing together with the wrong loops, then the yarn and the pattern is repeated again. </li><li>  The third row, like all odd ones, is knit with facial loops. </li></ol><h2>  Torn mesh </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.laylock.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grid diagram and description" class="if uuid-3089487" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3089487.jpg"></div><p>  The grid with knitting needles, a diagram of which will be presented below, is distinguished by tenderness and lightness.  It can be used as a piece of clothing or a summer model.  It should be remembered that this pattern is almost transparent, so you can use a cover or lining.

A step-by-step instruction is as follows: </p><ol><li>  The rapport consists of 23 loops. </li><li>  The first row - two wrong side, double crochet, two together (the first loop turns over), one front, two together for the upper part of the loop, one crochet. </li><li>  The second row and all even rows are knitted, as the loops look. </li><li>  The third row - two wrong side, one front, double crochet, three together to swap and knit front, double crochet and one front. </li><li>  From the fifth row, the pattern is repeated, starting from the first row. <div class="photo" data-original="azhyr.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Openwork mesh pattern" class="if uuid-3089905" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3089905.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Openwork edge </h2><p>  An openwork mesh with knitting needles, the schemes and description of which are presented in this article, is more suitable for off-season products.  It can be made with cotton threads (this will be a more lightweight version), wool mixture or wool.  The main condition is the absence of pile on the yarn, because in this case the pattern will not be visible as it was originally intended.  The step-by-step instruction looks like this: </p><ol><li>  The rapport consists of thirty loops. </li><li>  The first row is knitted with facial loops. </li><li>  In the second row, the yarn alternates with two front, knitted together front. </li><li>  The third row - one front, double crochet, five front, three stitches to knit together, turning them around its axis, five front, double crochet, one front and double crochet. </li><li>  The fourth row is completely knit with purl stitches. <div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Openwork circuit" class="if uuid-3089912" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3089912.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Diagonal grid </h2><p>  Knitted mesh, the description of which is presented below, is universal for any season.
