  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to see in Hamburg? Popular sights of Hamburg</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you are lucky enough to be in the second largest city in Germany, you definitely will not be bored.  In the ancient city on the Elbe there are many attractions that will not leave indifferent even the most fastidious and sophisticated traveler.  In our review, we will tell you what to see in Hamburg to get an unforgettable experience. </p><h2>  City Hall </h2><p>  One of the symbols of this German city and the pearl of architectural art is the Town Hall.  In Hamburg, it can be found on Rathausmarkt, 1. Today, the executive and legislative authorities of Hamburg sit in this monumental building.  If you don‚Äôt know what to see in Hamburg first, head to the town hall. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="53.55038339999999" data-lng="9.992368599999963" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/7/3/0/5730.png"></div><p>  When in 1842 it was necessary to urgently blow up the building of the town hall in connection with the large-scale fire that was burning within its walls, the question arose of building a new building.  The first projects were submitted to the city authorities in 1854, but almost all were rejected.  The ensuing economic crisis hindered the start of the construction of a new town hall, and only in 1886 did the construction of the main city building begin.  The author of the project was Martin Haller, 6 other famous architects of that time worked with him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The last internal work was completed only in 1897, construction was interrupted several times.  First, because of the strike of workers, and then because of the large-scale epidemic of cholera. </p><p>  On the central portal of the building there is a sculptural image of Charlemagne and Frederick Barbarossa.  Thanks to the latter, Hamburg received the status of a free city back in 1189. </p><p>  The height of the tower of the Hamburg Town Hall reaches 112 meters, it can be seen from almost anywhere in the Old Town.  Symbolical was the image of the Phoenix bird at its top.  She recalls that the city hall likewise rose from the ashes after the fire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nh-hotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hamburg Town Hall" class="if uuid-2632535" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2632535.jpg"></div><p>  Not a single excursion in Hamburg is complete without a visit to the city hall.  Tourists in their reviews share their impressions and say that this place is the personification of the old city and its courageous and freedom-loving inhabitants. </p><h2>  Old tunnel </h2><p>  The uniqueness of this design is that it was built according to a rather unusual project.  In order to be in the Old Tunnel under the Elbe, you will have to use the services of a lifter.  And this applies not only to pedestrians, but also motorists and cyclists. </p><p>  The opening of this building happened back in 1911, but despite the fact that the tunnel celebrated its centenary, it still performs its functions.  After all, to get to the Steinverder area, you can‚Äôt imagine a better way. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The history of the construction of this unusual tunnel began in 1907.  The author of this project was the German design engineer Ludwig Wendemouth.  Due to the fact that at the end of the 19th century, the cargo <span>port of Hamburg</span> could no longer cope with the amount of cargo handled, the need arose for its expansion.  They did this at the expense of territories located on the left bank of the Elbe.  And then the following problem arose.  The workers had to somehow get there, and the ferries could no longer cope with so many passengers.  In addition, they interfered with cargo ships moored at the port. </p><p>  At first, the city authorities thought to build a bridge to unload the port and enable dockers to quickly get to the place of work.  But after calculating the cost of such a large-scale construction, they came to the conclusion that the construction was inappropriate.  And then the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa tunnel came up. </p><p>  Despite the fact that its construction was also not cheap and cost the city treasury 10.7 million marks, it quickly proved its economic efficiency.  Its length is 426 meters, and the diameter of two parallel moves is 4.8 meters each. </p><div class="photo" data-original="allesgerman.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old tunnel under the Elbe" class="if uuid-2632536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2632536.jpg"></div><p>  After the 8-lane modern tunnel under the Elbe was built in the 70s, traffic along the old route has become less intense, but even today it copes with the flow of passengers and cars wishing to get to the other side.  Since 2003, the Old Tunnel has been taken under state protection as a historical and cultural monument of Germany.  When planning what to see in Hamburg, be sure to include it in your list. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Miniature Park </h2><p>  If you went on a trip with children, then there are attractions in the city of Hamburg, specially designed for family excursions.  On the territory of more than 2 thousand square meters.  meters located toy city, which laid more than 20 thousand meters of railway tracks.  The whole town is divided into 7 thematic zones: these are the Swiss and Austrian Alps, the American section, Scandinavia, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rochestersubway.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Miniature Park" class="if uuid-2632547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2632547.jpg"></div><p>  This extraordinary idea belongs to the twins Frederick and Gerrit Brown.  They traveled around Zurich and visited the exhibition of miniature trains of different years.  After that, they decided to create a park where all models of trains will be presented.  But the static composition seemed to them too boring, and the brothers created a real toy road along which trains constantly move. </p><h2>  Maritime International Museum </h2><p>  Since Hamburg is a port city, it is not surprising that a maritime museum has finally appeared in it.  It arose thanks to Peter Tamm, who donated his numerous collection of ships to his beloved city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maritime Museum" class="if uuid-2632557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2632557.jpg"></div><p>  If you are lucky enough to be in this place, do not expect to quickly inspect all the exhibits.  The maritime museum is especially delighted with children.  On a vast territory, on 9 deck floors, exhibits are located covering the thousand-year history of maritime affairs.  Moreover, the children can not only inspect the model of the ship, but also feel like real sailors.  With the help of a sextant, they will be able to independently determine the location of the museum, and play pirates in a specially styled room. </p><h2>  Bergerdorf Castle </h2><p>  On the outskirts of Hamburg is an old castle, which was built in the 12th century.  Over the centuries, it was completed and expanded until it finally acquired the appearance that tourists can see today. </p><p>  The castle has a museum of Bergerdorf, which contains an extensive collection of household items and art of past centuries.  This place is especially popular with newlyweds, here you can hold a wedding ceremony, which will be remembered for a lifetime.  Also in the castle from time to time concerts of classical music are held. </p><h2>  Alster Lake </h2><p>  The sights of any city are not only what is done by human hands, but also creations of nature itself.  Hamburg was no exception.  Alster Lake is rightfully considered one of the most beloved places of city dwellers and visitors. </p><p>  It is located almost in the very center of Hamburg and it is even surprising that in the center of civilization you can still find an untouched corner of nature.  Its history began back in the 13th century, when the need arose to build a dam that could hold back the flows of the Elbe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theview-hamburg.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alster Lake" class="if uuid-2632573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2632573.jpg"></div><p>  The hallmark of the lake is a 4-meter sculpture of a girl-bather.  To enjoy this corner of nature in the center of a bustling metropolis, you can rent a catamaran or a boat and take a walk along the clear waters of Alster. </p><h2>  Kickenberg Museum </h2><p>  Museums are not only dusty galleries and ancient castles with catacombs.  Such a cultural institution can also be located in the open.  The creators of this museum were able to recreate the appearance of a German village of the 18th century. </p><p>  On a vast territory (12 hectares), about 30 houses were built in the style of that era.  Tourists who decide to visit the open-air museum Kickenberg will not be bored, because life in the village is in full swing.  You will be told the secrets of grain processing and spinning wool, especially desperate travelers can even try their hand at milking cows. </p><p>  The museum has a coffee shop.  Here you will see the whole process of roasting coffee beans and you can enjoy the aroma and taste of a freshly brewed drink.  This authentic place will appeal to both adults and children. </p><h2>  Monument to the "Iron" Chancellor </h2><p>  The monument to Otto von Bismarck in Hamburg is one of many with the help of which grateful compatriots demonstrate their admiration for this politician.  However, it should be noted that the ‚Äúiron‚Äù chancellor himself was rather cool and indifferent to such recognition of his merits.  As Bismarck himself said, the most significant reward for him was the one he received for saving the groom who was drowning in the lake.  Then he was still a young junker and with special awe perceived such awards. </p><p>  The sculpture in Hamburg is one of the most impressive and tallest among all the monuments of Otto Bismarck.  Competition for the best project was announced in 1901, and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãerecting a monument arose even earlier - immediately after the chancellor's death.  The authors of the project, which won this competition, were Johann Schaudt and Hugo Lederer.  It took them three years to submit their creation to the citizens.  According to the architect and sculpture, Otto von Bismarck is depicted in the image of a knight tired of the Crusades. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tracesofwar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bismarck Monument" class="if uuid-2632584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2632584.jpg"></div><p>  The height of the whole composition is 34.3 meters, and the chancellor himself is 14.8 meters.  To appreciate the scale of this sculpture, it is worth saying that Bismarck's head is equal to the growth of an adult. </p><h2>  Church of the Archangel Michael </h2><p>  This main Protestant church in Hamburg has another name - "Big Michel", it is located in the southern part of the city.  The history of this temple began back in 1648.  However, he was not destined to exist for a long time.  The building caught fire from lightning and was almost completely destroyed by fire. </p><p>  By 1786, the inhabitants of the city managed to rebuild the church of the Archangel Michael, but in 1906 there was another fire, due to which the tower of the building was destroyed.  The city authorities initially decided not to restore the old building, but to build a modern church in its place.  But the inhabitants of the city loved their "Big Michel", so they decided to reconstruct the former temple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bonappetour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Archangel Michael" class="if uuid-2632587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43516/2632587.jpg"></div><p>  Today it is one of the symbols of Hamburg, which makes recognizable the appearance of this free Hanseatic city. </p><h2>  Horror museum </h2><p>  If you are making a list of what you can see in Hamburg, check out this horror museum called Hamburg Dungeon.  The emphasis here is on historical surroundings.  This is not a room of fear in the usual sense, theatrical production and an amusement park are successfully combined here. </p><p>  During the show, which lasts an hour and a half, you will not only get acquainted with the history of the city, but also experience a lot of emotions due to the authenticity of what is happening.  A tour of the catacombs, basements and prisons is conducted by professional actors, and they will try their best to make the tourist feel in his own skin all the horrors of the Middle Ages. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden </h2><p>  What to see in Hamburg for nature lovers?  They are invited by the city's botanical garden, its history began more than 200 years ago.  Initially, it was a private collection of exotic plants and flowers that were brought to Hamburg from all over the globe.  Later, the botanical garden was donated to the city, and authorities opened this place for public access. </p><p>  If a tourist has time, he should definitely visit this place.  Here you can see Japanese and Chinese gardens, landscape samples of the entire European territory and even a special corner with plants mentioned in the Bible, made by Israeli botanists. </p><h2>  Panopticon Wax Museum </h2><p>  Opened in 1879, the Hamburg Wax Museum has become one of the largest in Germany today.  In 1943, the building burned down, in a fire, all of its exhibits were destroyed.  However, the Hamburgers managed to completely restore the collection in 5 years. </p><p>  Here you can see wax figures of both our contemporaries and famous personalities of the past.  A collection of human organs, also made of wax, is presented in a separate room. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="jFxX9lyb1IM" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFxX9lyb1IM" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/5/7/3/1/5731.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get from Moscow to Hamburg </h2><p>  The second largest city in Germany can be reached in several ways from the capital of Russia.  The most convenient, but also the most expensive option will be a plane.  Travel time is a little more than 6 hours. </p><p>  There is also a train that takes you to Berlin.  There is no direct flight from Moscow to Hamburg, so you will have to change trains on an internal train in the German capital.  The total travel time is almost a day. </p><p>  And finally, if you decide to travel by car, you have to stock up on a map.  The path is not long (about 20 hours without stops), but the traveler will be able to enjoy the views of Germany on the way to Hamburg and will not have to adapt to a specific schedule. </p>
