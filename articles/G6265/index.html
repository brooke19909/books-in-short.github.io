History, Pharaohs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The word "pharaoh" owes its origin to the Greek language.  It is noteworthy that it was found even in the Old Testament. </p><h2>  Riddles of history </h2><p>  According to an ancient legend, the first pharaoh of Egypt - Menes - later became the most popular deity.  However, in general, the information about these rulers is rather vague.  We cannot even claim that all of them actually existed.  The Pre-Dynastic period is most fully covered in this regard.  Historians single out specific people who ruled southern and northern Egypt. </p><h2>  Attribute </h2><p>  The ancient pharaohs of Egypt passed the ceremony of coronation without fail.  The venue for the traditional celebration was Memphis.  The new divine rulers received symbols of power from the priests.  Among them was a diadem, a scepter, a whip, crowns and a cross.  The last attribute was in the form of the letter "t" and was crowned with a loop symbolizing life itself. </p><p>  The scepter was a short rod.  Its upper end was bent.  This attribute of power came from a <span>shepherd's staff.</span>  Such a thing could belong not only to kings and gods, but also to senior officials. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  The ancient pharaohs of Egypt, like the sons <span>of the sun god,</span> could not appear in front of their people with their heads uncovered.  The main royal headdress was the crown.  There were many varieties of this symbol of power, among which there are the White Crown of Upper Egypt, the Red Crown ‚Äúdeshret‚Äù, the crown of Lower Egypt, and the millet - a double version, consisting of a White and Red Crown (symbolized the unity of the two kingdoms).  The power of the pharaoh in ancient Egypt even extended to space - such a strong admiration for every heir to the creator of the world.  However, it would be wrong to assert that all the pharaohs were tyrannical rulers and sole rulers of fate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Some ancient images depict the pharaohs of Egypt, whose heads cover shawls.  This royal attribute was gold with blue stripes.  Often a crown was placed on him. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  According to tradition, the ancient pharaohs of Egypt were smoothly shaved.  Another external distinguishing feature of the rulers is the beard, which symbolized masculine power and divine power.  It is noteworthy that Hatshepsut also wore a beard, however, an invoice. </p><h2>  Narmer </h2><p>  This pharaoh is a representative of the 0 or I dynasty.  He ruled around the end of the third millennium BC.  A plate from Hierakonpol depicts him as the ruler of the combined lands of Upper and Lower Egypt.  The mystery is why his name is not included in the royal lists.  Some historians believe that Narmer and Menes are one and the same person.  Many people still argue about whether all the ancient pharaohs of Egypt are truly non-fictional characters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient pharaohs of egypt" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/387389.jpg" width="370"></div>

    <p>  Significant arguments in favor of the reality of Narmer are such found objects as a mace and a palette.  The oldest artifacts glorify the winner of Lower Egypt named Narmer.  Allegedly, he was the forerunner of Menes.  However, this theory also has its opponents. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Menes </h2><p>  Menes became the first to rule an entire country.  This pharaoh marked the beginning of the 1st dynasty.  Based on archaeological data, it can be assumed that his reign was in about 3050 BC.  Translated from ancient Egyptian, his name means "strong", "durable." </p><p>  Traditions related to the Ptolemaic era tell that Menes did a lot to unite the northern and southern parts of the country.  In addition, his name was mentioned in the annals of Herodotus, Pliny the Elder, Plutarch, Elian, Diodorus and Manetho.  It is believed that Menes is the founder of Egyptian statehood, writing and worship.  In addition, he initiated the construction of Memphis, in which his residence was located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pharaohs of egypt" class="if" height="242" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/387402.jpg?1399053267486" width="228"></div>

    <p>  Menes was famous as a wise politician and experienced military leader.  However, the period of his reign is characterized in different ways.  According to some sources, the life of ordinary Egyptians during the reign of Menes became worse, while others note the establishment of worship and temple rituals, which indicates the wise government of the country. </p><p>  Historians believe that Menes departed to another world in the sixty-third year of his reign.  The culprit of the death of this ruler, as expected, was a hippopotamus.  The furious animal inflicted fatal injuries on Menes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Aha choir </h2><p>  The history of the pharaohs of Egypt would be incomplete without the mention of this glorious ruler.  Modern Egyptologists believe that it was the Chorus of Aha that united Upper and Lower Egypt, and also founded Memphis.  There is a version that he was the son of Menes.  This pharaoh ascended the throne in the 3118th, 3110th or 3007th year BC.  e. </p><p>  During his reign, the ancient Egyptian annals were born.  Each year received a special name for the most striking event that happened.  So, one of the years of the reign of Chorus of Aha is called as follows: "the defeat and capture of Nubia."  However, wars were not always waged.  In general, the reign of this son of the sun god is characterized as peaceful, calm. </p><p>  The Abydos tomb of the pharaoh Khor Aha is the largest in the northwestern group of such structures.  However, the most pretentious is the Northern Tomb, which is located in Saqqara.  In it, objects were also found with a carved name Chorus Aha.  Mostly these are wooden tags and clay seals located on vessels.  On some ivory products, the name Bener-Ib (‚Äúsweet with heart‚Äù) was carved.  Perhaps these artifacts brought to us the memory of Pharaoh‚Äôs wife. </p><h2>  Jer </h2><p>  This son of the sun god belongs to the I dynasty.  It is assumed that he ruled for forty-seven years (2870-2823 BC).  Not all ancient pharaohs of Egypt could boast of a large number of innovations during their reign.  However, Jer was one of the most ardent reformers.  It is believed that he was successful in the military field.  Researchers found a rock inscription on the west bank of the Nile.  It depicts Jer, and in front of him is a captive man kneeling. </p><p>  The tomb of the pharaoh, located in Abydos, is a large rectangular pit, which is lined with bricks.  The crypt was made of wood.  Near the main burial site, 338 additional ones were found.  Servants and women from Jer's harem are believed to be buried in them.  All of them, as required by tradition, were sacrificed after the burial of the king.  Another 269 graves became the site of the last refuge of the nobles and the court pharaoh. </p>

    <h2>  Den </h2><p>  This pharaoh ruled around 2950 BC.  His personal name is Sepati (this became known thanks to the Abydos list).  Some historians believe that for the first time he put on a double crown, symbolizing the unification of Egypt, this particular pharaoh.  The story goes that he was the leader of military campaigns on the <span>Sinai Peninsula.</span>  From this we can conclude that Den was determined to further expand the kingdom of Egypt in this direction. </p><p>  The mother of the pharaoh was in a special position during the reign of her son.  This is evidenced by the fact that she lies not far from the tomb of Den.  Such an honor still had to be awarded.  In addition, it is assumed that Hemaka, the keeper of the state treasury, was a very respected person.  On the found ancient Egyptian labels, his name follows the name of the king.  This is a testament to the special honor and trust of King Dan, who united Egypt. </p><p>  The tombs of the pharaohs of that time did not differ in special architectural delights.  However, this cannot be said of Dan's tomb.  So, an impressive staircase leads into his tomb (it faces east, directly towards the rising sun), and the crypt itself is decorated with red granite slabs. </p><h2>  Tutankhamun </h2><p>  The reign of this pharaoh falls on about 1332-1323 BC.  e.  Nominally, he began to rule the country at the age of ten.  Naturally, the real power belonged to more experienced people - the courtier Eye and the commander Horemheb.  During this period, the external position of Egypt was strengthened due to pacification within the country.  During the reign of Tutankhamun, construction was intensified, as well as the restoration of the shrines of the gods, which were launched and destroyed during the reign of the previous pharaoh - Akhenaten. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pharaoh story" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/387493.jpg?1399056687307" width="350"></div>

    <p>  As was established during anatomical studies of the mummy, Tutankhamun did not even live to be twenty years old.  There are two versions of his death: the fatal consequences of some kind of illness or complication after falling from a chariot.  His tomb was found in the notorious Valley of the Kings near Thebes.  She was practically not plundered by the ancient Egyptian looters.  During archaeological excavations, a great variety of precious jewelry, articles of clothing, and works of art were found.  Truly unique finds were the bed, seats and a gilded chariot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="egypt tombs of the pharaohs" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/387492.jpg?1399056517789" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is noteworthy that the aforementioned successors of the king - Eye and Horemheb - tried in every possible way to oblivion his name, ranking Tutankhamun among the heretics. </p><h2>  Ramesses I </h2><p>  This pharaoh ruled as supposed from 1292 to 1290 BC.  Historians identify him with the temporary worker Horemheb - a powerful military commander and supreme dignitary Parames.  His honorary position sounded like this: ‚Äúthe head of all the horses of Egypt, the commandant of the fortresses, the keeper of the Nile entrance, the envoy of the pharaoh, the charioteer of His Majesty, the royal clerk, commander, the common priest of the Gods of Two Lands.‚Äù  It is assumed that Pharaoh Ramses I (Ramses) is the successor of Horemheb himself.  On the pylon of the <span>Karnak Temple</span> , an image of his magnificent accession to the throne has been preserved. </p><p>  According to Egyptologists, the reign of Ramses I is not distinguished by either duration or significant events.  He is most often mentioned due to the fact that the pharaohs of Egypt Seti I and Ramses II were his direct descendants (son and grandson, respectively). </p><h2>  Cleopatra </h2><p>  This famous queen is a representative of the Macedonian <span>Ptolemaic dynasty.</span>  Her feelings for the Roman general <span>Mark Anthony</span> were truly dramatic.  The years of Cleopatra's rule are notorious because of the Roman conquest of Egypt.  The obstinate queen was so abhorrent of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbeing a captive of <span>Octavian Augustus</span> (the first Roman emperor) that she chose to commit suicide.  Cleopatra is the most popular antique character in literary works and films.  Her reign passed in conjunction with the brothers, and then with Mark Anthony, the legal spouse. </p>

    <p>  Cleopatra is considered the last independent pharaoh in ancient Egypt before the conquest of the country by the Romans.  Often she is mistakenly called the last pharaoh, but this is not so.  A love affair with Caesar brought her a son, and with Mark Anthony - a daughter and two sons. </p><p>  The pharaohs of Egypt are most fully described in the works of Plutarch, Appian, Suetonius, Flavius ‚Äã‚Äãand Cassius.  Cleopatra, of course, also did not go unnoticed.  In many sources, she is described as a depraved woman of extraordinary beauty.  Over the night with Cleopatra, many were ready to pay their own lives.  However, this ruler was smart enough and courageous to pose a threat to the Romans. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The pharaohs of Egypt (the names and biographies of some of them are presented in the article) contributed to the formation of a powerful state that existed for more than twenty-seven centuries.  The elevation and improvement of this ancient kingdom was greatly facilitated by the fertile waters of the Nile.  Annual spills perfectly fertilized the soil and contributed to the ripening of a rich grain crop.  Due to excess food, a significant increase in population was observed.  The concentration of human resources, in turn, favored the creation and maintenance of irrigation canals, the formation of a large army, and the development of trade relations.  In addition, mining, field geodesy and construction technology were gradually mastered. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="power of the pharaoh in ancient egypt" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/387494.jpg?1399056788474" width="247"></div>

    <p>  Society was controlled by the administrative elite, which was formed by priests and clerks.  At the head, of course, was the pharaoh.  The deification of the bureaucratic apparatus contributed to prosperity and order. </p><p>  Today, it can be asserted with confidence that Ancient Egypt became the source of the great heritage of world civilization. </p>
