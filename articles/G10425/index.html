With all its small stardom, it has gained popularity among tourists.  Many companies that organize trips to Goa for Russians mainly settle them in this hotel.  The guesthouse was built in 2005, and in 2015 it underwent a major overhaul.  After that, he began to be called "Casa Candolim", and recently his rating was even increased to two stars.  In two thousand, ten, eleventh and twelfth years, he won prizes at the prestigious TripAdvisor service as one of the best hotels in India.  Now the hotel is positioning itself as a boutique.  In this article we will introduce you to the Kaza Rufina Highway Hotel and try to explain the secret of its success to tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Casa Rofina Hideaway Guest House" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1475694.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Candolim </h2><p>  This resort area where the Casa Rofina Hideaway Guest <span>House</span> is located is considered the best in North Goa.  Despite the fact that this resort is considered cheap, it is still quieter here than in Calangute, and more wealthy and respectable people come here.  Therefore, despite the fact that there is only one (and now two) star on the hotel‚Äôs signboard, its services and hospitality far exceed the price you will pay for them.  The hotels and restaurants in this area are better and more respectable than in other nearby areas.  Therefore, despite its location in North Goa, Candolim is very reminiscent of the southern part of the state. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  To get to Casa Rofina Hideaway Guest House from Delhi, you need to fly to Dobolim Airport, which is closest to here.  It is not very far away - only forty-five kilometers.  And <span>Goa</span> International <span>Airport is</span> even closer - 17 km.  The hotel is a traditional Portuguese <span>colonial-style building</span> painted yellow.  The owners of the hotel live on the ground floor (it is managed by one family).  There is also a common room that guests of the hotel can use, a lounge and a library.  On the second floor - most of the rooms for guests.  Guesthouse Casa Rofina Hideaway Guest House (India) is surrounded by a small but very beautiful garden.  The hotel is located in a small village, very close to the beach, almost on the shores of the gentle Arab Sea, a hundred meters from the main road of Candolim Beach Road and two hundred from the supermarket "Lavender".  Near the hotel you can find several salons offering <span>Ayurvedic massage.</span>  The place is quiet, but very close to the center of tourist and commercial activity of the village.  Since the hotel is located a little off the road, sometimes it is not so easy to find. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Casa Rofina Hideaway Guest House reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1475673.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, they are there.  Three rooms in the hotel are standard, small (only sixteen square meters in area), but with balconies and plastic chairs.  Nevertheless, you will find in this room both a shower with hot water and a refrigerator (which is very important).  In addition, there is a safe and Wi-Fi.  There is a fan on the ceiling.  The floor is wooden.  Three more rooms are slightly better: they are air-conditioned and their area is about twenty square meters.  There you can watch TV and use the minibar.  There is also a kettle and coffee maker.  And two superior rooms are eight-meter two-room apartments with an entrance hall and a kitchen.  In total, the hotel has eight rooms.  The rooms are mainly designed for two people.  Therefore, if you want a third person to stay there, they will not put an extra bed, but they will give a mattress.  The linen in the rooms is changed every other day.  The rooms on the second floor have sea views, and some have pool and garden views. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Casa Rofina Hideaway Guest House India" class="if" height="261" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1475695.jpg" width="541"></div>

    <h2>  Where to sunbathe and swim </h2><p>  Asa Rofina Hideaway Guest House is just two hundred meters from the sea.  In order to get there, you need to go outside the gates of the hotel, walk to the main road, cross it.  Behind her, the coast begins.  The beach, like almost everywhere in Goa, is public, sandy.  Therefore, if you do not have your own umbrella, you will have to pay for its rental.  But the <span>beach "Candolim"</span> is considered the best in the state.  True, the waves are slightly larger than in other places, and the descent into the water is not so gentle, but this does not greatly affect the cleanliness and beauty of relaxation.  But parents with children need to keep this in mind.  There are a lot of equipped beaches on Candolim where you can find various water activities: diving and snorkeling. </p><p>  In general, Candolim beach is the best suited for simple relaxation, which will allow you to escape from all affairs and worries.  The sand there is very soft and clean.  And closer to the territory of the Donna Florina Beach Resort hotel people gather who are interested in esotericism and yoga.  In addition, the Casa Rofina Hideaway Guest House, after renovation, became the owner of a good, picturesque swimming pool, however, very small in size.  If you ask the hosts, they will give you beach towels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Casa Rofina Hideaway Guest House Candolim reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1475674.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to see in the district </h2><p>  The cheapest way to travel in North Goa is not to book a tour with a tour operator, but to call a taxi.  The management of Casa Rofina Hideaway Guest House will be happy to provide you with this service.  From here you can go to Old Goa or visit the capital, Panaji.  There you can see old churches and houses in the famous Portuguese colonial style.  If you do not want to take a taxi, a bus runs every twenty minutes from the main road to the capital of Goa.  Fort Aquada, a famous prison, is a five-minute drive from the hotel.  And the Candolima Church is located so close to the hotel that it can be reached on foot without much effort.  Tourists leave positive reviews about visiting the spice farm and yoga classes.  And lovers of longer journeys are recommended a trip to the mountains, to the Dudhsagar Falls.  They are one of the hundred highest cascades in the world.  And boat trips on the sea (where you can watch dolphins at sunset) or along the Mandovi river will leave an unforgettable impression. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Casa Rofina Hideaway Guest House Candolim (India)" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1475705.jpg" width="550"></div>

Many companies that organize trips to Goa for Russian travelers settle them in this particular hotel.  Tourists are mostly very satisfied with their stay.  The atmosphere here is cozy and somewhat even elegant, especially in the last two years.
