    <h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  The country has a dry, continental climate.  In January, the temperature does not exceed +15 ¬∞ C, and in July it reaches +30 ¬∞ C.  The most favorable time to visit the hospitable Kingdom of Jordan is autumn and spring. </p><h2>  Aqaba </h2><p>  An important seaport of the country on the Red Sea, a modern resort city.  The coast of Aqaba stretches for twenty-seven kilometers.  Within the city, all beaches are paid, so most tourists prefer to relax outside the city.  Even in winter, the temperature in this town does not drop below +22 ¬∞ C. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Aqaba, divers like to relax.  Undoubtedly, it is difficult to find a more beautiful place where you can go scuba diving than the Red Sea.  There are all conditions for diving.  This resort has not so much religious Islamic influence (in comparison with other cities), so women can dress a little easier here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="all inclusive hotels jordan red sea" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1210403.jpg" width="600"></div>
