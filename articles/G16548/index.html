    <h2>  What can be knitted bolero </h2><p>  If we are talking about the warm form of clothing, then thin wool, angora or mohair should be used.  These types of yarn have many valuable qualities: </p><ul><li>  Retain heat. </li><li>  Let in air. </li><li>  Absorb moisture. </li><li>  Presentable look. </li></ul><p>  You should not try to work with acrylic, polyamide and microfiber, since they are absolutely not able to warm, even if the thread is very similar to wool. </p><p>  These materials, imitating cotton and viscose, are much better suited to create a lace fabric.  Along with cotton, linen and bamboo, they allow you to make a beautiful summer product.  <span>The crochet bolero pattern is</span> developed by each knitter independently, based on its purpose and personal preferences.  The basis may be a simple or patterned pattern. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To build a product pattern, you do not need to be a fashion designer, many practical tips can be gleaned from magazines.  In cases where the craftswoman works with fragments connected separately and combined into one canvas, the crocheted bolero pattern is an elementary drawing, compiled on the basis of the model‚Äôs main dimensions and motive parameters.  Some excellent examples of such products are presented below. </p><h2>  The simplest model of openwork bolero </h2><p>  Both beginners and experienced knitters consider even linear patterns to be the most practical.  Such canvases begin with a chain of air loops.  Their knitting continues upward in straight and reverse rows in accordance with the pattern parameters.  The figure below shows a bolero model with a deep smooth roll.  The advantage of this model is the ability to place the clasp on the front parts.  It can be a button, a decorative hook, a clip or a simple knitted lace. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scheme and description crochet bolero" class="if" height="239" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1235857.jpg" width="310"></div>

    <p>  To perform it correctly and, importantly, symmetrically, it is necessary to draw a contour on paper and apply a canvas to it when knitting.  Any pattern can be selected, for example, one that is depicted in the diagram. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork pattern for bolero" class="if" height="273" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1235856.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Pattern execution sequence: </p><ul><li>  A chain of air loops (VP). </li><li>  2VP;  2 double crochet (CCH) developed in the 5th loop of the chain;  2VP;  2CCH in the same loop as the previous CCH;  2VP in the 5th P;  single crochet (RLS).  Repeat the sequence to the end of the row. </li><li>  3VP for lifting;  2;  2VP;  3;  2; 1;  2SSN with a common top.  The principle of this element is shown in the diagram.  Repeat the sequence a number of times, except for the lifting loops.  At the end of row 1. </li></ul><p>  The third row repeats the first, and the fourth - the second. </p><p>  The density of knitting will depend on the thickness of the thread.  The following description is given for such parameters: 10 cm = 5 rapports, 10 cm = 12 rows. </p><h2>  Making back and front </h2><p>  Backrest Detail: </p><ul><li>  The initial chain of 176 VP (44 cm). </li><li>  Knit a square in a pattern 34 cm high. </li></ul><p>  Left half of the front part: </p><ul><li>  Dial 88 VP. </li><li>  For the formation of bevels of the neck, it is necessary to reduce one rapport in four rows until there are 7 instead of 11. Due to the presence of diagonal inclined stripes, the pattern makes it very easy to make cuts.  It is also possible to form a bevel, guided by the drawn pattern. </li><li>  Next, the part is knitted exactly to a height of 34 cm from the typesetting edge. </li></ul><p>  The right part of the front knit similarly.  Finished cloths are washed, dried and stitched on the shoulders.  The sides should be sewn from the lower edge to a height of 16 cm, the remaining 18 will become armholes. </p><p>  The neckline, bottom line and armholes should be tied and sewn on.  The openwork strapping scheme is proposed in the diagram. </p><h2>  <span>Scheme and description of a crocheted bolero</span> made of motifs </h2><p>  The easiest way to work with square fragments.  Their clear geometric shape eliminates the occurrence of parts that are difficult to perform, so such models are initially planned simplified.  This paragraph provides a diagram and description of the crocheted bolero, which does not include curly armholes and necks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet bolero pattern for girls" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1234676.jpg" width="369"></div>

    <p>  As can be seen in the drawing, both parts of the product (both front and back) are rectangles.  In order to obtain armholes, only the squares marked with the symbols ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù are sewn together, while leaving an unstitched section equal to the length of one motive.  If, by individual standards, the width of the armhole should be more than one square, then the unwired section should be left longer. </p><p>  You can combine fragments into a whole canvas in the manufacture of the last row or when all the motives are ready.  The latter method is preferable, since it makes it easier to correct errors.  However, when making connections with the first method, the canvas looks neater. </p><h2>  What you should pay attention to </h2><p>  Such a crochet bolero pattern has its own peculiarity: during tying the armholes they should be pulled a little.  If this is not done, the shoulders will be bristling.  To avoid this, in the patterns for sewing or for the manufacture of some knitted products, they plan to lower the shoulder (several centimeters). </p><p>  A square shoulder is great if you need a <span>crocheted bolero</span> pattern <span>for a girl.</span>  It is also worth considering that such a blouse cannot have a fastener.  The front shelves do not converge, so the bolero takes the form of a vest.  However, this is insignificant, since the product is summer and very openwork. </p><h2>  <span>We</span> crochet a <span>bolero</span> : product scheme with sleeves </h2><p>  A more complex model of the product, which has sleeves and a wide wrap around the entire perimeter, can be used with virtually any clothing.  She looks harmonious with an evening dress, jeans or a light sundress. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet bolero pattern description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1234677.jpg" width="354"></div>

    <p>  This crochet bolero pattern also consists of squares, however, triangular halves of the motifs are provided to form a smooth neckline.  Sleeves are also formed by squares. </p><p>  In this model, the harness is as decorative as the main pattern.  Both one and the second play an important role, complementing each other. </p><h2>  Finished Product Processing </h2><p>  When the main work (knitting parts, stitching and tying) is completed, the product should be handled very carefully.  It should not be machine washed and at high water temperatures.  It is better to limit yourself to just hand washing.  Also, the bolero does not need to be ironed and dried in a hanging form (only unfolded). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet a bolero" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1234678.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  These recommendations can be attributed to all knitted things.  Many know them, but often ignore them.  Wool and cotton often shrink, and the synthetic fiber in their composition can stretch.  A mistake in leaving can turn a short neat bolero into a jacket or, what is worse, into clothes for a doll. </p>
