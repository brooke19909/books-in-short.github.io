Fedor Apraksin absolutely deservedly awarded the title of Admiral General and the post of President of the Admiralty College.  It is impossible to overestimate his services to the fatherland: he, along with the tsar, took part in the creation of the Russian fleet.  It was Fedor Apraksin who won a number of battles at sea and on land, which were of strategic importance.  What was remarkable in the biography of the famous admiral-general?  Let's consider this question in more detail. </p><h2>  Origin </h2><p>  The Apraxins have long occupied a privileged position in society.  Sources for the first time reliably mention them in the first half of the 17th century.  As early as 1617, the ancestor and namesake of the naval commander Fedor Apraksin was the clerk of the order of the Kazan Palace.  In 1634, he served as the clerk of Boris Lykov, who was the son-in-law of Tsar Mikhail Romanov.  Fedor Apraksin, being childless, died in 1636.  But his brother Peter had offspring.  We are talking about the son of Vasily Apraksin, who served the king himself.  It was in the family of Vasily Petrovich that the offspring of Matvey appeared - the father of the eminent naval commander.  Matvey Vasilievich himself ‚Äúgoverned‚Äù in Astrakhan.  Three sons and a daughter were born in his family.  Pyotr Matveevich was in the service of the sovereign as a privy councilor, and then a senator.  Fedor Matveyevich was an associate of Tsar Peter I, Andrei Matveyevich was an oberson with monarchs.  But the daughter of Marfa Matveevna Apraksina became the legal wife of Tsar Fedor Alekseevich.  This marriage to a certain extent predetermined the career of all the sons of Matvey Vasilyevich. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  But, becoming the second wife of the monarch, Marfa Matveevna Apraksina soon became a widow and lost her status as queen.  But this did not prevent her brothers from building a career in the system of the state apparatus. </p><h2>  The king's captain </h2><p>  He was born on November 27, 1661.  From a young age Apraksin F.M.  served as a steward with Peter I. And it should be noted that he had worthy competitors.  In particular, we are talking about Prince Fedor Yuryevich Romadanovsky.  He was also a close steward.  And if Apraksin created amusing troops, then Romodanovsky was their generalissimo.  After some time, the king became interested in "battle games", so the number of soldiers in the regiments, formed specifically for the amusements of Peter I, increased at times.  One way or another, but the amusing troops were a serious step in reforming the Russian army, and Apraksin's merit in this matter is obvious. </p><h2>  Governor </h2><p>  However, Fedor Matveyevich will be even more favored by the king when he builds his first ship. </p>

    <p>  In 1692 he was appointed governor of Arkhangelsk.  After some time, Apraksin will come up with the idea to build a ship that could successfully crank commercial matters at sea.  The Russian emperor was absolutely delighted with this venture and personally took part in laying the cannon frigate "Saint Apostle Paul".  Apraksin F.M.  devoted time and improvement to the city.  In particular, he strengthened the defense of Arkhangelsk <em> </em>  and enlarged the territory of the Solombala shipyard.  In just a few years of governorship in the ‚Äúland of the European North‚Äù, he was able to elevate the military and commercial shipbuilding industries to a new level of development.  Moreover, he introduced the practice of sending Arkhangelsk ships abroad for commercial purposes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  New ranks </h2><p>  IN <em> </em>  the beginning of the 18th century, Fyodor Matveyevich was assigned to manage affairs in the Admiralty Order.  In addition, he becomes the governor of Azov.  Apraksin spends a lot of time in Voronezh, where he is working hard to create a fleet that would cruise the waters of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov.  At the mouth of the Voronezh River, he intended to lay another shipyard. </p>

    <p>  In Taganrog, Fedor Matveyevich planned to equip the harbor and build fortifications, in the village of Lipitsy, located on the right bank of the Oka, Apraksin planned the construction of a factory for casting cannons.  In Tavrov (Voronezh region), a state dignitary wanted to create an admiralty and equip docks.  In the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, he decided to begin hydrographic work.  And all his above-mentioned undertakings were crowned with success. </p><h2>  President of the Board of the Admiralty </h2><p>  Naturally, the colossal work done by Apraksin does not go unnoticed by the main ruler of the Russian state.  Peter I appreciates the merits of his steward.  In 1707, Fedor Matveyevich was awarded the rank of Admiral General and was appointed President of the Admiralty College.  He is entrusted with the personal command of the Baltic Sea flotilla and several military units on land. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Success in military affairs </h2><p>  In 1708, Admiral General Apraksin led the Russian corps in Ingermanland, which prevented the Swedish army from capturing the ‚Äúcity on the Neva,‚Äù Kotlin and Kronshlot.  Fedor Matveevich was able to destroy the building of Stromberg near the village of Rakobor (formerly Wesenberg). </p>

    <p>  Almost three weeks later, the president of the Admiralty College in the Gulf of Cape defeated the Swedish forces led by Baron Liebecker.  Naturally, such triumphant victories were noted at the highest level.  Fedor Apraksin was awarded the title of count and received the position of full privy councilor.  In addition, Peter I ordered the masters of the Mint to make a silver medal depicting a chest portrait of the illustrious military leader and naval commander. </p><h2>  Triumphant victories continue </h2><p>  And then Fedor Matveevich again distinguished himself on the battlefield.  The commander, having 10 thousand soldiers in his arsenal, besieged Vyborg and took the fortress.  For this operation, he received the Order of <span>St. Andrew the First-Called,</span> as well as an award sword made of pure gold and decorated with diamonds.  Then Apraksin was transferred to the Azov lands, where he destroyed the previously built fortifications and sold merchant ships.  The fact is that Azov in 1711 passed under the jurisdiction of Turkey.  After <span>that, the Admiral General</span> spent some time in St. Petersburg, but already in 1712 he was appointed to command the infantry, which goes on a campaign to return part of the Finnish lands.  The commander conquered the territory, starting from Vyborg, where in 2010 a monument to Fedor Apraksin was solemnly unveiled, and ending with J√§rvi-Koski.  And soon after this, the steward of Peter the Great, commanding galleys at sea and infantry on land, was able to besiege Helsingfors (the capital of Finland).  In the fall of 1713, Apraksin won the battle with the Swedes in the vicinity of the Pyalkane River.  Of course, for this brilliant Victoria Admiral General could well have received another order of St. Andrew the First-Called. </p><h2>  Gangut </h2><p>  But the winner's laurels were ahead.  In 1714, the commander and head of the Admiralty College was once again able to demonstrate to the enemy the strength and power of the Russian army. </p>

    <p>  We are talking about the famous sea battle with the Swedes, unfolding at Cape Gangut.  Apraksin had 99 galleys and scampavas at their disposal, which accommodated a total of 15 thousand Russian soldiers.  Fedor Matveyevich and his soldiers were to provide access to the Aland Islands and the Abo area.  However, the Swedish fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Vatrang, who ordered his soldiers to gain a foothold on the Gangut Peninsula, tried to prevent these plans.  To minimize the chance of relocation of Russian galleys through the previously created wooden flooring, located in a narrow part of the peninsula, the Swedes had to divide the flotilla into several parts.  This was a strategic mistake, because having disconnected, enemy ships became more vulnerable to attack.  Russian galleys were able to force the peninsula from the sea and partially attack the ship of the enemy squadron.  After some time, a decisive confrontation of forces took place in the Strait of Rilax-fjord.  The Russian fleet turned out to be stronger and won.  Entrance to the Gulf of Bothnia was free, and access to the √Öland Islands was open.  A few months later, the eastern lands located along the Gulf of Bothnia, went to Russia.  Almost all of Finland was in the hands of Emperor Peter I. </p><h2>  Return to the capital </h2><p>  However, soon Fedor Matveyevich was suddenly recalled to the capital.  The thing is that the king learned that officials from the inner circle of Admiral General are abusing their powers and stealing money from the treasury.  During the reign of Peter I, embezzlement was a fairly common phenomenon, which was brutally suppressed by "special bodies."  But Apraksin himself, unlike other dignitaries, was not a greedy and greedy person, he was quite enough of state salaries for the needs of his family. </p>

    <p>  And the investigators, indeed, did not find evidence that would testify to the fact that the illustrious military leader was stealing public money.  But Apraksin's subordinates were convicted of this.  However, the tsar, who always remembered the merits of Fyodor Matveyevich before the fatherland, did not strictly punish his steward and ordered him only to pay a fine. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúThe Case of the Tsarevich‚Äù </h2><p>  At the same time, the Apraksins repeatedly proved their loyalty to the sovereign.  For example, we are talking about history when the offspring of Tsar Alexei in 1716, without warning anyone, went to live in Austria.  Thus, the emperor‚Äôs son decided to demonstrate his rejection of the reforms and transformations of Peter I. Only diplomats Tolstoy and Rumyantsev managed to persuade Alexei to return to his homeland and to confess his act.  Naturally, the emperor wanted to teach a lesson to a negligent offspring and ordered him to be kept in the Peter and Paul Fortress until he changed his mind.  However, Alexei neglected the interests of the fatherland and set about seeking Austrian citizenship not only, but in the company of like-minded people.  By coincidence, Pyotr Matveevich Apraksin was in their circle.  But investigators ultimately did not find evidence of his guilt.  However, this unpleasant incident with his brother was seriously worried by Fedor Matveevich, who was a direct witness to the interrogations of the prince.  As a member of the commission of inquiry, the Admiral-General, along with other dignitaries, signed the indictment on the heir to Alexei.  Tsarevich was sentenced to death. </p><h2>  Campaigns against Sweden and the military operation in Persia </h2><p>  After the victorious battle at Gangut, the head of the Admiralty College, managing on the skerries of Stockholm, periodically cruised along the coastal territory of Sweden, destroying foreign ships and collecting tribute from the territory.  King Frederick I was forced to compromise with Russia by signing the Nystadt Peace Treaty, which was disadvantageous for Sweden. <em> </em>  And Fedor Matveevich was awarded the highest maritime award (Kaiser flag). </p>

    <p>  In 1722, the military leader marched on Persia.  He personally led the Russian ships, plowing the expanses of the Caspian Sea.  In 1723, Apraksin returned to his homeland and was given command of the Baltic Fleet. </p><h2>  After the death of the great reformer </h2><p>  When Emperor Peter I passed away in 1725, his former stolnik continued to occupy a high position at court.  In 1725, <span>Catherine I</span> herself granted Apraksin the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky.  Soon, the wife of Peter the Great transferred most of the state affairs to the <span>Supreme Privy Council,</span> which subsequently included Fedor Matveyevich.  But the first fiddle in this governing body was played by Prince Alexander Menshikov.  Meanwhile, Russian ships were gradually failing, and their modernization and maintenance required financial allocations, which, unfortunately, were not allocated in sufficient quantities.  In such circumstances, Apraksin became less likely to go to sea, although the great victories of the Russian fleet were still fresh in his memory.  Only in 1726, Admiral General agreed to lead Russian ships to Revel in order to demonstrate the military power of Russia confronting England. </p><h2>  Sunset career </h2><p>  When Emperor <span>Peter II</span> ascended to the Russian throne, the Dolgorukovs, who were somewhat alienated about the Apraksins, began to manage state affairs in the country.  Fedor Matveyevich decided to leave the civil service and settled in Moscow.  Over the long years of being in power, Apraksin made a fairly large fortune.  The stolnik of Peter I owned palaces and estates, owned vast land, and possessed unique valuable things.  To whom did all this go under the testament of Admiral General?  Since he did not have children, Fyodor Apraksin shared everything that had been acquired between his relatives, and he donated the magnificent home ownership in St. Petersburg to Emperor Peter II.  Apraksin died on November 10, 1728.  The body of a state dignitary was buried on the territory of the Zlatoust monastery in Moscow.  The father of the president of the board of the Admiralty was also buried there.  Leaving a major mark in Russian history and possessing such rare qualities as kindness, diligence, truthfulness, he turned out to be one of the main assistants to Peter the Great in reforming the Russian state. </p>
