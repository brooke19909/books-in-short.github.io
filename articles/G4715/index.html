    <p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe park is 32 hectares.  It is organized so that visitors can watch predators in natural conditions.  Guests of the safari park move on special bridges, being above the habitat of lions.  The total length of these transition bridges exceeds 1 kilometer. </p><p>  The cost of admission for an adult on the territory of the park is 900 rubles, for a child - 450 rubles (prices as of 2017).  Reviews of tourists about this unique place are extremely positive.  However, to get the most complete impressions, it is recommended to stop here for a whole day to see all the phases of the life of lions per day.  The hotel has a hotel, cafe, dining room and bar. </p><h2>  Ak-Kaya Rock </h2><p>  <span>White Rock</span> (or Ak-Kaya) is the main natural attraction of Belogorsk.  Crimea is known for its diverse relief and unique mountain landscapes.  Ak-Kaya is one of the most popular geological features of the peninsula.  This is a sheer rocky wall, located four kilometers north of the city of Belogorsk.  It is composed of marls and limestones, which gives it a characteristic white color. </p>

    <p>  The absolute height of the White Rock is 325 meters.  Above the surrounding area, it rises by almost 150 meters.  At its foot numerous niches, grottoes and stone talus formed.  Steppe vegetation prevails here, and wild rose hives and undersized hornbeams are found separately. </p><p>  Ak-Kaya is incredibly film and photogenic.  This area can be seen in a number of Soviet feature films.  The most famous films are ‚ÄúThe Man from the Capuchin Boulevard‚Äù, ‚ÄúChipollino‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Headless Horseman‚Äù, ‚ÄúMirage‚Äù. </p><h2>  Tash han </h2><p>  Caravanserai is a <span>guesthouse</span> for travelers, characteristic of the countries and peoples of the Middle East and Central Asia.  In fact, this is a medieval oriental hotel.  In Crimea, such buildings were preserved in the village of <span>Old Crimea</span> and in Belogorsk. </p><p>  Tash-Khan (‚ÄúStone Courtyard‚Äù in Russian) is a valuable monument of Crimean Tatar architecture dating back to the 15th century.  It is located in the city of Belogorsk.  Unfortunately, only the entrance gate, as well as a fragment of one of the walls, have survived from this building.  According to scientists, the caravanserai in Karasubazar also played the role of a defensive fortress.  The building had loopholes and four corner towers. </p><p>  The area around Tash Khan was the center of the city‚Äôs trading life.  Here they traded wine, fabrics, clothes, utensils, weapons and slaves.  It will not be amiss to note that at the end of the 16th century, due to its favorable trade position, Karasubazar was the most densely populated city on the Crimean peninsula. </p><h2>  Cheremisovsky waterfalls </h2><p>  And now let's take a walk around the outskirts of Belogorsk.  So, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe villages of Cheremisovka and Povorotnoye there are a number of picturesque waterfalls formed by the mountain river Kuchuk-Karasu. </p>

    <p>  There are six waterfalls in total.  The largest of them has a height of 10 meters.  All Cheremisovsky waterfalls are distinguished by the bluish color of the water.  The emerald hue is given to them by exposures of blue clay, which are found everywhere in the river valley.  The best time to visit Cheremisovsky Falls, as follows from the reviews of tourists, is spring.  At this time of the year they are most full-flowing and beautiful. </p><h2>  Altyn Teshik Cave </h2><p>  This unique object is located on one of the slopes of the White Rock.  In fact, this is not a cave at all, but a huge grotto 20 meters high.  It was discovered by climbers in 1960 and was called the Golden Hole. </p><p>  In 1969, the grotto was carefully studied by an expedition of archaeologists.  Numerous remains of primitive man, tools of his labor and hunting were discovered in it.  Grotto Altyn-Teshik attracts the attention of esotericists and lovers of all kinds of mysticism, and the locals are not tired of composing various legends of fiction about him. </p><h2>  Catherine Mile </h2><p>  In the years 1784-1787, the odious Russian Empress Catherine II made a loud and pompous journey from Petersburg to Crimea.  Every ten miles of this path, special stone obelisks - ‚Äúmiles‚Äù - were placed.  Later they were nicknamed Catherine. </p>

    <p>  In Soviet times, almost all of Catherine‚Äôs miles were destroyed as ‚Äúsymbols of tsarism‚Äù.  Five such objects have been preserved in Crimea.  One of them is located on the 29th kilometer of the P23 highway, near the Tsvetochnoye village.  In the summer of 2012, this mile was thoroughly restored. </p>
