I would like to immediately highlight the manufacturing company Meridian Telecom, which has been supplying communicators to our country for a long period of time.  By the way, this company pays attention to tablets, in particular, this applies to Fly products.  These devices have long been considered the thinnest in the world.  Quite recently, the <span>thinnest</span> Fly Tornado Slim <span>phone</span> was presented to everyone on display (the exhibition was held in Asia, and there the gadget was presented under the name Gionee Elife S5.1). </p>

    <p>  The brand is engaged not only in the development, but also in the assembly of such devices.  Today, this device can be defined as the thinnest phone of 2014.  However, at present, there are already other models that are also champions in this field.  This category includes not only mobile devices, but also tablets and even laptops.  By the way, the Fly Tornado Slim model was included in the Guinness Book of Records as <span>the thinnest smartphone</span> in the world. </p><h2>  Indicators </h2><p>  If you still do not know what the thinnest phone looks like, then we can tell you that the thickness of such a device is only 5.15 millimeters, and many citizens of our country have long been using this device.  In fact, the Fly Tornado Slim phone has not only advantages, but also disadvantages, which we decided to talk about today.  The design of this device is unique, but manufacturers still needed to sacrifice flagship features and put the screen with the highest resolution in this smartphone.  Despite this, we can safely say that the end result was not only unique, but also interesting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  We will not talk about the technical characteristics in this article, but nevertheless we will talk about the positive aspects that are likely to be of interest to many users.  Let's start with the external design of the mobile phone, as well as ergonomics.  When you first pick up the Tornado Slim, you can immediately notice the unusual design that can bribe many users.  The <span>thinnest phone</span> is not only beautiful and presentable from the outside, it is also multifunctional.  Many users who have been using it for a long time leave only positive reviews, since in reality the build quality of the device is at a high level. </p><h2>  Comparison </h2><p>  If you start to consider the thinnest cell phones, then you can immediately determine that our option is in the leading positions.  But as manufacturers pay attention to the external parameters of the devices, worthy competitors have really begun to appear at present.  The Tornado Slim phone has a number of advantages compared to other models of various manufacturers, while the communicator is able to surpass even the new devices that are available today. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  If you have a desire to get the thinnest phone of 2014, which you can use not only for personal calls, but also for entertainment, in this case we can recommend you the given model.  One needs only to find out detailed information on this device, and then it will immediately become clear to you that such a purchase will bring you a lot of positive emotions. </p><h2>  Korean rival </h2><p>  Now we will visually consider this device, because many users pay attention to the given model, but do not use it as the main phone.  In fact, even the thinnest Samsung phone cannot compare with this communicator, as it is inferior in its parameters.  We are not talking about the characteristics now, because by acquiring the Korean version, you can get more features in functionality.  By the way, at present, Samsung has also begun to pay attention to the thickness of devices, because each user wants to get not only a convenient gadget, but also a compact one. </p><h2>  Acquaintance </h2><p>  The mobile phone of this model is capable of supporting two SIM cards in active mode.  However, this is not surprising, but still such a thin communicator, and even with two numbers, is already an innovation.  You probably already could see the thinnest phone in advertising on TV and even on the Internet.  In fact, many users liked this device, and this is not only due to external parameters, but also its functionality. </p>
