    <h2>  A little about the Lyubertsy district </h2><p>  This <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof the Moscow region</span> is a place of residence for two hundred thousand citizens.  Not all of them strive to live in a purely urban environment.  Many seek to relocate to such districts of the district that would be with urban conditions and at the same time, fresh air prevailed in them.  So are the residents of the capital, who are now trying to sell their real estate in the metropolis and travel to areas with a healthier environmental situation.  Just such requirements are met by the Lyubertsy district.  Marusino is located north of the city itself, surrounded by forest, lakes and fresh air.  Therefore, the population of the Lyubertsy urban district only increases from year to year. </p>

    <p>  Only ten kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road - and you can get into the residential complex.  In the future, it is planned to build a metro station right next to it, which will significantly increase the cost of housing and increase the attractiveness of the complex. </p><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  Lyubertsy district, Marusino is built up with low-rise buildings.  There are already several cozy residential complexes of the same name, which differ only in numbers in the names.  The same applies to Marusino 5.  This is an economy class housing in a quiet corner of Moscow Region. </p><p>  In total, the developer designed ten five-story houses for one thousand one hundred and sixty apartments.  Apartments in Marusino are all the same layout, small in size.  For large families, this residential complex is not suitable, since the project provides only one-room and two-room apartments.  Moreover, the two-room meter will not exceed fifty-two square meters.  But their cost is relatively low for almost metropolitan housing: from eighty thousand rubles per square meter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Layout of houses and apartments </h2><p>  The developer offers for the purchase of fully finished apartments, which you can immediately call in and live.  Complete decoration is provided, interior doors are installed, engineering systems are connected, glazing is fully completed.  All living quarters are ready for a comfortable stay in them. </p><p>  The houses are also built according to the same architectural design, have the same appearance.  The facades are made using the latest technologies, which allows for their natural ventilation and energy saving.  The latter, in turn, leads to savings in heat, energy, and lower utility costs. </p>

    <h2>  Developer offer </h2><p>  The Lyubertsy district (Marusino) is not located in the metropolis itself, which allows its residents to enjoy a more favorable environmental situation, which cannot be said about the residents of the capital.  The developer offers its property buyers a well-maintained and calm quarter.  In addition to the same architecture of the houses, children's playgrounds, green lawns, recreation areas for adults and children are equipped.  The developer Marusino did not forget about car owners, building a separate parking lot for them.  The territory of the complex is fenced and guarded.  Thus, you can not worry about the safety of their property, their safety and the safety of their children.  No stranger will enter the complex. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The village of Marusino has all the necessary infrastructure and social facilities.  It also has a kindergarten for the smallest residents.  Older people will be able to attend school.  It is located a few meters from the Marusino residential complex.  Near the residential complex operates a post office, pharmacy and several shops. </p><p>  Thus, the village of Marusino provides all the necessary conditions for a comfortable stay.
