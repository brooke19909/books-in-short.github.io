    <h2>  Mobile app </h2><p>  In addition to Internet banking, payment can also be made using the mobile application.  This method will be no less convenient, since the card replenishment procedure can be absolutely anywhere.  But provided that the mobile phone has Internet access.  You can download this application to your smartphone both on the official website of Tinkoff Bank and through most virtual directories. </p><p>  The procedure itself is very simple and is performed as follows: </p><ul><li>  go to the page "Translations"; </li><li>  Next, select the transfer to the card; </li><li>  we dial sixteen digits, that is, the card number; </li><li>  select "Continue". </li></ul><p>  If necessary, confirm the operation with the code that will come to the phone in the form of SMS. </p><p>  Funds will be instantly transferred to the recipient, if he is the owner of the Tinkoff card, other transfers may come with a slight delay. </p><h2>  Payment from a Tinkoff card to another bank card </h2><p>  There are several ways to make such a transfer.  Payment is easy to make via the Internet or mobile bank.  In addition, you can transfer from a Tinkoff card to a card of another bank at any ATM.  But it is worth considering that a commission may be taken for this procedure, in contrast to transfers via the Internet.  The payment procedure itself is simple and does not take more than three minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Credit Card Transfer Features </h2><p>  The Tinkoff Platinum card has its own characteristics and nuances when making money transfers, since it is a credit card. </p><p>  So, according to the bank‚Äôs terms, a transfer from a credit card to another bank‚Äôs card is equivalent to cash withdrawal from ATMs.  A commission of 290 rubles is provided for this procedure.  In addition, three percent of the transfer amount will be deducted from the card.  It is worth considering another fact.  Some banks charge commission fees for replenishing any credit cards.  In this case, you will have to pay for the transfer twice.  One time to the translator, the second to the recipient. </p>

    <h2>  Established limits </h2><p>  Payment from card to Tinkoff card has some limitations.  They are different for individuals and legal entities.  Limitations are set on the amount of the transfer and on their number per day and month. </p><p>  Consider the restrictions that are set for individuals: </p><ul><li>  for one operation, the amount of money transfer cannot exceed one hundred thousand rubles; </li><li>  no more than five money transfers can be made from the card account within twenty-four hours; </li><li>  the sum of all transfers within one calendar month should not exceed five hundred thousand rubles; </li><li>  from a VISA card in four days you can transfer to other cards no more than three hundred thousand rubles; </li><li>  during the whole calendar month, more than twenty different transfers of funds are not allowed. </li></ul><p>  The Bank has set such limits for payment from card to Tinkoff card. </p><h2>  What to do if money is not credited to the card account </h2><p>  Crediting funds usually does not take much time.  Money comes to the card within one to five minutes.  In the rarest cases, a transfer may be delayed for five days, especially if it has fallen on holidays.  In such cases, do not worry. </p><p>  Information about the status of the transfer and the location of the funds sent can be found by calling the hotline listed on the company's website.  A bank specialist will tell all the information in detail. </p><p>  In cases where the transaction was not completed after five days, you must contact the bank.  The client must provide an extract from the account to which the funds were transferred. </p><p>  The bank will conduct a check, and the money will either be returned to the sender or credited to the card account of the recipient. </p><p>  The most common reason for the delay in receiving the amount sent to the card is a technical malfunction. </p>

    <h2>  Transfer without commission </h2><p>  It is allowed to replenish the Tinkoff card without a commission, both by bank transfer and by transferring cash.

Without a commission, you can make a payment on a credit or debit card at terminals or cash desks: </p><ul><li>  MTS; </li><li>  Beeline; </li><li>  "Megaphone". </li></ul><p>  As well as in the salons and stores of "The Messenger" or "Euroset."  Funds will be transferred to the client‚Äôs card within fifteen minutes, in rare cases it takes up to one day.  However, it is worth considering that cash limits are set, in each of the salons they are individual. </p><p>  You can replenish your bank card through the contact points ‚ÄúContact‚Äù, ‚ÄúZolotaya Korona‚Äù, ‚ÄúMaxim‚Äù and others, as well as through the cash desks of partner banks and in any of the Russian Post branches. </p><p>  Transfer via the Internet bank from the Tinkoff debit card to the card of any third-party bank is carried out without commission and at any time of the day.  Crediting funds also does not take much time, will be from five to thirty minutes. </p><p>  In cases where the transfer to the card is carried out from an electronic wallet ("Qiwi", "Yandex.Money", "WebMoney"), a commission may be charged.  For each of the wallets, it is individual. </p>
