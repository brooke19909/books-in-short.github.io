It is washed immediately by two seas: the Aegean - from the west and the Mediterranean - from the east.  The most convenient for a beach holiday is the east coast, because here the beaches are covered with fine golden-white sand.  The infrastructure on this coast is well developed, there are many comfortable hotels and much more.  But the west coast will appeal to fans of windsurfing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Princess Sun Hotel 4 Reviews" border="0" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/577390.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kiotari beaches </h2><p>  On the shores of the Mediterranean Sea is one of the youngest resorts in Rhodes.  This is Kiotari.  Its beaches are considered the best on the island.  Not so long ago there was a fishing village on the site of the resort, however, in a short time (since the beginning of the nineties), many hotels of various categories managed to be built here, both the simplest and the magnificent five-star, operating on the all-inclusive basis.  Nevertheless, 4 * hotel complexes are considered the most popular, for example, the Princess Sun Hotel 4 * hotel.  Reviews of tourists indicate that here you can find the perfect value for money.  However, the magnificent sandy beaches of the Mediterranean coast receive the most praise.  In contrast, the shores of the Aegean Sea are more rocky, and the beaches are small-pebbled.  That is why tourists prefer to buy tours to one of the hotels located on the east coast, for example, to the comfortable hotel Princess Sun Hotel 4 *. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Princess Sun Hotel 4" border="0" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/577392.jpg" width="459"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is attractive about Kiotari resort? </h2><p>  On this coast, people who prefer the noise of discos and nightclubs a quiet relaxing vacation like to relax.  Here you can often meet couples with children.  By the way, in these parts (and throughout Greece) there is a special warm attitude towards the younger generation.  In almost all restaurants and other catering places, you will be offered a special children's menu, a high chair for the convenience of a child at an adult table, etc.  The biggest advantage of staying in Rhodes is that for all family members there are entertainment here: a water park, discos and nightclubs, an amusement park, various excursions, etc.  But on the beach, all lovers of water and beach sports can do what attracts them more: beach volleyball, windsurfing, diving, snorkeling, water skiing, <span>sailing</span> , etc. </p><p>  And those tourists who want to retire and relax without extraneous observers, if desired, can find a secluded wild bay.  However, the most valuable in these parts is the cordiality and hospitality of the local population.  In addition, thanks to the wonderful Mediterranean climate, the island is ready to receive guests until the end of October.  Autumn and winter are also mild: there is no heavy rainfall, cold weather, etc.  Some of the tourists who are <span>interested in</span> visiting the historical <span>sights of Rhodes</span> visit the island during the off-season period.  Indeed, at this time there are no huge lines in front of the museums. </p><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  If you, having looked at the rating of Rhodes hotels, decided to buy a tour to the Princess Sun hotel, then getting there from Moscow is most convenient by air.  In season, charter flights fly to the island.  The flight time is about 200 minutes (3 hours 15 minutes).  But from the international airport "Diagoras" to the resort of Kiotari you need to get by road.  Since the distance between the airport terminal and the village is about 50 kilometers, you have to spend about half an hour on the way.  You can use a taxi or regular bus.  You can also rent a car before your arrival.  Or do it even easier and pay for the transfer from the airport to the hotel.  Although a rented car can come in handy during your entire vacation.  To do this, you need an international driving license, as well as the opportunity to pay about 30 euros per day for a car. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="all inclusive hotel rating Rhodes" border="0" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/577391.jpg" width="550"></div>

Due to this, the aroma of pine needles interspersed with the brackish smell of the sea in the air.  Lindos is located 15 kilometers from it, and Rhodes, the island's capital, is 54 km away.  The Princess Sun Hotel was built in 1987 and is one of the first hotels on this coast.  In 1997, it underwent a complete reconstruction and modernization.

    <p>  There is no separate spa center here, however, tourists can use the services of the health club, which has a spa tub, as well as massage services. </p><h2>  Dining at Princess Sun Hotel.  Rhodes is a gourmet island! </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Princess Sun belongs to those Rhodes hotels that serve tourists on an all-inclusive basis, guests can refuse this and save money.  However, breakfast is obligatory for all tourists, but to eat it in the hotel restaurant or not in the afternoon and in the evenings, it is decided during the design of the tour package.  Naturally, the cost of the trip depends on this, because all inclusive tours include breakfast, lunch and dinner (buffet), as well as drinks (alcoholic, non-alcoholic, coffee, tea, etc.) of local origin and hot and cold snacks from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.  In principle, some tourists refuse "all inclusive" not only because they want to save their money, but also because they want to try dishes in all nearby restaurants and taverns, each of which is famous for its abundance of various delicacies, including from freshly caught seafood.  In addition, Rhodes is famous for its huge selection of cheeses, as well as dairy products. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Princess Sun Hotel (Rhodes)" border="0" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/577386.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  A map of Rhodes with resorts and hotels helps tourists to choose the right hotel for their holidays.  Naturally, many prefer to stay in hotels located on the first beach line.  Princess Sun cannot boast that it is located directly on the seashore.  However, its excellent location on a hill allows tourists to constantly see the most beautiful seascapes.  Between the beach and the hotel, 800 meters distant from each other, there is a road.  You can go there on foot in 7-10 minutes, however, the administration provided a regular shuttle bass (summer bus) for delivering tourists to the beach, which leaves every half hour from the hotel entrance to the shore.  It has everything you need for a comfortable beach holiday: umbrellas, sunbeds, towels, air mattresses, changing rooms, showers, toilets, sunbeds, etc.  All this is provided by the hotel guest free of charge.  For lovers of water sports there is a whole range of such services.  By the way, right next to the beach, the beautiful Asklipio fortress flaunts, the building of which gives the general landscape picturesqueness and a certain fantasticness. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Holidays in Rhodes (in particular, on the beaches of Kiotari) will bring great pleasure to fans of educational (sightseeing) and gastronomic tours, as well as those eager to get complete relaxation and relax from the bustle of the city on the magnificent sandy beaches of the island. </p>
