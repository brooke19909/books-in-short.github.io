    <p>  Kerkyra is the Old Town of Corfu, filled with charming historical narrow streets where you can wander.  Any tourist map here will be irrelevant, the route for research will be found by itself.  No matter which direction you take a walk, guests will still be minutes away from the coast.  Many visitors to Kerkyra recognize the strong Venetian influence on the city.  This is noticeable in the architecture of local fountains and houses, unlike the rest of Greece.  The entire territory is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Here you can visit interesting souvenir shops, restaurants and taverns. </p><p>  Achillion Palace is another attraction of the island, which was built by the Empress of Austria, Elizabeth of Bavaria, to forget her personal tragedy - the death of her son.  She was deeply attached to Corfu and obsessed with his beauty.  The Italian architect Raffaele Caritto built this palace, inspired by the legends of the hero of antiquity Achilles.  When the empress was killed, German <span>Kaiser Wilhelm</span> II acquired this castle as a private property, preserving beautiful gardens and architecture until it was plundered during the First and Second World Wars.  The building was both a military headquarters and a meeting place at the highest level, and only very recently became a museum. </p><p>  Paleokastritsa is a village in the northwest of Corfu, located between the hills of olive groves and citrus orchards.  Like most Corfu sites, this is an incredibly picturesque place in Greece, where you can visit various souvenir shops.  Popular spots in Paleokastritsa include the 12th-century Monastery of the Virgin.  Here you can visit the museum and the nearby village of Lacones, where you can enjoy a good breakfast.  Water sports are very popular in Paleokastritsa.  It is easy to rent all the necessary equipment.  Energetic tourists will enjoy canoeing around the beaches on a great sunny day.  You can also go to the famous caves of Paleokastritsy, where you should go diving. </p><h2>  Corfu Residence 4: reviews </h2><p>  According to most tourists, the hotel rooms are spacious, with good air conditioning, TV, refrigerator and a small kitchen.  Some vacationers in the complex noted that upon checking in their room looked outdated, with a dirty bathroom.  The apartments are really simple renovated and need updating.  The rooms of the hotel are very spacious, the terrace is great for exercise.  Vacationers had the opportunity to do yoga every morning in the fresh air, listening to the birds singing. </p>

    <p>  Some vacationers got rooms without a sea view.  In addition, there was dampness and an unpleasant smell of sewage in the bathroom.  The hotel‚Äôs television programs were limited to news, without the normal selection of films and children's entertainment.  Towels at the hotel do not change every day.  Vacationers did not like that the Wi-Fi signal was poorly connected, and mobile communication was constantly interrupted.  The hotel staff, according to reviews, very nice and friendly. </p><p>  The nearby beach is about a 10-minute walk away.  Not only is it pebble, it is also very small.  But at least the sea was perfect - crystal clear and warm.  The hotel is in a beautiful location and is located at different levels, it has a rather steep climb, which makes it unsuitable for tourists with disabilities.  The reviews also note that the location of the hotel is the best on the island of Corfu, thanks to this, guests had the opportunity to travel a lot, sightseeing, without additional financial costs. </p><p>  Nissaki Beach, although small, but clean, with delicious Greek dishes in the Mitsos tavern nearby.  And the sea is fantastic for lovers of diving and snorkeling.  The nearest shops are a 1-minute walk away.  The beach is located a little further (about 8 minutes walk from the complex). </p><p>  The hotel's dining room is not large enough to accommodate all guests at the same time, and not very clean.  And although meals were distributed within two hours, guests had to stand in line.  Many vacationers noted good food in the dining room of Corfu Residence Hotel 4. According to reviews, the food in it was homemade, tasty and quite varied.  It serves traditional Greek dishes with a small selection of salads and snacks.  A good selection was meat dishes, seafood and desserts, as well as pasta and vegetables. </p>

    <p>  Tourists liked the pool.  It is small but clean, with many buzzing bees around it.  This unpleasant moment can be a problem for people with allergic reactions.  Near the pool there are not enough sun loungers for all guests. </p><p>  Tourists who got a two-room apartment noted in their reviews the gloomy, dark ceilings in the rooms, the old kitchen in the kitchenette and the dirty bathroom, as well as the deterioration of the bathroom itself with black smudges and mold on the walls.  There was no sea view from the apartment.  Constant complaints were about terrible food with processed food left over in the afternoon and served for dinner.  The guests were disappointed with poor-quality tea bags and tasteless coffee, as well as serving drinks in fragile plastic cups without ice.  I was disappointed with the choice of desserts and fruits (except apples and watermelons).  Dissatisfaction with the same breakfast every day was noted.  It also gives advice to other tourists that you should not try the terrible ‚Äúcocktail of the day‚Äù in the pool. </p><p>  On the positive side, it was noted that Nissaki is a quiet place with beautiful nature.  There are many villas in the area.  Unfortunately, there are only two mini markets and only four cafes.  For lovers of nightlife, bars and discos, the Corfu Residence 4 is not the right place. </p><h2>  Recommendations of tourists </h2><p>  Every summer, the island of Corfu attracts thousands of tourists and becomes a favorite destination for summer vacations.  Historical and religious monuments, picturesque villages, beautiful nature and hospitality of local residents will give an unforgettable experience that will be difficult to forget.  Corfu Residence 4 has a good standard of service and good value for money. </p>
