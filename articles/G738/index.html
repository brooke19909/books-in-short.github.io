Now several high-rise skyscrapers are being built there with high speed.  The attitude towards them is very ambiguous: on the one hand, a linden grove in the immediate vicinity attracts, on the other hand, it is scared away by bad ecology from the nearby Moscow Ring Road.  In this article, we will evaluate the pros and cons, including relying on the opinions of the residents themselves. </p><h2>  About the complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="novostroev.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New buildings in LCD Satellite" class="if uuid-3078457" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078457.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews about LCD "Sputnik" are the most controversial, so let's figure it out in order.  The main thing you need to know about this complex is that it is an apartment.  So the buyer should be prepared for the fact that you will live in a non-residential premises from a legal point of view.  First of all, it will bring problems related to paperwork and registration. </p><p>  As they assure the company, which is building a residential complex, this is the only minus of these new buildings.  Is it really so, we will understand, based on reviews on the LCD "Sputnik" in Strogino. </p><p>  A residential quarter is being built on the territory of the Odintsovo district, not far from the village of Razdory.  The developer is the company "Cove Land".  The main developer is the Samolet group of companies.  It is important that in addition to the houses themselves, the master plan has all the necessary infrastructure.  These are three kindergartens, a school for more than 800 students, a fitness room, and a medical center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Construction Line </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resident Reviews for LCD Satellite" class="if uuid-3078461" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078461.jpg"></div><p>  The project is divided into three phases of construction.  The first two phases are planned to be completed in 2019, the third - at the end of 2020. </p><p>  The first two lines are three houses in height of 33 floors each.  Apartments for sale, in which from one to three rooms.  There are three options for finishing the premises in which the apartments are rented. </p><p>  Nearly 350 storage rooms are specially equipped for storing things.  Three underground floors of each multi-story tower are reserved for parking with a car wash.  The first floor is not originally residential.  There are rooms for wheelchairs, offices and shopping facilities. </p><p>  In the courtyards, the developer provides for sports grounds and play areas. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sputnik-strogino.ongrad.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Location LCD Satellite" class="if uuid-3078460" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078460.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of the residential complex is carried out by the company ‚ÄúAirplane Development‚Äù through its daughter under the name ‚ÄúLand Cove‚Äù.  The company was established in 2012 by developer Igor Yevtushevsky and lobbyist Mikhail Kenin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  All these years, the company has been developing, in the near future plans to enter an IPO.  The founders note that the business philosophy is based on several key tenets.  The developer plans to deal only with development, and get rid of infrastructure and social facilities as quickly as possible after they are put into operation.  It is precisely this policy that corresponds to the Sputnik residential complex. </p><p>  The developer can be described as fairly reliable.  Behind him - already successfully implemented objects of the residential complex Lyubertsy 2015, Lyubertsy 2016, Oktyabrsky 2016, Vnukovo 2016.  According to the feedback from the Sputnik LCD holders, it can be concluded that they are practically not worried about the construction time, as a rule, their company can withstand it, but they constantly complain about it because of the poor quality of finish. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apartments in LCD Satellite" class="if uuid-3078463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078463.jpg"></div><p>  The residential complex is from the west of the capital, just two kilometers from the metro station "Strogino".  Opposite the new buildings is the 63rd kilometer of the Moscow Ring Road.  The work is being carried out in the lowland of the Picturesque Bay, due to which the smoke from the string of cars that go along the MKAD reaches the fifth floor. </p><p>  Officially, the residential complex is located in the village of Razdor, Odintsovo district, actually across the road from Moscow. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Speaking of transport accessibility, the company's managers promise that the walk to the metro station "Strogino" will be no more than 20-25 minutes, in fact, you have to spend about an hour on the road.  Additional difficulties arose due to the huge excavation dug on the MKAD.  Because of it, you have to get to the sales office in a roundabout way, making a detour through the Rublevo Residence residential complex.  Mystery shoppers complain about this in reviews in Sputnik residential complex in Strogino. </p><p>  For motorists, the path is much easier.  You can drive to the new buildings from the side of Novorizhskoye Shosse or MKAD. </p><h2>  Concept </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pronovostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Description of LCD Satellite" class="if uuid-3078462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078462.jpg"></div><p>  In fact, the residential complex will be a square composed of four 33-story towers.  In the center there will be kindergartens, a school, sports fields, a stadium. </p><p>  The core of this development is supposed to be a community center, and the space around it will rely on the central square and the embankment.  This construction concept was developed in the Netherlands by Architekten Cie, which has already entered the Russian market.  For example, she collaborated with the PIK group of companies in the construction of a residential complex in Krylatskoye. </p><p>  The first floors of Sputnik are given for retail real estate.  Presumably, shops, beauty salons, bank branches will appear here. </p><h2>  Decor </h2><p>  Many customer reviews of the Sputnik residential complex emphasize that designers originally approached the design of entrances.  Initially, they sought to make the entrances look alike, but at the same time they retained their own zest. </p><p>  As a result, it was decided to turn to the periodic table to use familiar chemical elements.  They became silver, gold, copper, aluminum, nickel and cobalt, which gave the name to each of the six blocks. </p><p>  The porches have an impressive ceiling height of five and a half meters. </p><h2>  Floor plans </h2><div class="photo" data-original="oliu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="2 bedroom apartment" class="if uuid-3078604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/3078604.jpg"></div><p>  Buyers can choose among studios, as well as one, two or three bedroom apartments.  The smallest area is 24, and the largest are 78 square meters.  It is possible to combine several apartments or buy an entire floor. </p><p>  The apartments, whose area is more than 55 "squares", have loggias.  All apartments are finished, their cost is already included in the price of housing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="layout lcd satellite" class="if uuid-3078600" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/3078600.jpg"></div><h2>  Finish options </h2><p>  When registering an apartment as a property, you should choose one of the finishes: modern classic, minimalism or a new retro. </p><p>  At work, builders use ceramic tiles, laminate, double-glazed windows are installed on the windows.  The apartments are equipped with reliable entrance doors with three locks. </p><p>  In the reviews of the apartments in the Sputnik residential complex in Strogino, everyone notes that there are enough options. Everyone will find what he likes. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pronovostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about LCD Satellite" class="if uuid-3078458" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078458.jpg"></div><p>  Against the background of all the minuses of the apartments, their main advantage is the low price.  On average, a square meter here is a quarter cheaper than in an apartment of a similar area. </p><p>  Currently, housing can be purchased for the amount of 2.3 to eleven and a half million rubles.  Depending on the area.  It should be noted that in the nearby Myakinino Park residential complex, which is being built by the PIK group of companies, prices are on average higher by one million rubles. </p><p>  The apartments also have a reverse side.  They pay utility bills at rates for non-residential premises, which in some cases are one third higher. </p><p>  The developer seeks to reassure buyers, convincing that the difference will be insignificant.  According to estimates, the overpayment for three-room apartments will be only 760 rubles per month. </p><p>  The apartments are sold on the basis of the federal law "On participation in shared construction", since not one of the houses has yet been commissioned.  Square meters can be issued in a mortgage.  Of the banks with which the developer cooperates, the most favorable interest rate for Russian Capital is 8.75%.  There is an option to purchase apartments in interest-free installments. </p><p>  Further, everything goes according to the standard scheme.  All the necessary package of documents is collected, a loan agreement with a bank and an agreement on the provision of services for the registration of an equity agreement are concluded. </p><p>  Under each of the buildings are pantries and underground parking.  The cost of parking spaces differs in size and distance from elevators.  For example, in family places, you can put two cars at once, one after another.  The cost of a parking space starts from 700 thousand rubles.  You can also get a mortgage on it. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe pantries is from one and a half to six square meters, and their cost starts from one hundred thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mirkvartir.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Satellite in Strogino" class="if uuid-3078459" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3078459.jpg"></div><p>  In customer reviews of Sputnik LCD in Strogino, special attention is paid to infrastructure.  Indeed, by 2022, when all construction phases are completed, a real small town with a population of about ten thousand people will appear here. </p><p>  The residential complex was originally designed in such a way that it was possible to get all the necessary services without going beyond it.  At least kindergartens, schools, convenience stores will be right on its territory.  In addition, within walking distance there are Leroy Merlin and Auchan. </p><p>  If there are not enough places at all in local schools or kindergartens, children will have to be transported by car.  In terms of transport accessibility, there should be no problems, since there are several trips to major roads from the complex at once.  This Novorizhskoe and Myakininskoe highway, as well as the Moscow Ring Road. </p><p>  Sputnik is actually located at the intersection of all these routes, which negatively affects the environmental situation, the level of harmful substances in the atmosphere is markedly increased.  Anticipating this, the developer planned several recreational areas on the shore of the bay and in a lime grove. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.7980697" data-lng="37.37843859999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/3/2/9/14329.png"></div><p>  There is a lot of anxiety in the feedback from real estate investors about the Sputnik residential complex in Strogino.  The future residents are frightened by the almost complete absence of parking lots with an inevitably large number of vehicles.  In addition to underground parking, there are practically no other places to park a car.  Not everyone will be able to afford it, as in some cases the cost of a parking space will be one third of the price of the apartment. </p><p>  The positive feedback from residents about the Sputnik residential complex emphasizes that a plan has already been approved for the reconstruction of the Myakininsky highway, which will become a 4-lane.  In addition, the company plans to work on landscaping, which is good news. </p><p>  It is interesting to read reviews about the Sputnik residential complex of workers who are engaged in the construction of these houses.  They admit that the facility carefully conceals all emerging flaws and defects.  For example, a deviation from the norms, uneven walls, frozen concrete.  Mostly low-skilled employees who receive small salaries, are constantly fined.  Hence the low quality.  In the reviews of the Sputnik residential complex, the builders themselves advise, before buying an apartment, to trace how it was built at all stages.  Pay attention to who works at the facility, how long the developer himself has been present on the market.  Only in this case you will save yourself from trouble. </p>
