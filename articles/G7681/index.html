There are many factors to consider.  There are very few acceptable options in the budget segment.  But we will tell you about one good solution.  It's about the Zanussi ZWS6100V washing machine.  We will review reviews about it in this material.  Like its specifications.  We start with the appearance of the machine.  And then let's move on to its other features. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bt.rozetka.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine zanussi zws6100v reviews" class="if uuid-3240419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240419.jpg"></div><h2>  Design and appearance </h2><p>  It is worth noting for starters that this washing machine is made in a classic style.  Front loading is used here.  That is why the car has a classic look.  A top-loading model would not look like this.  The car body is made in classic white color.  body lines are straight and strict.  At the top is the control panel.  In the middle is the program selector for washing.  There is a powder tray on the left side of it, and the necessary buttons for controlling the machine on the right.  There is no display.  But this is not so scary.  The main thing is that the Zanussi ZWS6100V washing machine, reviews of which we will consider a little later, is able to fit into any interior due to its strict design. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="youla.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="zanussi washing machine zws6100v specifications" class="if uuid-3240421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240421.jpg"></div><h2>  Dimensions and weight of the car </h2><p>  Now about the size of the machine.  It is worth noting that it is quite compact and narrow.  Therefore, it can easily fit even in the closest bathroom.  If you measure the car, you get these numbers: 60x38x85 centimeters.  This is one of the most compact washing machines in the budget segment.  It weighs, however, it is decent.  As many as 57 kilograms.  So installing it in a limited-sized bathroom alone will be very problematic.  Need some help.  It is worth noting that this washing machine is narrow.  Zanussi ZWS6100V can be perfectly placed even under the countertop in the kitchen and make it a built-in machine.  Such versatility only plays into the hands of the product and the manufacturer.  In general, the dimensions of the machine make it the number one candidate for purchase. </p><h2>  User reviews about the appearance of the machine </h2><p>  And now about what users think about the appearance of the built-in washing machine from Zanussi?  For the most part, everyone is happy that the device has a classic and austere appearance.  This makes it universal.  With this design, it can be installed even in the kitchen, at least in the hallway, at least in the bathroom.  Also, many are pleased with the very modest dimensions of the machine.  It fits in any bedside table in the kitchen and is easily covered with a countertop.  By the way, the upper part of the body is removed.  Which is also a plus.  The weight of the machine is also not very large.  Owners say that other devices of this type weigh much more.  And if desired, Zanussi can be dealt with without helpers.  Also, users say that the assembly is very high quality.  There are no backlashes, gaps and other signs of frank "China".  In general, users are satisfied with the appearance of the washing machine.  And this is good. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="mcgrp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine zanussi zws6100v instruction" class="if uuid-3240420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240420.jpg"></div><h2>  Washing machine specifications </h2><p>  We continue to consider the Zanussi ZWS6100V washing machine.  Features on the line.  This machine is equipped with a powerful engine that can accelerate the drum to 1000 rpm in spin mode.  This is pretty good.  Also in the car there is full protection against leaks.  There is also an option to control the level of foam and control imbalance.  But there is no adjustment of revolutions during the spin cycle.  And this is not entirely good, since this option is very useful when washing delicate fabrics.  Also there is no screen.  But this is not so critical.  But there is an intelligent electronic control in the Zanussi ZWS6100V washing machine.  A description of additional functions is provided in the instruction manual that comes with the kit.  Moreover, the description is quite detailed.  And set out well. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="narrow washing machine zanussi zws6100v" class="if uuid-3240422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240422.jpg"></div><h2>  A little bit about the instructions </h2><p>  Another key feature of the Zanussi ZWS6100V washing machine is the manual.  She is very reasonably written.  Firstly, there is a full-fledged Russian language without traces of a crooked machine translation.  Reading this document is very simple.  Secondly, the instruction is written in a simple and accessible language.  Everything is literally laid out on shelves.  Thirdly, the most difficult points in the instructions are illustrated.  Moreover, the pictures are of very good quality.  We can say that the guys from Zanussi took care of the user and did everything so that he would not look on the Internet for additional information about connecting this washing machine.  In general, quality instruction is a sign of a real brand that cares about its reputation.  It turns out that Zanussi is just such a brand.  However, we continue our review. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="built-in washing machine" class="if uuid-3240423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240423.jpg"></div><h2>  User reviews about the operation of the machine </h2><p>  Now let's talk about what users think about the operation of the Zanussi ZWS6100V washing machine.  Reviews on this subject are mixed.  There are both positive and negative.  But we must consider everything.  Let's start with the positive.  Most users claim that the machine works perfectly.  She manages to wash off even the most difficult contaminants.  And despite the fact that she does not have a special program for this.  Also, the owners are pleased that after spinning things are almost dry.  Ten minutes on the battery - and there is no trace of moisture.  Many owners also note ease of use.  And really, everything is extremely simple here.  Moreover, the menu is in Russian.  In general, users are satisfied with the quality of the work of this washing machine from the company "Zanussi". </p><p>  And now for the unpleasant.  There are also negative reviews.  And they are always there when it comes to a budget product.  Almost all owners of this washing machine claim that it is very noisy.  And it is especially felt during the spin cycle.  And if she also stands in the corridor, then in general it‚Äôs a disaster.  Also, the owners are not happy that when spinning and starting the centrifuge, the machine jumps quite noticeably.  With vibration isolation, she is not all right.  Also, users were upset by the lack of an option to select rpm during the spin cycle.  It is always standard 1000. But for some things it is very harmful.  And you can‚Äôt cancel the spin.  Only choose a washing program without it.  But then the risk is great that the machine does not remove all contaminants.  These are the disadvantages of this washing machine.  Of course, unpleasant.  But what did you expect for that kind of money? </p><div class="photo" data-original="abyhom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Washing machine zanussi zws6100v description" class="if uuid-3240424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3240424.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now to summarize.  We reviewed the Zanussi ZWS6100V washing machine.  User reviews about this product make it clear that it is not so bad.  Yes, there are some disadvantages.  But the washing machine copes with its direct responsibilities.  And this is the most important thing.  And the fact that there are no functions, then they should not be.  Take a look at the price tag.  For that kind of money, even having protection against leaks is already a luxury.  And she is here.  So if you need a high-quality and inexpensive automatic machine, then you can safely choose this particular model.  Disappointed will not stay. </p>
