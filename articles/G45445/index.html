Nowadays, she has many admirers, and many want to learn such an art. </p><h2>  What to work with </h2><p>  <span>Acrylic paints</span> for glass painting - what are they?  There are two main varieties: cover and stained glass.  The former, according to the name, cover the glass with an opaque layer, like ordinary gouache.  It‚Äôs easy even for a beginner to work with them; special skills are not required here.  They are usually water-based.  Because of what such a picture is very easy to scratch or even completely wash off.  Therefore, the finished work must be varnished (also acrylic and water-based).  After that, the figure will gain "longevity". </p><p>  Other acrylic paints, with the help of which stained glass painting of the bottle is performed, due to their transparency are able to create an amazing game of light shades.  It is much more difficult to work with them, it is advisable to have at least minimal experience in painting contours. </p>

    <h2>  What are stained glass paints </h2><p>  You should know that such paints are also sold in several varieties: </p><p>  - ordinary (it takes about a day to dry); </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - the so-called baked - these <span>stained glass colors</span> are heated in the oven to the desired temperature.  This is required for reliable image capture.  All technological details of the work are given in the attached instructions; </p><p>  - "sticking."  It is understood that they release them for children's creativity, but adults are happy to work with them.  The process is very exciting - the image is drawn on any smooth surface (for example, on a regular stationery file), dries and turns into a beautiful film with your drawing, which can be carefully removed and pasted anywhere. </p><p>  Where exactly?  On window glass, a mirror, a refrigerator, ceramic tiles, etc. These paintings seem to be very fragile and should be handled with care.  But in practice, a glued surface can even be washed with glass cleaner. </p><p>  Another plus of these colors is that a boring picture is easy to remove and re-paste somewhere.  In addition, such creativity can perfectly entertain both children and adults. </p>

    <h2>  What do we need for painting? </h2><p>  - Acrylic paints themselves, the same varnish for fixing (in jars - requiring application by brush, or in the form of an aerosol). </p><p>  - Brushes of different thicknesses. </p><p>  - Art contours for spectacular painting or stencils for painting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  - Cotton buds and toothpicks to correct the pattern. </p><p>  - A palette that will be replaced by a plastic disposable plate. </p><p>  The painted surface can be different: mirrors, any dishes, <span>decorative panels,</span> windows with New Year's drawings and even glass furniture.  In this small article, we will consider painting bottles with acrylic paints.  Yes, the most ordinary glass bottle! </p><h2>  Material preparation </h2><p>  Glass without all the excess requires only degreasing with alcohol or even the usual liquid, which is removed from the nails.  If the bottle you like is with a label, then, of course, you first need to get rid of it. </p><p>  Dip it in hot water for about fifteen or twenty minutes, remove traces of glue with a hard brush, cleaning powder or <span>sandpaper.</span>  Then dry - and the bottle is ready.  Remember that painting a bottle with acrylic paints can turn an ordinary object into a unique vase or an original gift item for any holiday. </p><p>  Then we select the image.  For beginners, drawing should not be too confusing.  Popular floral motifs, leaves, twigs.  On sale you can find a variety of stencils for painting.  Some of them are quite complex, while others are quite suitable for a novice artist. </p>

    <h2>  Transfer image </h2><p>  Painting a bottle with acrylic paints requires some artistic skills.  If you don‚Äôt have enough of them yet, it‚Äôs rather risky to transfer the drawing directly to the glass.  Good advice for beginners - try placing the picture under the glass and simply circle it!  And for convenience, you can even "stick" it with water. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you want to achieve the effect of stained glass, first make sure to draw a contour.  It will dry for an hour or two, then you can begin to decorate it. </p><p>  Perhaps the biggest difficulty here is the smooth drawing of the contour.  Painting bottles with acrylics requires extremely accurate work.  The pressure of the hand must be constantly monitored, which is not easy for a beginner.  Weak pressure will not give the desired effect - the paint simply will not leak out, if pressed too hard it will flow ‚Äúover the edge‚Äù. </p><p>  We have to correct irregularities with stored toothpicks and cotton swabs.  Well, if you do not set the goal to achieve the stained-glass window effect, then everything is much simpler - draw "to your liking", up to improvisation during the work. </p><h2>  Additional tips </h2><p>  Remember - acrylic paints are subject to rapid drying, so do not squeeze a lot from the tube at once.  The paint dried up during the work is refreshed by spraying with water. </p><p>  It is advisable to apply each of the colors not in one layer, but in several.  All must dry well.  The colors of this glass are unusually bright and expressive. </p><p>  Buying a lot of different colors is not worth it.  Enough basic colors - red, blue, yellow, green and, of course, black and white.  The number of shades that can be obtained on their basis by mixing is practically unlimited. </p>

    <h2>  And further </h2><p>  The "texture" will give the picture a regular foam sponge.  It is better to cover a large area (for example, a glass door) with paint from an aerosol can (the background is smooth and neat).  But its cost is higher. </p><p>  So that the brushes do not become ‚Äúdisposable‚Äù, rinse them thoroughly immediately after finishing work.  For any type of paint, use varnish for reliability. </p><p>  And most importantly - wait for inspiration, do not start work "on duty"! </p><h2>  Painted bottles contours </h2><p>  The bottle chosen for creativity should be of an elegant form - otherwise there will be no effect.  It is desirable - from transparent white glass.  And without any engraving with the designation of the manufacturer. </p><p>  So, we need to buy in the art store special contours for working with glass and ceramics.  Make sure they are sold with the nozzle (sometimes sold separately).  Nozzles have holes (about half a millimeter).  Of course, you can do without it, but using the nozzle will give the work a sophisticated and "professional" look. </p><p>  It would be nice to have loose holographic sparkles (for example, golden ones).  They are also used to create manicure, and the purchase can be made in the department of decorative cosmetics.  It is advisable to choose the smallest. </p><p>  In addition to the brushes, solvent, detergent mentioned above, prepare more <span>poster pens</span> and cotton wool. </p><p>  So, consider the technique of painting. </p>

    <h2>  Drawing contours </h2><p>  The bottle (washed, cleaned of labels and fat-free with alcohol) will be decorated with decorative curls.  You portray them in any form you like, which your fantasy will tell you. </p><p>  Using the white outline, draw the first curl on the bottle (the nozzle is not yet used, it will come in handy later).  The hole in the circuit will not allow you to get thin curls, but so far this is not required.  Greasy curls will "collect" more sparkles. </p><p>  Without waiting for the contour to dry (and it dries for about half an hour), gently sprinkle it with sparkles.  They should stick well to the fresh contour.  Part of the sparkles will inevitably be scattered around the contour, but now you do not need to remove them - you can lubricate the curl borders.  They are removed only after drying all the curls made sequentially in the same technique. </p><h2>  Practical advice </h2><p>  When you buy contours, you may be advised those that already contain sparkles.  But there they are already mixed with the main paint, so they will not shimmer and shine. </p><p>  Thus, the contour is better to choose without sparkles, and apply them in the process of work already from above. </p><p>  Little by little, the pattern will cover the whole bottle.  This will not happen too quickly - in several stages.  Indeed, in order to turn the bottle over and begin to paint its reverse side, you should wait for the final drying of the already treated surface. </p>

    <h2>  Apply paint </h2><p>  When the drawing is transferred to the glass completely and everything is dry, under the stream of running water, wash off unnecessary sparkles and carefully blot the product with a rag.  And only after that we begin to work with paints. </p><p>  Having collected paints on a brush, fill part of curls on a bottle.  Choose the color of paint according to your own taste - one or more.  It is better not to paint over all curls, because a monotonously painted bottle will not look spectacular. </p><p>  Apply paint as carefully as possible, evenly distributing on the surface.  Explicit smears should not be visible.  This process is also phased, with interruptions to complete drying. </p><h2>  Finishing touches </h2><p>  At the final stage, the nozzle on the circuit is just useful.  With its help, the finishing touches are applied, or rather the points.  They have to frame each curl around the edge.  Grace and extraordinary sophistication of the final result gives precisely <span>dot painting of</span> bottles, the stencil of which is selected taking into account the unity of the overall composition.  You will immediately see how the product will sparkle <span>with bright colors</span> and become "voluminous". </p><p>  Currently, acrylic painting is extremely popular, and it is precisely the dots that are a fashionable and advantageous option. </p><p>  In conclusion, I want to say that this beautiful kind of decorative art is gaining more and more fans from year to year.  The real masterpieces of applied art are being created.  And most importantly - their creators are ensured the joy of creativity and good mood! </p>
