The calculation of loops and rows is quite simple. </p><p>  The round knitting technique allows you to do a thing without a seam and with a smooth crown.  So the hat looks neat. </p><p>  You can make a <span>knitted fabric of</span> any density.  It is almost not deformed, comfortable to wear and care. </p><p>  There are many patterns and techniques that allow you to create fantasy models for any season and for every taste.  Funny children's hats and elegant women's hats are crocheted.  Therefore, crocheted hats are always popular. </p><p>  Here is a selection of models for beginners and experienced craftswomen: children's and women's hats for all seasons, a detailed description and fresh ideas. </p><h2>  Round hat for beginners </h2><div class="photo" data-original="madeit.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet hat" class="if uuid-2394139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2394139.jpg"></div><p>  Such a simple model is a real find for beginners.  Crocheting a hat of an adjacent, round shape begins with the crown.  To make the top of the cap smooth, you need to dial six air loops, lock them into a ring and knit with double crochets, evenly adding twelve loops in each row.  Get a circle of twelve wedges.  For crochet with crochet, six loops in each row must be added.  The circle will be divided into six parts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The diameter of the crown is calculated simply: head circumference / 3.14 (this is the number of Pi).  For simplicity, you can divide exactly three, the error is small.  The main thing to understand is that this is the optimal width of the product.  If you incorrectly calculate the diameter of the head, the cap will either not be worn or will slide into your eyes.  In this model, it is important that the thing neatly rests on the head.  When the crown is ready, you need to continue knitting without adding until the crown reaches the desired depth.  In the process, the product is tried on several times so as not to make a mistake with the size.  You can decorate a crocheted hat to your liking with any suitable accessories. </p><h2>  How to knit a hat without a seam </h2><p>  The junction of the rows with circular knitting forms a strip of large holes, with a noticeable slope to the right.  It is especially clearly visible on a smooth canvas, connected by columns with a crochet, as in the previous example.  Even in the tightest knit, the lifting air loops form a noticeable seam, giving the product an untidy look.  You can make the seam more accurate as follows.  At the beginning of each row, an additional column is tied from the base of the lifting air loops.  At the end of the row, the connecting air loop is tied into this additional column, and not into the lifting loops.  The seam will be smooth and without large holes. </p><p>  To ensure that there is no seam at all, use the method of "spiral knitting".  From the initial ring, the product is knitted in one continuous row, without lifting loops.  Additions are made according to the drawing.  It is very important not to lose count and not lose the beginning of the series.  Each turn should be marked with a pin or a special convenient lock, moving the marker from row to row.  To align the edge of the product, the last columns are knitted in decreasing order: with a crochet, a half-column and without a crochet.  As a result, on the back of the head, the crocheted hat will look as neat as in the front. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="madeit.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="round hat" class="if uuid-2394180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2394180.jpg"></div><h2>  Beanie hat </h2><p>  A popular accessory looks slightly sloppy and brings a touch of carefree into the image.  Beanie is versatile, comfortable and always modern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yarnspirations.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beanie hat" class="if uuid-2394162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2394162.jpg"></div><p>  This simple hat is crocheted with crochet columns just like the previous one.  Smooth crown of twelve sectors, tulle without additions.  For a free fit, 1-1.5 cm is added to the diameter of the crown. The highlight of the cap is the length of the crown.  In order to form a soft fold on the back of the head, the depth is increased by one and a half to two times. </p><h2>  For spring mood </h2><p>  For those who do not want to hide curls under the headgear, an open-top option is offered.  This crocheted hat for spring can be a charming touch to any look. </p><div class="photo" data-original="daisycottagedesigns.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="open top hat" class="if uuid-2394430" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2394430.jpg"></div><p>  For work 32 loops are typed.  Locking them in a ring you can not twist the chain.  The hat is knitted with a ‚Äúshell‚Äù pattern.  To the desired diameter of the crown, twelve loops in each row are added.  The tulle can be finished with several rows of single crochet so that the edge of the product does not stretch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The bow is knitted from contrasting yarn.  To give it rigidity, use a thread in two additions.  There are 25 air loops.  At the beginning and at the end of the second row, two loops are added.  They continue knitting round, not forgetting about symmetrical additions.  You should get a rectangle of 15 * 7 cm. It needs to be pulled together in the middle and sewn to the cap. </p><h2>  Cat girls </h2><div class="photo" data-original="persialou.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hat with ears" class="if uuid-2394745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2394745.jpg"></div><p>  For a funny knitted hat with ears (crochet), no pattern is required.  But you need to tie a small sample so as not to make a mistake with the size.  The pattern ‚Äúembossed stripes‚Äù is formed by alternating single crochet columns on the front side and lush facial columns on the wrong side.  Yarn is better to use lush.  The hat will keep in shape and will not slip into your eyes. </p><p>  To ‚Äúembossed stripes‚Äù turned out vertical, the knitted fabric is located horizontally.  A chain of air loops is dialed along the length corresponding to the depth of the cap.  A rectangle fits.  Its length is equal to the circumference of the head, and the width is the distance from the earlobe to the crown.  The short sides of the base are connected with a knitted seam or crochet.  To make the seam in the middle of the nape, the workpiece is straightened, the middle of the horizontal seam is fixed with a pin and the crown is connected.  The product is turned out.  Align the corners.  On the rim of the cap, knit several rows of single crochet columns.  A small border will fix the cap and give it a finished look. </p><p>  After trying on a hat, mark the lower edge of the ears.  Two diagonal seams are made on the front side, using the same yarn as for the hat.  The thread is slightly tightened to pick up the ears. </p><h2>  For hot summer days </h2><p>  You can crochet a hat for summer with a universal ‚Äúshell‚Äù pattern.  The top of the head is shown below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Seashells circular pattern" class="if uuid-2394629" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2394629.jpg"></div><p>  Tula fits in without adding.  The rim is left untreated.  ‚ÄúShells‚Äù form a rather decorative edge in an odd row.  It is easy to turn such a hat into a hat, continuing knitting with additions of twelve loops, as on the crown.  The width of the fields is determined by fitting.  The hat is decorated with flowers and ribbons, in accordance with the intended image.  To make the fields look neater, they should be starched.  The hat is knitted from jute or thick cotton.  For a hat, they choose yarn much softer and finer. </p><h2>  Little fashionistas </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="berry hat" class="if uuid-2395189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2395189.jpg"></div><p>  Crochet hat for girls knitted from blended yarn.  The crown is crocheted, the tulle is a ‚Äúshell‚Äù pattern.  On the neck, the back of the tulle is four rows longer.  Eyelet ties and decorative leaves are crocheted in columns.  Along the edge they are treated with finishing columns ‚ÄúCrab step‚Äù.  This is a series of single crochet stitches knitted in the opposite direction: from left to right. </p><h2>  Cap girl crochet: master class </h2><p>  The Luntik cap of the popular cartoon hero is made on the basis of a round adjacent model. </p><ul><li>  For a warm winter hat, mixed yarn was used: wool and acrylic.  The main yarn is lilac and three colors for decorative details. </li><li>  Work begins with a lining.  For greater softness, it is made of pure acrylic so that there is no discomfort from contact with the hair.  The crown is tied with columns with a twist of twelve wedges, the crown to the middle of the forehead, slightly shorter than necessary for the cap.  Ears are made by two triangles with the ‚ÄúShells‚Äù pattern.  The finished lining is taken into account when measuring for the main workpiece. </li><li>  The base is crocheted.  The canvas turned out smooth and dense. </li><li>  The crown is smooth of six wedges. </li><li>  Tula is connected in a spiral. </li><li>  The ears on the base are symmetrically tied with soft double crochets along with ties. </li><li>  The lining and the base are connected on the crown pointwise, along the rim - a continuous blind seam.  The lining does not protrude from under the caps, as it is noticeably shorter. </li><li>  All decorative details are connected separately and processed with a "crustacean step". </li><li>  Expressiveness to the eyes is given by light patches sewn by the third layer. </li><li>  Eight details were made for the ears: four purple and four pink.  The sides are connected using the ‚Äústep of the dog‚Äù.  The lower sides of the lilac are sewn to the cap, and the pink ones are curled inside.  Due to this, pink threads do not stick out in the connecting seam, and the whole structure is more elastic.  After contact with the hood, the ears straighten easily, and the hat does not lose its fresh appearance for a long time. </li><li>  Mouth and nose are embroidered with thick yarn. </li><li>  To achieve a resemblance to a hero, you need to repeatedly check the picture.  All parts must be properly placed and pinned.  Assembling is done manually with a fine thread. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="hat &quot;Luntik&quot;" class="if uuid-2395035" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2395035.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Summer panama </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="summer hat for girls" class="if uuid-2395413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2395413.jpg"></div><p>  According to this scheme, you can tie a nice openwork panama, which will protect the child‚Äôs head from the sun and will not allow her hair to tear.  For work, you can take mercerized cotton of any color.  Ready-made headgear will look better and get less dirty if it is starched. </p><h2>  Cap for boy </h2><p>  Work begins with a round, flat crown of twelve wedges connected by double crochets.  When you get a circle of the right size, in the back of the cap, the addition is stopped.  The front three wedges continue to add evenly.  Three to four rows can be knitted depending on the length of the visor.  In the next four rows they also uniformly make a reduction in the front wedges.  So the rim of the workpiece again will correspond to the girth of the head. </p><p>  The visor can be made soft or put inside the liner to give shape.  The part can be knitted separately or continued directly on the rim.  The number of loops corresponding to the front wedges is reduced to 30 in four rows.  They add it again so that the double part is symmetrical.  The visor is stitched at the base and sides.  With a hidden seam, it is attached to the tulle so that the cap does not tear apart during active games.  The rest of the rim is tied with two rows of single crochet for greater rigidity. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mooglyblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cap for boy" class="if uuid-2394957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2394957.jpg"></div><p>  If you knit this model of thin cotton threads, you get a great summer accessory. </p><h2>  Helmet for boy </h2><p>  Crochet children's hats for boys can be decorated no less spectacularly than for girls.  A simple adjacent model with a round top turns into an original design thing, if you add a couple of embossed details to it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.owlbarn.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="helmet for boy" class="if uuid-2394893" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2394893.jpg"></div><p>  The crest on the crown is a straight double rectangle.  To keep the part in the desired position, they begin to knit it directly from the cap.  To do this, from the forehead to the back of the head, make a mark with a contrasting thread.  Double crochet on both sides of it.  It is enough to knit three rows.  At the top, both sides of the ridge are connected.  If you want to make the comb taller, you can complement it with a plume of bright lush yarn. </p><p>  For a visor, a rhombus is tied.  Its short diagonal is equal to the distance from the nose to the chin.  The long diagonal is equal to the distance from the earlobe of one ear to the earlobe of the other.  Slots for buttons are tied at the sharp ends, with which the visor is attached to the temples.  The slots should be sized so that the part moves freely on the forehead and back. </p><p>  There are two ways to decorate a visor with black stripes of slots.  Immediately knitting the fabric with alternating gray and black rows, or embroidering with black thread on the finished part. </p><h2>  Patterns for original models </h2><p>  Beautiful crochet patterns for children's hats can be made of any yarn.  If the same pattern is knitted with lush wool, tightly spun acrylic or thin cotton thread, the result will be unpredictable each time. </p><p>  The pattern ‚Äúlush column‚Äù allows you to create volumetric textured knitting.  The accessory associated with it is suitable for inclement weather, as it will retain heat perfectly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="lush column" class="if uuid-2395008" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2395008.jpg"></div><p>  The ‚Äúflower‚Äù pattern forms a dense multilayer fabric, if you take thick yarn for work.  From a soft thread with the addition of silk, an elegant openwork will be obtained, especially if you use a larger hook than the thickness of the thread requires.  In this case, the canvas will not deform strongly.  This is especially important for children's things. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="flower pattern" class="if uuid-2395011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2395011.jpg"></div><p>  Another light but effective pattern is ‚ÄúFilet mesh‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="simple lace" class="if uuid-2395013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76608/2395013.jpg"></div><p>  Best of all, he will succeed from a thin <span>fancy yarn</span> with the addition of lurex, sequins or bugles.  A crocheted hat for a girl will look airy and tender. </p>
