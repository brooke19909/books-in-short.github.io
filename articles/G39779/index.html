Arriving in Kaliningrad, Holy Cross Cathedral must be visited first! </p>

    <h2>  The history of the architectural structure </h2><p>  The building plot was acquired by the Altstadt parish community back in 1913, but construction was not destined to begin that year, as the world plunged into World War I.  When it ended, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãerecting a temple again became relevant in the parish community.  Already in 1925 the project was ready, but for some reason it was not recognized.  Then the Berlin architect Arthur Kickton, famous in his circles, was offered to deal with this issue.  He agreed, and after a while presented a plan, according to which it was proposed to build not only the church building, but also houses for the priest and the community, directly adjacent to the main building. </p><p>  On June 15, 1930, the first stone was laid.  In 1933, in early May, the church was consecrated.  During the Second World War, like the whole of Kaliningrad, the Holy Cross Cathedral was damaged, but not very much - only the dome burned down.  When the war ended, the building began to be used for economic purposes.  There was a car repair shop and a factory for the production of experimental fishing gear.  The structure is constantly modified, rebuilding as you please.  As a result, the overlap simply could not stand it and collapsed.  So, already in the 80s of the last century the once beautiful, and by that time the church, already turned into ruins, was abandoned. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A few years later, the former Kreuzkirkha was transferred to the Orthodox community.  In 1991, the Holy Cross Exaltation was registered.  Then the new district of Oktyabrsky Island needed its own church, as it was far from all the others, which Kaliningrad was rich at that time.  Holy Cross Cathedral (rector at that time - Peter Berbenichuk) began to be restored.  And, it is worth saying, it was on the initiative of Archpriest Peter.  The reconstruction lasted 3 years.  The building was completely restored, after which, as expected, it was consecrated and opened for parishioners. </p>

    <h2>  Kaliningrad, Holy Cross Cathedral: architecture </h2><p>  The shape of the temple is a Greek cross.  The lining is made of decorative brick.  The cathedral was three-naved, and over the western facade towered 2 towers of the same size, crowned with domes.  They were connected by a gallery, under which there was a clock even during the time of the Germans. </p><p>  The main detail of this small complex can be called a fairly large niche portal.  Its surface is decorated with a panel on which a large cross is depicted. </p><p>  If we talk about the architectural style, the building most of all refers to the late modernism, which combines with elements of neoclassicism. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Interior of Holy Cross Cathedral in Kaliningrad </h2><p>  Erhst Feye, a German artist, was engaged in interior design.  The Holy Cross Cathedral (Kaliningrad), its interior, included stained-glass windows, the sketches for which were created by another specialist - Gerhard Eisenbletter.  The third artist was designing a font for baptism and special paraphernalia.  But all this (that is, pre-war decoration), of course, could not be restored.  Not because experts could not do this.  The restoration was simply taking into account the Orthodox canons. </p><p>  In the modern building, the main creation can be called the amber iconostasis.  In addition, it is worth paying attention to the image of the pelican - it symbolizes the sacrifice of the Christian faith. </p>
