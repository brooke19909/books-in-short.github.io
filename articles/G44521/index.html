Reviews about the rest on it, about travels, hotels and the kitchen, as well as what can be brought from there, will be the topic of our article.  Indeed, hundreds of thousands of tourists flock here every year to watch the cradle of the mysterious Minoan civilization, swim in the three seas and lie on the sand, watch the locals dance sirtaki, and also adopt their measured and unhurried rhythm of life.  Let's see what is most liked by those who were lucky enough to visit this island. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="35.240117" data-lng="24.809269099999938" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="7"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/6/2/1262.png"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  So, what do travelers primarily advise us on how to arrive in Crete?  In the reviews, you can read that most tourists arrive at the island’s largest hub - Nikos Kazantzakis Airport, in Heraklion.  It is here that the majority of aircraft from major cities of Russia arrive.  Both regular and charter flights fly to Heraklion, so tourists have a lot of choices, you can visit the island even out of season.  But when there are too many people, the airlines that take large groups on vacation send them to the second international airport - Chania.  Independent travelers who appreciate romance and experience prefer a different path to get to Crete.  In the reviews they write that it is much cheaper to fly to the capital of Greece - Athens.  And from there you can go to the <span>port of Piraeus.</span>  From it to Crete go a variety of ferries and voyages. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandleisure.com" data-author=": GARDEL Bertrand, " data-source="http://www.travelandleisure.com/trip-ideas/beach-vacations/how-to-travel-to-the-greek-islands#agia-peladia-crete-greece"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crete reviews" class="if uuid-2307158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2307158.jpg"></div><h2>  Areas </h2><p>  Each traveler has his own image of a perfect holiday.  Based on it, tourists settle in different areas of Crete.  There are four in total.  But in the central area of ​​Heraklion, travelers rarely stop to rest.  The main historical attractions of the island are located there, but access to the sea is not enough.  The most popular area of ​​Crete is Rethymnon.  There is simply no end to the tourists here, and most of the reviews they leave are about this “soul of Crete”.  This is not at all surprising.  Almost all the natural beauties of the island are concentrated in Rethymnon.  There are gorges, and picturesque cliffs, and caves, and beautiful beaches.  Photos of Crete in reviews of these places look like real postcards.  In the east of the island is the most expensive area - Lassithi.  Here, tourists will find the most luxurious hotels and resorts. </p><p>  And in the west spread Chania.  It is difficult to describe in a few words.  In Chania you will find archaeological museums in the open air, and ancient fortresses, and wonderful beaches, and mountain canyons.  In a word, this is Crete in miniature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.adelebeach.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Buses in Crete" class="if uuid-2307175" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2307175.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get around </h2><p>  If you do not have your own or rented car or at least a motorcycle, according to Crete in the reviews it is advised to travel by bus, and along the coast - by boat.  Public transport on the island is well developed.  In cities, buses are painted blue, and those that travel along Crete between different villages are green or beige.  All buses are modern, comfortable, with comfortable seats and air conditioning.  They walk quite often, and in front, on the windshield, there is usually a sign indicating the final destination.  But if you want to go to distant mountainous areas, be aware that flights there can only be two to three times a day.  Tickets can be bought from the conductor, but tourists are advised to purchase them at special ticket offices at bus stops - this is cheaper.  The fare depends on the distance the bus travels. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifeincrete.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.lifeincrete.com/tag/the-palace-of-knossos/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about sights of Crete" class="if uuid-2307181" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2307181.jpg"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Reviews of Crete would be incomplete without stories of what you can see here.  Its territory is small, but so much is concentrated on it that it is impossible to list: caves and temples, monasteries and fortresses, parks and picturesque bays.  Of course, the most visited and famous attraction of Crete is the Knossos Palace, where, according to Greek myths, there was the famous Labyrinth in which the Minotaur lived.  And indeed, in this multi-storey antique building there were about a thousand different halls.  From here, as they say, the empire of <span>King Minos</span> was controlled <span>.</span> </p><p>  In the east of Crete there is a Dikti cave where, as another myth says, the god Zeus was born.  A few tens of kilometers from Rethymnon you can see the oldest Christian monastery in Crete - Arkadi.  It was built in the fifth century.  It was repeatedly destroyed by the Turks.  But the islanders always restored this shrine, and it was she who became the center of the rebellion against the Ottoman yoke.  Near the city of Chania, tourists visiting the majestic Byzantine fortress Frangokastello.  Heraklion has the best archaeological museum in Greece.  And next to the capital of the island you can visit the house-museum of the famous master El Greco. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.suitqaisdiaries.com" data-author=": ADRIAN QAIS, " data-source="http://www.suitqaisdiaries.com/things-to-do-in-crete/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crete reviews" class="if uuid-2307248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2307248.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to sunbathe and swim </h2><p>  For many travelers, Crete is primarily associated with the beaches.  Reviews of tourists about them are not only enthusiastic, but also very diverse.  After all, the beaches on the island are probably several hundred.  Someone likes small bays, sheltered between the rocks, others just crazy about the huge cult beaches with foamy parties.  The north of Crete is the best suited for relaxing on the sea.  This part of the island is one huge beach, without any exaggeration.  The best reviews, of course, about the former pirate harbor - Elafonisi.  This place is famous for the azure color of the sea and unique pink sand.  In second and third place are “Balos” and “Vai”.  The last beach is surrounded by a date grove, and a few decades ago hippies liked to go here, like in Goa.  Elafonisi and Vai have a fully equipped coast.  Here you and umbrellas, and awnings, and deckchairs, and cabins, and taverns, and parking for cars.  But “Balos” is devoid of even signs of civilization.  And getting to it is quite difficult.  But here is the whitest sand and the cleanest sea - they say that it was in this place that the advertisement of the Bounty chocolate bar was shot.  Here is the most mystical corner of the island, which is called the “kiss of the three seas”. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.elizabethestateagency.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.elizabethestateagency.com/en/beaches/seitan_limania/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece crete reviews" class="if uuid-2307207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2307207.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to live </h2><p>  Now let's see what travelers leave reviews about Crete hotels.  From their point of view, the best hotels for vacationers are located in the north of the island.  But they are also the most expensive.  Here you will be offered pools and water parks, and a variety of services, and even the all-inclusive system, beloved by the Russians.  But if you want to relax on a budget or save money for sightseeing, it is better to choose guesthouses in the west or south. </p><p>  If you are "on wheels", you can even rent a small house in the mountains.  Cheap hotels in Crete are small, sometimes with only three to five rooms.  They are managed by one family, and the owners themselves prepare breakfast.  Most often it is he who is included in the price.  You can, of course, book half-board at any hotel, but tourists claim that for dinner you should choose a restaurant outside the hotel.  This is the only way you can truly experience the local delicacies.  The most popular hotels of Crete have four stars on the facade.  This is the “Grand Hotel Holiday Resort” in Khersonissos and “Candia Park Village” in <span>Agios Nikolaos.</span>  Of the “fives,” tourists most like the “Blue Palace” and “Aquila Elounda”. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sunshine.co.uk" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.sunshine.co.uk/hotels/Panorama_Hotel-68.html"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about Crete hotels" class="if uuid-2307219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2307219.jpg"></div><h2>  What travelers think about Cretan cuisine </h2><p>  As the saying goes, the country in which everything is is Greece.  Crete in reviews is often called the best gastronomic tourism destination.  Indeed, although Greek cuisine itself is very good, you will certainly be surprised on the island, whether you are a foodie or not.  Tourists like local sweets and desserts, pies, as well as numerous snacks from cold meats - meze.  There is also something like Cretan traditional fast food - Dacos.  This is a sandwich with a salad of special barley bread with garlic, basil, olives, tomatoes and sheep’s cheese.  And here the variant of Turkish pogachi is popular here, only the Cretans make this dish sweet and fill with custard.  Well, lamb barbecue ribs with a side dish of rice (psitos), as well as seafood, are perfectly prepared from the main dishes on the island.  As in any Greek tavern, in Crete you will be served small skewers on skewers - souvlaki, gyros (local version of shawarma).  But travelers unanimously call the lamb king - kleftiko - the king of dishes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bluepalace.gr" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.bluepalace.gr/weddings/en/search"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crete island reviews" class="if uuid-2307220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2307220.jpg"></div><h2>  What buy </h2><p>  As elsewhere in Greece, in Crete - the reviews in this completely coincide - you can buy an excellent fur coat.  No wonder the island, however, like the mainland, organize special tours for fur products.  Of course, it’s not worth coming here especially for shopping, but you can also take something interesting with you.

Everything is good here - sunbathing on the beaches and swimming in the sea, relaxing with a cheerful company of young people and sedate tourists with children.  But the most important thing is excursions.  This island is so beautiful that almost everything is asked for in the lens.  So say tourists in reviews of Crete.  They use photos of their travels as evidence.  Only those traveling by public transport should bear in mind that it is forbidden to eat in Cretan buses - you can only drink water.  This is due to the fact that there are many serpentine roads, and passengers can feel dizzy from the smell of food. </p>
