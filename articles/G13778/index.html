Despite its modest size, it has its own network of territorial offices in Russia.  The company's business is mainly aimed at attracting deposits from the population and issuing loans to corporate clients. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  A credit institution was registered for the first time in 1992 and received the name "Bastion".  It was originally created as a share-based bank.  Already in 1993, the form of ownership of a closed joint-stock company changed. </p>

    <p>  In 1996, the owners of the bank again changed its form of ownership and slightly corrected the name, now it has received the name Joint-Stock Social Bank "Bastion".  The bank worked under this brand until 2009, when the name changed again to Vkladbank.  However, this name was used for only about a year and in 2010 it was replaced by its modern name.  From that moment, a new round began in the development of the financial institution, and began to receive feedback from an ever-increasing number of customers. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  From the moment of its foundation until the beginning of 2014, the head office of the credit institution was located in Voronezh, but then it was decided to re-register Arksbank in Moscow.  From this moment, the credit institution from a regional has turned into a capital. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Despite its relatively small size, Arksbank operates not only in the capital, but also in cities such as Voronezh, Vologda, Belgorod, Chelyabinsk.  Previously, the branch network was somewhat wider. </p>

    <p>  The credit institution does not have its own ATM networks and terminals.  But since cards are not being issued, Arksbank does not receive bad reviews for this. </p><h2>  Performance and Rating </h2><p>  The relatively small Arksbank financial rating is also quite low and is in the third hundred Russian credit institutions.  However, some of its products are quite interesting.  ‚ÄúArksbank‚Äù recently offered deposits at fairly high interest rates, thanks to which it gained wide popularity among individuals. </p>
