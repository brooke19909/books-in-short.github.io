Both cities are located on the banks of the Volga.  However, in fact, you will have to overcome a longer path, which will take you at least five hours. </p><h2>  Distance between cities </h2><p>  The distance covered between Astrakhan and Volgograd depends on which vehicle you choose: </p><ul><li>  For the bus, as well as for the car, it will be 420 km. </li><li>  For the train - 450 km. </li></ul><p>  Going on a journey, it must be borne in mind that time in these Volga cities is counted out differently: Moscow is accepted <span>in Volgograd</span> , plus one hour in Astrakhan. </p><h2>  Bus ride <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Astrakhan Volgograd" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2206801.jpg"></div></h2><p>  <span>Buses run along the Volgograd-Astrakhan route</span> all day <span>.</span>  Transportation is carried out by several companies.  There are thirteen flights daily.  The passenger is left to choose the best option for himself, to purchase a ticket at the ticket office or on the official website and get on the bus. </p><p>  The first flight from Astrakhan leaves at six in the morning, the last at nine in the evening.  Arrival depends on the conditions of the carrier.  The fastest bus will deliver a passenger in 5 hours 15 minutes, there is also a long flight, it will take 8 hours 40 minutes to travel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The cost of a bus ticket Volgograd-Astrakhan ranges from 1062-1139 rubles. </p><h2>  On the boat </h2><p>  If you are not in a hurry and your trip from one city to another is more of a fact-finding or a tourist one, we recommend that you pay attention to the motor ships running along the Volga.  Astrakhan and Volgograd connect cruise routes of different durations.  The most popular cruise for four days and three nights.  During this trip, a person gets the opportunity to enjoy the views of the Volga, relax on a comfortable boat and enjoy the fresh air.

    <p>  The motor ships Dmitry Pozharsky and Alexander Nevsky set off for cruises.  The cost of the permit depends on the category of cabin and starts from 9600 rubles. </p><p>  If you choose a long cruise, then you can get from Astrakhan to Volgograd only after 10 days, having been at the same time in Perm, Kazan, Moscow, Yaroslavl, Rybinsk, Cheboksary, Novgorod and other cities located along the route.  The motor ships Caesar, Pavel Bazhov and Surgeon Razumovsky make long trips.  The ticket price depends on the availability of a bathroom in the cabin and its category, the minimum price is about 43 thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Such a trip will be remembered for a long time and will be a great alternative to a traditional beach vacation. </p><h2>  Travel by car </h2><p>  Departing from Astrakhan to Volgograd by car, you need to expect that you have to drive about 420 km, spending about 5.5-6 hours on it. </p><p>  There are several options for how to get from one city to another, both routes are laid along the banks of the Volga. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bus volgograd astrakhan" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2206809.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In the first case, you should leave Astrakhan on the left bank of the Volga and go to Volgograd along the R-22 road.  The distance will be 420 km, fuel consumption - about 35 liters.  The federal highway "Caspian" has almost the entire length of one lane in each direction and is actively used by motorists.  Therefore, a quick ride on the R-22 is almost impossible due to the dense traffic flow, especially freight. </p><p>  In the second case, you can leave Astrakhan for Volgograd on the right bank of the Volga along the road through Kharabali, Akhtubinsk, Znamensk and Leninsk.  With such a route, the distance between cities will be 460 km, approximately seven hours will have to be spent on the way.  You will have to spend only on gasoline, at the rate of 9 liters per 100 km, about 40 liters of fuel will be required.  The regional road, of course, loses in quality to the federal highway, which, moreover, has recently been put in order. </p><p>  Whatever route you choose from Astrakhan to Volgograd, the driver can be calm, as there are enough gas stations and cafes on any road. </p><h2>  By train <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Astrakhan Volgograd distance" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58159/2206793.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Railway tracks are laid along the right bank of the Volga.  If you take the train, you will have to travel 450 km between Astrakhan and Volgograd, which is about eight hours on the road. </p><p>  However, the 014 fast train passes this distance faster, in just 5.5 hours.  The train leaves Astrakhan at 16:30 and at ten o’clock in the evening it is already in Volgograd.  The cost of tickets in the compartment starts at 2389 rubles, while the seats will cost less - from 816 rubles.  This composition is sent daily. </p><p>  On even days, train 301 passes through Astrakhan, which goes from Grozny to Volgograd.  Landing in Astrakhan takes place at 21:05, then the train goes 10.5 hours to arrive at destination at 07:40.  A reserved seat ticket will cost 743 rubles, a coupe from 1572 rubles. </p><p>  There is another option to get from one Volga city to another - use the 369  Baku-Kharkov train passing through Astrakhan.  Departure from the Astrakhan station at 20:55, arrival at the Volgograd apron at 04:29. </p><h2>  Air traffic </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there are no direct flights from Astrakhan to Volgograd and vice versa; all flights require a change in Moscow.  This route is the most inconvenient and most expensive. </p>
