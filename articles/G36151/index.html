Island vacations cannot be classified as cheap.  Maldivian resorts for wealthy people.  Local hotels mainly have four and five stars.  In addition, it is worth considering a rather expensive flight to the capital Male, and then to one of the atolls.  All this makes tours more expensive compared to other beach and sea resorts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visualitineraries.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Garden Villas" class="if uuid-2585312" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2585312.jpg"></div><p>  Speaking about how much a ticket to the Maldives costs, you should focus on approximately the following prices: accommodation in a room on the island of Kuredu will cost an average of 117 thousand rubles (for seven nights), taking into account the flight, the amount increases to 200 thousand.  rubles. </p><h2>  Diving </h2><p>  Kuredu Island Resort &amp; Spa is of interest to diving enthusiasts.  Kuredu is one of the best diving spots in the Maldives.  There are a lot of interesting places: the outer spurs of the atoll, the underwater islands, and of course the rich underwater world. </p><p>  About 50 dive sites are scattered throughout the Laviyani Atoll.  Their number is regularly replenished with new places.  Near the atoll, 15 species of sharks were seen.  No less common are the rays that are regularly observed by divers.  Experienced instructors will help not only experienced people, but also teach the basics of beginners.  In addition, everyone can go snorkeling. </p><div class="photo" data-original="holidaycorp.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel pool" class="if uuid-2585317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2585317.jpg"></div><p>  Kuredu Island stretches in the ocean from east to west, and it is more expanded in the eastern part, and in the west the land is greatly narrowed.  The long south coast overlooks the Laviyani Atoll and has a gorgeous sandy beach.  But the north side is facing the ocean.  Here, beaches are rarer and protected by low walls. </p><p>  Kuredu is one of ten Maldivian islands that offer golf courses.  It may sound strange, but the Maldives is incredibly popular among Europeans because of golf.  Many from year to year come back here not only to relax, but also to play golf. </p><h2>  June weather conditions </h2><p>  Since the street is already the beginning of summer, tourists will be interested in what is the weather like in the Maldives in June?  At this time, the hulhang dominates the islands - this is the south-west wind, which brings precipitation.  But do not be upset if you plan a vacation in June, since the likelihood of showers is high only at night.  In the daytime, sunny and clear weather usually reigns.  The weather in the Maldives in June is good for those people who can not stand the heat.  A pleasant bonus for rest during this period will be more reasonable prices. </p><p>  In general, on the islands in June, the temperature reaches +31 degrees, and sometimes it reaches + 34. At night, you should not wait for coolness, usually at this time the temperature is +26 degrees.  Do not be afraid of the rainy season.  The sun in June is more active than in winter, so a stay on the beach should be metered and certainly in the shade.  And without a cream and a hat you just can not do here. </p><p>  The probability of precipitation in June, although high, but the showers are not long and end quickly.  The weather at the beginning of summer has one feature - it is humidity, which is inconvenient.  However, it is well tolerated due to regular winds.  Although residents from regions with a dry climate should still be careful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="holidaycorp.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water Villas" class="if uuid-2585318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2585318.jpg"></div><p>  Strong storms are possible in the first two weeks of the month, so swimming is not always possible.  The water temperature reaches +28 degrees, but swimming in a storm is not recommended - it is very dangerous, especially in the reef area.  Storms are temporary, so storms give way to clear weather. </p><p>  However, the Laviyani Atoll is one of those places in the Maldives where good rest is possible in June, as it is predicted there is a high probability of showers of only 6 days.  The water temperature in this case reaches +29 degrees, and the air - +31 degrees. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, it is worth paying attention to the reviews of tourists.  It is worth noting that travelers remain completely delighted with Kuredu and the Kuredu Island Resort 4 * service.  Each guest is expected to fly to Male.  Further, all tourists are transported by bus to the home airline terminal.  It takes the whole process no more than five minutes.  And then you have to wait for the flight of your seaplane, which will take you to the island itself.  The flight lasts 20-30 minutes, but at the same time it is incredibly exciting and impressive, because there is a beautiful ocean and atolls around.  Take-off and landing are very soft and do not cause inconvenience. </p><p>  Hotel Kuredu Island Resort 4 * (Maldives, Laviyani Atoll, Kuredu) is as beautiful as the island itself.  Despite the large selection of villas, tourists do not recommend choosing apartments on the west coast of Kuredu.  The fact is that it is not quite similar to the ideas about the Maldives.  Near the coast there are breakwaters, strong tides expose the rocky bottom and all this does not have a very beautiful appearance.  In addition, it is stronger than the wind.  But the east coast pleases with endless sandy beaches and stunning views. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hotelopia.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach vacation" class="if uuid-2585330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2585330.jpg"></div><p>  In general, all villas are good for living.  They have approximately the same equipment.  Some have a private pool.  On the island there are separate villas for honeymooners and romantic couples, which are located in some privacy.  Although no matter what bungalow you prefer, relaxation and silence are guaranteed. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  According to tourists, the food in the hotel is tasty and varied.  Of course, you should not wait for Turkish tables, in the Maldives they do not feed like that.  But in general, the food is quite high quality and tasty.  Themed days are often arranged.  Different food options are possible, but most tourists prefer all-inclusive or all-inclusive plus.  The latter concept includes drinks, but not all.  In the bars you can take any cocktails, beer and wine for free, as well as two bottles of water daily and the contents of the minibar.  But strong drinks still have to pay separately. </p><p>  The all-inclusive concept allows you to visit the restaurant for dinner for free.  The hotel has four main food establishments.  In each of them there is a children's table.  Drinks are available at any bar throughout the day. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  The hotel and the island leave a lasting impression in the hearts of holidaymakers.  After the flight, you will be met by attentive and helpful staff.  Girls who speak Russian are working at the reception, so there are no problems.  The hotel is characterized by European service.  The cleaning and cleanliness of the rooms on top.  No less friendly staff in bars and restaurants.  Everywhere guests are greeted with cordiality.  In general, Russian tourists are loved here. </p><p>  The territory of the hotel complex is clean and well maintained.  And the coast of the island is admirable and praised.  The wide beach is covered with stunning soft sand, which replaces the azure hue of the water.  Sometimes, entering the water, you can stumble upon shards of coral, but they do not cause inconvenience.  In the very south of the island there is a long sand spit that goes into the ocean.  This is an amazing sight.  Swimming on the coast is incredibly nice.  But without protective creams and natural clothing with long sleeves just can not do.  Inexperienced tourists on cloudy days overtake burns.  It only seems that the sun is hidden.  In fact, its rays are very active and achieve their goal.  This is always worth remembering. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kuredu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pool Villa" class="if uuid-2585333" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2585333.jpg"></div><p>  The island has ideal conditions for diving and snorkeling.  Local instructors instruct and take to the most interesting places.  Water activities and rides are expensive.  But it is quite possible to admire underwater beauties on your own, because in front of the beach there is a reef with incredible flora and fauna.  Here you can see turtles and sharks daily.  Tourists recommend taking fins and a mask with them, because renting them per day will cost you more than a thousand rubles. </p><p>  The hotel and the island is an ideal place for a paradise holiday.  No extraneous noise will bother you here.  Even during the high season, beaches are not crowded and this is the advantage of the Maldives.  Vacationers recommend a visit to the spa, classic massages and treatments will help to achieve real bliss. </p>
