    <p>  Impressions of relaxation are greatly enhanced through the prism of the quality service that 5 star hotels in Alanya provide.  It‚Äôs hard to make a mistake here.  As a rule, this level of accommodation guarantees the best vacation option: meals, rooms and leisure activities will retain memories for a long time. </p><h2>  Going on a long-awaited journey </h2><p>  The resort welcomes guests from late April to mid October.  This place - Alanya - is considered the warmest in Turkey.  You should take this fact into account and purchase a tour in mid-July, as the temperature at this time of the year rarely drops below 35 degrees Celsius.  It is worthwhile to protect yourself from such temperatures for children and older people. </p><p>  <span>5</span> star <span>hotels</span> in Alanya care about their reputation and organize a special entrance to the sea in the form of bulk sand or pontoon.  Since the beaches here are mostly pebble, you should be careful when entering the water, or better yet, buy inexpensive rubber slippers in the city, their cost is about five dollars. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  5 star hotels in Alanya </h2><p>  The center of this <span>resort</span> , famous among avid holiday lovers in <span>Turkey,</span> almost does not offer good, high-quality ‚Äúfives‚Äù, since they are all located in nearby villages, for example, in Avlassar, Inzekum, Konakli, Mahmutlar or Okurcalar. </p><p>  Connoisseurs of quality travel find their main advantages here in sandy beaches, narrow, but long and clean, with yellow sand.  Rocky capes and picturesque bays, active nightlife and affordable prices are a pleasant combination for lovers to have a good rest! </p><p>  Rich infrastructure is available for gourmets of relaxation, which <span>5 star hotels</span> in Alanya offer in different options: from compact and fashionable boutique hotels to huge Luxury-class complexes. </p><h2>  Number one </h2><p>  The list of ‚ÄúPopular 5-star Alanya Hotels‚Äù is headed by the Dolphin Botanik and Dolphin Botanic Platinum hotel complexes, which are located in close proximity to each other.  Often, it is they who receive the ‚ÄúAudience Award‚Äù from seasoned travelers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alanya 5 star hotels photos" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/699710.jpg" width="550"></div>  The first hotel was built in 1983, so it does not have the newest number of rooms.  However, he is loved because of the magnificent green territory, which covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãninety thousand square meters.  This is a unique place in Alanya, since only one hotel boasts such luxurious vegetation, the presence of which is a consequence of the age of the hotel complex.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The second hotel complex - ‚ÄúDolphin Botanic Platinum‚Äù was built in 2014, it pleases all its visitors with excellent spacious rooms and a huge water park.  However, it also has its drawbacks - a small and not very colorful area does not impress tourists. </p><h2>  Number two </h2><p>  The 5-star Hotels in Alanya list is continued by the Justiniano and Justiniano Club Park Conti holiday complexes in Okurcalar, which have long been loved by families.  They do not have a large territory for walking, but they are famous for excellent mini-clubs for children with many exciting, educational games and puzzles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Popular 5 star Alanya hotels" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/700656.jpg" width="600"></div>  The hotels have several colorful <span>water slides,</span> swimming pools and private beaches with free umbrellas from the sun, sun loungers with comfortable mattresses and huge towels.  The cost of living in the complexes "Justiniano" is relatively low - which is why they are not visited for 6 or 14 days, but immediately for three weeks.
