In addition to ancient history, it attracts many tourists with its mild, dry climate, constantly warm, sunny weather, an entertaining underwater world and, of course, sandy clean beaches. </p><p>  When the question arises of a place for an affordable and quality vacation, most tourists choose hotels in Egypt with a sandy entrance to the sea.  This is due to the fact that, despite the interest in underwater beauties, many are afraid to get wounded on corals, which the Red Sea is so famous for. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt Hotels with Sandy Sea Entrance" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29995/682810.jpg" width="600"></div>
