One of the three retail areas, it quickly overgrown with two-story buildings.  On the first floors were shops and shops, on the second - offices of merchants. </p><p>  The grain area differs from its contemporaries in that it survived not only a multiple change in appearance, but also a large number of renaming. </p><h2>  Theater Square Saratov </h2><p>  In 1815, a wooden theater was built on the southern edge of the vast territory of Khlebnaya Square, which gave the name to this part of it.  At the end of the 19th century, opposite the theater, the Radishchev Art Museum was opened.  And until the end of the century, the southern part was no longer built up with any structures.  But the rest ¬æ had a dense building with shopping malls, hotels, banks.  This part of the square was officially called Trading, but among the people it was called the Upper Market. </p><p>  After the building of the theater became small for the reception of everyone, and the new building built in its place, but also wooden, burned down, it was decided to build a large stone theater. </p><h2>  City Theater </h2><p>  The Saratov society appealed for the highest permission to use public money for the construction of a theater building.  It was allowed to spend 40 thousand rubles, as a result, the theater cost the city twice as much. </p><p>  Among those wishing to rent the theater, the city authorities chose the merchant Osip Shekhtel, the father of the future famous architect.  The first performance took place in the fall of 1865.  The authorities demanded from local and visiting troupes that on the stage not only dramatic performances, concerts and dance numbers be shown, but also operas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="2gis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Opera and Ballet Theatre" class="if uuid-3193518" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3193518.jpg"></div><p>  After the revolution, the theater on the Theater Square of Saratov became an opera.  His repertoire included the best works of opera and ballet.  The Drama Theater was opened in another room. </p><p>  In the middle of the 20th century, a major reconstruction of the building was made.  In fact, instead of an already dilapidated structure, a modern palace was built that meets all the requirements of that time.  A number of famous artists are known who at certain stages of their lives worked on the Saratov stage.  This is Vaclav Dvorzhetsky, Oleg Yankovsky, Evgeny Mironov and many others. </p><h2>  Museum named after A.N. Radishchev </h2><p>  In the second half of the 19th century, public museums began to appear in Russia, the purpose of which was to bring knowledge to the people.  In 1852, the Hermitage was opened in St. Petersburg, after 15 years Moscow followed suit, creating the Tretyakov Gallery.  Famous artist, professor, collector and grandson A.N.  Radishchev Alexei Petrovich Bogolyubov promised the Saratov authorities to bequeath his collection to the city, but subject to the construction of a large and convenient building for it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Radishchev Museum" class="if uuid-3193527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3193527.jpg"></div><p>  In the summer of 1885, at the Saratov Theater Square, the Radishchev Art Museum was opened, the third public museum in Russia and the first in the province. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Revolution Square, Theater Square </h2><p>  During the years of Soviet rule, the Upper Bazaar with all its buildings was demolished, and in its place a huge wasteland formed, which in 1920 was called the Square of the Revolution.  In front of the theater there was a mass grave of fighters of the Red Army;  the stone, surviving buildings of the malls began to be used for the needs of the city.  It housed various institutions, a printing house, a clothing factory.  In the seventies they built a new building of the research institute, a little later - the regional executive committee.  At the same time, a monument to V.I. Lenin was erected here, and the square began to fully comply with its name. </p><p>  During its beautification in the 50s, a small park was laid out, a monument was erected on the mass grave and the Eternal Flame was lit.  All city festive demonstrations and rallies took place on the Revolution Square, which established temporary stands. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.53218200000001" data-lng="46.03305380000006" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/6/9/4/16694.png"></div><p>  In 1991, the territory in the city center was again renamed the Theater Square of Saratov, the address of which is known to every Saratov citizen.  Guests can be guided by the fact that it is located between Moskovskaya Street, Radishchev and Gorky. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fotokto.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the chapel" class="if uuid-3193515" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3193515.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, the square remains the site of city holidays.  Mandatory parades in honor of Victory Day, mass events for the City Day, sports, concerts, are held here.  Seasonal fairs and New Year festivities are also held here.  At the end of the 20th century, Alexander Nevsky‚Äôs Chapel of the Life-Giving Spring was built on Theater Square in Saratov.  It is installed on the site of the eponymous, destroyed chapel, which was erected in 1866 in the health of Emperor Alexander. </p>
