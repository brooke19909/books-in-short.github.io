    <h2>  Storage of funds on the card is not always safe </h2><p>  In this regard, the amount of cash with which people go out is reduced.  After all, why is it needed if you can take a lightweight plastic card with you, which does not take up much space and is convenient to use? </p><p>  But not everything is as good as it seems at first glance.  From year to year, the number of scammers who steal plastic cards is increasing.  They came up with a lot of tricky schemes how to lure a payment instrument out of your hands.  So, if a person has lost a card (Sberbank), what to do in such a situation? </p>

    <h2>  First of all, pull yourself together </h2><p>  First of all, do not panic.  Very often there are times when the card was simply put in the wrong pocket or in another bag, jacket, jeans, etc. If you are at work, then remember whether you took it in the morning, whether you were at the ATM, used it or not . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But keep in mind that you do not have much time to think, because while you are thinking, someone may already be buying household appliances or other values ‚Äã‚Äãat your own expense. </p>

    <p>  If you nevertheless realized that the card was stolen, then immediately block it. </p><h2>  How can I block a card? </h2><p>  There are several ways to do this: </p><p>  - Call the hotline or a bank branch.  During the call, you can directly ask the question: ‚ÄúLost the card (Sberbank), what should I do?‚Äù  This method is the most convenient.  But in order to call the bank, you need his number.  Each plastic card contains a hotline number where you can call.  It is worth it to pre-record or save on your mobile phone to insure yourself.  To complete the card blocking operation, the operator may ask you for your <span>passport data</span> and the secret password for accessing the card.  It is always indicated in the contract for banking services, which is concluded when opening a card account with a bank. </p><p>  - Come to any bank branch.  If any branch of the bank is close to your location, then you can go there without calling and ask the same thing as during the call: "Lost your card (Sberbank), what should I do?"  You will immediately be asked to block it.  But in order to do this, you must have a passport or other documents identifying you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Do not forget to order a new one. </h2><p>  If you blocked your card, you can immediately order a new one through your operator or bank employee.  To carry out such an operation at a bank branch, you will need a passport.  And if by telephone, then you will not require any additional documents, but additional questions from the operator are possible. </p><p>  After the client has lost the <span>bank card of</span> Sberbank, you need to wait until it is issued.  In order to withdraw <span>funds</span> before handing a new card <span>,</span> you must have a passport with you and contact the bank branch.  Depending on the tariff at which you are serviced, the bank can perform such an operation with or without a commission.  This is very convenient if a person has lost the <span>salary card of</span> Sberbank. </p>

    <h2>  How to protect yourself? </h2><p>  In order to protect yourself, always observe the following rules: </p><p>  1. Never tell anyone your PIN code from the card.  Only you and no one else should know the access code for your card.  Bank employees never ask and do not have the right to know him. </p><p>  2. Do not store the pin code next to the plastic card.  A very common mistake people make is to store a <span>credit card</span> with a PIN code in their wallet.  If an attacker steals a wallet from you, then he will take possession of not only the card itself, but also unlimited access to its resources using your password. </p><p>  3. Periodically change the pin code.  Remember, in the life of each of us there are times when we have to go to an ATM with colleagues.  No matter how confident you are about the integrity of an employee, they can pick up a pin code if you are nearby.  In order to reduce the risk of money withdrawals by strangers, periodically change your password for access to the card.  Experts recommend at least once every 2-3 months, depending on the activity of using the card. </p><p>  4. Set limits for the removal or payment of goods at the point of sale.  This action will allow you to limit the damage that you may suffer in case of theft of the card.  You will always have the opportunity to increase limits or remove restrictions using a phone call to the bank. </p><h2>  Write a statement to the bank about the card theft </h2><p>  If the attackers who stole the card still managed to withdraw money from it, then write a written statement to the bank that you have stolen the card.  The bank may require you to write such a statement to the police.  Next, follow the instructions of the bank employees.  If you can prove that at the time of withdrawing money from the card you were not there, the bank will return these funds to you.  Typically, the operation to return such funds takes from one to three months. </p><p>  This is especially important when a customer has lost a Sberbank credit card.  Indeed, due to theft, you can get into debt. </p><p>  All this will help you answer the question: ‚ÄúSberbank serves my organization, has lost a card, where to call?‚Äù  Be careful and follow the tips in the article.  And remember that no advice can guarantee you the safety of your funds if you are inattentive and neglect your bank cards. </p>
