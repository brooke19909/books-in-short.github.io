  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to properly calibrate iPhone battery?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The problem with most modern gadgets is that they run out of battery too quickly.  Sometimes they can be turned off, although a sufficient charge level is displayed on the screen.  What to do in such a situation?  Is this a serious malfunction?  If the problem occurs with the new phone, then it is better to hand it over under warranty.  However, if it has already worked for 2-3 years, then it is worth trying to calibrate the battery. </p><p>  iPhone is the most popular brand, so let's look at how to rehabilitate such a smartphone, returning it the opportunity to work for a long time on a single charge and, importantly, without failures. </p><h2>  Calibration - what does it mean? </h2><p>  With the advent of touch gadgets, the word ‚Äúcalibration‚Äù sounds very often.  Many apply it only to screens, believing that it improves the touchscreen sensitivity setting.  And this is true, in some phones there is such an option.  But, in addition to the sensor, you can also calibrate the battery.  iPhone 5s, 6 and other models do not have such a function in the menu, so not all users know how to set up the battery (this will be discussed later). </p><p>  The essence of the calibration process is to reset the controller.  The latter is responsible for the operation of the battery, that is, it determines the minimum value of the charge and the maximum.  Over time, the capacity of the battery decreases.  Because of this, the controller may not work correctly - do not fully charge the battery or turn off the phone too soon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="msntechblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 5 battery calibration" class="if uuid-2599589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2599589.jpg"></div><h2>  When is calibration needed? </h2><p>  You can highlight the main signs that will make it clear that it's time to calibrate the battery of the iPhone 5, 5s and other modifications. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The phone began to run out quickly. </li><li>  A sharp change in charge level, for example, was 40%, and after a few minutes it became 20%. </li><li>  Turning off the device by 10-15%. </li><li>  The smartphone has not been used for more than three months. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.unlockboot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone battery calibration" class="if uuid-2599580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2599580.jpg"></div><h2>  IPhone Battery Calibration: Step-by-Step Description </h2><p>  Any user can handle battery calibration.  The algorithm is simple.  It consists in making two full cycles of charging and discharging. </p><p>  Step-by-step description of actions: </p><ul><li>  Discharge the smartphone.  It is necessary to use as many functions as possible in order to maximize the battery.  As soon as the device turns off, it should lie down for 5-10 minutes. </li><li>  The next step in calibrating your iPhone battery is to connect it to power.  For this, a charger and a current source with a constant maximum voltage are used.  The device itself does not include! </li><li>  Wait until the 100% icon appears on the screen.  After this, the phone with the connected charger should be left for another 1-2 hours.  After all, the controller may erroneously show the charge level. </li><li>  Now you need to turn off the charger. </li></ul><p>  This is the first step in calibrating the iPhone 6 battery and other models.  Next, you will need to repeat all the above steps again.  Discharge the gadget to the maximum until it turns off.  Then charge again to 100% and leave it to charge for another hour.  That's it, calibration is done.  Now the smartphone can be used as usual. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Important: when performing these steps, you can not recharge the phone! </p><div class="photo" data-original="seattlepuzzling.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 6 battery calibration" class="if uuid-2599592" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2599592.jpg"></div><h2>  How to care for the battery? </h2><p>  IPhone battery calibration must be done at least once every six months.  This will save the user from quick discharge.  But, in addition to this method, there are rules that will help ensure a long battery life. </p><ul><li>  The smartphone should only work in conditions of permissible temperatures.  Both supercooling and overheating can harm the battery. </li><li>  It is undesirable to constantly overexposure the device on charging if it already shows 100%.  It is also not recommended to fully discharge it. </li><li>  If no one will use the phone for a long time, then the battery should be 30-40% charged during storage. </li><li>  Use only original accessory (z / y). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.leawo.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iphone 5s battery calibration" class="if uuid-2599584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2599584.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Smartphones of the "apple" company have proven themselves only on the good side.  They hold a charge perfectly, especially in comparison with Chinese gadgets.  But over time, even expensive equipment can malfunction.  Therefore, if the iPhone 5 or 6 began to discharge quickly, then you need to calibrate the battery.  There are opponents of this method.  These people write that there is no point in realizing two full charge and discharge cycles.  But you can find many reviews in which users claim that after performing the calibration, the battery life of their phone has become the same as before.  Definitely worth a try.  It definitely won‚Äôt harm the smartphone. </p>
