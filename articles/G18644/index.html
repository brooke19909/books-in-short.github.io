Holidays for every taste and budget, well-developed infrastructure, unique attractions, amazing nature attract hundreds of thousands of guests to the island, kissed by the sun. </p><p>  No matter which city travelers visit, everywhere they will find a lot of interesting corners, which expands the possibilities of those who get tired of basking on snow-white beaches.  Fans of excursions in a paradise will definitely not be bored. </p><h2>  Natural miracle formed as a result of tectonic faults </h2><p>  One of the most curious natural monuments is the freshwater lake of Kurna, located in the western part of the island, in the Apokoronas area, near the village of the same name.  Surrounded by mountain peaks, Kournas Lake, once known as Korisya in honor of the revered Athena of Koresia, is of volcanic origin.  Many centuries ago there was a temple dedicated to the goddess, but after terrible earthquakes it was wiped off the face of the earth. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kurna lake coordinates" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1970596.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Mentioned in the VI century in the works of the philosopher Stefan of Byzantium, it is the largest in Crete among freshwater lakes of natural origin.  True, its size is small - the total area is about 1.5 km <sup>2</sup> .  The uniqueness of the reservoir lies in its depth (25 m with seasonal variations of two meters), which is below sea level.  Since ancient times, local residents who looked at it from above believed that the natural miracle was bottomless. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An important part of the country's ecosystem is daily filled with waters draining from the Lefka Ori mountain range and the Mati underground karst spring.  A stone bag at the bottom, formed as a result of tectonic faults, does not allow them to go to sea.  In the north and west of the lake, drainage channels have been erected to allow water to flow into the fields that the inhabitants process. </p><h2>  Two versions of the appearance of the name </h2><p>  It is believed that the Arabs who conquered Crete in the Middle Ages gave their name to the picturesque reservoir, calling it ‚Äúkurna‚Äù (translated as ‚Äúlake‚Äù).  However, some Greek scholars are sure that this is not so and the name comes from the word Œ∫œÅŒøœÖŒΩœåœÇ ("source). Having undergone significant metamorphoses, it was transformed into Kurna. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kurna lake kournas lake" class="if" height="291" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1970580.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Peaceful nature </h2><p>  The main attraction of Crete is amazing amazing scenery, which relaxes and pacifies.  No matter what time of year you come, Lake Kurna is equally beautiful, and even in winter you can enjoy the wonderful views of the majestic mountains covered with snow, reflected in the clear waters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kurna lake reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1970595.jpg" width="600"></div>

And only in the eastern part of the lake is a sandy beach, and in other places swimming is strictly prohibited. </p><h2>  Protected pond </h2><p>  Famous not only for its special beauty, but also for its rare fauna, Lake Kurna is under the protection of the European environmental program.  The purest water that can be drunk is filtered through karst rocks.  She likes freshwater turtles, living where people do not swim, and this place is fenced with buoys. </p><p>  There are a lot of eels and other fish that make "peeling" of the feet.  The service, which is popular in beauty salons, is available for free. </p><h2>  What to do on the lake? </h2><p>  Kurna Lake, the description of which is presented in the article, is a favorite vacation spot for foreign guests.  An equipped beach with sun loungers and umbrellas, changing cabins awaits them.  The variety of catamarans swaying on the waves is amazing.  They are presented in several modifications: two- and four-seater, stylized as retro cars and designs with a slide, from where it is so nice to slide into warm water.  Some ships have a canopy that protects from sunlight.  Many tourists go away from people's eyes to be alone with each other and swim freely, because near the shore it is difficult to do this because of the large number of vacationers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kurna lake kurna description" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1970583.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The lake is surrounded by dense vegetation that creates natural shading.  Under the emerald shrubs are tourists, breathing in the wonderful smell coming from plants.  Fragrant tree sap attracts <span>cicadas singing</span> together in the heat. </p><p>  The surroundings of the popular natural monument are amazingly beautiful.  Hiking routes are laid here for outdoor enthusiasts, and everyone can rent a boat or a catamaran and ride on the transparent surface of Lake Kurna, rushing away from the noisy beach.  The cost of one hour is about 15 euros, but 60 minutes pass unnoticed, and it is best to take a ship for a longer period. </p><p>  No matter where the tourist looks, everything has a relaxed rest and pacification.  Amazing photos are obtained here, emphasizing the unique beauty of this place.  After bathing and exciting walks along the lake, I really want to have a bite to eat, and the nearby cafes and taverns with views of the main pearl of Crete will reduce your appetite and quench your thirst.  Delicious Greek cuisine seems incredibly delicious in the fresh air. </p><h2>  Qurna Lake (Crete): how to get there? </h2><p>  The natural miracle that is very popular with Russian tourists is located between the two resorts of the island - Rethymnon and Chania, and from the last path to the lake is much shorter. </p><p>  You will have to go to a paradise in a rented car, since city transport does not stop nearby.  How to get to Lake Kurna on your own?  The easiest way to do this is for those tourists who rest in the west of the island.  You will have to go east on the E75 highway, and after 40 kilometers a small town Georgioupoli will appear, next to which there is a tourist attraction.  Coordinates of Lake Kournas for GPS - N 35 ¬∞ 19'936, E 24 ¬∞ 16'757. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kurna lake how to get" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1970606.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There will be a crossroads, and after leaving the highway, you need to follow the signs on which Greek and English inscriptions are often duplicated in Russian.  The main guideline is a green train.  As soon as you see him, know that the attraction is already nearby.  The car must be parked on the side of the road, and go down to the pond on foot. </p><h2>  Qurna Lake Travel Reviews </h2><p>  Some vacationers from Russia, who have already visited the Volga, Yenisei, Baikal or Amur, admit that they were disappointed to see a small body of water that they had heard so much about.  It does not cause violent emotions, like other tourists from other countries.  In addition, the disadvantages of the beach located next to the lake include its crowded nature, so lovers of solitude go to another place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kurna lake crete" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1970612.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is very interesting to look at a landmark from above.  It is from this position that the sharp contrast of the colors of transparent water is surprising: at the very shore, it acquires a gentle azure hue, and closer to the middle - saturated blue.  It depends on two types of freshwater algae that grow at different depths, so the palette changes depending on the location of the sun. </p><p>  Of course, you can endlessly look at Lake Kournas (Crete), but it is best to swim in it.  As some tourists say, after salty sea water, freshwater seems heavy, while others, on the contrary, sing praises, finding it very pleasant. </p><h2>  What else vacationers tell </h2><p>  Vacationers admit that the coast is strewn with sharp pebbles, and it is best to stock up in advance with special slippers for swimming, in which it will be comfortable to walk along the beach. </p><p>  Many believe in the paranormal occurring on the lake.  Locals stir interest by talking about electromagnetic fields that have accumulated in the water.  Impressive people feel a headache, a breakdown, and those who are far from prejudice feel a surge of energy and are filled only with positive emotions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kurna lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1970613.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As experienced travelers say, the best time to visit Kournas lake is August, when the water level drops, exposing the white sand on the beach.  True, as practice shows, this is sludge that can suck, therefore, mandatory monitoring of children is necessary. </p>
