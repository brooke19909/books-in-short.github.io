For three years, artists worked here: Garikov, Molteninov, Kabachek, Kotik, Kutuzov, Savostyanov and Seleznev.  It was they who created this documentary-artistic canvas. </p><h2>  Developers </h2><p>  The diorama <span>"Breakthrough of the blockade of</span> Leningrad" in Kirovsk was decorated with an objective plan created by a team of mock-ups, the head of which was Zaitsev.  The authors are not only talented people, but also courageous participants in the hostilities that took place in this city. </p>

    <p>  The diorama "Breakthrough of the Siege of Leningrad" inspired the famous poet <span>Dudin Mikhail</span> to devote a poem to the creators who organized this place.  There he expresses his impressions of the memory that stirred in his soul, writes about wartime and how well this work of art reflects it.  Here you can see broken trenches, <span>the Neva River,</span> and infantry sent into battle. </p><p>  It is these spectacles such as the Museum-Diorama ‚ÄúBreakthrough of the Siege of Leningrad‚Äù that make it possible to forget the deeds of veterans and to respect them.  The photos give an approximate idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe scope of this project. </p><h2>  Theme </h2><p>  The main semantic load of the work is to reflect the events that occurred during the action under the name "Spark".  The diorama "Breakthrough of the blockade of Leningrad" reflects one of the most important moments that took place during the struggle under the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The canvas has several plans.  This picturesque picture has large dimensions, thanks to which it was possible to paint everything that happened in the fierce battles in January 1943. </p><p>  The diorama "Breakthrough of the blockade of Leningrad" shows the battle during which the two sides dealt mutual blows.  The task was to defeat a group of fascists who came from Germany.  The troops were commanded by Lieutenant General Govorov and General Meretskov.  The coordination of mutual work took place with the help of the actions of General Zhukov and Marshal Voroshilov. </p>

    <h2>  Space and scale </h2><p>  If you go up to the observation deck, you will be able to see the panorama of the ledge, the depth of which is more than 16 km.  Once here, you will feel that you were in the heat of a battle that occupied the Neva coast on the right.  It was here that at the time of January 1943 the Russian army appeared. </p><p>  The left side of the project is decorated with images of events that took place during the first hours of the struggle.  These are preparatory operations and a march of the orchestra next to the divisions of shooters that belonged to echelon number one.  Then there are flames in the battle for the rescue of Shlisselburg.  Defenders from the Nut building are connected to the fight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Majestic paintings </h2><p>  In the center you will find the Neva Force and the village of Maryino.  This is the third day of the fighting.  Two crews of tankers then had to cross the pond, using fortifications made of wood and ice.  Here is the Ladoga bridge.  Now, just to the left of it is a museum.  On the right is an offensive on the second workers' camp.  Here the rifle division reflects the forces of contract soldiers.  From the Nevsky Piglet, which later went down in history, attempts are being made to attack the 8th state district power station. </p><p>  In the background of the exposition there are strike groups that entered the battle on January 18 in 1943.  It was at this moment that the blockade was broken. </p><p>  After liberation, railway tracks and a bridge across the Neva were laid here.  The people called this place ‚Äúthe road of Victory,‚Äù which made it possible to build up power to conquer the land from the Nazis. </p>

    <h2>  Exclusivity </h2><p>  This work of art was the first of its kind in the city and was unique because it reflects what happened in as many as seven fights.  Enormous space involved. </p><p>  The depth of the composition gives you the opportunity to see with your own eyes everything that happened here.  You seem to be there and becoming part of the event.  In the course of their work, a group of mock-ups tried hard to make the relief look natural.  There are pits from bombs and funnels from shells.  Buildings of engineers are executed in their present height. </p><p>  Before the museum was created, diligent research was carried out, archives were studied.  To restore the picture, we needed data gleaned from photographs and movies.  In addition, interviews were conducted with veterans who were direct participants in the action.  Historian consultants helped a lot. </p><h2>  When and how can I get here? </h2><p>  The diorama ‚ÄúBreakthrough of the blockade of Leningrad‚Äù may become an extremely interesting place to visit.  The operating mode is as follows: you can come any day except Monday (day off) from 11:00 to 18:00.  In autumn and winter, the functioning of the monument is somewhat limited.  Closing is carried out at 17:00. </p>
