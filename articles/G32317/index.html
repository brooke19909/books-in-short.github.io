So, it's time to create shoes for the child in which he will feel easy and comfortable.  Self-made booties are perfect if your house has cold floors.  Most often, young mothers who are familiar with needlework techniques create shoes for children with their own hands.  In addition, the network has many different video lessons on making the first shoes for a child.  There is also a scheme of the sole for <span>crocheted booties.</span>  Well, if you‚Äôve never done knitting before, don‚Äôt be upset.  The following is a detailed description of the work, based on which, everyone can make booties for the child with their own hands.  In addition, this article contains a knitting scheme that tells you the sequence of work. </p><h2>  Determine the size of future booties </h2><p>  Before starting knitting, it is necessary to measure the child‚Äôs leg in order to further determine the number of loops. From these loops, the sole for booties will be crocheted, a diagram of which can be borrowed from any currently available source.  To find out the size of the child‚Äôs legs is quite simple.  Using a ruler or a centimeter tape, measure the distance from the middle of the heel to the longest toe of the baby.  The number of centimeters obtained as a result will be the size from which the knitting of the sole begins. </p><h2>  We choose tools and materials for crochet soles </h2><p>  First you need to decide on the threads from which you will <span>knit</span> baby <span>booties</span> .  The yarn should be pleasant to the touch, so that the first steps of the kid do not cause him discomfort.  As a rule, for knitting children's things, children's acrylic is taken without adding wool.  Such yarn is not only pleasant to the touch, but also does not cause an allergic reaction in the baby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, you will need a crochet hook.  There are hooks of different numbers.  The hook number indicates the diameter of the <span>knitting tool</span> in millimeters.  To work with children's acrylic, you need a hook number 2.5 or 3. With this tool you will be comfortable to knit.  but remember: the larger the number of the hook, the lower the knitting density as a result.  Scissors are also useful for you to cut the working thread after finishing work.  There are no specific wishes.  Take those that are convenient to work with. </p><h2>  Schematic notation </h2><p>  At first glance, it may seem that you have a set of dots and crosses.  But do not be alarmed, this is how the crochet pattern of the sole of the booties should look like.  Here, the air loops are indicated by a black dot, and the double crochets look like a cross with a stick obliquely.  You just need to count and then knit the number of elements indicated in the diagram.  But remember that the number of loops and columns shown in the diagram will be correct only if the size of the child‚Äôs legs and the type of thread match the ones indicated in the source.  In other cases, the required amount will have to be calculated independently.  It is also necessary to know that the connecting column in the diagram is indicated either by a handle above the lifting loop, or by a colored dot.  How to knit one or another of the elements that make up the crochet sole of the sole, we will consider a little below. </p><h2>  Knitting elements: how to knit air loops and crochets? </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen know how to knit air loops and double crochets.  But what if you are just starting to do needlework and still don‚Äôt know anything about it?  It doesn‚Äôt matter, in this article we will look at how crochet elements are made. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  So, any knitting begins with a set of rope from air loops.  At the end of the working thread, it is necessary to make a knot with a loop in such a way that, if desired, it can be dissolved by pulling a short length of the working thread.  Take the working thread in your left hand and wrap it once around your index finger.  Grab the thread with the fingers of your left hand, pulling it slightly.  Now pass the hook under the thread on the outside of the index finger and grab the thread from the skein with the hook.  Remove the resulting knot from the finger and tighten it. </p><p>  The first loop is ready.  We begin the set of the number of air loops necessary for the sole.  Put the thread on the index finger, hold it with the other three fingers, pulling it slightly. Hold the knot with the index and big fingers.  Now hook the thread and drag it through the loop.  Repeat the set as many times as necessary.  Do not forget to knit three more loops for lifting knitting. </p><h2>  Single crochet </h2><p>  A matching crochet sole outsole pattern may imply single crochet stitches.  Therefore, now we will analyze the process of knitting them. </p>

Now in the second loop we pass the hook, grab the working thread and bring the loop.  On the hook we now have two loops.

    <p>  Secure the three lifting loops to the main chain.  To do this, insert the hook and loop into the fourth loop, using the left index finger, put the working thread on the hook.  You have three loops formed on the hook.  Grab the working thread and thread it through the loop and crochet on the hook.  Now pry the thread again and pull it through the remaining two loops.  It is necessary to repeat the whole process as many times as how many crochet columns you have counted in the diagram. </p><h2>  Knitting density </h2><p>  We pass directly to the knitting itself.  But first, with threads that are designed for booties, you need to knit a trial pattern.  This will help you calculate the right amount of air loops.  Do not forget to add three more to the resulting number of air loops.  These three birds will begin to knit and replace one double crochet.  Depending on the thickness of the threads in one centimeter, 2-3 air loops can fit.  Knitting a trial pattern will help beginner needlewomen not only determine the number of loops from which knitting will begin.  In addition, during the knitting process there will be an opportunity to get acquainted with knitting techniques and practice knitting loops and posts. </p><h2>  How to tie a sole for booties? </h2><p>  So, we learned how to knit air loops and double crochets, decided on the density of knitting and calculated the required number of loops, which we need to dial.  Now we need a crochet sole for the booties and some free time. </p>

    <p>  Suppose the size of your baby‚Äôs legs is 11 cm. So, in the end, you should get a sole for booties of exactly this size.  If you are new to knitting and doubt yourself, the sole for crocheted booties (11 cm pattern and the exact number of loops) can be found on the Internet. </p><p>  We start knitting.  By hook number 2.5, we collect a chain of 13 air loops.  Do not forget to add three more loops for lifting.  Now in the fourth loop of the chain we knit a crochet column.  Knit another 12 double crochet stitches.  We got to knitting a heel.  Nothing complicated here.  Just in the air loop you will now knit not one, but five double crochets.  On the other hand, you also tie the base chain with double crochet.  From the side of the sock, it is necessary to knit four more loops into the air loop of the base.  Now finish the row with a <span>connecting column.</span>  To do this, insert the hook into the third lifting loop, hook the working thread and hook it through the loop that remains on the hook.  The first row of soles is ready.  We start knitting the next row.  Again, we pick up three hoist air loops and knit the double crochet into the column of the previous row.  On the heel, you knit five loops.  Find the three double crochets in the center.  Be careful here, as you need to knit two double crochet into a double crochet of the previous row.  Next, we knit the sole without changes until we get to the toe.  In the sock, we also knit three central columns, doubling them.  We end the row with a connecting column. </p><p>  Although you have calculated the required number of loops, try on the sole for reliability.  Just put the knitting on the baby‚Äôs leg and see what you get.  You may need to knit another row with single crochet.  On the heel and toe, knit two columns in the column of the previous row almost everywhere.  Discard only the extreme columns of doubling, they need to be knitted one at a time. </p><p>  You managed to crochet the sole for booties, the scheme step by step became your adviser in this matter.  It is time to knit the booties body itself.  In addition, now you know how to tie the sole for your child‚Äôs first shoe. </p><h2>  Choosing a model of booties </h2><p>  It is important to choose a model of booties.  Although there may be many variations of knitting, the scheme of the sole for crocheted booties in most cases is the same.  But then you need to carefully study the pattern and description of knitting.  That is why such a sole of booties should be crocheted, the scheme, the description of which is attached in the master class. </p><p>  Depending on whether you have a boy or a girl, the model of booties should be different. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet sole for booties" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43684/1376502.jpg" width="584"></div>  For a girl, you can knit booties from improvised materials and decorate them with crocheted flower or bow.  You can also sew a satin ribbon in tone booties.  There can be many options, it all depends on your imagination.  But if you are the boy‚Äôs mother, it will be more difficult to determine the model of booties here.
