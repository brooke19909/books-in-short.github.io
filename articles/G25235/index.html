Surprisingly, this model, according to customers, is considered the undisputed winner in the budget line.  Its stylish design and ease of use brought the gadget to the lead.  It is worth noting: even experts believe that price and quality are optimally correlated in the model. </p><p>  The direct competitor of the device from Meizu is Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. It also has a large touch screen.  Many position these devices as the most expensive.  However, Meizu leads due to its wide functionality and proprietary ‚Äúchips‚Äù, which include, for example, an operating system of its own design, a hardware button and other points. </p><p>  The popularity of this device adds a nice price.  The price of the device varies within 150 dollars.  In reviews, users often say that after getting acquainted with the characteristics of the gadget, a feeling of lowered cost appears.  So, let's check the accuracy of this statement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone meizu m3 note" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2008288.jpg" width="515"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The Meizu M3 Note phone, frankly, is very similar to the iPhone 6. Buyers have not been surprised at this for a long time, since this company is a copycat for apple products.  However, it is worth noting that she produces gadgets of rather high quality.  There were reviews on the network that many users preferred Meizu, although they had the opportunity to purchase a device from Apple. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At first glance, the case creates a feeling of reliability.  This is easily explained, since a special <span>aluminum-magnesium alloy</span> was used for it <span>.</span>  Plastic is also present, but it is used with small inserts on the bottom and top.  This is because metal is capable of interfering with the operation of antennas.  As for the color, they are slightly different from the metal surface, literally half a ton.  However, this cannot be considered a critical flaw, as it is not striking.  But if you still experience discomfort, you can always buy a cover on the Meizu M3 Note, which will hide the plastic inserts.  In addition to aesthetic value, it will perfectly cope with protective functions.  Everyone understands that the phone in the case is less susceptible to mechanical stress, so it retains its original appearance for a long time. </p><p>  Ergonomics is an important criterion that you pay attention to when choosing a smartphone.  This is especially important for those devices that are quite large.  Given that the M3 Note is equipped with a 5.5-inch display, you should not dream of compact dimensions.  Its physical dimensions are 153.6 √ó 75.5 √ó 8.2 mm.  Weight can be attributed to the average.  The device without a cover will be delayed by 163 g. However, this does not affect the usability at all.  Even with a solid size, the phone lies very well in the hand, practically does not slip.  Also, streamlined faces of the case indicate well-chosen ergonomics.  The rounded corners of the M3 Note give a distinctive elegance.  Touching the case gives you a pleasant feeling.  The back cover is non-marking, so do not worry that fingerprints will constantly accumulate on it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The lineup contains three colors: stylish gold (Gold), delicate silver (Silver), manly dark gray (Space Gray).  In light versions, the front panel is decorated in white, and in dark - in black. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu m3 note 32gb" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2008289.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Controls and Connectors </h2><p>  The Meizu M3 Note phone is equipped with all the necessary interfaces.  The microUSB format connector is located at the bottom end exactly in the center.  Here, however, with a shift to the right, you can see the hole for stereo speakers.  Closer to the left side is a talking microphone.  The mini-jack connector is on the opposite end.  According to users, such a solution is the most successful, since nothing interferes with listening to music when headphones are connected. </p><p>  Mechanical control keys are located only on the right side face.  Here, in principle, everything is pretty typical, as for any smartphone.  The manufacturer brought out a convenient lock button, and a little higher than its ‚Äúrocker‚Äù volume.  The left side edge served as a place for installing a special tray.  It is used for nano SIM cards and external microSD media.  The device catches 4G perfectly.  However, it should be borne in mind that support for next-generation networks can be chosen only for one slot, while the second will work in 2G standard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The most beautiful side of the phone is the front panel.  It is important to pay attention to the fact that you can purchase such a cover on the Meizu M3 Note, which will not hide it.  In addition to the beautiful large screen, there are a proximity sensor, lighting, front camera and notification indicator.  Near these elements is the earpiece.  Under the screen, the user will see a multifunctional control panel.  It has a special key, which is both touch and mechanical at the same time.  "Why is it so complicated?"  - you ask.  Because it is in this button that a scanner is installed that reads the fingerprint. </p><p>  On the back side are functional elements arranged in a standard way.  There is a two-position flash of the LED type, the main camera lens, which is located in the center.  The manufacturer also presented its stylized logo on the back cover.  An indisputable advantage is that the camera lens is slightly recessed into the body, so if you use a case, it will not be scratched on a hard surface. </p>

    <h2>  A few words about the screen </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the Meizu M3 Note phone is equipped with a large touch screen.  Its size is 5.5 inches.  The manufacturer did not save on the manufacture of the display.  The user will enjoy the LTPS matrix.  Maximum screen capabilities allow you to display a picture in Full HD quality.  By the way, let‚Äôs pay attention to one point: this type of matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmost often used in more expensive gadgets.  That is why <span>Meizu smartphones</span> are considered high-tech. </p><p>  In order to understand how high-quality this display is, it is necessary to refer to customer reviews.  You can find information in them that the brightness level allows you to comfortably interact with the device both in complete darkness and in the bright sun.  The setting is automatic.  There are no comments on her, as she works instantly.  In this criterion, the M3 Note model can compete with high-end branded smartphones.  Impressive user and viewing angles.  They are as wide as possible, almost close to 180 degrees.  With a strong slope, the contrast level changes completely slightly. </p><p>  The benefits also include the sensor.  It has a clear and fast response.  Reacts even when pressed with fabric gloves.  For users who type a large number of texts or play modern games, the multitouch option will be useful.  This model supports up to 10 touches. </p><p>  In order to protect the screen, the manufacturer used Dinotrail glass.  Its properties allow you not to worry about the formation of scratches, chips and other injuries.  Also in this model, <span>an oleophobic coating is used,</span> which prevents the accumulation of dirt on the screen and the appearance of glare. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="case on meizu m3 note" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2008291.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Communication </h2><p>  All users have long been accustomed to the fact that modern mobile devices are a kind of compact computer.  However, do not forget that the first appointment is still making calls.  Let's see how communication is implemented in Meizu M3 Note.  Specifications provided by the manufacturer indicate that the device supports 4G standard.  Currently, this criterion plays an important role for most users.  The SIM card is inserted in a special tray.  You can combine them in two ways.  If the user needs to install an external drive, then he will have to sacrifice one card of a mobile operator. </p><p>  As for the direct reception of the signal, this model boasts average performance.  However, in defense, we say that almost all modern smartphones work at the same level.  During a conversation with a subscriber, the speech sounds legible, no interference. </p><p>  Navigation capabilities in this model are implemented quite well.  Many phone owners use as a compass or navigator. </p><h2>  Camera Features </h2><p>  What modern user does not like to be photographed?  Manufacturers of digital gadgets have done everything possible to facilitate this process.  The M3 Note model has two modules.  The first, which is located on the front panel, has a resolution of 5 megapixels.  According to users, selfies are of decent quality.  Sometimes small gaps and digital noise may appear in improperly selected lighting.  You can record movies in 1080p format with this camera. </p><p>  What are the <span>characteristics of the</span> main camera in the <span>Meizu M3 Note</span> ?  It is based on a 13-megapixel matrix.  The lens is based on five wide-angle lenses.  The quality of the photos is excellent.  The shooting process is facilitated by the presence of a dual-band flash and phase detection autofocus.  If you need to edit photos, you can use the application settings.  In it, the developer provided all the necessary parameters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone meizu m3 note" class="if" height="258" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2008292.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hardware "stuffing" </h2><p>  I did not let Meizu M3 Note 32Gb and the processor.  This model is based on the chipset of the MediaTek trademark - Helio P10.  Based on 8 computing modules.  They work in pairs: 4 √ó 4.  The clock frequency in the first case reaches 1800 MHz, in the second - 1000 MHz.  The only drawback is the graphics accelerator brand Mali.  However, even with this, the level of performance of this smartphone cannot be called weak.  The interface is smooth.  Modern "heavy" games run quickly.  There are no problems even with demanding applications. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  This phone model works on Android 5.1.  On top of the operating system, a proprietary Flyme shell version 5.1.3 is installed.  Many buyers really like the interface.  Setting up the Meizu M3 Note is straightforward.  Application icons are located on desktops.  The curtain practically did not change its appearance compared to Flyme 4. The only thing you need to pay attention to is the lack of the usual menu bar.  In this model, the developers replaced it with a "carousel."  However, this has its advantages.  For example, in one motion you can clear all programs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone meizu m3 note Price" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2008294.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Two versions are available for sale to the buyer.  "Younger" is equipped with two gigabytes of "OS" and storage for 16 GB of internal memory.  If the user does not plan to install a memory card, it must be understood that such a volume for full work may not be enough.  In this case, it is recommended to purchase Meizu M3 Note 32Gb.  This version has a high level of performance, as the developers installed 3 GB of RAM.  Storage for downloading applications and other software has a capacity of 32 GB.  It is this version that will maximize the use of all the available potential of this device. </p><h2>  Meizu M3 Note: battery </h2><p>  What other criterion is considered important when choosing a smartphone?  Of course, the characteristics of the battery.  In this regard, the manufacturer did not disappoint buyers.  He installed a battery with a capacity of 4100 milliamps per hour.  Her resource is enough: </p><ul><li>  for 10 hours in video mode; </li><li>  for 5 hours spent in games; </li><li>  at 18 h reading electronic books. </li></ul><p>  Phone Meizu M3 Note in mixed mode is able to function up to 48 hours.  This is clearly respectful.  However, you need to understand the more functions that are involved, the more battery life will be reduced.  For example, if you connect to 4G, then a 100 percent charge will last about 14 hours. </p><h2>  Consider reviews </h2><p>  The early majority of users were distrustful of products from the Middle Kingdom.  After the release of the Meizu and Xiaomi line, the opinion has changed dramatically.  Model M3 Note receives only praise.  They talk about a great display, excellent camera resolution, a high level of performance, a beautiful, albeit copied, design.  The benefits of this gadget can be listed endlessly.  In any case, this device is considered to be of high quality.  Even if some kind of breakdown suddenly occurs, the repair of the Meizu M3 Note will be inexpensive.  Spare parts are available in almost all service centers, as this model is popular. </p><p>  The owners practically did not find any cons.  If you find fault, you can pay attention to the weak graphics accelerator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="setup meizu m3 note" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2008295.jpg" width="549"></div>

In 2016, a modification with 2 GB of RAM and 16 gigabytes of integrated memory cost about $ 150.  The ‚Äúolder‚Äù model could be purchased at about $ 20 more.  Which one to choose from them, each user will be able to decide individually, guided by their needs. </p>
