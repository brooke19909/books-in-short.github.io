In the III millennium BC  on the territory between <span>the Tigris</span> and Euphrates the foundations of the Babylonian civilization were laid. </p><p>  The people of the interfluve created a unique and unique culture, the basis of which was cuneiform writing.  The highest point in the development of writing dates back to the reign of King Nebuchadnezzar. </p><p>  Ancient Babylon is one of the wonders of the world, whose symbol was the powerful walls lined with enameled bricks, the <span>hanging gardens of</span> Babylon, the beloved of Nebuchadnezzar, and many others.  Residents of the city were proud of their ability to protect their buildings from moisture.  Bitumen was used for this purpose - an incredible achievement in the field of construction at that time.  Moreover, to protect Babylon, five miles from the city, a wall was built a hundred feet high and twenty feet thick, which ran from the shores of Euphrates to the Tigris.  The weakest points within the state were protected by fortresses.  Another common occurrence was the construction of bridges that connected both parts of the city. </p><p>  The history of ancient Babylon testifies that its inhabitants attached great importance to stellar predictions and deified forces of nature.  Individual stars formed into groups and formed constellations such as Gemini, Aquarius (controlling, in their opinion, the course of all the waters on Earth), Sagittarius represented himself as an ally during hostilities and a defender in difficult times, Taurus caused particular concern, because, in their view, had the ability to destroy entire cities.  Interestingly, the coronation process gave the ruler only the opportunity to rule, but did not make him God.  Also, the king could be reduced to the state of an ordinary person.  But one could find salvation by doing exceptionally good and just deeds, venerating the gods or supporting the temples.  Thus, the king was in the status of a subject in relation to nature. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ancient Babylon is the birthplace of such a science as astrology.  Thanks to the efforts of astrologers, the firmament was divided into twelve signs, as well as monitoring the movement of stars.  Scientists suggest that the Babylonians already used a telescope in those days, as evidenced by their find in the form of a lens. </p><p>  Astrology is not the only science whose achievements ancient scientists have boasted.  In mathematics, they achieved no less success.  During geological excavations, tablets were found indicating the knowledge of the Pythagorean theorem by the Babylonians.  It was its inhabitants who used to build the famous building - the city gate in blue.  Their decoration was the images of <span>sacred animals,</span> which were considered companions of the gods. </p><p>  The construction of each new structure was preceded by a religious ceremony, which was attached great importance.  As a precious offering to the gods, beer and cream were poured onto the cornerstone, and divine clay figurines with a metal bar in their hands were placed on top.  He was a symbol of power.  The end of the ritual was the sacrifice of a sheep. </p><p>  If we talk about the architecture of the city, then it was composed mainly of brick one-story and two-story buildings.  Ancient Babylon is a city with a well-thought out and clear layout, the streets of which, as a rule, intersect at right angles.  Not only the residents, but the ruler himself was proud of the achievements in the field of construction, which made it possible to feel protected from external attacks, given the level of development of the arms business. </p><p>  But ancient Babylon did not withstand the onslaught of the enemy and crumbled from within.  The heir to Nebuchadnezzar was overthrown by his close associates.  So, the predictions of the Bible began to come true, in which it was said that Babylon will turn into a pile of ruins, its location will become a desert and there will be no life in it - neither for humans nor animals. </p>
