    <h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  Overlooking the bay, there is a multi-storey residential complex ‚ÄúLiner‚Äù.  His address: st.  Pirogov in the city of Cheboksary.  This place was not chosen by chance.  Its history begins in 2007, when it was decided to develop a neighborhood on the embankment, Moscow architects were entrusted with the design.  Specialists did not let us down - LCD "Liner" (Cheboksary is justly proud of it) turned out to be a proud ship. </p><p>  But the 2008 crisis stalled construction, the freezing of which lasted for almost 5 years.  In 2013, developers and designers moved things off the ground and construction began on the embankment. </p>

    <p>  LCD "Liner" decorates Cheboksary, he completes the picture of the neighborhood on the waterfront.  In appearance, it is elegant and modern; during its construction, the latest energy-saving technologies were used and the slightest nuances of the surrounding landscape were taken into account. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The whole building was built as a single complex, block sections with different floors: 12-18 floors.  It is made in the form of an arc.  Outside, the house is lined with light porcelain.  For the convenience of seeing the surrounding beauties, it is equipped with panoramic balconies and terraces, covered with <span>stained glass.</span> </p><p>  The resemblance to the <span>ocean liner is</span> only enhanced by the promenade located along the house, resembling a deck in width. </p><p>  As in many modern buildings, the lower floor is planned non-residential, under the placement of shops, offices.  So with the LCD "Liner".  Cheboksary is a big city, and there are many organizations offering their services in the field of trade and public services that could occupy new premises. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  As mentioned above, as a rule, in large cities are located in places with well-developed infrastructure of the new building.  Cheboksary is no exception.  This is the situation with the residential complex under consideration.  It is located almost in the center of LCD "Liner".  Cheboksary have a developed transport system, so working residents of the complex can get to their work anywhere in the city on any type of transport: public or private.  The lack of industrial facilities in the center contributes to a more favorable environmental background. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The residential complex surrounded itself with a walking area wide enough so that almost all of its residents could walk on it in the evening and on weekends.  Walking along it, they at the same time enjoy beautiful views of the bay, inhale clean air and admire the panoramas of the city.  Little residents can play on the house playground, built on the inside of the complex. </p><p>  Owners of their own cars can not worry about the safety of their property, since currently most of the <span>new buildings in Cheboksary</span> are already with parking lots.  Not an exception and "Liner".  Its developers, to the delight of car enthusiasts, have provided a two-level underground car park.  You can not only place a car on it, but also use a garage or storage room.  For convenience, parking access is created directly from the entrance hall of the house. </p><p>  The first floor of the building is non-residential.  The premises are located various cafes, shops, offices, pharmacies and a fitness center.  Also at the service of residents is the entire infrastructure of the city.  Children can study at nearby schools and attend kindergartens. </p><h2>  Flats </h2><p>  Apartments of various sizes are offered by the LCD ‚ÄúLiner‚Äù (Cheboksary).  The layout of the apartments also depends on its location in the block section, the footage and the number of rooms.  So, on one floor accommodation is provided for up to five apartments.  The complex can accommodate residents in both one-room and other types of apartments, up to four-room ones.  Currently, not all developers offer this opportunity, most of them focusing on small families.  The smallest apartment is forty-five meters.  And the largest area reaches one hundred thirty-five meters. </p>
