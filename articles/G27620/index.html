Almost half of it in the entire history of existence has gone under water and, unfortunately, there are now many relating to the 4th century.  Attractions of Nessebar.

It can be divided into two parts: the Old and the New City.  Old Nessebar is a very tiny territory located on a small peninsula, only 800 m long and 300 m wide.  It is connected with the land by a narrow isthmus, through which light, water, food and, of course, tourists are fascinated by the surrounding beauty. </p><p>  Imagine that only a little more than 1000 inhabitants live here!  And since the city has the status of a museum city, each of them, in fact, is its employee, preserving the sights of Nessebar for posterity.  Photos of the inhabitants of this amazing place and its ancient buildings we offer you in this article. </p><p>  The town is filled with restaurants, souvenir shops, it also has a colorful market where you can buy leather, fur, silver and clay products.  All this is a subject of constant enthusiasm of tourists, but the peculiar architecture of this center of history is especially interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of nessebar photo" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/474798.jpg" width="400"></div>

Once Nessebar was called Balkan Jerusalem, because in this small city there were more than 50 churches.  Now, unfortunately, only a fifth of them remains. </p><p>  The greatest impression on tourists makes the Cathedral of St. Stephen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of nessebar reviews" class="if" height="266" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/474801.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  <span>St. Stephen's Cathedral</span> in Nessebar </h2><p>  Most of this cathedral, often called the New Metropolis, was reconstructed in the 16th century, and the oldest (eastern) part of the building was preserved from the 11th century!  Almost completely decorated from the inside with breathtaking 16th-century murals depicting the life of the Virgin Mary and various saints, the cathedral will not leave anyone indifferent.  As evidenced by many admiring reviews.  Particular attention should be paid to the magnificent carved iconostasis, preserved from the late 16th century. </p><p>  Due to the special value of this historical heritage, the church is not functioning now, it has been turned into a museum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria city of Nessebar attractions" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/474802.jpg" width="400"></div>

Bulgaria, like the whole world, considers this church the pearl of the city.  During its construction, a brick was used in combination with a decorative stone, which is why this building has a particularly "lace", "openwork" look.  The combination of the facade decorated in Turkish style with Christian canons in the general appearance of the church is also striking. </p><p>  Now in this building housed a small collection of works by local artists. </p><h2>  Church of the Holy Virgin </h2><p>  This church is the only one operating, its gilded dome can be seen from afar.  It was built in the late 19th century.  (which is not an age for such an ancient city), but, nevertheless, it can safely replenish the sights of Nessebar. </p>

    <p>  Bulgaria highly appreciates its miraculous <span>icon of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary</span> or, in a different way, the "Black" icon.  She is considered the keeper of the ancient city, and this is no accident. </p><p>  The fact is that not so long ago this icon was stolen.  All Nessebar, and the whole country were shocked by such sacrilege!  And a wave of misfortunes swept through the city: in the shortest time, 25 young people died in car accidents!  For the tiny Nessebar, this is a huge number.  Misfortunes ceased as soon as the icon was returned. </p><h2>  Archaeological Museum in Nessebar </h2><p>  As you have probably already seen, the whole old Nessebar is an <span>open-air museum.</span>  But it also has what needs to be stored under the roof.  To do this, in 1994, an archaeological museum was opened on Messembria Street, which is also included in the list of "Sights of Nessebar".  Reviews of his exposition are full of enthusiasm for tourists who have touched history. </p>

    <h2>  Architectural attractions of Nessebar (Bulgaria) </h2><p>  The architecture of the residential buildings of Old Nessebar is also a monument.  The style of the so-called Bulgarian Renaissance, which is characterized by high foundations made of white stone, used in antiquity as wine cellars with dark wooden upper floors, protruding bay windows and decorated with large wide windows, can bewitch anyone.  As a rule, in the interiors of these houses the walls are bleached, and the ceilings are dark, wooden. </p><p>  Walking past these houses tightly pressed against each other along the cobbled streets is almost the same as taking a trip in a time machine. </p><p>  More details about the life of the inhabitants of Nessebar can be found in the local Ethnographic Museum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nessebar - a living story" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/474808.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  A little more about the sights </h2><p>  The addresses of the sights of Nessebar can be a long list.  Why are the church of St. John Aliturgetos (14th century) standing?  This uninitiated church has its own tragic love story told by guides.  Or the Church of the Ascension of Christ (16th century), half dug into the ground at the request of the Turkish authorities, so as not to be higher than a Muslim warrior sitting on a horse.  Or dated 5th century.  the remains of the Basilica of the Blessed Virgin Mary. </p><p>  All these are places that cannot be missed, but how many have not yet been named!  One thing can be said - Nessebar, like a magic box filled with jewelry.  They can be endlessly viewed and admired.  And everyone here will find their own, amazing and unique, that will make you return to this oasis of history many, many times, becoming a loyal fan of the small cozy Bulgarian city of Nessebar. </p>
