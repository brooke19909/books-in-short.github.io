This is a small but very friendly, hospitable, clean and comfortable country.  It is worth noting that in Belarus at the government level, great importance is given to both environmental and physical cleanliness.  Residents of megalopolises, more or less large cities, arriving in the Republic of Belarus, as a rule, are very much surprised at the cleanliness of the streets, settlements, even the smallest, the capital of the country - the city of Minsk, regional centers.  At the same time, this is the norm for local residents. </p><p>  Contrary to the prevailing opinion, a vacation in Belarus can be very exciting, and most importantly, useful.  Naturally, lovers of lying around simply on the beach under the sun should choose other directions, but for those who want to actively and usefully spend time, this small country will be 100% suitable. </p>

    <p>  Agritourism </p><p>  The last decade is again beginning to gain popularity, especially among residents of megacities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg, agritourism.  By the way, this type of leisure is cultivated in Belarus as the main type of tourism business in the country, therefore it is developed in Sineoka (as the country's inhabitants themselves call Belarus) at the highest level, especially since the <span>natural conditions</span> and national traditions contribute to this fully.  Last-minute tours to Belarus will not leave indifferent any family member.  As practice shows, the owners of the farmstead provide all the little things that provide comfort and interest for all family members.  Men can go fishing, the abundance of lakes and rivers allows you to do this.  Some farms may offer their customers <span>hunting for a hare,</span> duck or wild boar, even moose.  Women who grew up in cities are always enthusiastic about picking mushrooms and berries.  Blueberries, lingonberries, cranberries are always plentiful in local forests.  In farmsteads there is always an opportunity for children to chat with pets, ride a horse, see how a cow is milked, feed the chickens.  This always delights the kids. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  What can I see </p><p>  But people who get hot trips to Belarus are not limited only to nature.  The country has a huge number of historical places of interest not only to specialists, but also to connoisseurs of antiquity, which is worth only one famous <span>Mir Castle.</span>  Local travel agencies have developed entire routes to such places with excursions, both one-day and multi-day, for example, a weekend. </p><p>  Holidays in Belarus will not be complete without a visit to the capital of the country - the city of Minsk.  This is a small city by world standards (about 1 million inhabitants) has its own attractions, which are mandatory included in last-minute tours to Belarus - this, of course, the National Library, made in the form of a diamond, and the Ice Palace.  The latter is recognized by many experts as the best hockey arena in Europe. </p>

    <p>  Prices </p><p>  In the current crisis <span>times, rest</span> in Belarus can be a great alternative abroad.  The prices here are simply ridiculous for the average Russian citizen.  Moreover, last-minute trips to Belarus, even for a long time, for example, to a sanatorium, will practically not affect the family budget, believe me, as a rule, enough vacation pay.  Speaking of sanatoriums, the level of service and living conditions, as well as the quality of the medical services provided, will delight even the most demanding customers. </p><p>  In general, rest in Belarus is a convenient, inexpensive, comfortable, and most importantly, a very informative option for spending a weekend or vacation. </p>
