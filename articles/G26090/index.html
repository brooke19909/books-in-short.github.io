It will not work if you decide to simply restart the device.  Any printer strips, sooner or later such an error will occur.  Nevertheless, this does not mean that he has come to an end and he needs to collect money for a new device.  Most often, the problem is solved simply. </p><p>  However, let's not get too far ahead.  First you need to understand the reasons why the printer can start printing in stripes, and after that we will consider ways to eliminate such a defect. </p><h2>  Your inkjet has started to print in stripes. </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="printer check" class="if uuid-2545589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2545589.jpg"></div><p>  What could be the reasons that the printer strips: </p><ul><li>  One or more cartridges have almost run out of ink. </li><li>  Due to the fact that the printer was not used for a long time, ink began to form clots inside the print head. </li><li>  Air has entered the print head. </li><li>  The cartridges partially blocked the air hole. </li><li>  An ink loop was pinched. </li><li>  The head or cable was broken. </li><li>  Sensor elements or tapes were broken or have dirt (these are the devices that position the printing system on a sheet). </li></ul><h2>  What can be done to fix the problem? </h2><p>  First, make sure your ink cartridges are full of ink.  If their level falls below the minimum, then simply refuel them or replace with new ones.  In order to determine the amount of ink in the cartridge, simply run the utility for managing your printer and select the ‚ÄúCheck Level‚Äù mode.  You can also find this option using the control panel directly on the device.  The result will be displayed on your display. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you have a <span>printer with CISS</span> streaks <span>,</span> carefully inspect the dye bottle.  If you are convinced that they are enough for printing, you can proceed to further actions. </p><p>  Next, it is worth inspecting the ink ribbon of the CISS so that it is not pinched.  Inspect the filters for the air holes: it often happens that due to ink, they can‚Äôt let air through freely. </p><p>  If you have not used your printer for a long time, then the problem is most likely that the heads are dry, the holes through which the ink passes were clogged with ink.  There are models of printing devices for which a long period of non-use is several days, but for most devices this period is from 1 to 3 weeks. </p><h2>  The device itself will help </h2><p>  Modern printers and MFPs have the function of self-cleaning the print head.  The cleaning function is available using a proprietary utility or through the instrument control panel. </p><p>  For example, in the HP device management and settings program, it will be called ‚ÄúCleaning the print cartridge,‚Äù Epson called this function ‚ÄúCleaning the print head.‚Äù  First you can check the nozzles: if they were clogged, then you can determine this by the received print. </p><p>  The cleaning process can be repeated three times in a row.  An hour or two after its completion, the device will be completely ready for operation. </p><h2>  The decision is in your hands </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="why does the printer strip" class="if uuid-2545560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2545560.jpg"></div><p>  To clean the nozzles of dried ink clots, most modern printers have a special pump.  It is worth noting that it is not available in budget versions, so the above methods are completely impossible for them.  If you have a cheap printer model, you can also use radical methods, such as rinsing and soaking the head in a solution with a cleaning fluid, or printing using a cleaning fluid that was poured into an ink tank.  To use the first method, the head must certainly be removable or be built into the cartridge. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The process of soaking is that you immerse the part in a slightly heated cleaning liquid and leave it for three days.  Carefully ensure that the solution does not dry out, it evaporates very quickly, and does not come into contact with the contacts of the electronic components of the devices, otherwise they will corrode.  As soon as the clots of paint are soaked, gently rinse them, dispensing fluid with a syringe. </p><p>  Rinsing and soaking slightly reduce the life of the print head.  Most often, she is not able to withstand more than three such procedures, so try not to allow severe drying out.  As a preventive measure, once every 2 weeks just start the printer, because during power-up the device cleans nozzles on its own, preparing them for work.  It is worth noting that the cheapest devices with a simple inclusion will not be enough.  With them you will have to do a test print to protect the device from breakage. </p><h2>  Expensive repairs </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="repair printer" class="if uuid-2545581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2545581.jpg"></div><p>  Be very careful that the head does not dry out and does not begin to strip the Epson printer.  The detail of this model is inalienable from the device, and its cost is very high.  The failure of the head in such models will be equivalent to the failure of the entire printer.  Repair in such situations will be inappropriate on the part of cash investments and the result. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If you recently removed the cartridges, then the cause of the formation of stripes may be an air plug.  You can remove it with an ordinary nozzle cleaner.  If you have a case when it is not possible to do this programmatically, then pump the system using a regular syringe. </p><p>  The appearance of unprinted strips on sheets of paper, which also come with an offset in the image detail, are often associated with dirt on the encoder tape.  This is such a translucent film with markings that is located along the carriage.  To solve this problem, you just need to open the printer cover and use a lint-free cloth to wipe the tape, soak the cloth in a cleaning solution first.  As soon as the tape dries, the machine will be ready for use. </p><p>  All the remaining cases of laser printer flickering, which, fortunately, are not numerous, were caused due to a hardware failure.  If the print head, loops, sensors and other components stopped working, then this problem can be solved only by replacing the defective component. </p><h2>  Having problems with the cartridge? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cartridge check" class="if uuid-2545572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2545572.jpg"></div><p>  Here are some points that can cause: </p><ol><li>  The toner has almost run out. </li><li>  Toner began to spill out of the container due to a loose closure. </li><li>  The waste bin is already full. </li><li>  A third-party object has entered the cartridge. </li><li>  The drum unit is broken or worn.  This is a cartridge component that looks like a cylinder.  Toner adheres to it under the influence of LED or laser light, after which it is transferred to paper. </li><li>  The cleaning blade for the drum unit is defective. </li><li>  The magnetic roller is worn or broken.  This is the component that charges the toner particles, so that they stick to the parts of the drum that were previously exposed. </li><li>  The roller is not in close contact with the drum unit. </li><li>  Toner dosing blades were not installed correctly.  A blade is needed to remove excess toner from the surfaces of the magnetic shaft. </li><li>  The sealing components of the drum were broken. </li><li>  Connection nodes have malfunctions. </li></ol><p>  The difficulty with fixing the dye on paper is most often due to the fact that the heating and pressure shaft of the stove is defective or has been worn out.  Difficulties with optics arise not because of a defect, but because it was contaminated with dust or toner. </p><h2>  How to determine the cause of failure according to the print? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="123-hp-com-envy4520.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hp printer strips" class="if uuid-2545575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2545575.jpg"></div><p>  There are some of the most probable reasons that the printer falters when printing, it‚Äôs extremely difficult to take into account everything, because models from different manufacturers differ in their design features. </p><p>  If you have a vertical light band almost in the center of the sheet, then this is a sign that the toner is almost running out.  The less it remains, the greater the band, and the printing of documents will be paler.  If the toner is in sufficient quantity, then a defect could appear due to a malfunction of its supply system. </p><p>  To fix such a breakdown, simply replace or refill your cartridge. </p><h2>  Buffer overflow </h2><p>  Does the printer strip when printing with stripes of dark or colored dots, which are scattered along the entire sheet?  They may appear in different places during printing.  This problem occurs after the cartridge has been refilled, and part of the toner begins to spill out.  It is also possible due to overflow of the buffer-source. </p><p>  To fix this defect, simply clean the cartridge, check its tightness, carefully remove all dirt from the buffer. </p><p>  Does the Epson <span>printer strip with</span> strips that run along the entire sheet and have blurry edges?  This also happens because the buffer is full.  In rare cases, this means that a third-party element has got into the cartridge, it has been damaged or the squeegee has worn out. </p><p>  To eliminate it, it is enough to clean the cartridge, empty the buffer or replace the damaged unit. </p><h2>  Maybe something is stuck? </h2><p>  Canon printer strips with narrow stripes with clear edges, along the entire sheet you can see light stripes, what goes a thin line?  Most often, toner cannot get on a separate part of the sheet due to some kind of obstacle.  The reason for this is a foreign object such as a crumb, coin, or paper clip that has fallen between the magnetic shaft and the blade for cleaning.  Just remove the excess item and everything will be fine. </p><h2>  Worn components </h2><div class="photo" data-original="inkjet411.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cartridge inspection" class="if uuid-2545585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2545585.jpg"></div><p>  Does the inkjet printer strip with fuzzy dark stripes that run along the entire sheet?  The reason for this is the wear of the magnetic shaft.  To resolve the error, replace the broken assembly or the entire cartridge. </p><p>  A dark band appears with repeating elements, can it be on one or two edges of the sheets?  This error is due to a defect on the surface of the drum of the magnetic shaft or fusing elements.  To determine the exact cause, you need to place a blank sheet of paper in the printer and send it to print.  When it is halfway, turn off the printer and remove the sheet of paper.  If there are no stripes on it, then the problem lies in the mounting system.  If streaks are present, then the cartridge jams.  To fix the error, replace the broken component. </p><h2>  Other malfunctions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ifixit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="printer inspection" class="if uuid-2545558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81922/2545558.jpg"></div><p>  Why does the printer strip stripes that are irregular in shape and fill the entire sheet space with a background?  The reason may be that low-quality toner was used for refueling, poor cleaning of the magnetic shaft, or the optical system was dirty.  In this case, you need to replace the toner, clean the cartridge, and thoroughly clean the optics.  It is also recommended to check the position of the dosage blade. </p><p>  Are clear transverse stripes equally spaced?  The problem may be that the contact of the drum with the <span>magnetic shaft</span> was broken due to toner spilling out, the squeegee was damaged, or the waste buffer was full.  In this case, clean the cartridge, check that it is tight, empty the buffer tank, or install a new element instead of the defective one. </p><p>  Does the HP printer strip in frequent narrow stripes?  They arise in connection with the contamination of optical systems.  To do this, simply clean the optics. </p><p>  Does the printer have repeats or overlays of print fragments all over the sheet?  The cause of this malfunction is a malfunction of the primary charge roller.  This is a component due to which the surface of the drum is ionized.  To eliminate the defect, thoroughly clean the roller contacts, and if this does not help, then you need to replace it. </p>
