  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The concept is the key to scientific research.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When preparing a dissertation for a <span>doctor of science, a</span> doctoral candidate is required in an abstract not only to clearly describe the research methodological apparatus, but also to formulate a research concept in which it is necessary to logically and consistently describe the essence of the work, its novelty, and approaches to solving the tasks. </p><p>  A concept is a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa work, its main idea or a combination of several scientific ideas that will be further presented for defense.  Doctoral dissertation is a rather voluminous work of a scientist, which presents both theoretical novelty and practical.  The preparation and writing of a dissertation, its coverage in peer-reviewed scientific journals takes several years, so the scientific concept is developed by the dissertation at the very first stages of work on the topic, in order to clearly represent the way for further research.  In the process of work on the dissertation, some hypothetical propositions can be refuted by the author, and the methods or conditions for conducting the study change, so you need to change the concept, make it a logically complete text, in contrast to the working version that was developed earlier. </p><p>  A doctoral candidate can write his own work or have a scientific consultant who already has a doctorate in this field of scientific knowledge.  The consultant can explain <span>what a concept is,</span> how its working and final version is drawn up.  It is important that the doctoral student learns to think conceptually, to see the content of his dissertation in perspective and to be able to any other scientific opponent to conceptually express the essence of his work or its individual chapters. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In any scientific concept, a personally significant author‚Äôs idea should be reflected, that is, for a dissertation, a concept is a certain way of understanding and presenting the <span>subject of research, a</span> leading idea for highlighting the phenomenon or process being studied.  When conducting a practical study, which is carried out not so much by the dissident himself as by other performers under his leadership, it is necessary to be able to clearly convey to them the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtheir innovation, otherwise the research process can be carried out in different ways and the results will not be reliable. </p><p>  The concept is not just a summary of the dissertation, but an evidence-based and understandable text that reflects the problem of modern science and its own way of resolving this problem.  Using a scientific concept, one can demonstrate the peculiarity and uniqueness of one's work in comparison with dissertations related to the topic.  Thus, it allows you to show the "growth" of knowledge in the studied area.  If dissertations for the degree of <span>candidate of science</span> require only an oral presentation of the concept, then in a doctoral dissertation the concept is the key to understanding what methods and means the author solves the tasks, what results he gets and how relevant it is for modern modernization of education, <span>technical science</span> or medicine . </p><p>  If a Doctor of Science degree is obtained from the totality of <span>scientific works</span> in peer-reviewed journals and from the texts of monographs, then the entire abstract is the author‚Äôs concept, presented abstracted.  When defending a dissertation, the applicant‚Äôs report can be presented in the form of a detailed concept with explanations, illustrations and summaries.  But more often than not, a concept is a system of interconnected and resulting from one another views on the phenomena and processes being studied, which are summarized by the dissertation in the methodology section.  If the idea is presented succinctly, concisely and logically, reviewers and opponents have the opportunity to see the whole essence of the work exactly as the author sees it, without distortion. </p>
