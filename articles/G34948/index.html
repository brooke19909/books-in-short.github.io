Everyone will be able to have a good time watching.  This article contains a list of worthy institutions and monuments of the architecture of the village with a brief description. </p><h2>  Communication with art </h2><p>  Among the main attractions of the city of Tchaikovsky is the Art Gallery.  When visiting the attention of travelers, amazing paintings, sculptures, graphics and the like will open. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.76611599999999" data-lng="54.127671299999975" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/3/8/0/8380.png"></div><p>  The compositions are designed so that visitors do not have a sense of uniformity.  Among the total number of works there are masterpieces of Shishkin, Tropinin, Braz and other famous masters.  In the whole Perm region, the Art Gallery is the second most important cultural institution in terms of importance.  Initially, it was founded as a result of the gift of the collector Zhigalko.  Over time, the collection was replenished with new works of art, and therefore it is not recommended to pass the Gallery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="autotravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tchaikovsky city attractions" class="if uuid-2782213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2782213.jpg"></div><h2>  Religious building </h2><p>  Sights of the city of Tchaikovsky are not distinguished by any memorable sophistication, but they can please tourists who have arrived in the city.  Travelers walking along the streets should definitely come closer to the Church of St. George the Victorious.  The building has no historical value, it was erected in 2003 and the temple became the main one in the whole city.  First of all, its enormous size is impressive; the central spire has a height of about 15 meters.  In front of the church there is a spacious square where you can take a walk, take a photo or just sit near the impressive size of the structure.  It is worth going a second time here at night.  The temple is illuminated from different angles, creating a pleasant atmosphere for walking.  Although the building was built 15 years ago, it managed to obtain the status of the main temple of the city.  A service is regularly held here, if you wish, you can go to it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.temples.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of the city of Tchaikovsky photo" class="if uuid-2782216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2782216.jpg"></div><h2>  Two monuments </h2><p>  In every village there are monuments that are worth a look at least a cursory glance.  They are present and among the attractions of the city of Tchaikovsky.  The story of the first of them, dedicated to the famous poet A.S. Pushkin, is not fraught with riddles or something unusual.  The figure was ordered at the Perm Art Fund.  For four years, questions about the installation, the form of the monument and the like were settled.  The poet was portrayed by A. Uralsky with arms crossed on his chest and a thoughtful look.  The monument was erected in 1989, it is definitely worth seeing.  There is also a <span>monument to Tchaikovsky.</span>  A photo describing the sights of Tchaikovsky before a trip here is often not easy to find, but every visitor knows this place.  In honor of the legendary composer, a settlement was named, although he was born 37 kilometers from here in Votkinsk.  The monument of impressive size shows Tchaikovsky in adulthood with a book on his heart, and musical instruments lie behind. </p><div class="photo" data-original="autotravel.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚ÄãTchaikovsky Perm region attractions" class="if uuid-2782214" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2782214.jpg"></div><h2>  The whole story in one place </h2><p>  Sights of the city of Tchaikovsky, which travelers should see, are in relative proximity to each other.  After viewing the aforementioned monuments, you should head to the third.  It is built in honor of the first builders and creators of the city.  A structure was built on Primorsky Boulevard, its general appearance resembles a sailing ship.  There is a name below, but the sail is of most interest.  This is a stone bas-relief of a semicircular shape and the most important stages of the development of the city are carved on it.  Viewers can see the people who built the settlement, the emergence of a hydroelectric power station, a sports past, and workers at major industrial facilities.  The whole life of Tchaikovsky is depicted on the bas-relief and this is why it is of value to tourists.  The construction was erected in a year, and in 2006 the first stone was laid on this site.  Around the monument is a small area, the area is well-groomed and clean. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="accofestival.spb.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tchaikovsky city attractions photo with description" class="if uuid-2782219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2782219.jpg"></div><h2>  Water open spaces </h2><p>  Every tourist should take a photo of the sights of the city of Tchaikovsky, especially after visiting the Votkinsk hydroelectric power station.  It was after its founding in 1961 that the settlement began to grow.  Initially, housing was built for employees with families, but over time, the size increased to a small town.  Hydroelectric power station is amazing in its size.  Large-scale structure with a spillway dam of 191 meters long.  Lovers of huge buildings should take a close look at this landmark.  It stands on the <span>Kama reservoir,</span> which can be separately allocated for visiting.  At night, the coastal streets are lit with romantic yellow, and the vast expanses of water complement the atmosphere.  At such a time, it‚Äôs nice to walk near the reservoir with your loved one or friends who like this sight. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mojpermskijkraj.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tchaikovsky city sights history" class="if uuid-2782220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2782220.jpg"></div><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Among the attractions of the city of Tchaikovsky in the <span>Perm region</span> should be recorded entertainment type.  If travelers arrived in the settlement with children, then you should visit Questroom59.  There are many rooms with a variety of puzzles.  Everything is thought out to the smallest detail, the building is divided into age sectors.  There are puzzles for adults with a more complex concept and children's rooms in which you can have fun with the whole family.
