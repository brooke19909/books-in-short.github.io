  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Perpetual magnet motor?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sometimes you look at web pages, again and again ... And, excuse me, you look exactly like a ram in front of a new gate.  It seems that the courtyard is not the 21st century, but the 16th.  The very dawn of the era of the transition of mankind from manual production to machine.  But at the same time, the sensation is not at all the triumph of reason and science, but the exact opposite.  Otherwise, the <span>perpetual motion machine</span> with magnets would not have arisen again and again - an idea whose absurdity has been repeatedly and convincingly proved. <br><br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Perpetual magnet motor" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/42457.jpg" width="225"></div>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãany perpetual motion machine, simplified to the bottom, looks like this: a certain simple (or incredibly complex - depends on the imagination of the "inventor") mechanism, once set in motion, works indefinitely.  But since any other mechanism works by borrowing energy from outside (which is required by the law of conservation of <span>mechanical energy), it</span> turns out that the perpetual motion machine is powered by energy from nowhere. <br><br>  <span>The absurdity of this</span> fact, however, is not so obvious as the impossibility of dividing the number by zero.  Otherwise, how can we explain the fact that for two and a half centuries both poorly educated artisans and pundits have offered countless designs of perpetual motion machines, among which was a magnet motor?  Moreover, the impossibility of their endless work was constantly proved not only theoretically, but also experimentally!  (At times, it came to building prototypes.) <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY perpetual magnet engine" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/42459.jpg" width="550"></div>  Finally, in 1775, the French Academy of Sciences decided that henceforth projects of perpetual motion machines will not be considered. <br><br>  The "age" of this historic decree is already three centuries old.  Do you think humanity has grown wiser?  Judging by the "tutorials" on the sites "How to build a perpetual motion machine with magnets with your own hands" - not at all. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Magnet motor" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11773/42458.jpg" width="320"></div>  One has only to read the writings of the "inventors"!  Here you will find new materials in the form of neodymium magnets, and a home-grown "single field theory", and the proclamation of knowledge of the school physics course as sufficient to build a perpetual motion machine.  But this is characteristic: almost all ‚Äúinventors‚Äù devote a huge amount of their writings to angry criticism of ‚Äúfalse scientists‚Äù who reject the ‚Äúunique‚Äù perpetual motion machine with magnets.  How they stigmatize teachers of schools and universities, "littering the brains" and "zombie youth"!  How to analyze the answers sent almost from a letter sent from academies of sciences, institutes and laboratories, abundantly seasoning them with bile comments.  The reader is immediately informed: it turns out that in Europe and America the perpetual motion machine with magnets has already been built and is working.  (True, for some reason, no reliable links are provided.) <br><br>  Worst of all, all this pseudoscientific nonsense is actively propagating and clogging search engines.  Therefore, when trying to find scientifically reliable information about whether it is really possible to always draw energy from nowhere and whether a simple perpetual motion machine with magnets can help, for example, save energy, the "unrecognized geniuses of all times and peoples" brazenly climb into the first lines of the issue.  And, even sadder, there are many times more liars and charlatans who collect donations for the construction of their absurdity than sincerely mistaken.  And, unfortunately, they are believed ...
