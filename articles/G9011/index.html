    <p>  During his studies, the future astronaut got acquainted with the UT-2, PO-2 aircraft.  He practiced the first skills on them.  In 1944, he, as an excellent student in political and combat training, was sent to the Yeisk School, where he mastered the profession of a sea pilot.  Now in the Museum of Star City there is a characteristic of Belyaev, which was written by teachers during his studies at the school. </p><h2>  Military career </h2><p>  The future cosmonaut Belyaev, whose biography is full of interesting and heroic events, after graduation, was sent to naval aviation in the Far East.  There he took part in hostilities against the Japanese Empire.  His debut departure was associated with the protection of bombers, who were sent to suppress the enemy firing points.  After the war, Belyaev received the medal "For the victory over Japan." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Post-war years </h2><p>  Pavel Ivanovich remained to serve in Primorye as part of the Pacific Fleet Air Force Regiment.

    <p>  For two years he was a party organizer.  He mastered space technology with great zeal, perfectly studied the ship‚Äôs materiel, and quickly mastered control skills. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Injury </h2><p>  A group of future astronauts had to undergo a complex set of training.  And the most important role in them was assigned to parachute training.  Management believed that these kinds of skills would be useful for cadets. </p><p>  In 1964, Belyaev and Leonov had to make a couple of jumps with a delay of thirty seconds.  The first jump went well.  But when they ascended into heaven again, the wind intensified.  The paratroopers jumped, and they began to demolish away from the right place.  Belyaev realized that the landing would be unsuccessful.  He pulled the slings, the demolition became less, but the speed of descent increased.  When landing Belyaev injured his leg, and he was sent to the hospital. </p>

    <p>  A difficult treatment has begun.  The hospital was visited by Gagarin, who asked the doctors to return Paul rather to the ranks.  Five months passed, and the doctors suggested a complex leg operation, but no guarantees were given.  Belyaev decided not to risk it and proposed an alternative - to increase the load on the leg, and thus make the bone grow together.  He took dumbbells and stood on a sore leg.  The pain was hellish, but the future astronaut achieved his goal - the leg was cured. </p><p>  Pavel missed a year of training, but was able to return to the group.  To do this, he had to pass 7 test jumps, which he coped with "excellent".  The authorities appreciated his efforts and allowed to fly. </p><h2>  Space </h2><p>  On March 18, 1965, Pavel Belyaev, an astronaut from God, and his partner Alexei Leonov started from Baikonur aboard the Voskhod-2 ship.  When they entered orbit, a lock chamber connected to the hatch of the ship began to inflate.  Leonov, passing through it, made the first man‚Äôs exit into space. </p><p>  Then the mission did not go as planned.  The astronauts had to cope with seven accidents.  Three of them were life-threatening, there was a danger of explosion, the control system refused.  To switch to manual control, Belyaev had to unfasten his seat.  He redirected the ship, set up the braking system, and returned to its place again. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cosmonaut Belyaev photo" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1285714.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Such manual control operations have not been previously conducted, and for the first time they were performed by Belyaev.  The astronaut spent 22 seconds on this.  But during this time the ship left the desired trajectory and deviated from the course by 165 kilometers.  For this reason, the astronauts had to land in the taiga.  The rescue operation found them only after four hours. </p><p>  In order for the helicopter to land, it was necessary to prepare a special site on the spot, next to which was a house for overnight stays.  It took two days.  In addition, astronauts had to ski to the helicopter.  These days were the hardest for them.  The astronauts needed not only knowledge and ability to control the ship, but also ingenuity, endurance and the ability to ski. </p><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  The cosmonaut's father was called Ivan Petrovich.  He participated in the fighting of the First World War and fought with the Japanese at Khalkhin Gol.  He died in 1959.  Agrafen Mikhailov's mother was born in 1899, and passed away in 1963. </p>

    <p>  Pavel Belyaev married early enough.  The astronaut and his wife Tatyana Filippovna had two daughters, Irina and Lyuda.  Their marriage was happy. </p><h2>  Rewarding </h2><p>  The space flight lasted 26 hours 2 minutes and 17 seconds.  The ship made seventeen revolutions around our planet, having traveled over 720 thousand kilometers.  On March 23, 1965, Belyaev was awarded the title of Hero of the USSR.  And on April 13 of the same year he was awarded the title of Honorary Citizen of Vologda.  August 17, 1979.  in this city they opened a bust to Belyaev. </p><h2>  The further life of the astronaut </h2><p>  Pavel Belyaev, an astronaut and honorary resident of Vologda, together with his friend Leonov planted young oaks in the square of this city.  Subsequently, they improved their knowledge and passed on the experience to the young, participating in the preparation of future conquerors of heaven.  Belyaev wished to take off again and hoped that fate would give him such a chance.  But this did not come true. </p><p>  The bright, energetic life of the Hero of the Soviet Union was short-lived.  On January 10, 1970, after a long illness, Pavel Belyaev passed away.  The astronaut was buried at the Novodevichy cemetery in the capital of our country. </p>
