Recreation areas, projected prices for 2016</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Kazakhstan is gradually becoming a popular tourist destination.  Amazingly beautiful nature and legalized gambling business encouraged local businessmen to develop beach infrastructure.  In this article we will talk about the <span>Kapchagai reservoir.</span>  When it was created, and it was in 1970, no one thought that there would be a <span>recreational area.</span>  They simply evicted the inhabitants of the village of Ili with Soviet directness, flooded it and built turbines of the Kapchagai hydroelectric power station.  On the shore of the reservoir formed a new town.  Its population was evacuated residents of Ili.  The city was named Kapchagay (modern name Kapshagay).  For a long time it was a small and unremarkable settlement in the Almaty region.  But nine years ago, with the adoption of the law on gambling, the town turned into a resort in a couple of years.  Now on the banks of the reservoir there is not only a casino, but also numerous pensions and hotels offering an unforgettable vacation on Kapchagai.  Recreation areas on this man-made lake will be considered in our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holiday on Kapchagai recreation area" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1211103.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is the climate in Kapchagai </h2><p>  The reservoir is located in the middle course of the Ili River.  It stretches for a hundred kilometers!  The width of the reservoir is 25-30 km.  The average depths are about forty meters.  For its size and proximity to the former capital of Kazakhstan, they called the man-made lake the Almaty Sea.  For the weekend, many residents of the region come here.  For them, the main attractions are a casino and a wonderful water park.  Well, for those who have come from afar, the main thing is a beach holiday.  On <span>Kapchagai recreation areas</span> (and there are more than one hundred and fifty) occupied all the banks.  These are mainly private guest houses.  Only two boarding houses are in state ownership.  Of course, it is worth coming here in the summer months.  The air warms up to forty degrees, but a deep lake softens the heat.  The water temperature is +18 ° C in May, +20 ° C in June, +22 ... +24 ° C in July and +26 ... +28 ° C in August. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rest on Kapchagai: recreation areas </h2><p>  Since the eighties, the reservoir was known as a recreational area.  The residents of Alma-Ata came here for a weekend.  Then there were barracks on the shores, where it was possible, at least, to spend the night.  Now, private hotels are crowded in orderly rows near the beaches, vying to offer a comfortable stay on Kapchagai.  Recreation areas can be divided into categories.  The first is “boutique hotels” for VIP clients.  The cost of rest is an average of twenty thousand tenge (for reference: 1 thousand tenge - this is approximately 200 rubles.).  On the territory there is a swimming pool, spa, billiards and other entertainment.  Examples include Picnic Park or Riviera Club.  The second category is for family vacations.  Purely neat, there is a pool on the territory, sometimes Wi-Fi and other joys of civilization.  The price of such a rest is from five to fifteen thousand tenge.  And finally, the Robinsonades are small houses on the sandy shore.  Sometimes they can have air conditioners, refrigerators, a minimum set of dishes.  But the cost of such a vacation is simply symbolic: three, and sometimes one and a half thousand tenge. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pearl Rest Area on Kapchagai" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1211189.jpg" width="600"></div>
