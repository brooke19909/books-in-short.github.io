    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  It is difficult enough to list all the hotels of this chain.  However, guests should know where Podushkin is located (hotel, Moscow).  Addresses can also be found in any directory or on the official website on the Internet. </p><p>  There is a very comfortable <span>hotel on Arbat,</span> at 6. Panfilovsky Pereulok. Welcome to VDNH, Eisenstein street, 2. On Voikovskaya you can find the hotel at 26 Koptevskaya street, apt. 4.  There is a branch on Kashirka, Proletarsky Prospekt, 1. However, this is far from all.  Wherever you are, everywhere has its own "Podushkin" (hotel).

Top service and affordable prices are what attract customers.  That is why new mini-hotels are opening one by one: on Komsomolsky Prospekt and Kitay-Gorod, in Maryino and Mytishchi, on Plyushchikha and Prospect Mira, on Taganka and in Solntsevo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hourly hotel pillow" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1055492.jpg" width="600"></div>

The hotel, the photos of the rooms of which are presented here in a large assortment, is actually very peculiar, vibrant and interesting.

Regardless of the number of guests, payment remains fixed.  It is necessary to confirm the reservation three hours before check-in, now you will need to provide your passport or driver‚Äôs license.

However, if guests decide to leave the room earlier, payment for unspent time will not be refunded.
