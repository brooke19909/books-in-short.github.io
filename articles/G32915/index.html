Buying CTP without life insurance is almost impossible.  In addition to the fact that since October 2014 the Central Bank changed the tariff, so insurers still refuse to sell a clean policy.  How to be in this situation? </p><h2>  The essence of the problem </h2><p>  There are 104 insurance companies operating in Russia that have a license for the sale of OSAGO.  Is <span>life insurance</span> mandatory when applying for this service?  By law, no.  Nevertheless, it is impossible to buy a policy ‚Äúon wheels‚Äù.  Most often, employees refer to the lack of forms.  This argument is immediately rejected by the SAR: insurers do not and cannot have problems with documents.  Some companies do not draw up a blank policy without an appointment, the queue in which lasts two or three months.  As a way out, they offer to buy several insurances at once.  At the same time, costs increase by 2-2.5 times.  This situation does not suit many Russians.  Although some agree to overpay several thousand, so as not to stand in line for a form. </p>

    <h2>  Cause </h2><p>  Reluctance about thousand to give OSAGO without life insurance did not appear out of the blue.  Such a decision was prompted by losses incurred due to the extension of the law on consumer protection to the insurance market.  The number of complaints of dissatisfied customers to court has increased.  The profitability of companies has fallen sharply. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Financial results </h2><p>  According to the <span>Russian Union of Auto Insurers,</span> in 2014, 102 companies collected OSAGO premiums in the amount of 150 billion 292 thousand rubles, which is 11.2% more than in 2013.  Over the same period, payments amounted to 88.816 billion rubles.  A significant role in this was played by the increase in Central Bank tariffs.  So, from 01.10.2014, the minimum cost of the insurance policy is 2440 rubles, and the maximum - 2574 rubles.  At the same time, the amount of payments also increased: for property damage - 400 thousand rubles, for damage to life and health - 500 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Critical market situation </h2><p>  According to the SAR, the increase in tariffs is crossed out by the difficult economic situation.  An increase in average payout will force companies to leave the market.  Many people leave highly profitable regions due to high risks.  In their place come unscrupulous insurers.  Car owners do not yet feel much difference, as they receive payments from the fund.  But if the PCA disappears, then the showdown on the roads will return. </p>

    <p>  Payment under a contract concluded in one insurance period may occur in another.  In this case, companies form reserves.  They are taken into account when determining the financial result, but not as profit.  Conscientious market participants are forced to compensate for the losses of bankrupt companies.  In addition, part of the premiums is returned to the insured.  Therefore, it is incorrect to calculate the financial result as the difference between the premium and the payment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Power on the client side </h2><p>  FAS is connected to work.  By the beginning of 2014, the organization received more than 700 complaints against 20 companies from 46 regions of the country that impose life insurance.  CTP is the hardest thing to buy at Rosgosstrakh, the largest player in the market.  In the Sverdlovsk region, a criminal case has already been opened against the company for abuse of a position that threatens a fine in the range of 1-15% of mandatory car insurance.  In 2012, this figure amounted to 1.6 billion rubles. </p>

    <p>  FAS also carries out outreach.  All who apply to the inspection are sent a memo on how to deal with arbitrariness.  In particular, one of the methods is as follows: if the company refers to the absence of forms, it is necessary to send a registered letter (no later than a month before the expiration of the policy) with a notice stating a request to conclude a new contract.  The insurer is not entitled to refuse. </p><h2>  Alternatives </h2><p>  In IDGC, you can buy an <span>insurance policy without</span> life <span>insurance</span> , but provided that the client has a copy of the passport of the owner of the vehicle.  According to the legislation, the following documents are required for applying for a policy: </p><p>  1. Application for concluding a contract. </p><p>  2. Passport (for individuals) or certificate of state registration of legal entities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  3. Driving license. </p><p>  4. Vehicle passport. </p><p>  5. Diagnostic card that confirms the passage of the inspection. </p>

    <p>  In some companies, morning hours are reserved for street customers.  In particular, in RESO-Garantia you can buy compulsory motor third-party liability insurance without life insurance, having previously stood under the office for more than one day.  According to customer reviews, one person is served per hour.  According to statistics, this procedure takes 30 minutes.  This time is enough to sign the paper and see the car.  Under the law, the insurer has the right to do so.  Another issue is that at the request of the client, an inspection should be carried out at his place of residence.  You can, of course, buy OSAGO without life insurance and without having a diagnostic card.  But not everywhere.  And it will cost 800-900 rubles more.  The line in the companies is scheduled for several months in advance.  You can speed up the process in a similar way - by acquiring several policies at once. </p><h2>  Why do I need life insurance </h2><p>  The product itself is very useful.  It gives a certain guarantee that in the event of an accident all insurance and health expenses will be paid by the insurance company.  But only in Russia this service is purely voluntary.  Compulsory life insurance under compulsory motor liability insurance is not prescribed in the federal law of the same name.  Therefore, numerous claims by car owners on illegal actions of companies had a result.  In addition to making a positive decision, the Supreme Arbitration Court imposed a fine on the offender in the amount of 50 thousand rubles.  Rosgostsrakh suffered the most. </p><h2>  Sanctions of the Central Bank </h2><p>  At the end of May 2015, the regulator imposed restrictions on the license issued to Rosgosstrakh.  Companies have banned the conclusion of new OSAGO agreements or change the existing ones.  In this case, the insurer must fulfill obligations under previously signed documents. </p>

    <p>  Despite the ban, employees offer to come to the office to conclude a compulsory motor liability insurance contract.  Individuals can apply for a policy directly on the site.  The Central Bank explained the ban introduced by the company as a result of massive violations of the current legislation, in particular the refusal to charge customers a break-even discount and the imposition of additional services. </p><h2>  What is fraught with the lack of a citizen? </h2><p>  The Federal Law "On OSAGO" says that the owner of a vehicle is obliged to insure his civil liability within 10 days from the date of purchase.  For violation of this period faces a fine of 8 thousand rubles.  By the way, CTP with additional markups is cheaper.  In addition to the fact that without a policy you will reach only the first traffic cop, it‚Äôs also impossible to cross the border of the country.  In the event of an accident, it will be necessary to appeal through the court all complaints of traffic police officers (in particular, regarding the lack of a driver‚Äôs insurance policy).  But it‚Äôs better not to take risks and learn in advance how to arrange for motor third party liability insurance without life insurance. </p>

    <h2>  Training </h2><p>  You need to start dealing with the issue of issuing a policy not a day or two before the end of the contract, but a couple of months.  As practice shows, solving the problem "off the wheels" will cost several times more. </p><p>  First you need to sign up for an application to five or six companies at once - at different times.  First of all, contact the insurer who received the previous policy.  There is a small chance to get a new one without additional markups. </p><p>  Then you need to prepare the vehicle for viewing.  Although, according to the law, compulsory motor third-party liability insurance without life insurance is carried out with a diagnostic card that confirms the fact that it has passed the inspection, many companies do not accept it, requiring an individual examination.  They really have a right to it.  Therefore, you should at least wash the car. </p><p>  On "X-Day" to appear at the appointed time.  Even if three meetings break, someone will be on one.  It is very likely that no one will look at the car at all, but they will immediately write out a clean policy. </p><p>  This is the cheapest, but at the same time, a long option. </p><h2>  The second way is to use mail services </h2><p>  An application for a policy can be written not only at the branch of the insurance company.  It can also be sent by registered mail with a delivery receipt to the address of the main office.  In this way, it is advised to use the FAS.  Having received a notification from the post office that the package has been handed over, you can go to the office and draw up a contract.  Then employees simply will not be able to refer to the fact that the papers will be reviewed for a month, or that "you are not in the database." </p>

    <h2>  How to buy compulsory motor third-party liability insurance without life insurance: an option for extreme people </h2><p>  No matter how many policies a person simultaneously draws up, a payment order for each of them is issued separately.  If you are not afraid of a long clarification of relations with the company‚Äôs security service (it is usually located in the central offices) or employees, you can use this option.  First, agree to the offer to buy OSAGO along with any other type of insurance.  Wait until the employee completes both forms and writes out a payment.  And then sign only the receipt for the payment of compulsory motor liability insurance, and you can say that you changed your mind about the second policy.  Agree to all threats to call police officers.  Better yet, call the department yourself.  Upon arrival of law enforcement agencies, the work of the branch will be suspended until the circumstances of the case are clarified.  It is advisable to conduct covert video immediately, so that if you have questions, you can prove your case. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The desire of companies to get more profit is understandable, as well as the refusal of customers to pay for services that they will not use.  MTPL insurance without life insurance in Russia is real, but it will take a lot of time.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to begin preparation in advance: to select 5-6 companies, put in order the car and after 2-3 months to receive the coveted policy. </p>
