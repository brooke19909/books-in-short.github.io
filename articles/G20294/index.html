  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Earrings with your own hands. Exclusive Available</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Each fashionista wants to change accessories for her wardrobe as often as possible, so that they exactly correspond not only to the chosen style, but also to the mood.  But, unfortunately, not everyone can afford to regularly buy jewelry.  Nevertheless, their cost sometimes reaches the size of several working salaries.  But there is a way, pay attention to the variety of modern jewelry.  Sometimes such accessories, although they cost an order of magnitude cheaper, but look much more sophisticated and chicier than precious metal products.  For example, earrings.  Massive and vibrant models with many bright decorative details are now in fashion.  Agree, to buy such beauty from gold or at least silver is a pleasure not at all cheap. </p><p>  In order not to waste a lot of time on shopping in specialized stores and choosing a kit that would ideally fit today's outfit, it is much easier to make earrings with your own hands.  And it‚Äôs not at all so difficult.  One evening is enough for you to make the perfect accessory.  Here is an example of where you can start your practice in creating jewelry. </p><p>  <strong>DIY earrings.</strong>  <strong>Master class at home</strong> </p><p>  In order for you to get an interesting and bright decoration, it is not necessary to stock up on expensive materials.  Start with something simpler, so it will not be too insulting to accidentally ruin something with awkward movements.  This model can be made of ordinary <span>copper wire,</span> large beads, finished hooks in the ears, glass beads and a variety of beads.  These materials can always be bought at an affordable price in the store or found in caskets with old jewelry.  Just first make sure that you are not allergic to copper, as some girls cannot wear simple, home-made earrings in their ear punctures. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You need to start work by cutting off two small pieces of wire of equal length.  This will be our workpiece, the scale of the future accessory depends on its size.  Bend as smooth a loop as possible from the first piece, the ends of which are carefully intertwined at the top with each other.  Ideally, they should form a small hook.  Do the same with the second part. </p><p>  To decorate the pre-blank, take a thinner wire so that it is convenient to thread through the beads.  Fasten one end of it to the upper loop of the first workpiece and begin to wind it evenly over thick wire.  After five turns, thread the beads.  And so, until the decoration is completely entwined.  Try not to get off the count of turns so that the work as a whole looks harmonious and neat.  As you can see, earrings with their own hands are not so much jewelry work. </p><p>  As soon as the place on the workpiece runs out, fasten the end in the same place where you started work.  But do not rush to cut thin wire.  The result obtained, of course, already looks pretty good, but we suggest that you give it a little extra charm.  Lower the remaining tail of the thin wire down so that it passes through the center of the earring (do not sacrifice yourself, if such small work causes you inconvenience, use thimbles or tweezers).  Put three beads on it, then place a larger and more contrast bead.  Secure it with an oblong bugle.  Pass the end of the wire through a large bead and drag through the remaining beads up.  Fasten in the same place as the rest. </p><p>  So, the most painstaking work is done.  You just have to attach special hooks so that the finished earrings with your own hands can be pulled into your ears.  Done!  Now you are the owner of an absolute exclusive.  The model can be changed at will as you like, adding additional details. </p>
