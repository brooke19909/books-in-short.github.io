Principality and rule</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A worthy descendant of the great Vladimir Monomakh, his seventh son - Yuri Dolgoruky - entered the history of Russia not only as the <span>great prince of</span> Kiev and the specific Rostov-Suzdal, founder of the city of Moscow.  He left a memory of himself as an ambitious, energetic person, who was directly walking towards his goal.  An ambiguous assessment of his life and work, however, as well as the affairs, deeds and decisions of many great military leaders of those ancient times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="biography of yuri long-armed" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/383819.jpg" width="418"></div>  N. M. Karamzin spoke of him as a person who noted the transformation of the eastern expanses of ancient Russia: the foundation of many cities and settlements, the construction of roads and churches, the spread of Christianity.  And he claims that, having a tough disposition and not differing in kindness, Dolgoruky did not stand on ceremony with enemies and rebellious boyars, which earned him an active popular rejection.

    <h2>  The birth of a prince </h2><p>  The biography of Yuri Dolgoruky is quite blurred, historians have to guess many facts from the life of the prince, comparing the scanty chronicles.  Accurate information about the date of his birth has not reached us: different sources give different numbers, and analyzing them, we can only say with confidence that he was born in the period from 1090 to 1097.  For the limitation of these events, we do not know which of the wives of Monomakh (first or second) was the mother of Yuri.  And we will not focus on this fact.  The main thing is that this person has done many glorious deeds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Strengthening the North-Eastern Russian lands </h2><p>  Participation in the most famous and successful campaign of 1111 against the Polovtsians as part of the army of the Russian princes was the first victory of Yuri: the daughter of the Polovtsian khan becomes his first wife.  Prince <span>Yuri Dolgoruky,</span> whose biography emphasizes that he could not count on the inheritance of the Kiev throne, being one of the youngest sons of Monomakh, from 1113 he became the specific ruler of the Rostov-Suzdal principality, practically on the outskirts of Russia between the rivers Oka and Volga. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prince Yuri Long-armed biography" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/383816.jpg?1399008436767" width="217"></div>  He is mainly engaged in the transformation and strengthening of this region, the construction of cities and temples.  Yuri Dolgoruky became the first prince to rule over the lands entrusted to him for more than forty years.  With the strengthening of the Rostov-Suzdal Territory and the formation of its borders, Yuri Dolgoruky (the years of rule led to the creation of many fortress cities in North-Eastern Russia) strengthened his influence and position.

    <h2>  Strengthening Christianity </h2><p>  When erecting cities, the prince did not forget about the spread of the Orthodox Christian faith, constructing magnificent temples.  Until now, he is revered as the founder of many churches and monasteries, in particular, the St. George Monastery in Vladimir on Klyazma, Borisoglebsky on <span>the Nerl River, the</span> Church of Our Lady in Suzdal, the Church of St. George in Vladimir and Yuriev, the Church of the Savior in Pereyaslavl-Zalessky and Suzdal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><br>  Campaigns and victories </h2><p>  In 1120, at the behest of his father, Yuri Dolgoruky led a successful campaign, together with the Polovtsy, nomads of Turkic origin, against the Volga Bulgars who lived on the lands of modern Tatarstan, Chuvashia, Samara and Penza regions.  The biography of Yuri Dolgoruky is not full of military victories - he rarely fought, but, possessing infinite courage and mastery of the military leader, used these qualities to achieve his goals.  Probably, he was a fairly educated person who understands the whole need for unification of Russian lands.  He participated in this process, strengthening the north-east of Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yuri Long-armed short biography" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/383818.jpg?1399008566486" width="396"></div>  Since 1125, the capital of the region instead of Rostov becomes Suzdal.  The princedom began to be called the Rostov-Suzdal land.

    <h2>  Prince's aspirations </h2><p>  Strengthening his position in the north-east of Russia, Prince Yuri Dolgoruky is striving for the southern possessions, inaccessible Kiev, where "big politics is being made."  It is for this activity that the chroniclers nicknamed Yuri Dolgoruky.  After the death of Vladimir Monomakh in 1125, the throne was inherited by his eldest son Mstislav, then (after his death in 1139) - <span>Yaropolk Vladimirovich,</span> who soon ceded power to Vyacheslav Vladimirovich - the sixth son of Monomakh. </p><p>  Princely strife was widespread, and the struggle for power at all times remained the most fierce and unprincipled.  In the period from 1146 to 1154, Prince Yuri Dolgoruky tried to gain power in Kiev.  This becomes the main goal of his life.  And during this time he twice regains the throne from his nephews - the sons of Mstislav, but cannot keep him.  He succeeds to enter the throne of Kiev on March 20, 1155 by <span>right of succession</span> after the death of his brother and sixth son of Monomakh - Vyacheslav Vladimirovich.  The short reign of Yuri Vladimirovich in the city of the Golden Gate was not calm, but he died on May 15, 1157, fulfilling his dream, being the Grand Duke of Kiev. </p><h2>  The foundation of Moscow </h2><p>  The first mention of Moscow in ancient chronicles dates back to 1147.  The biography of Yuri Dolgoruky and the chronicles of that time confirm that the construction of the city began after the meeting of the prince with Svyatoslav Olgovich in a small settlement on the Moscow River. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="characteristic of yuri long-armed" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/383820.jpg?1399021546349" width="600"></div>  The year of the first mention of Moscow began to be considered the date of its foundation.  Yuri Dolgoruky closely watched the development of the city, in 1156, by his order, the future capital was fortified with a moat and new wooden walls.  Around the same time, the construction of the wooden Kremlin began.

    <h2>  Wives and children </h2><p>  Biography of Yuri Dolgoruky mentions the two marriages of the prince.  The first wife was Polovka, whose name was not preserved in the annals, the second was called Olga.  These marriages brought Yuri eleven sons and two daughters.  Unfortunately, in the historical documents no details are kept about the family relations of the prince.  The name of the last daughter of the ruler is not clarified. </p><p>  The characterization of Yuri Dolgoruky among the ancient chroniclers is very unflattering: extreme unpopularity among the people of Kiev was promoted by the prince‚Äôs heavy disposition, his cunning and resourcefulness in achieving his goals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yuri long-armed years of rule" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/383821.jpg?1399008878063" width="600"></div>  Perhaps this was the reason for his death.  Chroniclers do not deny the possibility of poisoning Yuri.  However, despite all the contradictions of this strong nature, the fact is clear: Yuri Dolgoruky, whose brief biography emphasizes the implementation of a tough policy, contributed a lot to strengthening and unity of Russia as a great state.
