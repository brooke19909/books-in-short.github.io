At the end of each eventful evening, a disco is held. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  The Mega Saray Club (Turkey) has not only a large territory, but also an incredibly developed infrastructure.  Numerous bars and restaurants - this is not all that can please the hotel to its guests.  On its territory there are 22 the latest tennis courts with several types of coverage.  In addition, the courts are equipped with lighting for night use.  There is a famous tennis school.  Everyone can join the big sport and take lessons from good coaches. </p><h2>  Environmentally friendly hotel </h2><p>  Klub Mega Saray (Belek) is one of the few establishments that position themselves as environmentally friendly hotels.  In its activities, the complex is trying not to harm the environment and recycle waste.  It is worth noting that the hotel has a very large territory, the area of ​​which reaches 120 hectares.  All of it is planted with plants and flowers.  The beach of the Mega Saray Club is one of those places on the coast where carriage carriage turtles breed.  These animals have been under protection for a long time, since there is a threat of extinction of the species.  Every year, turtles make masonry on the beach that cannot be touched so that offspring will subsequently appear from them.  This area is controlled by hotel staff. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club mega shed additional services" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2048124.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the spacious hotel grounds are planted with plants that help regulate the ecosystem balance.  As ecotourism is becoming more and more popular in the world, the hotel complex will be of interest primarily to those who prefer relaxation among natural beauties away from the noise of megacities.  In recent years, the hotel adheres to an invariable concept, taking an active part in environmental protection activities.  The fact is that 29 endemic plants and even one relic plant grow in this region of Turkey, so the task of the population is to keep all this unchanged.  The Mega Saray Club offers not only an excellent vacation, but also the opportunity to enjoy nature and take walks among many trees and plants, flowers and animals. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  The hotel offers a fairly large list of standard services that are included in the all-inclusive concept.  But at the same time, there are additional services at the Mega Saray Club, which are paid separately.  Such services include massage sessions, a visit to the jacuzzi, tennis lessons, surfing, nightly lighting of courts, the use of motor sports, diving, and the order of a nanny for a child. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The Mega Saray Club Hotel (Turkey) is built on the coast and has its own sand and pebble beach, which is equipped with awnings, mattresses and sun loungers.  In addition, a pier was built on the coast for a comfortable stay and a convenient descent to the sea. </p><h2>  Reviews of tourists about the hotel “Club Mega Saray” </h2><p>  Continuing the review of the hotel, I would like to pay attention to the reviews of numerous guests of the institution.

    <p>  The hotel has a very large and beautiful area, which is well organized and convenient.  Therefore, here you can take walks, admiring the greenery of plants and beautiful flowers.  On the territory there are wonderful recreation areas.  In short, the hotel is filled with greenery and ponds.  It is very pleasant that the whole territory is maintained in excellent condition, gardeners spend all day engaging in plants, of which there are an incredible amount.  Cleaning takes place daily, and the tracks are washed with special products. </p><p>  The hotel has a wonderful number of rooms.  However, when booking an apartment, you should know some nuances.  The fact is that club rooms located in the garden, in principle, are not positioned as five-star apartments.  In them the situation is a little simpler and traces of scuffs are noticeable.  But all the other rooms are beyond praise, so tourists recommend booking them.  In general, the hotel staff is attentive, so it always tries to respond to requests from guests to relocate to other apartments if you did not like the proposed premises. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club mega barn service" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2048129.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Modern rooms are equipped with good furniture and accessories, they have everything you need for the best vacation.  Cleaning is done every day and incredibly high quality.  Maids even wipe all items with napkins with disinfectants, which is associated with the Coxsackie virus.  If you have a tip from the towels, they will build beautiful figures.  Towels and bed linen are changed frequently, almost every day.  And the contents of the minibar never ends, staff are watching this.  If there is a need for some subject, then you should turn to the reception desk, however, they understand Russian there poorly, but always try to help. </p><p>  If you relax with children, then of course you will be interested in the issue of washing.  Laundry at the hotel is, but its services are not cheap, washing one thing will cost up to four euros.  The soundproofing of the rooms is good, so the rest is very comfortable. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Meals at the Mega Saray Club are organized at a high level, as evidenced by numerous guest reviews.  The main restaurant offers an incredible variety of amazing dishes.  The local chef delights tourists with delicious sweets and delicacies.  No less tasty food in a la carte restaurants.  You can visit them twice during your stay at the hotel, but you must make an appointment in advance.  Which institution is better to visit, you decide, because of the gastronomic tastes of the guests differ.  Some people like a fish restaurant, others like a Mexican or grill.  To appreciate the virtues of their cuisines, you must visit them in person.  In the main restaurant, waiters work very promptly, there are no problems with mountains of dirty dishes.  And there are no queues either, although the hotel is always full of guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club mega saray belek" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2048132.jpg"></div>

Two age groups are open for children, in which interesting classes are offered.  The only drawback is the fact that the animation is carried out in German and English, sometimes Russian words slip through, but the children do not understand.

    <p>  Throughout the day, you can see how numerous service staff processes railings, sunbeds, tables, doors and other public objects with antiseptic agents.  In each toilet and at the entrance to the restaurant you can see special containers with disinfecting solutions.  This is due to the Coxsackie virus.
