To do this, you can use different <span>investment</span> methods <span>.</span>  <span>Investors</span> usually choose such directions that differ in not too high risks.  In addition, they focus on areas in which they are well versed.  If investments are planned by a novice investor, then quite often the choice dwells on investing in stocks.  Under such conditions, you should understand what the benefits of such an investment are, how to choose the right securities, and also how a direct transaction is made to purchase them. </p><h2>  Is it profitable to invest in stocks? </h2><p>  Many people who want to increase available capital are thinking about how to learn how to invest in stocks.  If you really understand this process well, you can get a fairly high income from activities. </p><p>  In Russia, investing in securities is considered not a very popular process, due to the low financial literacy of citizens and even company owners.  This type of investment is considered difficult, and many companies refuse to pay dividends on securities. </p><p>  The appropriateness of investing depends on what goal the investor is trying to achieve.  Additionally, it is considered which investment method is chosen for this.  If you plan to make high profits, then stocks are considered an excellent choice. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.abl.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what stocks to invest" class="if uuid-2499191" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2499191.jpg"></div><h2>  What kind of profit can I get? </h2><p>  If an investor decides to invest in stocks, then he can count on a really high profit.  Income can significantly outstrip inflation, while invested capital will remain intact. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  No one can know what kind of income will be received from the securities of a company.  Profit depends on what income per year will be received by the direct issuer. </p><p>  The main income of the investor is formed by the resale of the purchased securities, since the difference between the purchase and sale price can be significant.  Profitability forecasts can be made by studying the financial documentation of the company whose shares are planned to be acquired. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.manutencaoemfoco.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to invest in stocks of foreign companies" class="if uuid-2499193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2499193.jpg"></div><h2>  What stocks are worth buying? </h2><p>  Many investors are thinking about <span>how to invest money</span> in stocks.  For this, it is initially important to correctly choose the securities themselves that will be acquired.  It is allowed to choose several types of shares at once, which allows you to create a diversified investment portfolio.  This approach to investing money allows you to save capital in integrity, as well as quickly increase it. </p><p>  It is possible to invest in stocks of several types: </p><ul><li>  Ordinary shares.  They are called simple in another way.  If available, the shareholder may receive dividends or income from the sale of securities, for which he will have to become a participant in the stock market.  The profit earned by the issuing company is distributed among the shareholders, so the investor‚Äôs income depends on the success of the enterprise.  To do this, take into account what is the proportion of a particular investor in the assets of the organization.  If an investor plans to receive income from resale, then his profit depends on the difference between the purchase and sale price.  If an investor receives in ownership more than 10% of all shares of the company, then he can participate in the management of the enterprise: vote at a meeting of shareholders when making certain management decisions.  If the investor has more than 50% of the shares, then he has a decisive vote in making important decisions. </li><li>  Preference shares.  Most often, citizens and companies prefer to invest in stocks of this type.  This is due to the fact that such securities have some significant advantages.  These include the fact that income is primarily distributed among shareholders.  The amount of dividend payments is represented by a certain constant percentage of profit or fixed amount of funds.  If a company declares itself bankrupt or closes for various reasons, then investors have a priority claim for repayment of losses. </li><li>  Shares of companies producing famous brands.  Such securities are also called ‚Äúblue chips‚Äù.  According to them, shareholders can count on a stable and high income, as well as large dividends.  Such shares are highly liquid, so they can be quickly and profitably sold.  Such investments are rarely unprofitable.  If the investor decides to invest in shares of Russian companies, it is important to ensure the stability and reliability of these enterprises, even if they produce well-known and well-known products. </li></ul><p>  Investing money in any securities is associated with a certain risk, therefore, investors cannot fully insure themselves against losses.  Such investments will be more risky during the crisis in the country, but with a competent approach to choosing the securities themselves, you can count on high profits. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="apnip.water.kg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="invest in shares of Russian companies" class="if uuid-2499194" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2499194.jpg"></div><h2>  Investment Options </h2><p>  Due to the high profitability of this investment, many investors are thinking about how to start investing in stocks.  There are several ways to do this: </p><ul><li>  purchase <span>of securities,</span> for which an investor needs to become a member on the stock exchange; </li><li>  the use of direct investment in a promising and relevant business, for which shares are purchased directly from the issuing organization; </li><li>  purchase of shares in mutual funds, but it is important to choose these investment funds correctly so that they are reliable and stable. </li></ul><p>  Every beginner is interested in how to invest in stocks.  If the investor does not have experience in entrepreneurial activity, but at the same time has significant starting capital, then it is advisable to turn to the stock market.  A large number of securities are freely traded on it, so the investor can get significant benefits without directly participating in the management or development of any company. </p><p>  To obtain high profits, it is necessary to competently choose a profitable strategy, and it is advisable for a beginner to turn to brokerage companies for help.  Professionals will be able to decide which strategy is considered the most profitable based on the knowledge and amount of investor funds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="akersolutions.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to invest in stocks" class="if uuid-2499199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2499199.jpg"></div><h2>  How can I make a profit? </h2><p>  Investing in stocks of a company that is relevant and in demand can be done to achieve different goals.  Investors from such investments can receive both passive and active income.  Therefore, initially, the investor must decide in what way he will make a profit.  You can use different methods for this: </p><ul><li>  regular receipt of dividends, but under such conditions it is required to systematically monitor the financial condition of the company, since if it declares bankrupt or does not make a profit, then payments to shareholders will be low; </li><li>  raising earnings, but this method is considered relevant for experienced investors who can make forecasts regarding the increase or decrease in the rate of specific securities; </li><li>  earnings at depreciation, for which the shares received from a brokerage organization are sold at a high cost, and after depreciation are purchased and returned to the broker. </li></ul><p>  If an investor is interested in a long-term investment of money, then it is optimal to buy securities belonging to successful and reliable companies.  So a shareholder can regularly expect significant dividends.  If the investor wants to understand the rules of raising and lowering the rate, then he is faced with profitable, but at the same time, high-risk investments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bizjournals.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="invest in stocks" class="if uuid-2499189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2499189.jpg"></div><h2>  What stocks to invest in? </h2><p>  If the investor works together with a brokerage company, then specialists can recommend which shares to invest in order to get the highest profit.  If the investor plans to become a direct participant in the securities market, then he must independently decide which shares they will buy. </p><p>  When choosing securities, some nuances are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  they must belong to reliable and popular companies; </li><li>  the company issuing the shares itself must create and sell relevant products that are branded and in demand on the market; </li><li>  it is advisable to invest in securities of different enterprises, which helps to reduce the risk of losses if one of the companies declares itself bankrupt or receives a loss from activities for a long period; </li><li>  the organization should work for a long time. </li></ul><p>  If you follow the above recommendations, it will be very easy to figure out which shares to invest in order not to face significant risks and at the same time rely on high income. </p><h2>  Can I invest in foreign firms? </h2><p>  High income can be received by investors who buy securities belonging to foreign organizations.  How to invest in shares of foreign companies?  In this case, it will be advisable to seek help from brokers. </p><p>  It is important to choose a brokerage company that works directly with foreign enterprises.  In addition, you can independently choose mutual funds or use trust management. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.biggerpockets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to start investing in stocks" class="if uuid-2499198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2499198.jpg"></div><h2>  How to reduce risks? </h2><p>  Investing money in any direction is certainly associated with high risks.  Each investor wants his capital to be preserved and increased, therefore, it is advisable to use certain recommendations to reduce the risk of loss of funds: </p><ul><li>  first you need to familiarize yourself with the various relevant sources of information regarding investing, so that the investor himself has a lot of knowledge about this area of ‚Äã‚Äãinvesting money.  This must be done even if he uses the help of experienced brokers; </li><li>  Before investing any amount of funds, it is recommended to evaluate your financial capabilities in detail; </li><li>  diversification of the investment portfolio is necessarily used: securities of different enterprises are purchased, and not of one company, which allows to reduce the risk of losses in the event of bankruptcy of one company; </li><li>  for beginners, it is advisable to count on a long-term investment of money; </li><li>  at the first investment, you should definitely spend money on consulting specialists; </li><li>  money needs to be invested regularly, so once a month it is recommended to buy or sell securities. </li></ul><p>  Experienced investors recommend saving some of the funds for the purchase of shares from each income in order to increase the capital in circulation.  If you understand how to invest money in shares of large companies, you can become a major shareholder with the securities of well-known and profitable enterprises.  Income from dividends alone can become significant.  With significant changes in the financial position of the organization, it is important to sell or buy its shares, depending on forecasts of further changes in the exchange rate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realisingambitions.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to learn how to invest in stocks" class="if uuid-2499192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2499192.jpg"></div><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  Investing in shares of different enterprises has both positive and negative sides.  The undoubted advantages of such an investment include: </p><ul><li>  the shareholder receives the right to participate in the management of the company; </li><li>  the investor becomes the owner of part of a large and successful enterprise; </li><li>  you can get both passive and active income, and the choice depends on the strategy and desires of the shareholder; </li><li>  liquidity of securities is considered high; </li><li>  depositors are protected from loss of funds by numerous legislative acts. </li></ul><p>  But such an investment has some disadvantages.  For example, income derived from stocks is subject to personal income tax.  If the investor uses the help of a broker, then the brokerage organization acts as a tax agent, therefore it withholds and pays funds to the inspection.  If the shareholder acts independently, then he must calculate and pay tax himself. </p><p>  Other disadvantages include a high risk of loss of funds.  If less than 10% of the company‚Äôs shares are acquired, then the right to manage the company is limited.  If the investor does not have the necessary knowledge to work in the stock market, then he will have to use the help of brokers, which carries additional costs. </p><p>  Therefore, citizens and companies wishing to invest in shares of other enterprises should rationally evaluate all the advantages and disadvantages of such an investment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news.bitcoin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to invest money in stocks" class="if uuid-2499201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/2499201.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Many people think about <span>how to invest in</span> stocks.  To do this, you can use different strategies and investment options. </p><p>  At the initial stage, it is advisable to use the help of brokers or invest in mutual funds.  If the investor works independently in the market, then he must carefully choose the shares of different enterprises.  Such an investment is associated with high risks, so it is important to invest responsibly. </p>
