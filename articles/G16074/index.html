    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Even in the most expensive and luxurious hotel, as a rule, one cannot do without negativity.  The Plaza Hotel (Volgograd) was no exception.  Reviews of it contain negative comments as follows: </p><ul><li>  the rooms are very hot, despite the presence of air conditioning (no matter how you try to regulate the temperature, nothing changes); </li><li>  the attitude of the staff towards the guests can be called dismissive (with the exception of individual employees); </li><li>  there is no hood in the bathroom, which is the reason for the increased humidity; </li><li>  in the information folder, which is provided in the room, there is no information about the menu and prices of the restaurant; </li><li>  when paying for services in cash, the guests are not given a check; </li><li>  the breakfast menu is quite scarce, in addition, if you linger by the beginning you will have to be content with leftovers (products at the distribution do not replenish); </li><li>  despite the fact that the start of breakfast is announced from 7 a.m., in fact it starts an hour later (this is extremely inconvenient for those who have strictly planned time); </li><li>  not all lighting fixtures work in the rooms; </li><li>  in some rooms there are no remotes from the air conditioners (you have to turn it on manually); </li><li>  in the corridors and rooms there is a pungent smell of tobacco smoke (and this despite the fact that smoking is prohibited on the territory); </li><li>  when the hotel hosts weddings and other events with a large number of guests, guests are asked to vacate the parking lot; </li><li>  poor sound insulation (when the maids clean the corridor early in the morning, everything is heard in the room); </li><li>  dirty carpet in the rooms (it is unpleasant to walk on it barefoot); </li><li>  bed linen and towels are not entirely new; </li><li>  in double rooms for some reason only one set of towels is provided; </li><li>  the hotel‚Äôs restaurant often hosts weddings and other banquets, the noise of which lasts almost until the morning and keeps you awake; </li><li>  there are problems with paying with plastic cards; </li><li>  the ironing room only works until 6 pm, and therefore, if you have an event planned for the evening, you have to prepare things in advance; </li><li>  when the water in the coolers ends, the bottles are in no hurry to change, but because for some time you have to buy water yourself; </li><li>  Economy rooms do not have a refrigerator; </li><li>  unstable operation of wireless Internet (for social networks, speed is quite enough, but watching a movie or listening to music will not work); </li><li>  there are no windows in the economy class rooms; </li><li>  expensive breakfasts (300 rubles); </li><li>  in some rooms large black beetles crawl, which enter the room through the ventilation system; </li><li>  the room has few outlets (to charge a smartphone or tablet, you have to turn off the TV, air conditioning or lights); </li><li>  there are no mosquito nets on the windows, and given the poor operation of the air conditioner, this is a serious problem; </li><li>  rooms are not prepared for arrival (you may be given a key to the room, which was not cleaned after previous residents); </li><li>  due to poor ventilation, the smell of sewage is always in the bathroom, and a fungus appears on the tile. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Choosing a place to stay is not an easy task, because the hotel becomes your second home at the time of the trip.  Speaking about the Plaza Hotel, it is worth saying that it impresses with its luxury.  But this is only at first glance.  After spending a little time in the room, you begin to notice flaws.  Though, by and large, not so significant, nevertheless they suggest that the high status of a hotel is not always a guarantee of quality service.  However, we hope that the hotel administration will soon eliminate all the above problems and the Plaza Hotel will receive only enthusiastic reviews from its guests in the future. </p>
