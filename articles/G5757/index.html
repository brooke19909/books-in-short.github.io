Often at fashion shows, you can see clothes and various accessories decorated with beads.  There are also elements of clothing made entirely of beads, woven from it.  Models defile on the catwalks in dresses generously strewn with bead dots, drops and even pendants.  A lot of beaded jewelry participates in shows. </p><p>  Those who already have <span>experience</span> with this material - beads, decorate with their masterpieces everything that they want.  You can decorate a handbag, a dress, and even shoes.  And you can create a set of jewelry yourself, for example a bracelet and necklace, or weave roses from beads for brooches or hairpins. </p><p>  Red roses from beads look beautiful on a black beaded necklace.  All these works are unique and inimitable. </p><p>  There are several options for learning: </p><p>  - You can enroll in courses where they teach beadwork; </p><p>  - watching video tutorials, you can learn yourself; </p><p>  - using special literature, also learn yourself. </p><p>  Having a printed publication containing visual, step-by-step instructions on the photo, you gradually, with your own hands, create a unique masterpiece. </p><p>  Weaving roses from beads will allow you to become the sole owner of a unique jewelry.  Following the advice of the master class, you yourself will do whatever you want. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To start work you will need various materials: </p><p>  - several bead needles (preferably different numbers); </p><p>  - silk, acrylic or kapron threads; </p><p>  Of course, the color and number (thickness) of the threads will depend entirely on the beads used.  Size, number of needles also depends on the selected beads. </p><p>  - beads required for your work; </p><p>  - a wire may be needed, with its help elastic structures are created, for example, if you want to weave a rose from beads with your own hands, then you will need it.  More often they use copper wire. </p><p>  - fishing line, used for lighter products and structures.  Teens, when they are fond of weaving baubles and bracelets, often choose this material for their hobby.  The line is tear resistant, much stronger than wire or thread. </p><p>  The product that you will perform on the threads will repeat your movements, slide behind you, emphasizing your lightness.  But <span>weaving roses</span> from beads on threads is not desirable, since the form will not hold. </p><p>  There is still monofilament.  This is a fishing line that combines all the best qualities and threads and fishing lines.  Although thin, it is very durable.  Having the ability to pass into the hole of the beads with multiple additions, it creates, thus, particularly durable products.  Roses from beads made using such a fishing line, very durable and light.  Monofilament can also be used for embroidery with beads.  Rubber thread is very convenient to use for the manufacture of bracelets, necklaces, hair hoops.  Its good extensibility allows you to make products without the use of a fastener. </p><p>  So, having all the necessary materials for bead creations, consider some basic techniques for weaving.  The following techniques exist for you to learn.  For example, weaving ‚Äúcrosses‚Äù, ‚Äúlittle rings‚Äù, ‚Äúparallel weaving‚Äù, ‚Äúweaving a mosaic with even rows of beads‚Äù, ‚Äúweaving a mosaic with an odd number of beads in rows‚Äù, weaving cords using the ‚Äúspiral‚Äù technique, weaving cords of ‚Äúcolumns‚Äù. </p><p>  We wish you to understand all the intricacies of working with beads, create masterpieces and enjoy the admiring glances of others! </p>
