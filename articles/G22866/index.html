It is located in the north of the country, on the border with France and Germany, on the River Rhine.  Basel is famous for its amazing museums of world scale, a large carnival, which is not inferior in its scope to the Venetian, and the old city.  For tourists, this is a real paradise.  In our article we want to talk about what to see in Basel (Switzerland). </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="47.55959860000001" data-lng="7.588576099999955" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/9/7/6/2976.png"></div><h2>  A bit about the city ... </h2><p>  The city of Basel in Switzerland was founded by the Romans in 44 BC.  e.  in the territory of the Celtic settlement.  The first mention of it in written sources dates back to the year 374.  Already in the eighth century the city became the center of the episcopate, and in the thirteenth century the first bridge over the Rhine River was erected in it.  Basel is developing rapidly as a transport and trade center.  And in 1459 the first university appeared. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.escapismmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Basel in Switzerland" class="if uuid-2452747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2452747.jpg"></div><p>  Today in Basel (Switzerland) there are a large number of banks, offices, large shopping centers and transport organizations.  It is worth noting that the local river port is the only access to the sea for the whole of Switzerland.  The city has the first musical theater, second-hand bookstores, numerous art galleries, bars and restaurants.  Locals have a ‚Äúhabit‚Äù of vacationing in Germany, shopping in France, and living in Switzerland.  This feature has become the object of numerous jokes and stories.  Currently, Basel has the status of the most conservative and richest city in Switzerland, the locals are very proud of it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Historically, the Rhine River divided the city into two parts: in the northeast is Small Basel, and in the south-west is Big Basel, which is the historical center.  Here is also located the Cathedral, which is considered one of the main attractions of the city. </p><h2>  Basel Zoo </h2><p>  According to tourists, one of the attractions of Basel (Switzerland) is the zoo.  It is located in the very center of the city and occupies about 12 hectares.  The zoo is a large park area where you can see animals if they want to appear to visitors, and not because the enclosures are built in such a way that the animals are in sight.  All information about the zoo is painted on a board near the entrance to each territory.  So, for example, there is a zone where you can admire the cubs.  The Bezelsky Zoo is beautiful at any time of the year.  In the spring, you can admire the awakening of nature and look at the born babies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zoobasel.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zoo in Basel" class="if uuid-2452748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2452748.jpg"></div><p>  In the hot summer in the shade of the trees you can have a great time watching elephants and primates.  In winter, it is worth admiring the mysterious coral reefs or the world of the Amazon River in large heated aquariums.  In the zoo, photo and video are allowed in almost the entire territory.  The enclosures here are designed in such a way that you can take beautiful pictures and at the same time fences will not fall into the lens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Basel Town Hall </h2><p>  Another <span>attraction of Basel</span> (Switzerland) is the town hall.  The sixteenth-century building is built of red sandstone.  Its facade faces the main square of Marktplatz. </p><p>  In 1290, the mayor's office was located on this site, which was destroyed by the 1356 earthquake.  The archive of the whole city was completely lost.  Instead of the old building, the Palace of Lords was rebuilt, in which the city municipality is located.  In 1501, Basel became part of the <span>Swiss Confederation.</span>  The Great Council decided to build the town hall building, which was to be connected by a passage with the Palace of Lords. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wherewouldyougo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Town Hall in Basel" class="if uuid-2452759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2452759.jpg"></div><p>  Construction work began in 1504 and lasted for ten years.  The Palace of Lords was behind the new building and was also slightly rebuilt.  It was equipped with a room for the Great Council, which was decorated with stunning frescoes.  The Palace of Lords is the oldest part of the town hall.  In the twentieth century, another wing and tower were added to the central building.  Initially, residents negatively perceived such innovations.  But now they cannot imagine a city without a town hall and its tower. </p><h2>  Puppet Museum </h2><p>  Basel is a city in Switzerland whose attractions attract tourists from different countries.  Among them, you can find something that will be interesting to you personally.  The city is literally filled with various interesting places.  Tourists recommend visiting the local puppet museum, which is considered the largest museum of similar subjects in Europe.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe premises is more than 1000 square meters.  The ancient building was built in 1867, so it can be safely attributed to the category of local attractions.  The museum consists of four floors with spacious rooms.  The exposure is so large that it is difficult to see it at a time.  Therefore, the administration of the institution has compiled electronic catalogs, which contain information about all exhibits.  The museum stores not only teddy bears and dolls, but also toy houses and utensils, which relates to doll life.  Among the exhibits you can see what our great-grandmothers and great-grandfathers played. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.thestar.com.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Puppet Museum" class="if uuid-2452773" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2452773.jpg"></div><p>  The collection consists of toys created from the beginning of the nineteenth century to the present day.  The first mechanical dolls, various bears in gingerbread houses and even a series of dolls from famous manufacturers are stored here.  All exhibits were collected from different parts of the world or donated by former owners.  But there are also toys that were made by order of the museum.  Visitors can order a copy of the dolls on display. </p><h2>  City bridge </h2><p>  The Mittler Br√ºcke city bridge in Basel (Switzerland) has a long history.  It was built in 1226 by decree of Bishop Heinrich of Thun.  The oldest bridge in the city rightfully bears the title of one of the most popular attractions.  It was to protect the bridge that the archbishop created the fortified Small Basel. </p><p>  Mittler Brucke has an interesting story.  Initially, it consisted of two parts - one was wooden, and the second - stone.  They say that this was done due to the fact that the depth of the river off the coast from different sides was different.  But according to another version, the bridge was built in such a way that during the war it could be burned, dividing the Big and Small Basel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="paradiseintheworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bridge in Basel" class="if uuid-2452755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2452755.jpg"></div><p>  For many years the bridge remained the only one across the Rhine.  The city was actively growing and developing, and therefore there was a need to build new bridges.  After the appearance of the tram service in Basel in 1905, Mittler Brucke had to rebuild.  And since then he looks in a new way.  From two sides at the base of the bridge are decorated with figures of the famous bully king.  Here you can see a copy of the small chapel, where death sentences were brought into effect in the Middle Ages.  In that distant era, it was believed that a woman thrown from a bridge should drown if she is a witch.  If she survived, then charges of witchcraft were dropped from her. </p><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  The symbol of the city of Basel in Switzerland is the Cathedral, which is a basilica in the late Romanesque style.  Its walls are made of red sandstone.  And on top of the building is a red tile roof.  In 1258, the cathedral was damaged by fire, as a result of which the temple had to be renovated.  But in 1356 the building was damaged by a strong earthquake, after which it was rebuilt again in the style of that era, as evidenced by the interior. </p><h2>  University Botanical Garden </h2><p>  Of great interest to visitors to the city of Basel in Switzerland is the University Botanical Garden.  Walking on it will bring a lot of impressions.  It was founded in 1589 and is considered the oldest in the world.  The garden belongs to the Botanical Faculty.  It is open to visitors throughout the year.  Its territory consists of several sections that are located on the street: rock garden, grove, ferns, Mediterranean plants and others.  There are also greenhouses in which tropical representatives, succulents, water lilies grow.  But in the cold greenhouse there are those plants that are very sensitive to cold.  Their location in the garden varies with the season.  Among the plants of the botanical garden, there are even those that are considered extinct.  For all comers, guided tours are organized around the territory. </p><h2>  Museum of Anatomy </h2><p>  Basel in Switzerland is famous for its museums.  Among them is the <span>Anatomical Museum,</span> which was founded in 1924.  Its founder was K. G. Jung.  The museum was created on the basis of the medical faculty of the university, which rightfully bears the title of the oldest in the city.  Within the walls of the institution there are interesting anatomical exhibits that have been here since its inception. </p><p>  In addition, the museum has a collection of unique things that played an important role in the development of anatomy.  Within the walls of the institution you can see not only the permanent exhibition, but also temporary exhibitions dedicated to the human body. </p><p>  The museum exhibits are arranged in such a way that, moving from one to another, you can study the activity of different systems of our body.  The structure of human organs can be thoroughly examined on interactive models.  Since 1850, the museum presents wax models. </p><h2>  Basel synagogue </h2><p>  The first Jews in Basel (Switzerland) appeared in the twelfth century.  Over time, they built a temple for themselves.  But in 1349, the Jews were accused of poisoning the water in the wells, after which 1300 people were burned in the main square.  Those Jews who survived were expelled from the city.  They were able to return back at the end of the sixteenth century, when Basel became one of the major centers for printing books in Hebrew.  After the French Revolution, Jews from Alsace moved to the city, where they were threatened with constant pogroms. </p><p>  The modern community dates back to 1805.  Then in the city lived only 70 Jews, now there are about a thousand.  Basel now has not only a synagogue, but also Jewish schools and libraries.  The Great Synagogue was built in 1868.  The building accommodates 200 men and as many women. </p><h2>  Weather in Basel (Switzerland) </h2><p>  If you plan to visit this unique city and see its sights, then you will certainly be interested in weather conditions.  The weather in Basel (Switzerland) is determined by a very mild climate.  In this region, in comparison with other areas of Switzerland, there is always a lot of sun.  And in the autumn there are almost no fogs.  The average daily temperature in summer is +20.5 degrees, and in winter - +2.8.  Experienced tourists say that you can visit the city at any time of the year.  Even in the summer, you can not be afraid of the heat, because the region is characterized by moderate temperatures in the warm season.  Here you will not be bothered by the grueling heat if you want to see the sights. </p><h2>  Basel Carnival </h2><p>  The city gained world fame not only thanks to outstanding sights and museums.  Glorified Basel in Switzerland carnival, which lasts annually for three days.  Celebrations begin on Monday in the first week of Lent.  The procession of the mummers begins at four in the morning in the dark.  Over the next 72 hours, the whole city is in full swing.  Along the main street along which the mummers are walking, there is not a single empty table in the cafe, because everyone celebrates.  In fairness, it is worth noting that the locals call the holiday Fasnaht, and the word "carnival" is considered offensive, because their holiday has its own characteristics and color. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.myswitzerland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Carnival in Basel" class="if uuid-2452783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2452783.jpg"></div><p>  Pancake week processions in the city of Basel (Switzerland) began to be held back in the Roman era.  Of course, in those days, the carnival looked very different.  In its modern form, the holiday script developed a little over a hundred years ago.  Local communities come up with costumes for processions and awesome masks.  Citizens with great trepidation belong to the traditional carnival in Basel (Switzerland).  Confetti of different colors, costumes, scary masks and wigs - all these are symbols of a great three-day performance.  Only those associations of people who have previously submitted an application can take part in it.  Outsiders are simply not allowed.  But absolutely all tourists can look at a wonderful action.  The main difference between Fakhsnat and other carnivals lies in the costumes of the participants.  They are very specific.  You will not see such mummers anywhere else in the world. </p><p>  It should be noted that annually a lot of money is spent on preparing the holiday.  Costumes and traditional multi-colored lanterns are made anew every year, inventing something new. </p><h2>  Football </h2><p>  The city of Basel in Switzerland (photo is given in the article) is of genuine interest to all football fans.

Locals are very proud of the achievements of the club.  It is worth noting that Basel was the leader among the Swiss teams from the late sixties to the end of the seventies.  In subsequent decades, the club was not so successful.  A new rise occurred in 2000. </p><p>  All football fans with bated breath watched the match of the Champions League Manchester City (England) and Basel (Switzerland) on February 13 this year, which was extremely important for the Swiss club.

Within its walls is a large collection of art of the country.  The exposition was based on a large collection of Basilius Amerbach.  Over the years of the museum's existence, its funds were replenished with objects bequeathed or donated by wealthy citizens.  So, for example, a city artist named Samuel Birman bequeathed half of the acquired property and his collection to the museum on the condition that at his expense paintings from contemporary Swiss artists would be acquired. </p><p>  Currently, the largest international collection of paintings by artists of the Holbein dynasty is stored in the walls of the institution.
