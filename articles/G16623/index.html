The settlement itself is positioned as a tourist attraction.  There is something to see for visitors - a castle from the Middle Ages, an African village, etc. However, this is not what he became famous throughout the world for. </p><p>  ‚ÄúWhat is unique about it?‚Äù  - you ask.  Succo Lake with <span>swamp cypresses!</span>  Surprised ?!  Yes it's true.  Although this tree, by all laws of nature, should not grow in this area, but it has taken root well and pleases both locals and tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="succo lake" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1574693.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is in your name? </h2><p>  Many tourists wonder why Lake Sukko got such a name.  There are many versions.  Someone says that it is named after the village, others claim that, on the contrary, the lake gave the name to the village.  If you delve into the translation of the word "succo", it becomes clear that we are talking about a reservoir.  For example, from Turkish it is translated as ‚Äúwater dolphin‚Äù, and from Adyghe - ‚Äúreservoir for pigs‚Äù.  Locals call <span>Lake Sukko Kiparisovym,</span> which is quite symbolic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="succo lake how to get" class="if" height="404" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1574694.jpg" width="600"></div>

Their wood is completely not subject to decay, therefore it is considered eternal.  According to some versions, cypress trees in the lake appeared more than a century ago.  They have unique properties, so many people try to come here every year. </p><p>  This type of tree is unusual for this area.  They grow in the latitudes of North America.  How did cypress trees appear in Anapa region?  Locals tell different stories.  According to one, in the 30s of the twentieth century an experiment was conducted, the purpose of which was to check whether swamp cypresses would take root in an unusual climate for them.  And a miracle happened.  Now Sukko Lake has become a local attraction. </p><p>  But there is another legend.  It says that for a long time a noble family lived in this territory.  For some unknown reason, their son died.  And in memory of him cypresses were planted.  There is no way to verify the reliability of this legend, however the more interesting the story, the more mysterious the attraction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Succo Lake with Swamp Cypresses" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1574695.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sukko Lake - how to get there? </h2><p>  It is recommended to get to <span>Cypress Lake</span> by car - private car or taxi.  First you need to take a direction to the village of Sukko.  There you can ask the locals for directions or find a pointer to the lake on your own (it is located on the outskirts).  Entrance to the territory is paid - about 500 rubles.  There is no organized parking space.  If you don‚Äôt want to pay for the trip, you need to take care in advance about where to leave the car while you are on the lake. </p><p>  If there is no personal car, you can take bus number 109. Using this transport, you need to get off at the Lukomorye stop.  In the summer season, shuttle taxis often travel from Anapa.  They have a route indicated on the windshield. </p><p>  Lake Sukko is surrounded on one side by a forest.  It will take you about 15 minutes to go through it, but it's worth it, since it is from here that you can swim closer to unique trees.  On the other hand, there are places intended for recreation with tents and an excellent beach, equipped with everything necessary for a wonderful pastime. </p>
