Some of these tourists prefer to get to the sea not by train or plane, but by private car. </p><p>  Of course, this method loses time to the airplane, but it is very economical, especially if a whole family of three or more people is going to rest.  In this case, you will have to spend only on fuel for the car, meals during the trip, as well as on rest at the hotel, if the trip turns out to be especially long. </p><p>  <span>The federal highway</span> M4 ‚ÄúDon‚Äù, along which many residents of Moscow and other cities go towards the Black Sea, offers motorists various options for overnight stay and relaxation.  These are modest motels and decent hotels, some of which are located in close proximity to the highway.  One of the great places where you can rest during a long journey is the Rodina Hotel (Rostov-on-Don). </p><h2>  Road to the sea </h2><p>  The highway with the marking M4, which is called "Don", has a total length of 1,517 km.  It originates in Moscow, runs through Krasnodar and Dzhubga and ends in the coastal city of Novorossiysk.  Today, many sections of this route have become high-speed, which allows you to quickly cover the entire distance and find yourself on the Black Sea coast. </p>

    <p>  For example, getting to the Rostov Region by car from Moscow in a day is very real, even making small stops for snacks and other necessities of life.  This is approximately 12-13 hours of travel, subject to all speed limits and with little respite.  After such a long rally, I really want to relax and even sleep, especially for drivers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is for such travelers, as well as for numerous truckers throughout the route, there are various hotels and motels that are happy to take everyone under their roofs.  They are available in the Voronezh region, and not far from Pavlovsk, and in the Krasnodar Territory, and, of course, in the Rostov Region. </p><h2>  Great rest on the track </h2><p>  Hotel Rodina (Rostov-on-Don, M4), located just 100 meters from the exit of the highway, will be a great place to relax after a long and busy road. </p><p>  The building of this roadside hotel consists of three floors and is decorated with natural stone.  It is made in the style of <span>German houses,</span> where the half-timbered construction often prevails.  Hotel Rodina (Rostov-on-Don) takes on special beauty in the dark when the lights turn on. </p>

    <p>  Tourists traveling by car just need to drive up to 1076 km of the M4 highway and just 100 m from it.

Each of them is equipped with two single beds or a large double bed, bedside tables, a desk, air conditioning, an LCD TV, a minibar with a variety of snacks and drinks, a telephone, slippers, a hairdryer, a set of hygiene items.  Also, as a compliment, guests are offered mineral water, coffee, sugar and its substitute and tea.
