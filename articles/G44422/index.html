    <h2>  <span>Turkey Resorts</span> in the Mediterranean Sea </h2><p>  The only vehicle delivering tourists to their destination is an airplane.  Samara-Turkey, it is a very popular route today.  Direct flights are operated by Orenburg Airlines, and the final destination is Alania.  Other resorts can only be reached with a change, for example, via Moscow.  This resort town is characterized by economical hotels with comfortable conditions, without unnecessary luxury.  Tourists note excellent service and good food.  The downside is the distance from the airport. </p><p>  The second economy resort is Side.  The distance from the airport is compensated by "luxury" hotels at affordable prices.  Antalya closes the top three, an excellent resort, but the entrance to the sea is uncomfortable, immediately a steep cliff.  For families with children is not very suitable. </p><p>  The most expensive and luxurious areas of Turkey are the resorts of Belek and Kundu.  They are the youngest on the coast, equipped with modern infrastructure.  Here are luxury hotels, sandy beaches with a smooth deepening into the sea, the town is close to the airport, if you are used to luxury, then here you are. </p><p>  For lovers of affordable shopping and cheap excursions, Turkey opens its doors.  Kemer from Samara receives the largest number of tourists.  This resort is located in the coastal strip between the sea and the mountains.  Mountains protect from the winds, and the sea guarantees the mildest climate.  Beach lovers should know that they will have to lie on pebbles.  The beaches near the hotels are covered with sand, and entering the sea is still pebbled.  In Kemer, nightlife is in full swing, there are a huge number of clubs where celebrities come to concerts very often. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Ride with children </h2><p>  Turkey is the best holiday destination for a young family with kids.  Each hotel is equipped with a playground; there, the baby will not be bored for sure.  A well-developed animation service and a full staff of caring nannies will allow parents to fully enjoy their vacation.  Separately, it should be noted that it is necessary to choose the autumn months, when the air temperature is close to the usual one - this will help the child more easily transfer <span>rest in Turkey.</span>  Prices for tickets at this time are much lower, which is very important for a young family.  If in the season a tour for 7 days can be purchased for $ 1,000 or more, then in September-October it can be purchased for $ 500-700. </p><p>  The cost depends on the chosen resort.  The most economical are Alanya, Antalya, Kemer.  The number of stars at your hotel will also affect the amount you pay.  I must say that the service here is wonderful everywhere, from a modest 3 stars to suites. </p><h2>  Turkish cuisine </h2><p>  It is quite sophisticated and at the same time not too exotic, which all guests like.  Both vegans and meat lovers will find a dish to their taste here.  The abundance of vegetables, herbs, fish, baked in many ways meat and, of course, sweets will delight the whole family and even small sweet ones.  The most popular kebab is meat, fish or poultry baked over an open fire. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Arriving in Turkey from Samara, be sure to visit the local markets.  This is an opportunity to replenish the wardrobe with fashion news for affordable money.  Do not be afraid to bargain, for local trade this is normal, so in most cases you won‚Äôt succeed (not enough experience).  But if the seller will like your style of negotiating, he will make a discount. </p><p>  Arriving home, you will favorably stand out against the general background, because there are either no such things in stores, or their prices are simply cosmic.  Sometimes weekend tours are organized from Samara to Turkey just for shopping, and they select not only the time of year (closer to the end of the season), but also the day.  After lunch, discounts are usually more noticeable than in the morning.  Thus, going on a vacation from Samara to Turkey is a great idea that needs to be realized! </p>
