    <p>  Today we will consider a security system from a domestic manufacturer - StarLine A93: reviews, range, basic characteristics, and also indicate the advantages and disadvantages of individual rulers.  In addition, we compare the A93 model with similar devices from competitors for a more visual picture. </p><h2>  Variations of the A93 series </h2><p>  The series is available in several branches with different configurations, each of which has some of its own characteristics, as well as advantages and disadvantages. </p><p>  Variations: </p><ol><li>  Eso. </li><li>  GSM </li><li>  CAN LIN. </li></ol><p>  We will analyze each A93 line in more detail, and on the last branch we will pay special attention, because the feedback from the owners on StarLine A93 CAN LIN is the most flattering. </p><h2>  Eso </h2><p>  The configuration of the A93 system marked ‚ÄúEco‚Äù is a budget option.  It includes only the most necessary functionality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The list of basic functions: </p><ul><li>  128-bit encryption with individual keys; </li><li>  interference protection for signal stability; </li><li>  the presence of an energy-efficient power system (profitability); </li><li>  self-diagnosis; </li><li>  tracking and protection of the communication channel; </li><li>  acceptable work in difficult climatic conditions; </li><li>  sensors for tilt and shock. </li></ul><p>  Owner reviews about the <span>StarLine A93</span> in this configuration are mixed.  Many users purchased the Eso version precisely at the expense of a modest price tag, therefore they understand that it is not worth waiting for something supernatural from this system.  Nevertheless, she copes with her main task quite tolerably.  In addition, the model received a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù start-up function (by timer, by temperature overboard, etc.) and a flexible service channel for finer <span>tuning of StarLine</span> A93 (F1).  Reviews about careful tuning are entirely positive: the owner can independently organize the optimal operation of the system, where under his control are parameters such as sensitivity of the sensors, the noiselessness of certain modes, the maximum volume of the siren and other characteristics. </p><h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  Also in the budget line of Eco there is the possibility of integrating blocks, which allows you to make it if not premium, then middle class for sure.  In the list of optional equipment, you can note such useful things as a GSM module, access to a car without a key, an ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù lock, PIN authorization, and also installing a CAN LIN unit. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In general, the reviews on <span>StarLine A93 signaling</span> in the Eco configuration are positive, but many users, even despite the quite affordable price tag, really lack such advanced monitoring and security functions as GSM and GPS systems. </p><h2>  GSM </h2><p>  This is a more modern and advanced configuration of the A93 security system.  The presence of the GSM-unit allowed to significantly expand the alarm functionality. </p>

Despite minor flaws that relate to mounting on old cars (there is no function without keyless entry, autostart), the system turned out to be balanced.  Many users were attracted by the presence of a telematic security complex, which allows you to track the car and its current status via GSM and GPS channels.  Also, the alarm can be modified as in the case of Eco to a more advanced version by adding a CAN LIN block. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  CAN LIN </h2><p>  In this modification there are several variable branches: CAN LIN, adapted for the Russian Federation and the CIS - 2CAN 2LIN and the premium version - 2CAN 2LIN GSM Eco Slave. We will examine each variation in more detail, starting with the first.  In the basic version there is no functionality that allows you to track a car over a long distance, but judging by the reviews on StarLine A93 CAN LIN, this problem can be easily solved by installing additional GPS / GSM blocks. </p>

    <p>  This modification is incompatible with old cars that are not equipped with modern interfaces for working with new security systems.  The alarm will work, but some important functions will remain unavailable.  Therefore, before buying a system, be sure to check with the dealer for its compatibility with your car, or at least read reviews on the StarLine A93 CAN LIN car alarm in specialized forums.  You can also find cars supported by the A93 series at the company's official resource. </p><h2>  Hardware Features </h2><p>  CAN LIN modification has the following set of functions: </p><ul><li>  128-bit key binding encryption code; </li><li>  the presence of sensible protection against interference and external radio interference; </li><li>  energy efficient system; </li><li>  self-diagnosis; </li><li>  management of all communication channels; </li><li>  work in difficult climatic conditions; </li><li>  tilt and shock level sensors; </li><li>  universal set of interfaces for service and individual service. </li></ul><p>  In addition, the CAN LIN system supports user authorization by pin code, "silent" lock, "smart" autostart and access to the machine without a key.  Reviews about StarLine A93 CAN LIN are almost entirely positive: here there is cryptographic stability, and extended locking on technical routes, and ‚Äúsmart‚Äù sensors, that is, after installing the system, the car meets all the requirements for protecting vehicles from theft. </p><h2>  2CAN 2LIN </h2><p>  This modification is almost identical to the previous one, with the only difference being that it was developed specifically for 2010-2016 cars.  issues that are sold in the Russian Federation and the CIS.  As in the first case, the system is deprived of long-distance communication modules (GPS, GSM), but with the possibility of subsequent installation of the latter. </p>

    <p>  Reviews on StarLine A93 of this modification are twofold.  A good half of motorists, those who prefer self-installation and configuration of security systems, complain about the inadequacy of the alarm system: ‚Äúthoughtfulness‚Äù, inconsistent control, constant self-diagnosis and other shortcomings.  But here, in the vast majority of cases, the problem is simply in the incorrect installation of the equipment: the machine is designed for the usual CAN LIN bus, and the master novice installs a specific version of 2CAN 2LIN - this is the reason for the complications.  In addition, judging by the polynomial reviews on the StarLine A93, this tire is much more confusing (in terms of installation) of the previous modification.  Therefore, the installation of such a serious security system is better to put on the shoulders of professionals. </p><p>  Key features: </p><ul><li>  radio interference protection; </li><li>  self-diagnosis; </li><li>  ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù tilt and shock level sensors; </li><li>  bilateral protection; </li><li>  work in a wide range of climatic conditions; </li><li>  stability of the system during power surges; </li><li>  universal interfaces for service and individual service; </li><li>  full control of communication channels. </li></ul><p>  In addition, the security system includes such modern functions as Super Slave, ‚Äúsmart‚Äù engine start, user authorization by pin code, ‚Äúsilent‚Äù lock and access to the car without a key.  In general, the reviews on the StarLine A93 version 2CAN 2LIN regarding the capabilities are good.  Almost all car owners respond positively to ‚Äúsmart‚Äù sensors and to work flawlessly in the harsh Russian climate.  Also, many were pleased with the reliable cryptosystem, which completely blocks the ability to intercept an individual security code. </p><h2>  2CAN 2LIN GSM Eco Slave </h2><p>  This modification can be called as "all inclusive", that is, the maximum possible equipment.  This is a full-fledged and multifunctional security complex, which is able to provide reliable protection for your car.  Here we have advanced long-distance monitoring, coupled with a cryptocurrency dialog code.  This modification is designed to work with cars on the same name tires released in 2010-2016.  for the territories of the Russian Federation and the CIS. </p>

The DX50 model has a more impressive range of tags, a large number of sensors throughout the body, the compactness of the system and the most secure communication channel at a frequency of 868 MHz. </p>

    <p>  The domestic competitor represented by Pandora turned out to be attractive in many respects.  The Russian company did its best to launch an alarm with good noise immunity, cryptographic and with an extensive working radius.  But the disadvantages are not to be noted.  The first is the price.  The basic and simplest configuration of the DX50 costs the same as Starline with a GSM and GPS monitoring system.  In addition, our respondent has a powerful siren with the ability to adjust, but the competitor does not.  It is also worth noting the noticeably greater sensitivity of Pandora to stress transfer, while Starline behaves much more stable in the most difficult situations. </p><p>  Only the car owner should decide which alarm system to choose - the difference between these two competing models is not that big.  But it should be noted that if you need regular monitoring of all possible parts of the car, excellent noise immunity and range of use, then your choice is Pandora.  Look for maximum functionality and increased reliability - you are on the shelf for Starline systems. </p>
