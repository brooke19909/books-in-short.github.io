Photos, layouts and customer reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, St. Petersburg developers are actively exploring the suburban territories of the metropolis.  For the construction of <span>residential complexes,</span> among others, the lands of the Vsevolozhsk district of the Leningrad region are also used.  Not far from the village of Kudrovo located on its territory, the construction of houses of the residential complex "Seven Capitals" has begun.  Vienna, its first quarter, has already been commissioned.  At this stage, work is underway on the construction of high-rise buildings of the second stage of construction.  LCD “Seven capitals.  Quarter London ”- this name means an object in the project.  This unique <span>residential complex</span> specifically, as well as the entire microdistrict as a whole, will be discussed in this review. </p><h2>  What explains the name of the complex? </h2><p>  When creating the project, the developer took as a basis the images and <span>architectural concepts of the</span> best capitals of the world.  As a result, a whole microdistrict should be built, each of whose quarters will be created in the likeness of those available in one of the seven capitals of the world.  Hence the name.  The first quarter, already commissioned in 2014, is called Vienna.  All the apartments in it belonging to the comfort class are currently completely sold out.  So, by and large, to talk about him does not make sense.  But the second quarter of the Seven Capitals residential complex, London, deserves attention, part of which has already been commissioned and some of which are at the construction stage.  As for the remaining five quarters, there is no information regarding their names.  The project is multi-scale, the process of its implementation, according to the builder, will last 17 years, so most likely, all the other "capitals" so far are only in plans or are under development. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd seven capitals" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1293040.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, one can already understand from the two quarters presented - the complex is truly unique and deserves the closest attention from potential buyers. </p><h2>  Where is the residential complex located? </h2><p>  So where to look for this miracle?  Where is the Seven Capitals residential complex located?  Kudrovo, Vsevolozhsk district of the Leningrad region - this is where all interested buyers will find this wonderful object.  By the way, do not be afraid of the words "district" and "region".  In fact, the village is located near the south-eastern outskirts of St. Petersburg, at the intersection of the Murmansk highway and the ring.  In the immediate vicinity of it - three kilometers away - there is the metro station “Dybenko Street”, so we can assume that the location of the residential complex “Seven Capitals” is St. Petersburg. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  The creator and implementer of this original project is the Setl City construction and investment company, which operates as part of the Setl Group holding.  SK has been in the real estate market since 1994, its activities have been marked by state awards and prizes more than once.  The company’s assets include more than a dozen existing facilities, which everyone speaks of only in a positive way.  The developer has an excellent reputation in the market, is respected and trusted by customers, as he is renting out all his properties on time and without any imperfections.  Currently, the company is developing more than six million "squares" of living space, including square meters of the Seven Capitals residential complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc seven capitals vienna" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1293041.jpg" width="600"></div>

In total it is supposed to put up for sale 11 634 apartments.  Three houses have already been commissioned, an active sale of residential premises is underway.  By the way, it is worth noting that the apartments are sold out quite quickly.  About 85% of the housing represented in the quarter are studios and odnushki.  The remaining apartments in the residential complex "Seven Capitals" - two and three bedroom apartments.  In parallel with the construction of buildings, there is the construction of three d / s, as well as a large school.  But why, after all, “London”?  Everything is explained by the European layout of the apartments, the restrained "English" appearance of the facades of the buildings, combined with a bright design, as well as the promise of the developer to create comfort in the microdistrict corresponding to the level of this capital. </p><p>  All high-rise buildings erected using brick-monolithic technology will be located around a kind of center - the square of Europe, from which wide pedestrian paths diverge in all directions.  The first floors of some buildings will be given for commercial real estate.  The completion date for the entire quarter is the end of 2018.  But now you can buy apartments on the basis of equity participation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apartments in seven capitals" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1293042.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Further - in more detail about what are the apartments, transport, environment and infrastructure in London. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  Vsevolozhsk district has always been considered relatively prosperous in terms of environmental conditions.  There are no large production facilities, but there are plenty of forests and natural bodies of water.  In addition, the developer singled out as a separate item in the work plan not only the landscaping of the microdistrict, but also the improvement of the wetlands adjacent to it.  Landscaped park areas will be created here. </p><h2>  Transport connection </h2><p>  The nearest metro station "Dybenko Street" can be reached on foot in twenty-five minutes.  If there is none, then there is the opportunity to use the services of public transport.  At the moment, there are three stops, one of which is located next to the buildings of the residential complex "Seven Capitals".  In addition, the construction is underway - already almost next to the complex - of the new Kudrovo metro station, with the introduction of which the transport provision of the district will be simply excellent.  Three kilometers from the quarter there is a roundabout, two kilometers from it runs the Murmansk Highway, and Bolshevikov Avenue is located one and a half. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd seven capitals reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1293043.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Across the street from the Seven Capitals residential complex is the Mega-Dybenko shopping and entertainment complex.  And that, perhaps, says it all.  Indeed, it includes several large supermarkets, including Auchan and Ikea, about two hundred small shops, bars, restaurants and cafes, attractions, sports and fitness centers, and attractions for children.  There are bank branches and enterprises providing household and medical services on its territory.  In general, there is everything that a modern person needs. </p><p>  In addition, the Vienna quarter, located near London, is already a full-fledged residential area with existing infrastructure, so that residents of the "English" part of the Seven Capitals residential complex can freely use the services of various objects of the "Austrians".  By the way, judging by how Vienna is equipped with everything necessary, you can be sure that in London the developer will do everything possible so that the inhabitants of this “capital” do not feel a lack of anything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD seven capitals of St. Petersburg" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1293051.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Floor plans </h2><p>  The company's specialists designed the houses of the quarter in accordance with the level of comfort class and taking into account the European planning concept.  In this regard, the layouts of the apartments presented in the Seven Capitals residential complex are very diverse.  So there is a choice, each potential buyer will choose the right option for himself without any problems.  By and large, all the available layouts are generally problematic to describe, since, for example, more than five and a half thousand studios will be put up for sale.  And there are many options for their sizes and layouts.  The same applies to four thousand one-room, 1780 two-room and 250 three-room apartments.  Therefore, we restrict ourselves to the basic description. </p><p>  Almost all types of studios have an elongated shape, while one-room apartments are almost all square.  In residential premises of this format (first and second), almost everywhere combined nodes.  As for the apartments of a larger area, there are also species options when the windows look on different sides, and euro-apartments (combined kitchen and living room), and three-ruble apartments, in which the area of ​​the kitchen room goes over the roof for 30 "squares". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD seven capitals kudrovo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1293054.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Regardless of the format of the apartment, each is equipped with a spacious loggia, glazed from floor to ceiling.  Also, all living quarters have spacious hallways, some have ready-made wardrobe rooms, others have niches for large sliding wardrobes.  In general, the layout of the apartments is competent, ergonomic and functional.  As for the area of ​​residential premises, it varies from 22.5 to 84. 5 "squares". </p><p>  All apartments are fully finished. </p><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  What will the residents of the Seven Capitals residential complex (St. Petersburg) find in their apartments?  And here the developer showed himself very interesting.  So, on even floors, the entire finish is made in vanilla tones, while on odd floors - in chocolate.  There is a laminate everywhere on the floor, metal entrance and wooden interior doors are installed.  In the bathrooms and in the kitchen - Italian tiles.  The ceilings are painted, the walls are covered with wallpaper for painting.  Meters are installed for gas and light, and water, and even heating.  Also, the installation of all plumbing equipment, also of Italian production, was carried out. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The cost of apartments in the residential complex "Seven Capitals" democratic, of course, can not be called.  Still, comfort class, prices in this segment, to put it mildly, bite.  As for the future residents of London, today they are invited to purchase a studio for 2,300,000 - 2,900,000 rubles, and a one-room apartment - for 2,600,000-5,300,000 rubles.  As for the kopeck piece, you will have to pay from three and a half to six million for it, and from five and a half to seven for a three-ruble note.  In general, a lot, agree. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd seven capitals quarter london" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1293048.jpg"></div>

    <p>  You can buy an apartment using a lump sum payment, and in installments, the terms of which are negotiated with each client individually.  If you wish, you can apply for a mortgage, as well as take advantage of maternity capital. </p><h2>  LCD "Seven Capitals": reviews </h2><p>  What do the newly made residents of the complex say, as well as those who are only going to become them?  “London” surrenders second, after the “Vienna”, in which people have long been living.  So, each potential buyer can take an opinion of a real person about the developer and the quality of the houses being built by him.  In this regard, no one at random buys apartments in London, people do not make rash decisions and know what awaits them.  And since the quality of housing is really good, there are practically no negative reviews as such.  Unless there are a few questions regarding the layout and decoration.  So, for example, not everyone likes that the loggias are glazed to the floor.  You have to think about how to cover the windows, as the sun sometimes interferes, and from the street you can see what is happening on the balcony.  In addition, in some odnushki there are ledges, behind which communications are hidden.  They interfere with the arrangement of furniture, and the general appearance is somewhat spoiled, according to the owners.  Well, of course, almost everyone believes that the cost of apartments is still quite high. </p><p>  Otherwise, people are happy with everything.  The presence of a huge shopping center nearby and Vienna infrastructure facilities makes it possible to enjoy all the benefits of civilization, transport is also not bad, and the commissioning of the new metro station will be completely in order.  The houses are beautiful, the developer thoroughly took care of the safety of the residents, so that you can not worry about anything.  The yards of the commissioned houses are landscaped, and after the completion of the entire complex, gardens and a school will begin to work.  So, if you want to live in London, buy an apartment in the residential complex "Seven Capitals"! </p>
