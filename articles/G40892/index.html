    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ai Petri Suspension Bridge" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/2093785.jpg"></div>  In fact, there are two suspension bridges on Ai-Petri.  They are located at an altitude of more than 1200 meters above sea level.  The distance from the steps of the bridges to the rocks is about 50-60 meters.  These numbers are breathtaking.  Tourists who decide on such an extreme excursion will have to overcome two suspension bridges over the abyss.  The length of each is 45 meters.  The first suspension bridge on Ai-Petri is straight and level.  However, even a passage through it will give a lot of new sensations.  The steps are located at a solid distance from each other, and the railing looks symbolic.  The second bridge is popularly called the "Road to Heaven."  It has a noticeable slope upward, climbing up it, a person "climbs" uphill.  Many tourists admit that they decided not to overcome such a route at all the first time.  In the photo, the Ai-Petri suspension bridge looks reliable and not too long.  In fact, a strong wind almost always blows at the top.  Suspension bridges are driven by several tourists at once.  Easy rocking of the construction is ensured!

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea suspension bridge ay petri" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/2093788.jpg"></div>  The construction of the most extreme Crimean mountain attraction was carried out by the local public organization "Freerith" and the emergency rescue squad from Yalta "Crimea-Spas".  Before opening the bridges, thorough calculations and tests were carried out.  Steel cables were used to strengthen the visually fragile structure.  Thanks to them, each suspension bridge on Ai-Petri is able to withstand a load exceeding the permissible norm by 10 times.  During the operation of the attraction, representatives of the rescue service are constantly here.  They provide brief instruction for tourists, as well as help prepare for the passage over the bridge.  Admission to the attraction is carried out only after securing the insurance.  In addition, every tourist should wear a safety helmet.  For the entire duration of the attraction, no special incidents or accidents were recorded.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Ai Petri Suspension Bridge" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/2093790.jpg"></div>  Ay-Petri is an ancient Greek name.  Historians translate it into Russian as "St. Peter".  According to experts, the mountain in Crimea was named after an ancient monastery that once functioned here.  This peak is not the highest on the peninsula.  It is famous for its geographical location and beauty.  This mountain is considered the most foggy and windiest peak in the Crimea.  For those who want to visit the suspension bridge on Ai-Petri, these are only pluses.  During the tour, you can often observe the clouds directly under their own feet.  Many tourists manage to admire the unique natural phenomenon - ‚ÄúGloria‚Äù.  It is about the appearance of colored light rings on the clouds, beyond which there is a light source.  This optical phenomenon is often called the ‚ÄúBuddha Light‚Äù or ‚ÄúBroken Ghost‚Äù.
