It is correct when it depicts anything other than a double-headed eagle and the number 1. But such coins, as a rule, are not spent on acquisitions (unless by accident), but are deposited in coin collections.  Not an exception and 1 ruble with Pushkin, a ruble 10 years of the CIS.  When did such coins appear, what are their features? </p><h2>  Anniversary rubles in the USSR and the Russian Federation </h2><p>  In general, the tradition of collecting was common in the USSR.  How many tasks are there in the Soviet-time textbooks about Tan and Serezha that collected stamps?  At that time, jubilee rubles also appeared.  One such coin, 1 ruble, of course, was not the smallest amount, but still it was possible to save the jubilee coin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="coinsbolhov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Commemorative coins of the USSR" class="if uuid-2737908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2737908.jpg"></div><p>  The tradition of minting unusual coins dedicated to certain events has remained in modern Russia.  At the same time, <span>collection coins were</span> not limited to rubles.  More often it is ten-ruble coins of two types, coins of 2 and 5 rubles and, of course, a coin of 1 ruble.  There are rarer money made from precious metals, but it is unlikely that anyone will pay it in a store: they cost much more than their face value. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.raritetus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Coins of the Russian Federation" class="if uuid-2737920" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2737920.jpg"></div><h2>  In memory of Pushkin </h2><p>  Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin is a great Russian poet.  Born on June 6, 1799.  The future poet was brought up in a literary environment.  In his childhood, Alexander spent a lot of time with his grandmother, who hired a nanny for the boy - Arina Rodionovna.  The latter had a great influence on the boy. </p><p>  In 1811, the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum opened in St. Petersburg.  It was here that the poet wrote the first poems, published the first poem "To a friend of the poet".  In the years after the lyceum, he wrote the poem "Ruslan and Lyudmila." </p><div class="photo" data-original="pravoslavie.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexander Pushkin" class="if uuid-2737933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2737933.jpg"></div><p>  For too much liberties in his work in 1820, Alexander Sergeyevich goes to exile, where he begins his famous novel in poetry - "Eugene Onegin."  Nicholas I granted Pushkin freedom in 1826, but already in 1828 supervision was established over the poet.  An important event was the marriage of Pushkin in 1831 to Natalia Goncharova.  In these years, famous works were written: Dubrovsky, Captain's Daughter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On February 8, 1837, the poet was mortally wounded in a duel with Dantes, and died on February 10. </p><h2>  Collection ruble with Pushkin </h2><p>  In 1999, to the bicentenary of the great poet, a series of coins with the image of Pushkin was issued.  By the way, this is not the first ruble depicting Alexander Sergeyevich.  In the Soviet Union there was 1 ruble with Pushkin, dedicated to its 185th anniversary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moneta-russia.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruble Pushkin USSR" class="if uuid-2737905" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2737905.jpg"></div><p>  The modern coin was made from a rather rare alloy called neulziber, it includes zinc, nickel and copper.  A ruble was issued with Pushkin at both mints - St. Petersburg and Moscow, the number of coins issued was up to 10,000,000.  Despite such a large distribution, a coin is rarely seen in circulation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.staraya-moneta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruble Pushkin" class="if uuid-2737946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2737946.jpg"></div><p>  The obverse of the coin (the so-called front side, where the coat of arms is located, bank designation, mint and year) is no different from the usual 1 ruble of 1999.  But on the reverse (reverse side) is a portrait of the poet, under which is the signature of Alexander Sergeyevich, and also indicated years of life.  It is impossible to exaggerate the contribution of a writer, a poet to Russian literature, Russian speech, to immortalize a poet on 10 million coins is the least that can be done.  The cost of a ruble with Pushkin starts at 200 rubles, often costs more (it all depends on the state of the coin). </p><h2>  Commonwealth of Independent States </h2><p>  After the collapse of the <span>Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the</span> presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the chairman of the Supreme Council of Belarus signed <span>an agreement on the establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States</span> in Belovezhskaya Pushcha on December 8, 1991 <span>.</span>  Gradually, the former allied countries joined the CIS.  So international relations have taken on a new form.  Each country that is part of the CIS is a fully independent state, has equal rights along with other participants. </p><p>  The Commonwealth includes: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan.  Like any alliance, the CIS has a number of common goals and principles, there are several specialized organizations that are needed to address narrower issues, as well as 2 military structures. </p><h2>  CIS collection ruble </h2><p>  After the collapse of the USSR, the continuation of interaction between the former allied countries, which existed together for more than 70 years, the need to conclude a certain union was paramount.  In 2001, the Commonwealth of Independent States celebrated its first major anniversary - a decade.  The issue of coins "10 years of the CIS" is timed to coincide with this event. </p><div class="photo" data-original="coinza.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruble of the CIS" class="if uuid-2737972" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100520/2737972.jpg"></div><p>  Like the ruble with Pushkin, the 2001 coin has a completely standard obverse and a rather interesting reverse with an image of the CIS symbol, as well as the inscription ‚Äú10 years‚Äù.  In this case, the number ‚Äú10‚Äù is visible at one angle, and ‚Äúyears‚Äù - at another angle, which is also a distinctive feature of the coin.  You can draw a parallel in the number of minted coins, their circulation is also 10,000,000, and again finding a coin in circulation is quite difficult.  The price is several hundred rubles. </p><p>  Collecting coins is quite an interesting activity.  Therefore, you need to be careful about all the little things that come across in change.  Suddenly there will be a treasured ruble with Pushkin or with a decade of the CIS? </p>
