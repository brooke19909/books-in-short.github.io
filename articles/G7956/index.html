It would seem that this person is a famous historical person on the whole planet.  And certainly it has no equal on the European continent.  What questions can be if all the answers have not been simply given for a long time, moreover, they have been elevated to the canon and cannot be revised?  Where Jesus Christ was born, who he was, how and when he died - all this is known.  This is the case for the believing half of the Christian world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where jesus christ was born" class="if" height="247" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/146827.jpg" width="320"></div>  The second half, represented by atheists, answers all these questions even easier: Jesus did not exist.  After all, this is the simplest logical chain: if there is no God, therefore, there could not have been his son.  Where was Jesus Christ born?  Yes, nowhere!  According to the results of social surveys of the last few years, more than ten percent of respondents from Western Europe and America who are not related to religion believe that this character never really existed.

    <p>  The problem of historical personality </p><p>  However, everything is somewhat more complicated.  Many modern scholars agree <span>that such a person</span> did exist.  Of course, over the centuries, his life path has been overgrown with mythological details and fantastic additions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jesus christ born" class="if" height="277" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/146828.jpg" width="400"></div>  The task of separating the grains from the chaff was set by scientists who began to study the problems of the historical person of Christ.  Important questions remain about in which year Jesus Christ was born, what was his real <span>life path.</span>  However, an exact answer to them has not yet been found.

The main sources of study were ancient documents that date back to the very beginning of our era and contain any mention of this person.  Valuable sources to this day are the "Jewish Antiquities" by Josephus Flavius, the "Annals" of Tacitus, the correspondence of Trajan and <span>Pliny the Younger</span> , etc. The Bible itself also contains a number of facts that indirectly can serve as evidence of the real existence of Christ.  For example, indications of some of its shortcomings, such as incontinence, as in the episode with the expulsion of merchants from the temple, or insufficiently respectful attitude to parents. </p>

    <p>  Current historians point out that a completely fictional character would surely be absolutely idealized, without any flaws.  One of the modern researchers of this person - the historian Charles Gineber - answered the question of when and where Jesus Christ was born, answered that it really happened somewhere in Galilee in a poor family during the reign of Emperor Augustus.  According to him, there is no reason to deny the real existence of Jesus.  Based on the studied picture of the history of the Roman Empire during the marked period, everyday life and the orders of its eastern provinces, as well as a <span>critical analysis of the</span> messages about Christ, today's historians are reconstructing the life path of an unusual, but absolutely real person.  So, Jesus Christ was born in the Middle East, was an unknown theologian, and turned into one of the most mysterious figures in world history. </p>
