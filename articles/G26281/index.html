The main owner is a company that has been working with gadgets for more than 10 years, so the development and promotion of a new brand will be large-scale and competitive.  The company claims to be on the list of the "Top 10 flagships of the world."  In the meantime, the Chinese have declared themselves loudly and have already released several high-quality models.  One of them was the Oukitel K6000 Pro phone. </p><h2>  Generous equipment </h2><p>  The Chinese did not become greedy and put in a box, in addition to a smartphone, a lot of interesting things.  By the way, the box itself is quite presentable.  It has a bright orange color, thick cardboard, pleasant to the touch, on which there is only a barcode and information about the color of the phone. </p><p>  Inside is the Oukitel K6000 Pro, which we‚Äôll review now.  Under it is all the necessary documentation, which hid a "clip" for the slot.  Also, in the box you can find the charger, USB cable and OTG.  By the way, with the help of the latter, you can charge another smartphone that has a weaker battery.  But what was missing was the headset. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oukitel k6000 pro reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405395.jpg"></div>

    <p>  But it, perhaps, is more than replaced by a transparent silicone case for the Oukitel K6000 Pro and already two protective films: one is already on the phone screen, the other - together with documents.  Given the fact that it is usually difficult to find covers and films on such models, this equipment is very successful.  Well, headphones will have to be purchased separately. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cute candy bar </h2><p>  The Chinese have worked productively on the design of the Oukitel K6000 Pro.  A review of the appearance should begin with the fact that this model is a monoblock.  Regarding such a variant of the case, you can argue for a long time, nevertheless, everything is done quite high quality and durable.  Moreover, due to the integrity, ‚Äúbacklash‚Äù is not observed. </p><p>  The back cover is made of aluminum, plastic inserts are located on the top and bottom.  The aluminum edging on the sides is also harmoniously combined with plastic for the quality work of all communication modules. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="original k6000 oukitel pro" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405390.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In front is a special <span>protective glass</span> for the Oukitel K6000 Pro, reviews of which confirm its quality.  Some users dropped the smartphone more than once, but the screen remained intact.  Although there were cases with an unsuccessful outcome. </p><p>  The edging of a fairly large screen is in color with the body, so the dark version looks more profitable.  It visually enlarges the display frame, due to which it looks larger.  Two color solutions are available to buyers: ‚Äúsilver‚Äù and ‚Äúgray‚Äù.  In the ‚Äúsilver‚Äù version, the front of the phone is completely white, but the back panel is light gray. </p><h2>  In their place </h2><p>  Classic three touch buttons are located at the bottom front, and the earpiece is at the top center.  Closer to the left corner is the ‚Äúfront camera‚Äù, and to the right is the <span>proximity</span> and light <span>sensor</span> . </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Since this is a candy bar, the SIM card slot and memory card are located on the left side of the phone.  You can open it with the same ‚Äúclip‚Äù.  On the right side were the volume and lock (off) buttons. </p>

    <p>  At the top, as in many other smartphones, there is a place for headphones, and at the bottom end alone remains a micro-USB connector.  At the back in the center at the top there is a noticeable camera, under which there is a window for scanning a fingerprint.  To the left of the lens is a dual diode flash. </p><p>  When buying on the rear panel, you can find a sticker with instructions that explains where the SIM card slot is and how to use it correctly.  The phone received two SIM card slots, one of which can be used for a memory card.  That is, either one SIM card and a memory card are available, or two SIM cards are available.  Regarding this issue, users also had complaints.  It seems like the solution is quite interesting.  But some need two ‚ÄúSIM cards‚Äù and a memory card right away. </p><h2>  Comfortable to use </h2><p>  Ergonomics Oukitel K6000 Pro reviews can be divided into two "camps".  One includes women for whom the dimensions of the smartphone are quite unusual, to the other - men who feel comfortable using the phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The device received smoothed corners, thereby becoming convenient in classic coverage.  The fingers immediately assume the position of the buttons, which are also customary to use with one hand.  Despite the fact that all the keys are very smooth, they are also quite clear, which helps to avoid accidental keystrokes. </p><p>  Another good news was that the original K6000 Oukitel Pro has a fingerprint scanner.  Moreover, the place under the lens for this option is very convenient, since the finger immediately lies in a small "hole".  This function works correctly, unlocking works quickly, so there are no questions about it. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The diagonal of the display is 5.5 inches, and the resolution is FullHD.  By today's standards, this is a good option, given the price of a smartphone.  The quality of the screen image is excellent, the IPS-matrix makes the colors calm.  If there is not enough brightness, then it can be easily added.  Other screen settings on the phone are not provided. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oukitel k6000 pro price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1405396.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Pleased with the viewing angles.  Only at maximum tilt the colors fade slightly.  The rest of the picture remains unchanged.  The brightness of the device is optimal.  It doesn‚Äôt hurt your eyes in complete darkness, and on sunny days you can comfortably use your smartphone. </p><p>  As for the Oukitel K6000 Pro screen, the user reviews here are positive.  Particularly pleasing is its size, which allows you to easily watch movies and videos on Youtube. </p><h2>  "Sweet filling" </h2><p>  The smartphone is controlled by the brand new Android 6.0 Marshmallow.  Built-in launcher helps to adjust the interface for you.  You can change the appearance of the icons and improve the desktop settings. </p><p>  Otherwise, the phone is available with a ‚Äúclean‚Äù OS without unnecessary software, some of which would still have to be removed.  The shutter remained from Android.  The same can be said about the settings menu, contacts, messenger and dialing. </p><p>  The developers have worked on the menu.  The interface came out very high quality and convenient.  The process itself has several stages, each of which is clearly described. </p>

    <p>  Android 6.0 Marshmallow works with the device correctly.  The system as a whole functions stably.  It is well optimized, and due to the lack of excess software, it is also fast. </p><h2>  Hardware component </h2><p>  For the phone, they prepared the MediaTek MT6753 processor, which runs on 8 cores, the clock frequency of which is 1.3 GHz.  For the graphics meets the Mali-T720 MP3.  For the Pro version, they developed RAM as much as 3 GB, which is very nice, given that part of it uses the OS.  The internal memory here is as much as 32 GB.  Therefore, the phone is often used for 2 SIM cards, as the need for a memory card is minimal. </p><p>  Of course, you cannot call this device a gaming one, but it can also be safely used for gaming purposes.  For example, the famous toy Lara Croft: Relic Run runs freely on this model, giving an average of 60 fps. </p><p>  The popular World Of Tanks: Blitz also consistently showed 50-60 fps.  At maximum settings, Godfire: Rise of Prometheus also worked correctly, but with 30 fps.  In general, the performance of the device is at a high level. </p><p>  But regarding the sound of the Oukitel K6000 Pro, the reviews vary.  Most likely, this is due to the build quality, and nevertheless, the quality of the audio tracks is above average with and without a headset.  Low frequencies stand out, which are so often lacking.  Music and films sound very good and natural. </p><p>  The same can be said about conversational dynamics.  The interlocutor is heard well, without any noise.  You can adjust the speaker volume, as it is quite ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù. </p><h2>  Take a picture of it immediately! </h2><p>  Probably, the Chinese read all user reviews, since any detail is made with high quality.  Smartphone Oukitel K6000 Pro has a high-quality main camera of 16 megapixels and a front camera of 8 megapixels. </p>

    <p>  The camera menu is standard for Android, but there are some useful additions.  I am glad the presence of HDR mode, panorama shooting, face search, etc. Manual adjustment of shooting modes works well.  Therefore, if the user understands this, the pictures will turn out even better. </p><p>  The claimed 16 megapixels really answer with their indicator.  All this thanks to the high resolution.  Therefore, the pictures in the afternoon or in the evening are good.  The double flash provides bright lighting, so at night you can also take pictures without problems. </p><p>  The front camera justifies its 8 megapixel.  Selfies and video calls are free from daytime noise.  Therefore, posting photos on social networks and chatting became more comfortable with the Oukitel K6000 Pro Gray. </p><h2>  Productive work </h2><p>  The developers have worked hard on the maximum number of options.  All possible launchers, cameras and software work with a bang.  Wireless interfaces also play an important role. </p><p>  As mentioned earlier, 2 SIM cards are available to users.  If there is a call to one of them, the second goes into sleep mode.  It is possible to exchange one "SIM card" on a memory card.  In this case, everyone chooses what he needs.  But given the fact that there is as much as 32 GB of internal memory, they will most likely use the support of two telecom operators. </p>

    <p>  Since the phone is quite advanced, it also has everyone‚Äôs favorite 4G standard, which is now in great demand.  Transmission is stable, with normal speed. </p><p>  The remaining modules are inherent in all modern smartphones: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  Wireless Internet also works well, high-quality signal reception both at home and in public places. </p><h2>  Centenar </h2><p>  And finally, the highlight of the Oukitel K6000 Pro Gray smartphone is its battery life.  That is why this device has become popular among its "brothers" in the shop.  Of course, there is an even more powerful device, with a battery of 10 thousand mAh, but we are talking about a slightly less capacious battery of 6000 mAh, which is clear from the name of the model.  Now it‚Äôs clear that the Oukitel K6000 Pro price depends on this impressive plus. </p><p>  Users have long been accustomed to the fact that the average smartphone can "live" only one working day without charging.  Someone no longer pays attention to the constant need of the phone to charge, while someone is bored by such an "insatiable" device. </p><p>  Probably, for the latter, the Chinese came up with the Oukitel K6000 Pro.  The characteristics of the smartphone are already competitive, but such a huge battery capacity is generally a gift.  Testing the battery showed that with the correct "buildup" of the battery, the phone can last a whole week without recharging.  Of course, this option is possible only with moderate use of the device. </p>

    <p>  If the owner wanted to watch movies on the road, then the smart will last as long as 11 hours.  Enough use of the phone ‚Äî calls, surfing, photographs, listening to music and playing games ‚Äî will discharge this model only after 3-4 days.  Due to the moderate price of the Oukitel K6000 Pro, it is taken even as a navigator, since it is a real ‚Äúlong-liver.‚Äù </p><p>  Now it‚Äôs obvious that the OTG cable in the kit is not out of place.  After all, you can easily share the charge with other devices. </p><h2>  Price and quality </h2><p>  That's the way the developers got the Oukitel K6000 Pro.  The characteristics make the smartphone competitive, and the company's promise to get into the "top 10" flagships of the world is quite real.  The device really turned out to be of high quality, fast, beautiful, and most importantly, tenacious. </p><p>  In China, you can order this phone for $ 142, which is amazing, given how good it turned out.  In addition to crazy battery life, the model received a newfangled <span>fingerprint scanner, a</span> large screen with good resolution.
