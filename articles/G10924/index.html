You can buy a used vehicle through official car dealers, for example, brands such as Hyundai and KIA. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="KIa on loan from Sovcombank" class="if uuid-3058907" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3058907.jpg"></div><p>  But also in a car loan you can get a car bought directly from an individual.  The reviews "From Hand to Hand" from Sovcombank testify to the fact that this procedure is safe and guarantees the reliability of the seller. </p><h2>  Car loan terms ‚ÄúFrom hand to hand‚Äù </h2><p>  The conditions for car loan programs were considered above, depending on the official dealer salon.  The loan product for purchased used cars is slightly different. </p><ol><li>  The basic interest rate is 19%.  It does not change depending on whether the borrower has connected a financial protection service or not. </li><li>  If the client makes all payments on time and in full, does not resort to early repayment, and is also a member of the financial protection program, he can claim interest recount.  After completion of obligations, the bank reviews the loan rate and returns the difference paid to the current account.  The minimum bid limit is 10.9%. </li><li>  According to the terms of the car loan from Sovcombank, the loan term is from 12 to 60 months. </li><li>  The loan amount is from 100 thousand to 1 million rubles.  In any case, the requested amount cannot be more than the value of the collateral property, i.e., the vehicle. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.autoloansolutions.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car loan for the action &quot;From hand to hand&quot;." class="if uuid-3058929" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3058929.jpg"></div><h2>  Borrower Requirements </h2><p>  For all loan products, the general requirements apply: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  The age limit is from 20 to 85 years.  The potential borrower must be less than 85 at the time of payment of all debt. </li><li>  Official work with an experience of 4 months. </li><li>  The presence of a permanent residence in one of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Accommodation in the village where there is a branch of Sovcombank.  At the same time, registration and accommodation do not have to coincide. </li><li>  The borrower must provide a home or work landline telephone. </li></ol><h2>  Package of documents for the client </h2><p>  When obtaining a loan for property, which is also a guarantee, two types of documents are always required.  Documents on the client are designed to confirm his solvency, reliability and responsibility.  You will need: </p><ol><li>  Passport of a citizen of Russia. </li><li>  The second identification document.  It can be SNILS or a driver‚Äôs license. </li><li>  Certificate of income from accounting in the reporting form or in the form of a bank. </li><li>  For men, a military ID.  If it is impossible to provide it (for men from 22 to 26 years old), a surety will be required.  His face may be parents or other adult relatives. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.casachryslerjeep.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sovcombank car loan" class="if uuid-3058965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3058965.jpg"></div><p>  If the bank requests the provision of a guarantor, it should prepare the same package of documents as the main borrower. </p><h2>  Vehicle Documents </h2><p>  A car purchased under a car loan program is a pledge under a contract.  Therefore, this property has special requirements and also a package of documents: </p><ol><li>  Vehicle passport. </li><li>  Motor insurance sheet against theft, damage or theft, if any. </li><li>  When purchasing a car from a private person, you will need to provide a document confirming the registration of the car and its belonging to the specified owner.  When a car, even with a used one, is bought through a car dealership, the bank and the buyer do not need to check the past of the vehicle.  Another thing is if the car is sold by a private person, although a car loan is used for this.  The bank must be sure that the car is not hijacked and not wanted, so that in the future there will be no problems with repaying the loan. </li><li>  In customer reviews of car loans at Sovcombank, you can often read that the lender also requests a photograph of the vehicle being purchased. </li></ol><h2>  Documents required for a car seller </h2><p>  If the car is purchased under the "From Hand to Hand" program, the seller‚Äôs documents will also be required.  The previous owner of the vehicle must provide the creditor with the passport of a Russian citizen and a second document of his choice.  This may be a driver‚Äôs license, passport, SNILS, pension certificate, TIN, military ID, medical insurance policy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sovcombank car loan reviews" class="if uuid-3058904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3058904.jpg"></div><p>  The bank will transfer the entire indicated value to the seller, and the buyer will repay the loan to the lender. </p><h2>  Customer reviews of Sovcombank about car loans in Moscow and the regions </h2><p>  The credit institution was founded in 1990, but only in the last few has not begun to lead an active marketing company.  Unusual promotions and advertising campaigns contributed a lot to this.  For example, many customers celebrate the Great Bet Guarantee program.  This paid service is activated at the conclusion of the contract, but if the borrower is conscientious, he will receive at the end a recount of the interest rate.  All the accounted amount will be transferred to the client in the form of a cache back to the account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nada.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sovcombank car loan terms" class="if uuid-3058916" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3058916.jpg"></div><p>  The attention of the customers was earned by the guarantee of the best conditions in the bank.  If within three months an individual receives a loan for the same amount, term and with the same package of services, but at the same time its full cost is lower, he has the right to refuse the first loan with the provision of supporting documents.  People who took this opportunity say that their contract was terminated after that, they did not pay interest on the actual use of the money. </p><p>  In a relatively short period, there have been many positive reviews of Sovcombank loans.  Car loans in this institution are still gaining popularity, but favorable rates and the ability to recalculate interest at the end of the term attract people who want to become owners of a personal car. </p>
