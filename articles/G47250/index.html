In winter, here is a paradise for adherents of affordable skiing - all the conditions for it are provided by a vacation in Romania.  The country has not yet been spoiled by European chic, although it is eager for this at all costs, but for now this has not happened - it is possible to spend your vacation perfectly and not very expensive.  Romania‚Äôs modern history is as famous as the old legend of Dracula: the ruthless domination of tyrant <span>Nikolai Ceausescu</span> ended in 1989, although Romania is still tormented by poverty and political instability.  Nevertheless, Romania with great pleasure receives guests, offers them magnificent tourist trips and a completely different cultural program than you can find elsewhere on the planet. </p><p>  The rest in Romania is a mild and snowy winter, a maritime climate and a long swimming season, wide and clean beaches that smoothly descend into the sea, golden healing sand, the magical effect of mountain lakes and springs, low prices, excellent service in hotels, a diverse cultural and entertainment program.  Travelers who come to rest in Romania are offered a lot of entertainment.  This comfortable bars and small shops, a large number of restaurants with sumptuous dishes and fine wines, cafes in a unique national style, nightclubs and cabarets.  As well as sports centers with playgrounds for children and swimming pools, tennis courts, bowling centers, playgrounds for various active sports, horse bases, ski slopes equipped with snow cannons and ski jumps. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Last-minute tours to Romania - this is a sightseeing tour of Constanta, Bucharest, Sighisoara, Alba - Julia;  beach <span>activities</span> at the Black Sea resorts in Mamaia, Olympus - Neptune, Eforie Nord, Mangalia, Cap Aurora;  skiing in Sinaia, Poiana Brasov, Predeal.  It is also an opportunity to do thalassotherapy, mud therapy and rejuvenation courses at the <span>balneological resorts of</span> Covasna, Slanic Moldova, Baile Tushnad, Kobat.  Travelers are offered excursions to the famous castle of <span>Count Dracula</span> and a stud farm in Magnalia, a romantic trip to Iasi, visits to the caves and canyon Bekaz in the Carpathians, a trip to Lake Tekirgel, as well as walks through the reserve in the Danube Delta. </p><p>  The increase in the price of transportation has already nullified not so long ago the decrease in tariffs by Romanian hotels, and tour operators also expect the introduction of fuel taxes by aviation companies. <br>  Nevertheless, the demand for holidays in Romania by domestic travelers is quite stable, although this season, as a rule, not beach, but sightseeing and medical trips are booked. <br>  The cost of accommodation has remained unchanged, although lower hotel rates eat up the increased price of air travel.  In the near future, the so-called <span>fuel surcharges</span> will be introduced by carriers <span>.</span>  Although in order to make the vacation cheaper, it is possible to purchase not ordinary tickets, but last-minute tours to Romania. </p><p>  The advantages that last-minute trips to Romania have, well, to any other country is their rather low cost, compared to the standard cost.  This decrease in cost was made possible due to the fact that closer to the departure of tour operators paid places are still in surplus, as a result of this, the prices for trips fall in order to realize them.  Professionals call these tours special offers.  It is clear that it is much better for firms to realize this ticket at a lower cost than to completely lose cash.  But these services are extremely few and are lucky exclusively lucky. </p>
