  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Alize Baby Wool": reviews of needlewomen, composition, colors</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When the desire comes to create this or that thing, as a rule, its appearance is already quite clearly formed in the imagination.  What shape will she have, what tools may be needed, what kind of decor.  However, the problem often arises of choosing the material from which the product will be created.  This applies directly to such types of applied art as crocheting or knitting, because the choice of yarn is simply huge.  Even a concrete understanding of the characteristics of the yarn, such as composition, thickness and color, tactile impressions, does not save. </p><p>  Materials whose characteristics are the same can behave very differently both during knitting and during operation.  Much depends on the raw materials and the manufacturer, which becomes more every year.  They are especially careful in choosing yarn for knitting for children.  Since their skin is very sensitive, the material should be not only beautiful, but also soft, wear-resistant and hypoallergenic.  One of these materials is considered to be Alize Baby Wool yarn.  Reviews about it for the most part are very laudatory, however, in order to finally make a decision whether this material is suitable for knitting the intended products, it is necessary to carefully study its characteristics. </p><h2>  Manufacturer </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.vilrita.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yarn Alize Baby Wool" class="if uuid-3129321" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3129321.jpg"></div><p>  They make yarn in Turkey.  The Alize factory has been operating since 1984, in its assortment of more than 90 types of yarn, and every year it expands more and more.  Here you can find both completely natural and mixed or synthetic threads, they differ not only in composition, but also in the way of torsion.  The presence of both classic and fantasy materials allows you to create amazing products using completely simple schemes.  The price range is quite wide, Alize factories produce both budget types of yarn and elite ones.  Also pleases with the color palette of each line, thanks to this, even the most picky buyer will be able to choose the right yarn for a particular job. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From the line of children's yarn, Alize Baby Wool is especially popular. </p><h2>  Composition </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fantasy yarn in the product" class="if uuid-3131195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3131195.jpg"></div><p>  This yarn consists of 40% wool, the same contains acrylic, as well as 20% bamboo.  Wool is used not as merino, but as sheep, which significantly reduces the cost of the product.  In addition, used restored bamboo fiber obtained by chemical treatment of the plant - viscose.  If the raw materials were not washed well enough, the reagents can cause an allergic reaction, therefore, before using the finished product, it must be washed. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  In a small skein weighing 50 g is 175 meters of uniform thread, 3 mm thick.  The yarn is quite voluminous, it consists of three threads twisted together.  It has a light noble shine, very soft, a little cool at the first touch, it easily lets air through, but it retains heat.  Such characteristics were achieved thanks to the competent selection of the proportions of the materials included in the composition.  The manufacturer recommends using knitting needles from 2.5 to 4 mm and a hook number 1-3, however, according to reviews, Alize Baby Wool is too easy to stratify when crocheting, so it‚Äôs better to use a larger tool number. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Colors </h2><p>  As in other lines, the palette of this type of yarn is quite extensive, consists of 35 shades.  Moreover, its distinguishing feature is that it has not only delicate ‚Äúchildren‚Äôs‚Äù, but also very rich colors.  Thanks to this, ‚ÄúAlize Baby Wool‚Äù can be used not only for making clothes for babies, but also for adults who want to please themselves with tenderness and warmth of their first touches.  In addition, such a palette allows you to create a gradient effect in products, which is especially important in recent seasons. </p><h2>  Batik </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.vilrita.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alize Baby Wool Batik" class="if uuid-3129314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3129314.jpg"></div><p>  The manufacturer‚Äôs enthusiasm for fantasy materials could not help but touch this yarn, so a novelty recently appeared - ‚ÄúAlize Baby Wool Batik‚Äù.  The thread of this material is not dyed in the classical way, but sectional with smooth transitions.  Today, sixteen colors are produced, each of which combines from three to five colors.  The use of such material is a good way to create an interesting multi-colored product from one skein, without wasting time on the selection of primary colors and their shades to form transitions. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Despite all the efforts of the manufacturer "Alize", reviews about the yarn "Baby Wool" are very polar.  You can find both flattering, according to which this material became a favorite among all the yarn of this category, and very negative when the thread was literally thrown into the bin.  However, having analyzed most of them, it is possible to draw certain conclusions regarding the quality of yarn and the further operation of the products. </p><h2>  Quality </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="set of yarn <mixchars> A </mixchars> lize Baby Wool" class="if uuid-3131204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3131204.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews, ‚ÄúAlize Baby Wool‚Äù can be rated for quality by 4 points out of 5. The thread is even along the entire length in all skeins, but the thickness of the thread in skeins from different lots may vary slightly.  There are tangles with nodules - from 1 to 7 along the entire length, however, such a ball comes in about one in ten.  The color, as a rule, is stable, however, according to reviews about ‚ÄúAliza Baby Vul‚Äù, in a product knitted in 2 threads, one of them may brighten after washing, and according to other observations, the paint comes off not from the whole thread, but from one its constituent parts. </p><p>  Also, there are complaints about extraneous inclusions - dark hair and wooden fibers.  For appeals to the manufacturer regarding such shortcomings, his representatives recommend purchasing material from official suppliers, from which we can conclude that there can be a fake on the market.  However, there are few such situations, and the overall impression of this material leaves a positive one. </p><h2>  Exploitation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The correct spinning of knitwear" class="if uuid-3131220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3131220.jpg"></div><p>  The process of manufacturing products from this yarn, most masters still like it.  The thread glides easily over the tools, is pleasant to the touch, lies flat both in a simple cloth and in a pattern, hands do not sweat during work, and the finished product holds its shape well. </p><p>  However, here, according to reviews, "Alize Baby Wool" is imperfect.  Despite the fact that the yarn is warm enough, a hat in one thread turns out to be too thin, and in two - heavy for small children.  In addition, sheep‚Äôs wool did not play a particularly good role in the composition.  No matter how the manufacturer tried to soften it with acrylic and bamboo viscose, it was not possible to completely remove the stickiness of the material.  Moreover, in light shades it is less pronounced than in dark ones.  In addition, skeins from different parties can also vary in the degree of prickly material.  That is why the craftswomen agreed that it is better to knit clothes from this yarn that will not fit to the naked body.  Some were alarmed by the feeling of coolness that appears as soon as you take the product in your hands, however, this effect gives the bamboo fiber, and things heat up quickly enough, retaining heat even with mesh crocheting. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, ‚ÄúAlize Baby Vul Batik‚Äù charmed many. </p><div class="photo" data-original="orgubiliyorum.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted toys" class="if uuid-3131192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75783/3131192.jpg"></div><p>  She was especially appreciated by the craftswomen who knit amigurumi toys.  For toys in this technique, the thickness and structure of the thread turned out to be ideal, and many colors in one skein made it possible to save and eliminated the need to purchase skeins of yarn of different colors to perform small parts and make clothes. </p><p>  Finished products with standard care for knitted things do not stretch, do not deform, sit slightly even when washed in 30 ¬∞ water (this increases the density of the fabric), they retain their overall appearance well, but roll up a little in places of contact with other materials (sleeves sweaters on the inner seam, the general fabric with prolonged wear under outer clothing). </p><p>  To summarize the review of reviews on Baby Vul yarn of the Turkish company Alize, you can do the following: you can knit from this material, but use it to make the upper layer of clothing (cardigans, hats, scarves, etc.).  Products are soft, warm, breathable, hypoallergenic, but at the same time a little scratchy, quite durable, after washing they become a little softer and fluffier. </p><p>  Due to this, as well as its low price, Alize Baby Wool yarn remains a favorite among the half-woolen materials of this price category. </p>
