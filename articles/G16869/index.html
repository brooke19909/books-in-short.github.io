This territory has for many years become the haven of the Teleut tribe.  Kulundinskaya steppe was unsuitable for permanent housing due to bad soil and waterlessness.  That is why the Teleut tribe led a literally primitive way of life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Annunciation Altai Territory" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1318420.jpg" width="557"></div>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  By the mid-40s, the territories of the Kulundinskaya steppe began to be actively settled by the first settlers who were not afraid of waterlessness and practically unsuitable for cultivating the soil.  It is here, as mentioned above, that the modern village of Blagoveshchenka (Altai Territory) is located.  The map of the area will perfectly show where exactly you can find this settlement. </p><p>  The first immigrants to these places were especially poor peasants.  A distant and uncharted land gave many families hope for a good, hunger-free life.  However, they were disappointed.  Local residents didn‚Äôt really want to share their land with immigrants.  This gave rise to a fierce struggle between the peasants.  But this did not last long.  Soon a government decree was issued that 15 tithes per one peasant soul were allocated to Voronezh settlers. <br>  However, this did not save them from problems.  Due to the lack of natural water sources, they had to wander from one land to another.  This continued until they reached the territories near Lake Beshtanka.  Thanks to the reservoir, this area did not know drought, and the soil turned out to be incredibly fertile.  In addition, a trade route to the Yamyshevsky Fair passed nearby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Residents of the future village earned a living only by farming.  They grew cultivated plants year-round.  Particularly famous for the future village brought watermelons, which were in incredible demand at all nearby bazaars and fairs. </p><h2>  Location and Economics </h2><p>  The village of Blagoveshchenka is located in the same region of the Altai Territory, not far from two water bodies: Kuchuk and <span>Kulunda lakes.</span>  About 300 km - the path from it to Barnaul (western direction). </p><p>  The main layer of the economy of the village of Blagoveshchenka (Altai Territory) are enterprises of various fields of activity.
