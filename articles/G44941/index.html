It consists of many parts, but there is one that is the subject of greatest pride.  Of course, we are talking about a headdress.  For example, he takes a paratrooper (photo below) not only covers his head from the wind and the scorching sun, but also is his constant companion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="takes a paratrooper pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1895095.jpg" width="517"></div>

    <p>  Buying a ready-made beret in our time is not considered any significant problem, but independent tailoring of this headdress is recognized as special chic.  <span>The pattern of the beret of the</span> paratrooper is not something particularly complicated.  So if you have ever held a needle in your hands, sewing this product will not be difficult. </p><h2>  How to sew it yourself </h2><p>  It takes a paratrooper, the photo of which you will find in this article, is a product of soft shape.  For its manufacture, you will not need a special sewing machine or any special pads. </p><p>  Since there is nothing complicated in the paratrooper's beret pattern, you can build it very quickly.  The most important thing in the whole process is taking measurements.  Here you need to be extremely careful, because if you make a mistake at this stage, all further work will go down the drain. </p><p>  To check the quality of the constructed pattern, once again make sure of your own strengths and not spoil the expensive fabric, it is best to first perform a ‚Äútest‚Äù sample of inexpensive fabric.  So you can eliminate all possible flaws and take into account your mistakes when sewing the ‚Äúmain‚Äù model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beret paratrooper pattern" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1895096.jpg" width="600"></div>

If you want to get a warmer model, coat <span>coat,</span> thick cashmere, or thick fleece is fine. </p><p>  Well, if you want to sew it takes not for a real military, but, for example, for a children's matinee, then the fabric can be any.  The main thing is that the product should resemble the original in style and color. </p><h2>  Take measurements </h2><p>  In order for the pattern of the military beret of the paratrooper to turn out correct and beautiful, you need to correctly take measurements, or rather, just one.  You need to correctly determine the size of the head.  For this, a <span>centimeter tape</span> must be placed in the widest place of the skull.  It should pass through the protruding point of the nape and capture the frontal tubercles.  The number obtained from the measurements will be the size of the headgear.  For example, if you intended 58 cm, then you need to sew a hat of the 58th size. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="takes a paratrooper photo" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1895100.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  Attention!  At the time of measurement, it is very important not to pull the tape measure too much.  Otherwise, the pattern of the paratrooper's beret will be incorrect, and the finished product will be small.  At the same time, it is not necessary to ‚Äúloosen‚Äù the measuring tape too much.  In this case, the headgear will be too large and will sit ugly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beret pattern without a visor </h2><p>  <span>The</span> paratrooper's <span>beret</span> pattern is so simple that there is no need to describe it in detail.  Although the pattern presented in this article shows, it seems, a female model, men's military berets are no different from them. </p><p>  This model is also good because it instantly takes on the ‚Äúright‚Äù shape.  By changing the diameter of the bottom and side, you can easily change the level of blockage and achieve the desired result. </p><p>  The classic beret of the paratrooper has a one-piece bottom.  But if this is not important for you or there are problems with the fabric, the bottom can be cut out in two or four pieces.  The main thing is that the result is a circle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of a military beret of a paratrooper" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1895097.jpg" width="457"></div>

    <h2>  We process the edges </h2><p>  Regardless of whether you take it on a lining or not, so that the product looks beautiful and neat, you need to carefully process all the seams and edges.  Of course, it's best to do this with an overlock.  But if you don‚Äôt have such an aggregate, an ordinary machine with the zigzag function will do.  Well, as a last resort, you can sew over the edges manually. </p><p>  In addition, for the treatment of seams, you can use a <span>slanting trim.</span>  It is possible to ‚Äúpack‚Äù all the seams into it and the beret will serve its owner much longer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of a military beret of a paratrooper" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27191/1895098.jpg" width="354"></div>

    <h2>  Sewing technology </h2><p>  It‚Äôs not at all difficult to sew a paratrooper with his own hands.  Even a beginning seamstress can do this.  But there are still some nuances here: </p><ul><li>  When cutting material, do not forget to leave at least 8 mm for allowances.  If you decide to sew a beret from a synthetic ‚Äúloose‚Äù fabric, then leave at least 1.5 cm for allowance. </li><li>  If you decide to sew a real beret of the paratrooper, then the kashpen (a dimensional strip adjacent to the forehead) can be made of a dense but flexible fabric.  For example, you can <span>take black</span> skin or dense dermantine.  If the fabric is still too stretched, then to give rigidity, you can glue it with a thin non-woven. </li><li>  To work with a chestnut it was easier, but the beret lay better on the head, it is best to cut the dimensional strip along the oblique. </li><li>  Since usually a military beret is lined, the bottom and sides of the headgear must be duplicated on thin fabric.  It can be a regular lining material or thin knitwear. </li><li>  Try to cut out the beret parts in one piece whenever possible.  Remember: numerous joint seams can significantly change the size of the finished product. </li><li>  If the side consists of several parts, they must first be assembled in a circle.  After this, it is necessary to stitch all the seams with a beautiful decorative stitch.  At the same time, do not forget to constantly check the volume of the lower part with the size strip, and the upper size with the diameter of the bottom. </li><li>  The side is connected to the bottom face to face, and then turned out.  The same is done with the lining.  In the seam of the connection of the bottom and the lining, it is necessary to leave a non-sharpened ‚Äúwindow‚Äù.  Enough 10-12 centimeters. </li><li>  Now the seam of the connection of the chestnut with the side is joined face to face with a lining and stitched.  Through the left "window" takes it is necessary to turn out, and to close the gap manually or to grind. </li></ul>

The headpiece of the paratrooper itself is made of dense fabric.  More often than not, she does not ‚Äúcrumble‚Äù and does not ‚Äúshag‚Äù.  Therefore, after carefully processing the seams, the beret can be worn even without a lining.  This is especially true in the hot season.  But if you want to learn how to sew the classic version ‚Äúlike in a store‚Äù, then you will have to do some training.  In fact, there is nothing complicated about this.  It is worth a try and you will certainly succeed!
