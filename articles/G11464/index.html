The reign and personal life of Catherine the Great</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Russian Empress Catherine II, also known as the Great, reigned from 1762 to 1796.  With her own efforts, she significantly expanded the Russian Empire, significantly improved the administration system and energetically pursued a Westernization policy, which implies a process of transition to Western ideas and traditions.  During the time of Catherine the Great, Russia became a fairly large country.  She could compete with the great powers of Europe and Asia. </p><h2>  The childhood of the future great empress </h2><p>  Catherine II, nee Sofia Frederick Auguste, was born on April 21, 1729 in a small German principality in the city of Stettin, Prussia (now it is Szczecin, Poland).  Her father Christian Augustus of Anhalt-Zerbst was the prince of this tiny domain.  He made a military career under Frederick William the First. </p>

    <p>  Catherine's mother is Princess Elizabeth Holstein-Gottorp.  The girl‚Äôs parents really hoped for the appearance of the heir, and therefore did not show much affection for their daughter.  Instead, they devoted most of their time and energy to their son William, who, unfortunately, later died at the age of twelve. </p><h2>  Education and intimacy with a governess </h2><p>  As a child, the future Catherine II was very close to her governess Babette.  Subsequently, the Empress always spoke warmly of her.  The girl‚Äôs education consisted of those items that she needed by status and origin.  This religion (Lutheranism), history, French, German and even Russian, which will be very useful later.  And, of course, music. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So Catherine the Great spent her childhood.  Briefly describing her years at home, we can say that nothing unusual could happen to the girl.  The life of the younger Catherine seemed very boring, and she did not know then that ahead of her was an exciting adventure - a journey to a distant harsh land. </p><h2>  Arrival in Russia, or the beginning of family life </h2><p>  As soon as Catherine grew up, her mother saw in her daughter a means of moving up the social ladder and improving the situation in the family.  She had many relatives, and this helped to engage in a thorough search for a suitable groom.  At the same time, the life of Catherine the Great was so monotonous that she saw in this upcoming marriage a wonderful way to get out of her mother's control. </p>

    <p>  When Catherine was fifteen, Empress Elizabeth Petrovna invited her to Russia so that she could become the wife of the heir to the throne - Grand Duke Peter the Third.  He was an immature and unpleasant sixteen-year-old boy.  As soon as the girl arrived in Russia, she immediately fell ill with pleurisy, which almost killed her. </p><p>  Elizabeth survived due to frequent bloodletting, which <span>Elizabeth Petrovna</span> insisted on <span>.</span>  But her mother was against such a practice, and because of this fell into disgrace to the empress.  Nevertheless, as soon as Catherine recovered and accepted the Orthodox faith, despite the objections of her father, a devoted Lutheran, she and the young prince got married.  And along with the new religion, the girl received a different name - Katerina.  All these events took place in 1745, and this is how the story of Catherine the Great began. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Years of family life, or How a spouse plays toy soldiers </h2><p>  Having become a member of the royal family on August 21, Catherine began to bear the title of Princess.  But her marriage was completely unhappy.  The husband of Catherine the Great was an immature young man who, instead of spending time with his own wife, preferred to play with soldiers.  And the future empress spent time entertaining herself with other amusements, reading. </p><p>  Count <span>Andrei Shuvalov,</span> who was Catherine‚Äôs chamberlain, knew the memoirist James Boswell well, and he informed the count of the details of the monarch‚Äôs intimate life.  Some of these rumors contained information that shortly after marriage, Peter took Elizabeth Vorontsov as his mistress.  But <span>Catherine</span> after that did not remain in debt.  She was seen in relations with Sergei Saltykov, Grigory Orlov, Stanislav Ponyatovsky and others. </p>

    <h2>  The appearance of the long-awaited heir </h2><p>  Several years passed before the future empress gave birth to an heir.  The son of Catherine the Great, Paul, was born on September 20, 1754.  The paternity of this child has become the subject of endless debate.  There are many scientists who believe that in fact the boy‚Äôs father is not the husband of Catherine the Great, but Sergei Saltykov, a Russian nobleman and a member of the court.  Others claimed that the baby looked like Peter, who was his father. </p><p>  In any case, Catherine did not have time for her firstborn, and soon Elizaveta Petrovna took him to her upbringing.  Despite the fact that the marriage was unsuccessful, it did not overshadow the intellectual and political interests of Catherine.  The intelligent young woman continued to read a lot, especially in French.  She loved novels, plays and poems, but was most interested in the works of prominent figures in French education, such as Didro, Voltaire and Montesquieu. </p><p>  Soon, Catherine became pregnant with her second child, Anna, who will live only four months.  Because of various rumors about the promiscuity of the future empress, the children of Catherine the Great did not arouse warm feelings in Peter the Third.  The man doubted that it was he who was their biological father.  Of course, Catherine rejected such accusations from her husband and preferred to spend most of the time in her boudoir in order to hide from his intolerable character. </p><h2>  One step from the throne </h2><p>  After the death of Empress Elizabeth Petrovna, who died on December 25, 1761, Catherine's husband ascended the throne, becoming Peter the Third, while Catherine herself received the title of Empress.  But the couple still lived separately.  The empress had nothing to do with rule.  Peter was openly cruel to his wife.  He ruled the state with his mistresses. </p><p>  But Catherine the Great was a very ambitious woman with great intellectual abilities.  She hoped that eventually she would come to power and rule Russia.  Unlike her husband, Catherine tried to demonstrate her devotion to the state and the Orthodox faith.  As she correctly assumed, this helped her not only to take a seat on the throne, but also to secure the necessary support of the Russian people. </p>

    <h2>  Conspiracy Against Spouse </h2><p>  After just a few months of his reign, Peter the Third managed to get a bunch of enemies in the government among the military and especially church ministers.  On the night of June 28, 1762, Catherine the Great entered into a conspiracy with her lover Grigory Orlov, left the palace and went to the Izmailovsky regiment, where she delivered a speech to the soldiers in which she asked to protect her from her own spouse. </p><p>  So a conspiracy was committed against Peter the Third.  The ruler was forced to sign a document of abdication, and the son of Catherine the Great, Paul, ascended the throne.  Under him, the empress was supposed to be as regent until he came of age.  And Peter shortly after his arrest was strangled by his own guards.  Perhaps Catherine ordered the murder to be committed, but there is no evidence of her guilt. </p><h2>  Dreams Come True </h2><p>  From this time begins the reign of Catherine the Great.  In the early years, she devotes maximum time to ensuring the firmness of her position on the throne.  Catherine knew perfectly well that there are people who consider her a usurper who has seized someone else's power.  Therefore, she actively used the slightest opportunity to win the favor of the nobles and the military. </p><p>  With regard to foreign policy, Catherine the Great knew that Russia needed a long period of peace in order to concentrate on internal problems.  And this world could only be obtained through careful foreign policy.  And for its conduct, Catherine chose Count Nikita Panin, who was very versed in foreign affairs. </p><h2>  The unsettled personal life of Empress Catherine </h2><p>  The portrait of Catherine the Great shows her as a woman of a rather pleasant appearance, and it is not at all surprising that the personal life of the empress was very diverse. </p>

    <p>  Catherine could not remarry, because this would jeopardize her position. </p><p>  According to most researchers, the story of Catherine the Great has about twelve lovers, whom she often bestowed with various presentations, honors and titles in order to win their favor. </p><h2>  Favorites, or How to ensure your old age </h2><p>  After Catherine‚Äôs romance with adviser Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin ended, and this happened in 1776, the empress chose a man who had not only physical beauty, but also excellent mental abilities.  It was Alexander Dmitriev-Mamonov.  Many of the Empress‚Äôs lovers were very kind to her, and Catherine the Great always showed generosity towards them even after completing all the connections. </p><p>  For example, one of her lovers - Peter Zavadovsky - received fifty thousand rubles, a pension of five thousand and four thousand peasants after their relationship ended (this happened in 1777).  The last of her many lovers is Prince Zubov, who was forty years younger than the empress. </p><p>  But what about the children of Catherine the Great?  Really among so many favorites there was no one who gave her another son or daughter?  Or did Pavel remain her only descendant? </p><h2>  Children of Catherine the Great, born of favorites </h2><p>  When Empress Elizaveta Petrovna died, Catherine was six months pregnant from Grigory Orlov.  The kid was born in secret from everyone on April 11, 1762 in a remote part of the palace.  Her marriage to Peter the Third at that time was completely destroyed, and he often flaunted at court with his mistress. </p><p>  Catherine‚Äôs chamberlain Vasily Shkurin and his wife took the child to their house.  The reign of Catherine the Great began when the boy was only a few months old.  He was returned to the palace.  The kid began to enjoy normal childhood under the control of his parents - Empress Catherine and Gregory.  Orlov began to use the child, trying to push Catherine to marriage. </p><p>  She thought for a very long time and persistently, but nevertheless accepted Panin‚Äôs advice, which said that Mrs. Orlova would never be allowed to rule the Russian state.  And Catherine did not dare to marry Grigory Orlov.  When Alex became a teenager, he went to travel abroad.  The journey continued for ten years.  After returning to Russia, the son received the estate as a gift from his mother and began to study in the Holy Cadet Corps. </p>

    <h2>  The influence of favorites on state affairs </h2><p>  According to other historical data, the empress gave birth to a boy and a girl from Poniatovsky, but these children of Catherine the Great lived only about sixteen months.  They have never been publicly recognized.  Most of the <span>favorites of Catherine the Great</span> came from noble families and managed to build an outstanding political career.  For example, Stanislav Poniatowski became king of Poland in 1764. </p><p>  But none of Catherine‚Äôs lovers used their status to the extent that they influenced public policy.  With the exception of Grigory Potemkin, with whom Catherine the Great was associated with very deep feelings.  Many experts even argue that between the empress and Potemkin a secret marriage was concluded in 1774. </p><p>  Catherine the Great, whose reign has brought significant benefits to the Russian state, has remained a loving and beloved woman throughout her life. </p><h2>  The main merits to the Russian state </h2><p>  And although love in Catherine‚Äôs life was an important part, feelings never overshadowed political interests.  The empress always worked hard in mastering the Russian language to such an extent that she completely removed her accent, absorbed Russian culture and mastered customs, and scrupulously studied the history of the empire.  <span>The historical portrait of</span> Catherine the Great indicates that she was a very competent ruler. </p><p>  During her reign, Catherine expanded the borders of the Russian Empire to the south and west by almost 520,000 square kilometers.  The state has become the dominant force in southeastern Europe.  Numerous victories on the military front allowed the empire to gain access to the Black Sea. </p><p>  Moreover, in 1768, the Assignation Bank was entrusted with the task of issuing the first government paper money.  Similar institutions were opened in St. Petersburg and Moscow, and then banking branches were established in other cities. </p><p>  Catherine paid great attention to the education and upbringing of young people of both sexes.  The Moscow Educational House was opened, and soon the Empress established the Smolny <span>Institute for Noble Maidens.</span>  She studied pedagogical theories in the practice of other countries and initiated many educational reforms.  And it was Catherine who made the obligation to open schools in the provincial parts of the Russian Empire. </p>

    <p>  The empress constantly patronized the cultural life of the country, and also showed devotion to the Orthodox faith and the state.  She paid maximum attention to expanding educational institutions and increasing the country's economic power.  But who ruled after Catherine the Great?  Who continued her path in the development of the state? </p><h2>  The last days of the reign.  Possible heirs to the throne </h2><p>  For several decades, Catherine II was the absolute ruler of the Russian state.  But all this time she had a very strained relationship with her own son - heir Paul.  The empress knew perfectly well that it was impossible to transfer power into the hands of the offspring. </p><p>  Catherine the Great, whose reign ended in mid-November 1796, decided to make Alexander the grandson of her.  It was in him that she saw the future ruler and was very warm to him.  The empress prepared her grandson for the reign in advance, engaged in his education.  Moreover, she even managed to marry Alexander, which meant reaching adulthood and the opportunity to take a seat on the throne. </p><p>  Despite this, after the death of Catherine the Great, using the next <span>palace coup, the</span> son of the Empress Pavel the First took the place of the heir to the throne.  Thus, he became the one who ruled after Catherine the Great for five years. </p>
