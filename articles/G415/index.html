Description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Snow-white beaches, located in the most exotic corners of our planet, have not surprised anyone for a long time.  However, there are colorful places in the world that will make you freeze with admiration, and the Bahamian archipelago is just such an exception.  Picturesque Harbor, considered an elite holiday destination of the island state, attracts wealthy tourists from around the world like a magnet.  They rush here to see with their own eyes the fantastically beautiful pink beach, famous for its unusual color of sand. </p><h2>  Perfect beaches </h2><p>  The unique nature has always been the main attraction of the original archipelago.  The Bahamas has been welcoming travelers for many years, giving them memorable happy moments.  But the most special among the many islands of the state in the Atlantic Ocean is the famous Harbor, which is known for its beaches.  Equipped and great for swimming, they are just perfect in every way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pink sands beach" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1403205.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Natural phenomenon </h2><p>  <span>Pink Beach (Pink</span> Sands Beach) is especially loved by vacationers who are delighted with a wonderful phenomenon, which at first can be attributed to optical illusion.  An amazing indescribable picture opens up to the eyes of the guests of the island: endless sky-blue, clear water and outlandish sand.  Such magnificence of the virgin nature of Harbor will make even travelers who have seen a lot of things freeze with delight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pink beach harbor" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1403208.jpg" width="600"></div>

Such a phenomenon is associated with single-celled insects living on the beach, whose carapace is painted in a delightfully gentle tone.  When the surf throws them ashore in huge numbers, the microscopic shells are broken and mixed with sand, giving it a unique shade. </p><p>  The ocean so carefully grinds the hard shells thrown onto the pink beach (Harbor) that the sand poses no danger to the guests of the archipelago: it is resilient, soft, and it is very pleasant to lie on it.  I must say that the water grinds red corals into tiny grains, which also give a peculiar shade along with foraminifera insects. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pink beach" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1403210.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is amazing how the color of local attractions changes with the lighting.  Under the bright rays of the warm sun, lilac-metallic reflections lie on the world's most beautiful beach of pink sands, and at sunset it impresses with a purple palette. </p><h2>  Elutera beaches </h2><p>  Small Harbor, stretching five kilometers in length, is located next to the island of Eleuthera, and between them is a narrow pier.  Those who crave new adventures and experiences will be transported by ferry to a picturesque place famous for its virgin nature and lesser-known pink beaches.  With a population of more than seven thousand people, the corner lost in the ocean is practically uninhabited, and only masterpieces created by nature itself receive new guests.  Located in the west and east, they surprise a few tourists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure Island </h2><p>  It should be noted that the pink beach of the island is not the only reason to make a long flight to Harbor, so we‚Äôll also tell you a little about what else it can attract the attention of vacationers. </p><p>  It is no exaggeration to say that the whole life of Harbor Island is to serve tourists.  Developed infrastructure with comfortable hotels, a whole network of restaurants and boutiques attracts thousands of travelers annually.  In the sunny resort, everyone will find entertainment to their taste, from a relaxing holiday on the beaches to active sports. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pink island beach" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1403209.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the island is the city of Dunmore, whose indigenous people were engaged in shipbuilding and sold sugar cane.  It is the oldest settlement in the Bahamas, and its buildings are distinguished by a special style.  Tourists note that a measured pastime is not very suitable for young people who love nightlife in entertainment venues.  But those who do not think themselves without contemplating the natural beauties will fall in love with the magical Harbor at first sight. </p><p>  The best <span>Caribbean island,</span> as it was called by readers of Travel + Leisure Travel Magazine, received the highest rating from tourists who recognized the Bahamian pearl of love. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><ul><li>  The amazing color of the sand of the island of Harbor attracts not only wealthy tourists.  Filming for numerous glamorous magazines takes place here, and tanned models show pink swimwear.  The resulting photos do not even require any retouching. </li><li>  Five-star hotels are located near the beach, offering guests to relax at the highest level. </li><li>  Due to the fact that the four-kilometer pink beach is protected by coral reefs, it maintains the purity of water, which pleases its guests.  Particularly pleased are divers who come from all over the world for an unforgettable experience.  They note a comfortable dive, because here the surf of the Atlantic Ocean is not felt, and the absence of strong waves allows you to take a closer look at the rare inhabitants of the deep sea.  It is believed that this is one of the few islands with clear water, where visibility reaches almost 60 meters. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pink harbor island beach" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1403199.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Local authorities are concerned about the preservation of a natural miracle, so any construction is prohibited next to it. </li><li>  The pink beach of Harbor Island was chosen by Hollywood celebrities, and it is quite possible that tourists will meet leisurely strolling media people who bought their homes in an exotic place. </li><li>  The high season for visiting the eco-friendly resort begins in May and ends in September. </li></ul><h2>  The case when you do not need pink glasses </h2><p>  Of course, such natural phenomena exist in other countries, for example, in Greece, but the most famous was the pink beach in the Bahamas, photographs of which circled the whole world.  The best place for a romantic getaway and honeymoon is simply not to be found!  Come to Harbor Island and you won‚Äôt need pink glasses to feel truly happy. </p>
