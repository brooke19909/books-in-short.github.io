Its location was Imereti lowland.  Apartments built in the resort are just a ten-minute drive from Sochi Airport. </p><h2>  Resort "Imeretinsky": infrastructure </h2><p>  The resort area was built with the expectation that it will actively function all year round.  For this, a developed infrastructure was created, which is able to attract numerous tourists to Imereti apartments.  The resort has more than 20 catering establishments, 19 swimming pools, including 6 children’s, a magnificent tennis school equipped with 6 courts, paths for cycling and jogging with a length of 15 kilometers.  In addition, the complex has a medical clinic, fitness center and spa.  It is worth noting that the Imeretinsky resort is the only one on the Black Sea that has its own promenade and yacht port.  On its territory was opened the first modern Sochi beach in all of Sochi. </p><h2>  Resort Areas </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the Imereti apartments (Sochi) are located in three blocks, into which the entire resort is divided.

    <p>  The resort has a modern hotel complex called "Imeretinsky".  It includes an apart-hotel (located next to the Olympic Park) and a four-star hotel. </p><p>  The comfortable apartments and modern rooms overlook the Black Sea and the mountain peaks.  The hotel complex operates under the brand name "Russian Hotels" and offers its guests the best conditions for a family vacation, as well as for business meetings and events. </p><p>  The aparthotel has apartments in all resort areas.  We talked about them earlier.  But the four-star hotel offers guests a fairly large selection.  The hotel has 196 rooms, including 181 standard, one presidential room and 14 luxury rooms. </p><h2>  Restaurants and bars of the resort </h2><p>  The resort has several <span>restaurants, cafes</span> and bars, as well as a food delivery service.

    <p>  The main hotel restaurant, called the Bosphorus, is located on the ground floor of the building.  It will impress guests with lightness and plenty of light in the interiors, elegant furniture and a good kitchen. </p><p>  A food delivery service is available in the resort around the clock.  You can order the food you like at any time.  In the Coastal Quarter there is a cafe "Abrau", decorated in the Russian style.  On the ground floor, guests can visit the lobby bar.  Cafe "Crete" and "Capri", built in the Coastal region, offer all vacationers to take advantage of the benefits of a buffet style. </p><h2>  Spa "Imeretinsky" </h2><p>  The hotel offers guests the opportunity to visit the spa, within the walls of which you can not only relax and unwind, but also plunge into the world of beauty.  A wide range of cosmetic procedures and various spa programs will allow each woman to find beauty and freshness.  In addition, there is a hairdresser, whose specialists will help complete the image of a real beauty.  The spa is located on the seventh floor of the main building. </p><h2>  Fitness Centre </h2><p>  The modern fitness center is bright and sunny.  Within its walls, guests can visit the indoor and outdoor pool, jacuzzi, relaxation area, sauna, gyms for individual group classes.  Professional instructors will help you choose the right set of exercises suitable for you. </p><h2>  Imereti apartments: reviews </h2><p>  Concluding the conversation about Imereti apartments, I would like to turn to the reviews of tourists who managed to visit them.  According to the guests of the resort, the apartments are spacious, well-equipped and have beautiful interiors.  All of them have beautiful views from the windows to the most beautiful places.  Very pleased with the modern clean pools in each area of ​​the resort.  As for food, local cafes offer good breakfasts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Imereti Valley apartments" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1765937.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  According to tourists, the modern resort has a number of minuses, despite the excellent equipment.  One of them is the remoteness of the beach from different areas.  It is not very comfortable to stroll through the hot terrain in the summer heat.  Paid sun loungers are issued on the beach, which is rather strange for a resort of this level. </p><p>  Not all apartment guests are satisfied with the quality of cleaning.  In addition, maids sometimes forget to take out the trash daily, which is stipulated by the living conditions. </p><p>  In general, the apartments of the resort area "Imeretinsky" are worthy of attention from guests who come to relax in Sochi. </p>
