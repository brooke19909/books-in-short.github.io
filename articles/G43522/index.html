In Yekaterinburg, one of the largest temples in Russia, the Temple on Blood, was recently built.  A stone's throw from him is our wonderful hotel.  The temple was erected in 2003, on the site where on July 16 at night in 1918 the Russian autocrat Nicholas II and his family were shot.  The temple was consecrated on July 16, 2003. </p><p>  Currently, the pilgrims visit the sanctuary, not only from Russia, but also from other countries.  The church attracts the attention of many travelers arriving in Yekaterinburg, including representatives of art, famous politicians and so on. </p><p>  Today the Temple on Blood is not only a functioning church, but also a museum complex.  Here is a collection of objects that tell about the last months of life of Nicholas II and his household. </p><p>  Between the built buildings of the church and the Patriarchal Compound there is a wooden chapel of the Rev. Martyr Elizabeth.  This structure was repeatedly set on fire and subjected to vandalism, but survived.  As a result of the arsons, the chapel fell into a dark color.  In front of a wooden house on the ground lies a huge marble stone with an inscription that tells about the murder of the royal Romanov dynasty. </p><p>  The Patriarchal Compound was erected and consecrated along with the temple.  It includes the patriarchal chambers, the library, the house chapel of St. Nicholas, an incredible number of halls and rooms for organizing a variety of church meetings. </p><p>  The area in which the Temple on Blood is located, the Ascension Cathedral, the Elizabethan Chapel, the Patriarchal Compound, is now called the ‚ÄúHoly Quarter‚Äù. </p><h2>  "Red line" </h2><p>  You must admit that Hotel Marins Park enjoys considerable popularity!  Reviews, description - all testifies to this!  But now the conversation will be about the "Red Line" - a walking tourist route in Yekaterinburg.  It was created for independent travel of the townsfolk and guests of the metropolis in the historical center.

Volunteers designated all points of interest by numbering, which was also applied to the sidewalk.  This nuance allows tourists with a guide to navigate the city without the help of a guide. </p><p>  It is interesting that the length of the Yekaterinburg Red Line is six and a half kilometers.  Near each attraction on the asphalt there are telephone numbers, by calling which you can listen to the history of the object in Russian or English.  The text is told by musicians, English polyglots or journalists. </p><h2>  Restaurant "Tanuki", "Chocolate" and others </h2><p>  And let's take a short trip to the establishments where the guests of the Marins Park Hotel eat.  In the Tanuki Restaurant, for example, you can have a great time and enjoy Japanese home cooking.  This is an island of silence and comfort in the ever hurrying, noisy metropolis.  Visitors find themselves in the comfortable atmosphere of the Japanese garden, leaving behind the threshold problems of the modern world.  They enjoy relaxing at wooden tables under the lush branches of Japanese pine. </p><p>  On the tables are flashlights made of <span>rice paper.</span>  They glow with a soft light, revealing the intricate pattern of the veins of the paper shell.  In Japan, there is a belief that good perfumes flock to the bright light of a paper lantern. </p><p>  The Tanuki animal lives in this restaurant: this hospitable owner does not let the guests get bored.  The Japanese believe that fortune and prosperity will always live in the house where Tanuki settled. </p>
