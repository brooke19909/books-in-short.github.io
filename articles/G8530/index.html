However, in December 2018, the company had significant problems. </p><p>  In the last days of the calendar year, it became known that the Alpari broker had its license revoked.  At one point, she lost two more major forex companies - TeleTrade and Forex Club.  In addition, the certificates of their top managers were canceled. </p><p>  After that, conversations immediately began that the Alpari broker had expired.  The claims that the Central Bank put forward to the company were in violation of the requirements, the requirements for the ratio of the amount of security that was provided to individuals, to the procedure for maintaining an internal account.  Also, the revocation of the license from the Alpari broker was associated with the provision of false information on financial statements and violations committed in the field of organizing a risk management system. </p><p>  It is worth noting that these forex companies have received a large number of complaints.  This has been repeatedly stated by representatives of the Central Bank, in particular, Olga Shishlyannikova, head of the Department of the Commodity and Securities Market of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  It turned out that for most Forex dealers who worked legally, the average life of one account did not exceed six months, and the losses incurred by customers were four times their profit. </p><p>   2018         ,   . ,       ""  ,         .         .   ,     ,        ,     . </p><p> The situation is aggravated by the fact that these companies, and Alpari broker are no exception, are registered through offshore companies in foreign countries.  The money of customers is irrevocably going there. </p><h2>  Customer Impressions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="designdepot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alpari LLC" class="if uuid-3130947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3130947.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews about the broker LLC Alpari come in a wide variety.  Customers note that the company provides an opportunity to work for themselves as a plus.  Good income can be obtained through an affiliate program.  A fairly transparent mechanism for withdrawing money: everything happens in a short time, immediately after user verification. </p><p>  In their reviews of the Alpari broker, customers emphasize that this company has been successfully operating in the market for a long time.  This indicates its high standards. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p>  It should be recognized that there are many negative reviews about the broker LLC Alpari.  Customers sadly say that recently the company is completely falling apart, although there have been trends for this for a long time.  Claims often arise due to the failure of transactions for unexplained reasons, server freezes, which interferes with the implementation of transactions, the supply of left quotes that simply did not correspond to reality. </p><p>  Even working with PAMM accounts leads to a large number of negative reviews about the Alpari broker on Forex.  Users admit that they simply lost all their money when they were contacted.  Therefore, they strongly do not advise this company.  It seems that the office was created certainly not for ordinary people to earn money. </p><p>  Among the negative reviews about the Alpari broker, one can find allegations that these are ordinary scams.  All kinds of problems constantly arise with the withdrawal of money and the operation of the terminal, which, as a rule, do not exist for other companies working in the same field. </p><p>  The outrage causes the constant closure of profitable transactions, which occurs with enviable popularity.  When contacting the support service for advice, the client receives an answer that the case, most likely, is due to the fact that the passwords from the account were entrusted to unauthorized persons.  The company assures that all its activities are carried out in full accordance with the existing regulations, so checking the correctness of execution is not difficult.  According to the existing client agreement, it is strictly forbidden to transfer the password from the account to third parties.  If this happens, then the user must be aware of the risk he is taking.  In this case, the transaction is closed, even if at the same time it is profitable. </p><p>  Another point that is often noted in reviews of the Alpari broker is the lack of protection against negative balance on ECN accounts.  In addition, when customers invest in companies, traders often trade so irresponsibly that the user loses all his savings.  As a result, clients come to the conclusion that there are no real professionals among the specialists of this company, and only uneducated self-taught people who can not be trusted with anything, especially their savings and financial management.  The users ‚Äôbenefit does not bother them at all, and besides, they don‚Äôt care at all about their reputation, either their own or their company.  As a result, those customers who have worked with them strongly recommend never contacting Alpari again. </p>
