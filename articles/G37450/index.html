In 2007, it was decided to create a list of famous modern architectural structures in order to select the New Seven Wonders of the World.  Among them were the pyramids of Giza, Chichen Itza, Taj Mahal, Petra, Machu Picchu, the <span>Great Wall of China, the</span> Colosseum and the statue of Christ the Savior.  It is about the latter that will be discussed today, so we will go back to Brazil and see what is interesting here. </p><h2>  Rio de Janeiro - the pearl of Brazil </h2>

European architecture, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãlights, luxury jewelry stores and even a Museum of treasures.

    <p>  The peak, on which the statue was later erected, was called the ‚ÄúMountain of Temptation‚Äù back in the 14th century.  Its unusual form later led to a change of name, and it became known as Corcovado, which in translation into Russian means "hunchback". </p><p>  In 1859, before a series of research expeditions, the clergyman of the Catholic Church Pedro Maria Boss visited here.  Conquered by the picturesque beauty of these places, he decided to erect a statue of Christ on the mountain, which will serve as a symbol of protection and protect the city.  It is no accident that the city of Rio de Janeiro was chosen as the place where the statue of Christ the Savior is located.  A stunning panorama of the city, the bay with the picturesque Sugarloaf Mountain and openwork coastline is associated with nothing more than a picture of modern paradise. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Project competition </h2><p>  The church was not ready to implement such a large-scale project at its own expense, so the project was postponed and the construction of the railway began, which was supposed to help in the delivery of building materials. </p><p>  In 1921, a festival was organized called the Monument Week.  During its holding, donations for construction were collected. </p><p>  Since the city where the statue of Christ the Savior found its permanent place was so actively involved in the implementation of this plan, it was decided to announce a competition for the best project.  Architects and engineers immediately responded, offering dozens of different options for consideration.  The city administration chose the project of Eitor da Silva Costa: his statue expressed the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãChristianity as much as possible, since the figure with outstretched arms resembled a cross. </p><p>  I must say that the project has undergone some changes.  After much debate, the engineers replaced the ball-shaped pedestal, symbolizing the earth, with a rectangular one.  It laid a small chapel, which operates to this day.  The pedestal was made marble. </p><h2>  Location </h2>

    <p>  Construction lasted about 9 years, from 1922 to 1931.  It was a truly grandiose project.  To create such a miracle as a statue of Christ the Savior, the country at that time was not technically ready, so it was decided to produce all the details in France, and then deliver it by rail to the top of Mount Corcovado.  Here they were met by local craftsmen and sculptors who assembled.  A figure is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On October 12, 1931, the grand opening and consecration of the statue took place.  From the end of the railway to the top of the mountain, a winding staircase was made up of 220 steps, along which numerous pilgrims, tourists and townspeople climbed.  Since then, on the majestic Mount Corcovado, towering 704 meters above sea level, in a mysterious haze of clouds and fog, there is a beautiful statue of Christ the Savior.  The city, under the mighty protection of Jesus, has a fantastic vision, from which the heart stops ... The statue became a symbol of Rio de Janeiro and Brazil. </p><h2>  Description </h2>

    <p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe figure of Christ standing with outstretched arms suggests that everything in the hands of the Lord.  The statue is visible from anywhere in the city, at any time of the day.  It looks especially charming in the rays of the setting sun from the porthole of a helicopter.  Private companies provide this service: a slow fly-around of the monumental figure of Christ in a circle.  Its height, together with the pedestal, is impressive - 39.6 meters, and the arm span - 30 meters.  The weight of the giant is more than 1100 tons! </p><h2>  Time travel </h2><p>  To plunge into the era of the monument, you should use the old transport, preserved from 1896.  An antique-looking tram still runs connecting the upper and lower levels of the city.  Just imagine that he is more than 100 years old, as the past decades immediately appear before his eyes ... </p><p>  The journey will be slow and give you the opportunity to enjoy the magnificent views.  Squeaking on bends and struggling to overcome a steep climb, the tram brings you to the foot of the stairs leading to the observation deck.  Only 220 steps - and you are at the statue.  From this angle, the pedestal looks much more impressive partly because the mountain itself is a natural pedestal.  Many speak of a special, mysterious aura enveloping the figure.  It is difficult to disagree with this, because next to such a work of art you feel mystical awe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What country is the statue of Christ the Savior" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/467548.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Recommendations for tourists </h2><p>  Do not bask in bed for a long time if you decide to take a trip to the beautiful.  The statue of Christ the Savior is located in one of the most visited cities, so the influx of tourists here is very large.  Toward noon, you run the risk of getting stuck in a queue for a long time.  Both the ski lift, the tram, and the stairs themselves have limited capacity, so early morning is the best time for an excursion. </p><p>  There are no problems with transport here: every 30 minutes a train leaves the city, which brings people to the monument.  It takes a little time, about 20 minutes.  If you do not want to part with your personal transport, then at the foot of the statue there is a good parking.  From here you can go on foot ascent or use the modern elevator.  Today there is the opportunity to climb the escalator or funicular, so if you have small children or elderly people, do not worry that the loads will be beyond their strength. </p><p>  Do not rush to leave the site after visiting the statue: go on an excursion to the Museum of Naive Art, take a walk through the magnificent forest on your own or in the company of a guide.  Clean air, transparent rivers and lakes, exotic animals - all this will give a lot of vivid impressions. </p><h2>  Doubles statues </h2>

In Lisbon, in the mid-90s of the twentieth century, a 28-meter statue was erected.  Instead of a 700-meter mountain, a pedestal 80 meters high was used.

    <p>  In Vietnam, a similar statue was erected with outstretched arms 32 meters high. </p><p>  In Indonesia, just a few years ago, the construction of the 30-meter high monument of Christ was completed, and this despite the fact that the country is Muslim. </p><h2>  Time, nature, element </h2><p>  For less than 100 years of serious upheaval, the statue did not survive.  The storms and hurricanes that destroyed everything in their path did not harm her, as did the lightning that often struck her.  Someone refers this to the properties of <span>soapstone,</span> others see it as a sacred meaning.  In one of the strong thunderstorms, lightning broke two fingers from the hand of Christ.  The church keeps a reserve of stone from which the monument is made, and in the near future the reconstruction of this valuable historical object is expected. </p>
