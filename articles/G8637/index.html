The city is proud of the factories that produce high-quality metal, which (a confirmed legend) was ordered here to build the Statue of Liberty in New York.  Here the famous son and father of the Cherepanovs developed a steam locomotive - the first domestic one.  And the local car-building plant, in addition to cars for Russian Railways, produces modern tanks. </p><p>  Nizhny Tagil is a city with a difficult fate and a long history.  But he gave the world many talented people whom all Russians are proud of. </p><h2>  "Vyiska merchant" </h2>

Modern and old sculptures are added to the old and ancient places of interest in this city.  For example, ‚ÄúVyiska merchant‚Äù, who fell asleep in her bed right next to the Alexander passage.

    <h2>  Samples of military products </h2><p>  Most of the monuments and famous places are located in the center or close to it.  For example, directly in the open air on the central street of Lenin, there are samples of military products from the Nizhny Tagil plant: a copy of the first Cherepanov steam locomotive, a T-34 tank, non-standard wheel shapes, rails and other products of the city‚Äôs factories. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tower </h2><p>  The first interesting attraction of Nizhny Tagil is the Watchtower.  She is almost two centuries old.  The tower is the highest point of pride.  Historians have been arguing for several decades now about when and why it is called that.  Indeed, by the time of its construction in these places there were no raids.  There is speculation that the Watchtower was used as an observation post.  Since the <span>city</span> consisted of wooden buildings for a very <span>long time</span> , there were frequent fires.  Therefore, historians suggest that the tower had a bell and, most likely, lights. </p>

Therefore, it is possible that they watched the starry sky.  Moreover, in the city at the pedagogical institute for a very long time they kept an ancient telescope, which recently was transferred to the Nizhny Tagil Museum-Reserve.

The halls of the second floor will tell about the process of urbanization of Nizhny Tagil, about how the settlement became a city.  The expositions are rich in old photographs that reveal the appearance of a factory-type village, the clothes of the population of that time, the life of serfs in this district.  In one of the rooms you can see the approximate interior of the living room of the manager's house and the front door.

    <h2>  Monument to Peter and Fevronia </h2><p>  What other sights of Nizhny Tagil are known?  Monuments.  You can start by visiting patrons of family happiness: Peter and Fevronia.  The monument is a little over 15 years old, and it is already one of the most visited and beloved. </p>

This is how you need to build a married life, according to God's covenants.  They loved each other all their long lives, and having felt the imminent arrival of death, they took a monastic vow in the male and female monasteries, respectively, and went into another world at one day and one hour.  Before the couple died, they bequeathed to put them in one coffin and bury them together.  The monks did not follow the will of the spouses.  And soon a miracle happened: under the vigilant gaze of the monks praying near them, the bodies of Peter and Fevronia were in one coffin.  Although physically they were far apart.

    <p>  The monument to Peter and Fevronia of Murom turned out to be simple and concise.  Spouses in simple clothes are standing on a pedestal, their legs are wrapped in a symbol of the Garden of Eden.  Inside the pedestal there is a lamp, whoever considers it necessary, can put a candle in it and even pray for family well-being (the prayer is knocked out on the other side of the pedestal). <br>  An interesting fact is that the monument was ordered and manufactured by local businessman Alexander Kubyshev.  He independently prepared a place under the pedestal and installed a fountain (previously he had a water supply to it). </p><p>  And the installation of the monument surprised the workers with a ‚Äúmiraculous‚Äù phenomenon.  They claim that the figures of the saints ideally fell right into place immediately, without adjustment and tuning, as if they really wanted to. </p><h2>  Museum of armored vehicles </h2><p>  Not far from the famous Ural Car Building Plant there is a museum with a rare exposure.  It was opened in 1986 for the anniversary of the enterprise according to the order of the director.  Initially, museum exhibitions were available only to factory workers.  In 1988, a warehouse for finished products was made from the museum.  But at the same time, the exhibits were preserved. </p>

At the same time, the first excursions were started on the expositions.  In 2006, the museum ceased to obey the plant and opened the door for everyone.  This significant tour was accompanied by the governor of the region, veterans of the rear and war, as well as the archbishop.

    <p>  The modern museum has more than a thousand unique exhibits.  These are all kinds of tools, machine tools, observation devices, details of military vehicles, etc. A separate exhibition area is devoted to sketches and drawings of a factory from Kharkov, which is building steam locomotives. </p><p>  Among the presented equipment - there are armored vehicles of the Second World War, in which you can touch everything, see and even climb and sit. </p><h2>  Memorials to the fallen </h2><p>  The sights of Nizhny Tagil are represented by several memorials to those who died in the Great Patriotic War. </p><p>  The memorial looks like a large rectangular column.  All sides of it are "covered" with the names of the dead.  At the end of each list are years.  Not far from the column, the monument itself is visible.  This is the second part of the memorial.  The bas-reliefs of the warriors are in motion on a large wall.  This memorial place is located near the railway station, which is very symbolic, because it <span>is a memorial to the</span> dead soldiers of the railway workers. </p>

    <p>  In May 2012, the name of the local soldier Prokopiy Tolmachev, found by the search engines, was added to the 246 names knocked out on the column. </p><p>  On this place dear to the townspeople, ceremonies are held dedicated to the celebration of May 9th.  And there was even a tradition to plant birch trees every year near the memorial.  A small grove has already formed. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  These are not all the sights of Nizhny Tagil.  The city has a beautiful drama theater, modeled on <span>Greek theaters.</span>  The administration building deserves special attention of constructivism lovers, a unique monument to the father and son Cherepanov and many, many other interesting and unique memorable places. </p>
