There is a logical explanation for this.  With a small difference in price, the buyer gets a lot of advantages.  One of them is new engineering networks, walls and floors.  This eliminates the need for repairs in the coming decades.  In addition, it is in new buildings that you can choose apartments with an improved layout and well-designed internal infrastructure. </p><p>  Among the <span>new buildings in Krasnodar,</span> one cannot ignore such a large project as the <span>Green Park</span> residential complex <span>(Green Park).</span>  It is notable for its convenient transport interchange, the level of housing comfort and quite reasonable prices.  Important is the fact that many apartments in this complex have already been purchased, which means that there is a demand for them. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The residential complex Green Park in Krasnodar is located in the Karasun district, where the active construction of residential complexes is underway.  The address of the new building: Krasnodar, Dmitry Blagoev street, 29 (lit. 1-3). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="green park Krasnodar" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2158986.jpg"></div>

    <p>  According to the approved project, Green Park consists of 3 houses, each of which has 18 floors.  The total number of apartments is 900. The developer is the company Capital-Invest (CapitalStroy).  According to many experts in the field of real estate, the developer managed to combine the aesthetics of the houses, the availability of housing and the most convenient location in the project. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The deadline for commissioning Green Park residential complex is scheduled for the 3rd quarter of 2017. </p><h2>  Construction Features </h2><p>  Design and construction work was carried out taking into account all the necessary norms and requirements, which guarantees high quality construction site.  The materials used during the work are the products of well-known companies.  At the same time, the project has some distinctive characteristics.  They are very important to consider, since they directly affect the operational quality of housing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD green park Krasnodar address" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2158996.jpg"></div>

    <ul><li>  Application in the construction of monolithic frame technology. </li><li>  The walls of the houses are made of bricks. </li><li>  Exterior decoration of houses involves the installation of a ventilated facade with porcelain stoneware.  For this, an aluminum subsystem is mounted.  Such a decision is today considered one of the most rational.  The ventilated facade gives the building an attractive appearance and, thanks to the aeration of the panels, protects the walls from moisture.  The walls of such a house will last much longer, and mold will not appear on them either. </li><li>  Ceiling height reaches 2.8 meters.  This can be considered as an advantage, because even today many developers offer low ceilings (2.5 m). </li></ul><h2>  The internal infrastructure of the <span>residential complex</span> "Green Park" </h2><p>  The internal infrastructure of the residential complex was carefully thought out at the planning stage.  The first and second floors of the houses will be occupied by offices of various service companies.  Among them are provided: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  grocery store; </li><li>  pharmacy; </li><li>  beauty saloon; </li><li>  Kindergarten. </li></ul><p>  There is a concierge room on the ground floor. </p><p>  The territory of the residential complex is equipped with underground parking with a sufficient number of parking spaces for residents - only 383 places.  There is also a guest parking area. </p><p>  Yards of houses are a convenient landscaped area with green spaces, benches for relaxation, sports and playgrounds.  In other words, the territory is equipped to the smallest detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capital invest" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2158990.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  External Infrastructure LCD </h2><p>  Buyers who are looking for a comfortable apartment pay special attention to such characteristics as transport accessibility and district infrastructure.  It is worth noting that one of the best places was chosen for the construction of the Green Park residential complex in Krasnodar. </p><p>  The fact is that infrastructure has already been formed in this area.  This allows newcomers to immediately get access to all institutions from the service sector, rather than waiting for several months for the construction of a kindergarten or supermarket in a remote area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe new building. </p><p>  Not far from the LCD there are: </p><ul><li>  kindergartens (in addition, a kindergarten will be in the complex itself); </li><li>  gymnasium; </li><li>  comprehensive schools; </li><li>  polyclinics; </li><li>  large supermarkets; </li><li>  shopping centers; </li><li>  restaurants and cafes; </li><li>  Beauty Salons; </li><li>  sports complex; </li><li>  picturesque park of culture and rest ‚ÄúSunny Island‚Äù. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD green park Krasnodar" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2158985.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  Of great importance is transport accessibility.  There are no problems with this either.  There is a bus stop 5-10 minutes walk; it takes about 10-15 minutes to get to Krasnodar Airport. </p><h2>  Types of apartments </h2><p>  In the <span>residential complex of</span> Krasnodar "Green Park" there are several options for real estate.  These are 1- and 2-room apartments.  This feature is mainly explained by the fact that they are the most popular types of housing in the city.  At the same time, each buyer can choose an apartment of their own layout and the desired area. </p><ul><li>  One-room apartments.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch apartments varies from 41 to 45 square meters.  m </li><li>  One bedroom apartments.  In this case, it is possible to purchase more spacious housing with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã66-71 sq.m. </li></ul><h2>  Apartment renovation </h2><p>  The developer of the LCD "Green Park" offers the most convenient and profitable option - pre-finishing.  It includes the following works: </p><ul><li>  high-quality double-glazed windows are installed on the windows; </li><li>  loggias are glazed; </li><li>  fully wired; </li><li>  communication systems laid (central water supply, sewage); </li><li>  installed meters for heat supply, water and electricity; </li><li>  floors and walls are aligned; </li><li>  durable high-quality entrance doors are installed. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="residential complex green park" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2158987.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  The pre-finishing allows to reduce the repair time (compared with the rough finish) and allows new owners to move in as quickly as possible.  At the same time, there is a significant saving in price compared to fine finishing. </p><h2>  The cost of apartments </h2><p>  Speaking about the cost of apartments in the Green Park residential complex in Krasnodar, it should be noted that it belongs to the middle segment and is similar to prices in some other new buildings in the city.  On the other hand, for apartments belonging to the comfort class, they can be called quite attractive from a financial point of view. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lc green park builder" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2158988.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about the "Green Park" in Krasnodar are mostly flattering.  Dissatisfaction was expressed most often due to failures in the deadline.  Apparently, Capital-Invest put off the commissioning for quite some time. </p><p>  The lack of public transport in some directions was also indicated. </p><p>  Otherwise, the buyers were satisfied. </p><p>  There are a large number of new buildings in the Green Park area, therefore, in the district there are mainly attractive new buildings that do not violate the general appearance.  A lot of shops and service companies in the district are also a big plus, according to potential buyers. </p><p>  Based on the characteristics, value of the property and reviews, it can be concluded that the apartments in this residential complex are extremely attractive for purchase.  Such an offer may interest both people in need of housing and far-sighted investors.  On the other hand, it is necessary to take into account many individual requirements for real estate. </p>
