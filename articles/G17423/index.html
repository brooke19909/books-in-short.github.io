It is located directly on the Black Sea coast, between the Oyburskoye and Donuzlav lakes.  It was founded in 1969. </p><p>  There are many similar villages on the peninsula, life here is quiet and measured.  As soon as summer comes, the village comes to life. </p><p>  This place has everything for a good rest - the cleanest air, the sea with clear water, the rich aroma of medicinal plants, a shallow bay, healing mud.  The whole amazing mix created by nature itself is waiting for you in Mirny.  In the village it will be good for both adults and children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peaceful crimea" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/469193.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Recreation and entertainment </h2><p>  On the beach of the village there is only velvety sand, there are no rocks, no pebbles, no stones.  The sea here is clean and warm.  The village of Mirny (Crimea) is located about a fifteen minute walk from the sea. </p><p>  There are many interesting entertainments on the city beach.  These are <span>jet skis</span> and inflatable slides.  In addition, tourists have the opportunity to fly on a hang glider.  You can also rent a catamaran, jet ski and more.  Extreme sports such as kiting and windsurfing are also developing very fast in this region.  Since 2007, a festival called "Wings of Donuzlav" has been held in the village area.  There you can see demonstrations on kitesurfing and windsurfing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In past years, the famous Kazantip festival was held in the neighboring village - Kakhovka.  A lot of tourists gathered for this event.  Many of them lived in Mirny, as in Kakhovka it was much more expensive.  Tourists can get on foot from one village to another in just fifteen minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Peaceful Crimea" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/469192.jpg" width="449"></div>

    <h2>  Housing choice </h2><p>  The village of Mirny (Crimea) has in its structure many hotels, inns and pensions, which hospitably welcome tourists from all over the world.  Those who prefer a more modest vacation should pay attention to the private sector.  A lot of people rent rooms and houses in the summer. </p><h2>  Sights of the village </h2><p>  <span>Donuzlav Lake</span> is the deepest on the territory of <span>the Crimean peninsula.</span>  It cuts deeper into the territory for thirty kilometers, thus separating the <span>Tarkhankut Peninsula.</span>  The shores of this lake are very winding, due to which small bays form.  At the mouth of Donuzlav there are sea fish - red mullet, horse mackerel, mullet and goby, and in the upper reaches - freshwater (for example, carp and silver carp).  Birds such as cormorants, ducks and waders nest here. </p><p>  A valuable deposit of healing mud is Oybur Lake.  In the summer season, when it dries up, a layer (rather thick) of sea salt appears on its surface.  It is no less useful than dirt.  Not far from Lake Oybur there is an estuary with blue clay, which is used for treatment and rejuvenation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is also a dolphinarium, which is located in the bay of Lake Donuzlav.  On the basis of this institution, a dolphin therapy research laboratory was created.  Communication with these marvelous sea creatures normalizes and corrects the functioning of the central nervous system.  Here you can watch an amazing performance.  Those who wish can take pictures with dolphins and even swim with them. </p><p>  Cape Tarkhankut is an amazingly beautiful place.  It is very good here to engage in sports such as diving, surfing and kiting.  The water in this place in the summer warms up to +28 <sup></sup> , the sea is clean, since there are no rivers nearby.  The cape, like the village of Mirny, has a sandy beach.  By the way, <span>Cape Tarkhankut</span> is the westernmost point of the Crimean peninsula.  Films such as People and Dolphins, Amphibian Man, and Pirates of the 20th Century were filmed here. </p><p>  In addition, on vacation you can visit the wind farm in Mirny.  Also quite an interesting place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peaceful crimea photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/469191.jpg" width="495"></div>
