The history of the city has about five centuries, so it is very attractive for tourists.  The sights of Ostashkov are numerous <span>temples, churches,</span> parks, museums and simply unique structures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of ostashkino" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/470237.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Historical essay </h2><p>  If you describe the city in a nutshell, then we can say that this is a typical county town, which retained the features of the past centuries.  A settlement in this region arose in the XIV century on the island of Klichen, however, he was not destined to exist for a long time.  Already in 1393 he was plundered and burned by the Novgorodians.  Again, life here began to boil only after the foundation of the Nilo-Stolbnetsk Monastery.  Around this shrine, people began to settle, workshops and workshops opened here, and the city began to come to life, grow and prosper.  Already in the XVIII century, Ostashkov became the largest shopping center, the village began to rapidly build up.  Particular attention here deserves the layout of the city, which is now preserved almost in its original form.  In those days, it became a model, however, most of the county-level cities in our country were built on this principle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Temples of the city </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the sights of Ostashkov are primarily churches and cathedrals.  By the way, for a small town there are quite a lot of them.  It is definitely worth a visit to the Znamensky Monastery.  Now it does not function according to its main purpose, but here you can see the picturesque Ascension Cathedral, and near it there are a huge number of old houses where various structures function or people live. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ostashkov city attractions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/470239.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  The Bogoroditsky monastery is another reason to visit the city of Ostashkov.  The sights of this place amaze even the most demanding tourists.  The temple was founded in the XVIII century by order of Peter I. On its square you can see several churches that were erected in the same period.  Today the temple is undergoing reconstruction, and after a couple of years the monastery can be seen in all its glory. </p><p>  If you are in Ostashkov, then do not forget to also look into the ancient Trinity Cathedral.  It was founded in the 17th century, but its internal and external appearance has been changed many times; in its original form, unfortunately, it has not been preserved. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the city of Ostashkov <span>(Tver Oblast)</span> boasts not only shrines <span>.</span>  <span>The sights of the</span> village are also numerous museums.  The museum of local lore will best tell about the history of the region and local traditions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  There is also a small fish museum in the city.  This institution is quite young, he is not even ten years old.  However, they conduct very interesting and informative excursions.  The guide will tell you about the local inhabitants of Seliger, about the traditions of fishing and cooking fish. </p><p>  The Ostrog Museum is located in the former prison building.  His exposition, of course, is devoted to the prison case.  Here are a number of items from the history of Ostrog.  At the request of tourists they are carried out throughout the premises of the former dungeon. </p><h2>  Nilo-Stolbetsk desert </h2><p>  It was created at the end of the XVII century.  And immediately became an attractive object for hundreds of pilgrims.  And at the beginning of the twentieth century, more believers came here than in any other shrine of Russia.  The external decoration of the temple is really amazing: the complex consists of 20 buildings, which are made in a pompous palace and Petersburg style.  Be sure to visit this beautiful monastery, if you decide to look into Ostashkov!  The sights (the photo of the bell of this shrine is shown below) of the temple do not end there.  Everyone can climb the bell tower and from there look at the amazing panorama of the city, villages, lakes and other temples. </p><h2>  Parks </h2><p>  Sights of Ostashkov are also picturesque parks and squares.  On the island of Klichen there is a unique park museum, where the whole nature of the region is collected in miniature.  Better places for walking and recreation in the city simply can not be found. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ostashkov Tver region attractions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/470241.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Unusual facilities </h2><p>  A very remarkable building is the building where the fire brigade was located.  In 1843, the first voluntary fire brigade was organized in the city.  To this day, the local fire service still uses this building.  Since then, it naturally changed its appearance, however, even taking into account this fact, it was not deprived of the status of a historical monument. </p><p>  You have another great reason to visit Ostashkov (Tver region).  The sights of the city are a number of buildings built in the 18th-19th centuries.  True, most of them are not in the best condition, as they were built of wood, but it still does not hurt to admire their amazing view. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ostashkov city Tver region attractions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/470242.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Valsky Pillar </h2><p>  Favorite tourist attraction is the Pillar of Wall.  It was established after the Ostashkovskaya fortress burned down in this place in 1711.  This monument is made in a classic style.  On its walls you can see icons and paintings.  Not far from the fortress was a chapel.  For a very long time, it housed the icon of St. Barbara, who is considered in the Orthodox religion to be the patroness of sailors, boatmen and fishermen.  An icon lamp stood near the icon, where fishermen prayed and asked for a good catch.  After nationalization, the chapel was barbarously destroyed. </p><h2>  Famine Pyramid </h2><p>  Sights of Ostashkov, of course, are of great interest, but in the vicinity of the city there are also a lot of amazing places.  In the Ostashkinsky district, near the village of Khitino, there is a massive pyramid whose silhouette can be seen from the road.  This building is named after Alexander Golod, who spent his whole life researching the pyramids and the proportions of the so-called Golden Ratio.  At first it may seem very heavy and built of stone, but if you go inside, it immediately becomes clear that the building is made of very light material.  An unusual building was created in 1997 and has a height of twenty-two meters.  It is believed that if you stay in the middle of the building for a long time, you can get rid of many ailments and feel a surge of energy.  True, evidence of the fact that the pyramid can heal does not yet exist.  But it is reliably known that in this structure there really are certain vibrations that can affect a person.  Now the pyramids of Alexander Golod are located in many cities of Russia.  Many scientists believe that <span>an abnormal zone</span> is located in this structure <span>,</span> so the most unusual phenomena can occur here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="g ostashkov sights" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/470244.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The source of the Volga </h2><p>  In the village of Volgoverkhovye, the majestic <span>Volga River</span> originates <span>.</span>  This small spring has a picturesque chapel.  Not far from the source is also the Olginsky monastery and the picturesque stone fortress.  1.5 km from the village is the village of Moses, where the walls of the Peter and Paul Fortress are preserved.  Here you can see a very beautiful painting. </p><p>  After all the reading, you probably already thought about how to visit the city of Ostashkov.  The sights of this region certainly deserve your attention. </p>
