The hotel staff will meet the late tourist even at night, as the reception serves customers around the clock. </p><h2>  Hotel Interior </h2><p>  The building of the Romance Beach Hotel 4 occupies five floors.  At the entrance there is a reception desk where you will be carefully listened and accommodated even in the middle of the night.  According to the reviews of tourists who arrived at the hotel at 10 pm, they were not only politely served, but also separately fed dinner, for which they were very grateful because they were on the road for a long time and were terribly tired and hungry. </p><p>  The lobby of the Romance Beach Hotel 4 Marmaris is impressive at a glance.  The snow-white room with its purity blinds your eyes.  The large hall has an elongated well shape.  On all floors, the aisles to the rooms are located on the balcony surrounding the front door.  In the middle, all five floors have no partitions, that is, the fifth ceiling is visible from the first floor. </p><p>  White chandeliers and beautiful fabric balls descend from the top on metal bars.  Upholstered furniture of the same white color complements the composition: sofas and armchairs.  A beautiful spiral staircase is also an interesting additional element of the decoration of the hall.  Palm trees growing in large square tubs dilute the luster of the paintings on the walls. </p><p>  A contrasting spot to the snow-white interior of the hall is a delicate shade of glass tiles of the color of the sea wave, which decorated the sections of the floor in the waiting and relaxation areas.  For the convenience of guests, the hotel has two elevators. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  Romance Beach Hotel 4 (Turkey) has its own territory, fenced with a low fence.

Some rooms overlook it.  Not all tourists are delighted with this, but most of them rate this neighborhood positively.  Especially convenient for those tourists who come to the resort with children.  No need to travel far to have fun riding a water slide. </p>

    <p>  On it you can sit in plastic chairs and see the beauty of the city and local flora.  The design of the rooms is restrained and concise, nothing more.  On the wall above each bed there is a sconce; there are small bedside tables.  The bathroom is spacious and modern. </p><h2>  Standard rooms </h2><p>  Romance Beach Hotel 4 (Turkey, Marmaris) has 22 standard rooms.  They also differ from each other in different layouts of beds.  Some rooms have double beds, while others have two single beds located nearby.  On each side of the beds are comfortable nightstands for personal items. </p><p>  Under the window is a small soft sofa in front of the coffee table.  There is also a plastic armchair on the balcony.  The bathroom is exactly the same as in the previous triple rooms.  Rooms differ in flooring.  If in the previous ones there was a brown laminate, then in this category the floor is light, the laminate is of the color ‚Äúbleached oak‚Äù, antique.  Now this design is in fashion. </p><h2>  Family rooms </h2><p>  This category of rooms in Romance Beach Hotel 4 (Turkey, Marmaris) is represented by two rooms, they are designed for couples with children or just for up to four people.  Each room has two beds.  In the first - a double or two single, pouf, dressing table with a mirror, a small sofa, bedside tables near each side of the beds.  In the other - there is less space, there are only two single beds and bedside tables.  The TV is only in the parents room. </p><p>  There are only nine such rooms and they are the most expensive, but not the best.  Due to the large heap of furniture and bedding, there is absolutely no room left for moving around the room.  Children, for whom the room is designed, will have nowhere to turn around.  Unless you have to come to the room with them only to sleep in the midday heat and at night. </p><h2>  Rooms with the beautiful name "Deluxe" </h2><p>  The only category of rooms overlooking the wonderful bay of Marmaris.  12 rooms received the status of "Lux" after a major renovation in 2011.  Such rooms in Romance Beach Hotel 4, according to tourists, are the largest.  Only in these rooms there is a wardrobe for clothes and a leather sofa.  At the feet of the double bed is a leather long stool. </p>

    <p>  Snack bars are located in the recreation areas: on the beach and near the pool.  Without leaving far from the place of bathing, you can freshen up with cold drinks and have a snack. </p><p>  When reading about the 2017 Romance Beach Hotel 4 reviews, it‚Äôs hard to give the right rating for both food and service.  Our tourists mainly like the hotel itself, and food, and a variety of dishes and fresh fruits.  Some foreign tourists are not satisfied with the quality of service.  They were not always smiled, at night they could not find food to eat, there were no forks, containers with any food that other hotel residents had not taken were re-filled. </p><p>  Among the Russian-speaking tourists, there was only one indignant review of the quality of food. </p><h2>  Hotel Bars </h2><p>  Two cozy bars are located in Romance Beach Hotel 4.

The second bar is also located not far from the water, but already in the hotel courtyard, next to the pool.  You can sit outdoors in the chairs under a canopy, or you can go into the interior and sit next to a large aquarium or fireplace. </p><p>  If you are leaving for a long trip and cannot come for lunch, you can take a <span>packed</span> lunch on the road at the bar. </p>

    <h2>  Romance Beach Hotel 4 (Marmaris): reviews </h2><p>  In many reviews, the resentment of vacationers on a small number of sun loungers and places on the beach and pool of the hotel can be traced.  The hotel on the coast is limited.  It has rows of sun loungers with umbrellas.  For lovers of sleep in the morning, of course, there is not enough space on the beach.  At 10 am it‚Äôs hard to find a piece of the beach, not filled with vacationers.  With the pool - the same trouble.  Some write that you probably need to get up at six in the morning to find a free sun lounger by the pool. </p>

    <p>  Also, tourists are unhappy with the close proximity of deckchairs (one next to the other) on the coast.  People don‚Äôt want their neighbor‚Äôs legs to rest on their head.  Water passages are very narrow. </p><p>  There are, of course, a lot of positive reviews.  After all, many people who want to swim and soak in the clear waters of Turkey can not ruin their mood.  And the wonderful sandy and small-pebbled <span>beach of Marmaris is perfect</span> for swimming. </p><h2>  Additional hotel services </h2><p>  About Romance Beach Hotel 4 (Marmaris) reviews are not limited to comments about food and room quality.  They describe a beautiful gym with a lot of shells, treadmills and other weight training equipment.  People leading an active lifestyle are given the opportunity not to interrupt their activities during the holidays. </p><p>  After classes in the hall, you can steam up and relax in the sauna or in the Turkish bath, go to the massage parlor.  However, one must remember that these services are already paid and are placed in the spa at the hotel.  There you can go for a water massage in the jacuzzi. </p><p>  For lovers of reading, there is a library, but it is not known in what language literature can be borrowed there.  It can be seen that our tourists are not fans of reading books when the blue sea and warm sand are near, because none of the reviews gave information about this type of service. </p><p>  The hotel also has laundry facilities.  Some vacationers spend up to 10 days at the resort, and, of course, things need to be refreshed.  You can give things to the laundry, but at an additional cost. </p><p>  The hotel also has a spacious conference room.  Everyone can use the premises for conferences and seminars, corporate meetings.  There is also an internet corner.  It is very convenient, according to vacationers, that right at the hotel you can use the currency exchange. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The brightest evening in Marmaris vacationers called "Turkish Nights".  Such an event is not organized on site, but a free transfer from the hotel is provided to guests.  Familiarity with the traditions of Turkish culture and cuisine will be an interesting addition to the treasury of knowledge about different countries, especially since there is no need to pay extra for dishes of national cuisine, they are included in the price of the hotel. </p><p>  Especially tourists like belly dancing and various competitive entertainment at the end of the program.  After all, participating yourself is always more fun than just watching.  You can test your abilities in teaching the art of dancing.  Photos and videos of your performance can be ordered for a fee to a local photographer. </p><p>  The hotel also has animators for children, and live music in the evenings. </p><h2>  Where to go? </h2><p>  Not far from Romance Beach Hotel (Marmaris city center) 4, about 100 meters away, is the Turkish Tansas market, where you can buy something as a souvenir about this wonderful corner of the globe.  Somewhere at the same distance is the Migros supermarket. </p><p>  As already described above, the Marmaris water park adjoins the hotel, where there are many water attractions and slides of varying complexity for children and adults.  In the city center, which is 20 minutes walk, is the ancient fortress of Marmaris. </p><p>  Near the hotel there is a parking of boats, which you can go to the Greek island of Rhodes.  A boat trip will surprise the beauties of the coastal zone.  Many in the reviews write that the color of the water in the sea resembles the beaches of the Bahamas. </p><p>  Also in the evening for tourists - a whole street of shops, bars and restaurants.  It is located 10 minutes walk from the hotel. </p>
