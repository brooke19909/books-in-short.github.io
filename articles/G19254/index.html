    <h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  In general, almost all our compatriots were satisfied with the accommodation in this hotel.  According to them, ‚ÄúSonesta Club‚Äù (Sharm el-Sheikh) is not a new hotel, so you will not find rooms with modern design and new technology here.  However, all apartments have a fresh repair and are furnished with comfortable, high-quality furniture and working equipment.  Many guests in the reviews say that they liked the fact that the air conditioning in the room is constantly working.  Therefore, upon returning you will not find yourself in a stuffy room, you will not have to wait until the air conditioner cools the air in the apartment.  As for the cleaning, the tourists were quite satisfied with its quality.  According to them, the cleaners were not lazy to change towels daily, and to renew bed linen every few days.  In addition, they almost every day, regardless of the fact whether you leave them a tip, twisted funny figures from towels.  This was especially pleasing to the kids.  Judging by the comments of some guests, the cleaners sometimes forgot to replenish stocks of soap or shampoo in the bathroom, but this did not cause problems, since it was possible to report this to the reception, and the deficiency was quickly filled. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sonesta club 4 charm el sheikh naama" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1002732.jpg" width="533"></div>

    <h2>  Territory, location </h2><p>  Tourists who chose the Sonesta Club 4 * hotel for their <span>holidays in Egypt</span> , the reviews of which we are currently considering, were very pleased with its territory.  So, according to them, it is much larger, more beautiful and well-groomed than in the neighboring five-star hotel of the same chain.  Our compatriots assure that in addition to infrastructure facilities, there are plenty of nice places where you can take a pleasant walk and take wonderful photos as a keepsake. </p><p>  The guests of Sonesta Club 4 *, the photo of which can be seen in this article, also note in their comments that they were satisfied with the location of the hotel.  So, according to them, in a couple of minutes of walking there is a promenade along which you can walk along other hotels and reach Naami Bay.  There are many shops, souvenir shops, bars, discos, restaurants, etc. In addition, the hotel is located near the airport.  Therefore, upon arrival, you do not have to waste time getting to the hotel. </p><h2>  Restaurants, bars </h2><p>  In addition to how meals are organized, as a rule, tourists make many complaints.  And this applies to hotels both in Russia and in such popular resort countries as Turkey and Egypt.  However, the Sonesta Club 4 * hotel in this sense can be called a pleasant exception to the rule.  Indeed, the vast majority of guests agreed that the food here is very well organized.  Of course, coming here, you should not count on the same variety of dishes and snacks that more expensive five-star hotels offer.  However, the menu at Sonesta Club will surely appeal to you. </p><p>  So, three times a day in the main restaurant, skilled chefs serve a buffet.  For breakfast, visitors can taste eggs cooked in different forms (scrambled eggs and fried eggs are here with you), cereals, fresh fruits and vegetables, sausages, cheeses, pastries.  For lunch, guests will find a varied selection of first and second courses of meat, fish, poultry, soups, salads, snacks and delicious desserts.  By the way, in our comments, many of our compatriots praise the cream soups served at the restaurant, which both adults and children enjoyed with pleasure.  Moreover, our compatriots, judging by their comments, did not leave indifferent and perfectly cooked pilaf with seafood.  For dinner, the restaurant of the Sonesta Club 4 * hotel (Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt) also offered a variety of dishes that could be taken from the buffet.  In addition, on the street, cooks cooked meat on the grill, distributing it portionwise to everyone. </p>

    <p>  As for the service in the restaurant, our compatriots on this point do not express special complaints.  According to them, the waiters very quickly clean the dirty dishes from the tables.  In addition, if a dish is quickly dismantled, cooks replenish its supplies so that those visitors who come for lunch or dinner a little later could also try it.  Seats in the restaurant, according to guests, were also enough for everyone.  The only thing that bothered some tourists a bit was the lines behind the grill.  However, the cooks tried to serve everyone as quickly as possible.  So, in principle, this fact did not become a particular problem for the vast majority of vacationers. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  According to the comments of those who left reviews about their stay at Sonesta Club 4 *, the hotel, as indicated in its official description, is located on the second coastline.  This means that on the way to the beach you will have to cross the road.  According to our compatriots, the hotel is a short distance from the sea.  So, to the beach, according to them, you can literally walk in 8-10 minutes with an unhurried step.  In addition, a minibus runs between the hotel and the beach every half hour.  So if you do not want to walk, you can use the shuttle service.  It works from 8 a.m. until the evening.  However, according to our compatriots, most of the guests preferred to make a pleasant and completely not tiring walk to the sea.  Moreover, the path passes through the picturesque territory of hotels. </p><p>  As for the beach of the Sonesta Club hotel itself, then, according to a number of vacationers, it is not big enough.  After all, guests of it use not only Sonesta Club Sharm 4 *, but also two other hotels.  In this regard, there is often a shortage of sun loungers and parasols.  Therefore, many tourists had to go to the beach before breakfast in order to occupy a deck chair, because otherwise, if you come to the sea a little later, it may turn out that there are no free sunbeds.  Therefore, our compatriots turn to the hotel administration with the hope that this situation will be somehow resolved.  Indeed, in this case, tourists will be more comfortable, and they will be pleased to recommend the hotel to their friends and acquaintances. </p><p>  As for entering the sea, it is quite smooth here.  However, travelers claim there are a lot of rocks and corals at the bottom.  Therefore, it is better not to enter the water without special shoes.  This, at first glance, inconvenience is fully compensated by the fact that many interesting marine inhabitants live near the coast.  So be sure to grab a snorkeling mask from home or already in Egypt.  After all, you will have the opportunity to watch colorful fish, crabs, moray eels and many other interesting marine life that can only be found in the Red Sea. </p><p>  If you want to be able to go into the water on a sand, then experienced travelers are advised to go to a nearby beach.  By the way, here you can rent a sunbed with an umbrella.  As our compatriots note, there is no fixed cost for this service, and everything will depend on how you can negotiate with the beach employee.  So, someone managed to rent two deckchairs and an umbrella for a couple of dollars, and someone had to shell out $ 15. </p>

    <p>  But back to the private beach of the Sonesta Club Hotel.  It has a bar.  It serves guests of all three hotels that have the right to use this beach.  Alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are served here.  According to our compatriots, the choice and quality of their completely satisfied.  However, some tourists say that it would be nice to organize a snack bar on the beach, as is done in many other hotels.  This will allow guests to have the opportunity to eat or even have lunch without returning to the hotel.  Many travelers were satisfied with the work of the bartender.  According to them, he is a true professional in his field.  In addition, the bartender remembers all the vacationers the first time, and the next time you visit, without asking too many questions, he offers you the drink that you ordered the last time. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Despite the fact that most travelers come mainly for a beach holiday in Egypt, Sonesta Club 4 *, according to our compatriots, offers a lot of entertainment on its territory.  Therefore, a fairly large percentage of guests spent a lot of time at the hotel. </p><p>  So, first of all, tourists liked the pools equipped in the hotel complex.  According to the guests, here they are for every taste - for adults and for children.  In addition, one of the pools has excellent water slides.  Both adult vacationers and the youngest travelers enjoyed riding on them with pleasure.  Near the pools there are sun terraces with ample sun loungers and parasols.  There are also bars where you can enjoy your favorite drink and, if you wish, have a bite to eat. </p><p>  From the morning until late in the evening, the hotel has a team of animators.  As tourists note in their reviews, the guys do an excellent job.  So, in the daytime, they offer everyone to do water aerobics, yoga, gymnastics, learn some dance moves, play volleyball, water polo or darts.  In the evenings, entertainment performances are organized in the amphitheater of the hotel complex.  They are organized by both animators and guest artists.  So, guests of the hotel are waiting for a fire show, "Egyptian Night", performances by artists, various competitions and performances.  In a word, you won‚Äôt be bored here.  After the end of the evening entertainment program, everyone, accompanied by animators, can go to one of the discos in Naami Bay. </p>
