    <h2>  You will definitely enjoy the beach! </h2><p>  Just five hundred meters from <span>the Paphos</span> Veronica 3 * <span>hotel</span> , across the road, there is a small beach with fine pebbles and sand.  All vacationers noted its cleanliness and convenient location.  In addition, it is protected from high waves by bulk breakwaters. </p><p>  There is something to admire: through clear transparent water, pebbles at the bottom and small fish are visible, snooping almost at the feet of bathers.  By the way, vacationers are very pleased here the lack of algae and large stones at the bottom. </p><p>  There are water rides on the beach, and sunbeds and umbrellas will be paid (2.5 euros each).  The sea here is small enough, which is very welcome vacationers with children and swimmers who are unsure of themselves on the water.  If you walk along the coast, to the city beach, then the depth there, which will provide great opportunities for swimming and diving, will be much greater, but the number of people here, alas, will increase. </p><h2>  Separately about a night in Cyprus </h2><p>  After many daily twists and turns, you, of course, will go for a walk as soon as the evening falls on the island.  And you will be very satisfied!  There are a lot of people on the embankment - life is in full swing here, and out of a huge number of restaurants music is shrill.  It's great to go there!  But you can, just sitting on a bench, enjoy the night sea, giving freshness, and passers-by, carrying their joy past you. </p><p>  And after returning to the hotel, take a dip in the pool water heated for a day, like milk.  All this will fill you with an amazing feeling of carelessness and lightness.  And it will certainly help to quickly and soundly fall asleep in its new haven - Veronica hotel 3 *. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Veronica hotel 3" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/478168.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  You can explore the island without a guide. </h2><p>  If you do not like the required programs offered by the guide, and you have chosen the right company, then you can rent a car to go traveling on your own.  As mentioned above, Paphos Veronica 3 * provides the opportunity to rent a car. </p><p>  One day of rental will cost you about 53 euros.  True, you will have to first leave a deposit of 300 euros (this condition applies to all rental offices).  But you will be provided with a full tank of gasoline, and you will be able to hit the road on a route compiled just for you!  As a huge number of tourists rightly believes, the impressions received on such a trip will be much brighter and more colorful.  Well, try it! </p><p>  By the way, between the Almira and Anabella hotels, not far from Veronika, there is an information center where you can get a map of Paphos and a bus schedule.  This will greatly help those who plan to get to know the city on their own.  After all, such trips will cost you only 1 euro, but you can consider everything that seems interesting to you in Paphos and take many wonderful pictures that will not let you forget the local beauty in the future. </p><h2>  A few different tips for those who decide to go on vacation to the Veronica 3 * hotel (Cyprus) </h2><ul><li>  In Cyprus, in August it is very hot, and this, combined with high humidity, leads to a very uncomfortable feeling.  Cypriots at this time massively go on vacation from the island, so you probably better to go to this resort in September (best in the second half).  This is for the residents of the middle zone, who can hardly endure the heat, will be the most suitable condition for a good rest. </li><li>  Baking on the island is unusually high in calories.  It is abundantly saturated with honey or syrups, so it should be eaten in a separate meal, otherwise your waistline will increase significantly. </li><li>  At the Veronica 3 * hotel, reviews of which are provided in this article, they do not charge money for a particularly beautiful view from the window upon arrival or daily tips for a good cleaning.  By the way, these Cypriots are very different from the service staff in other recreation areas, which often lead to bewilderment of Russian tourists. </li></ul><h2>  And a few words in conclusion </h2><p>  Well, even if the hotel is located in a quiet and comfortable area, it does not impress with ostentatious luxury, but it guarantees a calm measured relaxation in clean rooms with a friendly maid and with the special atmosphere that is unique to Cyprus.  Indeed, only here philosophical peace reigns, leisurelyness and thoroughness in everything.  And what else does a modern man plagued by vanity need?  So do not hesitate for a long time and come to Veronica 3 * (Cyprus).  You will not be disappointed! </p><p>  Have a good rest and vivid impressions! </p>
