    <h2>  A little bit about the hotel building </h2><p>  The hotel was built in 2001, since then it has been renovated several times.  Therefore, today she appears before her guests in an updated form.  The building itself is built in the shape of an accordion, consists of three sections.  The managers chose mustard as the main color for their hotel.  In general, Ozgurhan Hotel 3 * looks quite attractive.  In the backyard of the building is a large outdoor pool.  The hotel is located somewhere three kilometers from the city center.  But many monuments and museums of the city are in close proximity to it.  To reach the seashore, you must overcome the distance of one and a half kilometers from the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The road to the hotel </h2><p>  Ozgurhan Hotel Side 3 * is located in the most popular resort and historical city of Turkey - Side.  But there is no airport, so you can get to the hotel only through Antalya.  Airplanes to Antalya fly from most cities of Russia.  In particular, a round-trip ticket from the capital of the Russian Federation will cost approximately $ 300.  Before flying to Antalya, you can order a transfer from the airport to the hotel.  The service is paid and is provided directly by Ozgurhan Hotel 3 *.  If you do not want to use this service and decide to go to Side on your own, you need to know that between it and Antalya it is 75 km.  A bus leaves the bus station every hour and takes you to the city you need in 1.5 hours.  By taxi, the same path can be done in an hour, but the cost of such a trip will be higher. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Service </h2><p>  Ozgurhan Hotel 3 * Side tries to take care of its guests, so it offers a fairly wide range of services.  Among them there are both free and paid.

Many people who happened to stay in this hotel noted that for its class it is very decent.  They liked the level of service and the quality of the food, but there were also disadvantages that were noted by almost all tourists.
