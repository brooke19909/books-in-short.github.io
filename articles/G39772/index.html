    <p>  In addition, Anapa and Vityazevo are popular in bus tours on a geographical basis, because to get here is simply the closest, for example, from Rostov or Samara.  Many resorts and hotels in Vityazevo are on the seashore, and therefore tourists love this place so much. </p><h2>  Little greece </h2><p>  As is known from history, this section of the Black Sea coast once belonged almost entirely to the Greek colony, so the so-called <span>Pontic Greeks</span> lived here <span>.</span>  Despite the fact that someone left for their homeland, some remained to live here, and therefore the architecture of the village is built in the Greek style.  You can admire all these beauties on the Paralia Boulevard of the same name, where most of the buildings, the Greek font, statues, sculptures and large arches are preserved.  So tourists who can‚Äôt go to Greece this season for financial or any other reasons can safely recommend this village. </p>
