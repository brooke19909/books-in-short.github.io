  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Swan Lake, Astrakhan: from ancient centuries to the present</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Astrakhan is the oldest cultural and economic center of the Volga region.  Located in the upper delta of the Volga River.  The city has about 100 nationalities, there are many national communities and religious denominations.  There are a lot of interesting places in Astrakhan, the Armenian and Persian courtyard, many ancient and beautiful temples and churches, squares and parks.  Also a huge number of modern cozy places of rest. </p><p>  Swan Lake is a famous Astrakhan landmark.  A reservoir of natural origin is located at the junction of Lenin Square and Admiralteyskaya Street.  The lake was formed due to the drying of the Volga river bed.  The townspeople call the reservoir "old man", which means - the old riverbed. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The banks of the reservoir are reinforced with granite slabs and lawn grass is planted under a slope. </p><p>  Convenient slopes are equipped to Swan Lake in Astrakhan.  There are rest benches and lanterns around the perimeter.  In the southern part of the reservoir there is a viewing platform, and an overpass has been erected near the Planetarium building. </p><p>  Almost in the middle of the lake there is a romantic rotunda, but just to get there, it will not work.  An exception is made only for the newlyweds.  They are allowed there for a solemn photo shoot, and for a fee. </p><p>  In winter, when the entire lake is ice-bound, a skating rink appears here, which the whole city gathers in.  Visitors are asked to be careful, and take good care of the place of rest.  But not everyone is able to follow such simple rules.  So, for example, last year, with the onset of heat, it was necessary to restore the tiles from the slopes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="astrakhan.go2all.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Park area near the pond" class="if uuid-2284865" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2284865.jpg"></div><h2>  Swans </h2><p>  But the most attractive on the lake is the swans.  Here live several couples who are completely not afraid of people and are happy to feast on treats, boldly sailing to the shore. </p><p>  In general, the bird story in the pond is rather sad.  Swans have always lived on the lake (since the 60s of the last century), but with the “efforts” of the local inhabitants they fed the birds bread with mold and the pond was empty for many years.  Periodically, sick and wounded birds were thrown here, either by hunters or poachers.  But, once, a real flock of swans appeared on the lake, healthy and beautiful.  Anonymous, in 2017, called the landscaping department of the city council and informed about this, but instructed that the birds be watched and fed than expected.  So the birds appeared again on Swan Lake of Astrakhan. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="46.344939" data-lng="48.02127999999993" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/5/2/1052.png"></div><h2>  Bird Care </h2><p>  Healthy swans require no less attention and care than sick ones.  Birds eat boiled wheat, finely chopped vegetables and fruits, they love clover very much.  Therefore, local authorities are asking all citizens and visitors not to feed the birds with bread. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The pond itself is also regularly maintained, twice a year, the water is completely drained and the bottom is cleaned. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Center of Astrakhan" class="if uuid-2284888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2284888.jpg"></div><h2>  Environment </h2><p>  The area around Swan Lake in Astrakhan is landscaped. </p><p>  In addition to arranging alleys (cozy benches and lawns appeared), a reconstruction of the Planetarium building was carried out, which now harmoniously fits into the urban landscape.  The project provided for the formation of an island with a rotunda and a park area near the Iranian embassy, ​​with the installation of a fountain.  The architectural part of the work was carried out by Volgograd specialists, and all the improvement was carried out with the support of the companies of the Lukoil group. </p><p>  Now this place is surely visited by city guests, and local residents come to the lake to relax and enjoy the water surface and swans. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rotunda on the lake" class="if uuid-2284884" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2284884.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The swan lake of Astrakhan was formed due to the shallowing of one of the channels of the Volga River. </p><p>  In ancient times, the river almost came close to the Astrakhan Kremlin.  And the Nikolsky Gate generally had a marina. </p><p>  Since 1767, information has already appeared in the annals that the Volga begins to actively grind.  Because of this, a new pier was erected on stilts in the middle of the river, from which a bridge was stretched.  But by the end of the century, the problem is becoming even larger and you have to dig a canal, on the site of which is today Admiralteyskaya Street. </p><p>  Even these events did not help, and by the end of the 19th century, the spit and sandbank completely dry up, and only the base, the pond, which is now Swan Lake in Astrakhan, remains from the canal. </p><p>  Later, on the site of the appeared sandbank, an entire urban area is formed, which was named after the place of formation - Kos. </p><div class="photo" data-original="denisanikin.livejournal.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Viewpoint" class="if uuid-2284891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2284891.jpg"></div><h2>  Address </h2><p>  Swan Lake in Astrakhan is located at the intersection of Lenin Square, Embankment on May 1 and Admiralteyskaya Street.  The easiest way to get here is on foot, walking along Lenin Square.  Object coordinates: 46.34598;  48.02326. </p><p>  After admiring the beauties and taking a photo of Swan Lake (in Astrakhan), be sure to go to the Planetarium. </p>
