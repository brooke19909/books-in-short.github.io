    <p>  The second floor of the historic mansion was a small theater named after  Komissarzhevskaya, the leader of which was the brother of Vera Fedorovna - architect Fedor.  It was this man who raised the theatrical banner of romanticism in the pre-revolutionary period.  In addition, there was also a school-studio, where they trained universal actors with stage vocals and other data. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, at this stage the story did not end, but only began, but this is not in this article.  By the way, not so long ago, in the building where the modern hotel "Pushkin" is located, complex construction and reconstruction works were carried out, so the mansion became simply unrecognizable. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  As soon as you find yourself on the two-hundred-meter Nastasinsky Lane, you will immediately notice the hotel complex, which stands out from the overall picture due to the magnificent facade.  It is also worth paying attention to the height of the ceilings in the premises, which reaches 4.34 meters, which is rare today. </p>

    <p>  The interior of the hotel is made in a classic style, but still some elements of the decor remind you that this is a legendary mansion with a long history.  By the way, just a 15-minute walk are the two main attractions of the capital - the Kremlin and Red Square. </p><h2>  basic information </h2><p>  If you came to a city like Moscow for several days, the Pushkin Hotel, whose address is Nastasinsky Lane, 5th Building, 1st Building, will be an ideal place for an unforgettable pastime.  The metro is the fastest metropolitan transport, so it is easiest to get to the hotel by metro.  In this case, you will need to go to one of the following stations: Tverskaya, Pushkinskaya or Chekhovskaya. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Do you have any questions for the hotel administrator?  Then call and ask them by phone number +7 (985) 924-09-90 or drive up for a personal conversation at any time of the day or night.  To offer cooperation, write to the email address marketing@otel-pushkin.ru. </p><h2>  Rules of residence </h2><p>  Each hotel complex must have a set of basic rules for customers to comply with.  The Pushkin Hotel (Moscow, Russia) is one of the best in the city, therefore, on its official website all the necessary information is presented, moreover, in Russian and English. </p><p>  Many faced a forced delay in another city, because of which it was necessary to agree on an extension of the rental room.  The administration of "Pushkin" is always ready to go forward, but if you do not report your problem with leaving 2 hours before the end of your stay, you will still have to release the number.  Did you manage to notify the administrator about the problem of delay in the city?  Alas, you still have to worry, because an extension will be possible only when your number is not booked by third parties.  Well, if you are unlucky, try to find yourself another room in the same hotel complex - then they will definitely help you! </p>
