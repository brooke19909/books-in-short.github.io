These unique reservoirs are protected by the state and are part of the Narochansky park.  The area of ​​the lakes is more than one and a half thousand square meters.  km  In this conservation area, both locals and tourists like to relax.  However, fishing, picking berries or mushrooms is strictly prohibited, since hundreds of rare species of flora and fauna live in the park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue lakes belarus" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/461297.jpg" width="433"></div>

    <h2>  Unique nature and landscapes </h2><p>  In the park you can find many plants, most of which are listed in the Red Book.  The beauty of the local landscapes has long attracted many travelers here.  Around the lakes grow picturesque forests.  The area of ​​the Narochansky park is somewhat reminiscent of a washboard: the plains here are intertwined with hills, which forces tourists to either go up or down. </p><p>  Many are interested in how these unique landscapes originated here.  The <span>Valdai glacier</span> played an important role in the formation of this area <span>.</span>  It was thanks to him that the <span>Blue Lakes were formed.</span>  Belarus can also boast of other amazing sights, but these reservoirs have always been of great interest to both vacationers and various scientific experts.  It should be noted that in the Narochansky park there are several reservoirs that are collectively referred to as "Blue Lakes": </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Balduk. </li><li>  Small Boltik. </li><li>  Barley. </li><li>  Dead lake. </li><li>  Rude. </li><li>  Elgenia. </li><li>  Perch. </li><li>  Hub. </li><li>  Imsharets. </li><li>  Big Boltik and others. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Crystal clear water surface </h2><p>  The cleanest body of water is Lake Grublea.  The bottom here is clearly visible even at a depth of 4 meters.  The fact that the lake is very clean confirms one more circumstance - crayfish live in its depths, and they, as you know, prefer to live only in unclogged bodies of water.  The maximum depth of the lake is amazing - 26.8 meters!  A tower is installed on Lake Grublea from which you can jump into the water.  Meanwhile, there are strict rules: you can’t make fires, put up tents and litter.  According to one of the ancient legends, all those who swim in the lake are getting younger.  Of course, you are unlikely to win eternal youth, but you will definitely feel the charge of vivacity and energy after bathing. </p><p>  Belarusians say that Glubenka Lake is the best place for romantic dates.  It resembles a heart in shape, and in the middle of the reservoir is a small island.  Glubeneka, using a small channel, connects to Glublya Lake.  A small bridge is thrown over this canal; from it you can admire the charming landscapes of both lakes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are other Blue Lakes in the park.  Belarus is a surprisingly rich and hospitable region.  Lake Balduk is famous for its cool water, its depth is as much as 40 meters.  It is near this reservoir, by the way, that it is allowed to light bonfires and put up tents.  On its shore there is a spring with clean and very tasty water.  At present, the balduk is actively studied by biologists, but many of its secrets remain unsolved. </p><p>  The water of Lake Okunek is very saturated with iodine, so after bathing in it you can notice reddish small spots on the body.  But in the lake Yachmenka water is highly mineralized and salty to the taste.  Therefore, if you want to improve your health, come to the Blue Lakes (Belarus).  Where these amazing places are, you now know, and getting to Narochansky Park by car is not difficult at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue lakes belarus soligorsk" class="if" height="489" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/461300.jpg" width="399"></div>

    <h2>  Offers for tourists </h2><p>  On the territory of this conservation area there is a trail along which tours are conducted.  Travelers go to Lake Grublea, you can climb to the observation deck, which is located on a high hill, from here a bewitching view of the surroundings opens.  The nature of these places is truly a delight.  A lot of tourists from Belarus come here every year, as well as outdoor enthusiasts from other countries. </p><h2>  Where to settle down? </h2><p>  Of course, it is very interesting to go to these places with a tent.  However, if you are used to comfort and coziness, it is best to rent a house.  Manor "Blue Lakes" (Belarus) offers guests of the park to stay in comfortable rooms or a separate house, which is located in a quiet location near a picturesque small pond.  Near the estate also flows the beautiful river Strachanka.  At the request of guests, the estate staff can organize kayaking on the river.  You can walk along the “ecological trail”, get acquainted with the local fauna, see the rarest plants that are listed in the Red Book of Belarus.  You can also ride a quad bike, bike, fry kebabs or fish.  On the first floor of the estate "Blue Lakes" there is a banquet hall. </p><p>  Believe me, you should see the Blue Lakes (Belarus) with your own eyes at least once.  The length of the Narochansky park is 34 km from north to south, and 59 km from east to west.  In this region, the highest elevation reaches 190 meters, there are also lower hills. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest on the blue lakes of Belarus" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/461296.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lakes in chalk quarries </h2><p>  Blue lakes in Belarus are also called reservoirs that formed in the chalk quarries.  There are several places where they are located: the village of Krasnoselsky (near Volkovysk), near Berezka, near Slutsk (in Lyuban and Salihorsk). </p><p>  When you reach these places, it becomes clear that everything around the quarries is covered with a white coating (this is chalk).  Such fantastic landscapes inspire the thought that you are not on Earth, but on some distant planet.  Trucks regularly haul limestone from here on very dusty and difficult roads. </p><h2>  Salihorsk - local Maldives? </h2><p>  The local quarries are very deep, some of them reach 15 meters.  Due to <span>alkali metals, the</span> water in the basins has an excellent <span>turquoise color.</span>  However, local authorities do not recommend going to these Blue Lakes (Belarus).  Salihorsk does not have the necessary tourist infrastructure.  Such quarries are industrial facilities, and swimming in the ponds formed here can be dangerous.  The walls of the quarry are not fortified, so there is a great risk of collapses.  True, this does not stop many daredevils.  In the summer, despite the prohibition signs, they come here not only to enjoy the emerald green water, but also to swim.  Recently, people even agree to go to limestone reservoirs by companies in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue lakes belarus lyuban" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/461299.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Blue Lakes (Belarus, Volkovysk) </h2><p>  The Volkovsky quarry is considered the deepest.  The length of one quarry reaches from 1 to 4 km.  And the depth in some of them reaches the mark of 15 meters.  Representatives of the Volkovysk authorities say that you can’t swim in these places, since landslides often occur here, there were even <span>accidents.</span>  But the “Danger Zone” sign does not stop many tourists at all, but, on the contrary, makes them violate the ban.  Even foreign tourists are eager to visit the “Belarusian Maldives” (as the locals call the chalk quarries).  The usefulness of the Cretaceous deposits is still not well understood, so it is hardly worth waiting for the development of tourism in these places.  True, this does not stop people, they still continue to ride on chalky quarries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue lakes Volkovysk" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/461286.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Turquoise lakes</span> in other places </h2><p>  You can also meet bluish-green lakes in the <span>Brest region</span> near Bereza.  Another so-called Blue Lakes (Belarus) is also very popular.  Luban is a village where there are also limestone quarries where you can admire the crystal clear turquoise water.  Is it worth it to go to those places, it's up to you to decide, but in any case you should be very careful.  You can admire such reservoirs, but it is extremely undesirable to go down to them and swim there.  And it is best to prefer a vacation on the Blue Lakes of Belarus, which are located in the Narochansky park.  It will be much more comfortable and safer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="manor blue lakes belarus" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/461298.jpg" width="550"></div>
