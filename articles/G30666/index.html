Before making an option purchase and placing a bet, it is necessary to conduct an analytical forecast.  You need to understand which direction the market is moving, and for this you need to take a training course.  Knowing where the market movement is going, the trader is more likely to win the option and make a profit.  If you do not use forecasting and analytics in your work, in this case it will be a normal game, as, for example, in a casino or in a bookmaker.  In this case, the chances of earning something are significantly reduced, and in some cases you can get not only big losses, but also lose your deposit altogether.  Therefore, answering the question: "Verum Option - a divorce or not?"  - you must always take into account the attitude of the trader towards options, his seriousness, literacy and experience.

    <h2>  <span>Trading Strategy</span> Based on Moving Averages and Stochastic Indicator: Description </h2><p>  First of all, you need to set three moving averages on the chart with a period of 5, 8, 13. These periods are not random, these are Fibonacci numbers.  And since there is a close relationship between the <span>Fibonacci numbers</span> and its movement in the foreign exchange market, working with these periods precisely, you can get good results. </p><p>  Next, you also need to set the stochastic indicator on the chart.  It shows the oversold and overbought areas of the market.  If it has values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom 75 and higher, this means that the market is in the overbought zone, therefore, you need to place a bid on the sale.  And if it has a value of 25 or lower - this is an oversold zone, which means you have to buy, that is, open a deal to buy. </p><p>  As mentioned above, stochastic is a confirming indicator and works interconnected with moving averages.  How to work? </p><p>  When moving averages intersect and are directed up, this is a buy signal, down - a sell.  It is impossible to open a deal on the basis of only moving averages, it is necessary to wait for confirmation signals from the stochastic.  Do not rush, the right moment will be sure, and you can‚Äôt work without confirmations.  This is due to the fact that there are both working entry points and false signals on the market.  The foreign exchange market is constantly on the move and very often, especially when it is in a flat state, market noises occur that give false entry points. </p><h2>  <span>Trading strategy</span> based on the indicator MASD and Parabolic </h2><p>  This method of work is also well established.  The <span>MASD indicator</span> itself is built on the basis of moving averages. Parabolic in this case will be a confirmation.  The trading strategy is quite simple and clear and suitable for beginners. </p><p>  1. It is necessary to set the indicators MASD and Parabolic on the chart with standard settings.  Entry points: the MASD should cross the zero mark and have one closed column, the entrance to the market at the second. </p><p>  2. A parabolic, which consists of points, must have two or four points, no more.  Buy deals must be opened when the market has an upward movement.  For sale - in a downward movement.  Both indicators should have indicators in the same direction and be sure to confirm each other.  It is also important to note that Parabolic works well during a trend, and when the market is in a flat, it has a lot of false signals.  Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the state of the foreign exchange market. </p><h2>  Trading strategy for overclocking a deposit </h2><p>  Usually, many novice traders open small deposits.  And, of course, initially their goal is to increase their own funds.  This trading strategy is designed specifically for such situations.  To work, you need the following: </p><p>  1. It is necessary to establish the moving average AO200 on the chart. </p><p>  2. A prerequisite is that the market has a good trend movement. </p><p>  3. Working timeframe M5-M15. </p><p>  4. The first step: you need to wait for the price to roll back from the moving average.  Rollback should occur in the form of one, maximum three candles, and they should be without shadows and small. </p><p>  5. The second step: confirmation, which means that the price should return back to the moving average and be sure to close on it (above / below).  The main condition is that she comes in contact with the AO. </p><p>  6. Third step: after confirmation immediately on the next candle, you can open a deal. </p><h2>  Analytical analysis </h2>
