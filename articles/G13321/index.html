    <h2>  Device complete set </h2><p>  Very modest, as for a premium device, the equipment on this device.  Of course, the box itself is well thought out.  It is made in the form of a kind of book in which the main advantages of the phone are given, as well as recommendations regarding its use.  In addition to the built-in battery in the device and himself, the delivery kit includes a charger, cord, user manual and warranty card.  This list does not have enough protective film for the front panel, case and stereo headset.  Although the front part of the smart smartphone is protected by 3rd generation <span>Gorilla Glass</span> , but anyway, it will be more reliable to stick a protective film on top of it.  A similar situation with the side faces of the device and the back cover.  Case for Meizu MX4 Pro in this case, too, will not be redundant.  Regarding the stereo headset, you can partially agree with the manufacturer.  The gadget‚Äôs audio output has a high-quality <span>sound amplifier.</span>  To reach its full potential, you need really great headphones.  And in this case, an individual selection of a stereo headset is required. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  The design of the gadget and its ergonomics </h2><p>  The 6th generation iPhone and Meizu MX4 Pro are very similar in appearance.  An overview of their controls once again convinces.  Only one physical button is displayed on the front panel.  It also has a fingerprint scanner (just like in the "apple" flagship - iPhone6 ‚Äã‚ÄãPlus), which is protected by <span>sapphire crystal.</span>  The front panel displays a 5.36-inch display.  At the edges from the side faces, thin strips 2.8 mm thick separate it.  Above it, as expected, is a camera for making video calls, a speaker and a whole group of sensors.  The physical buttons for controlling the device are located on the right side (volume control) and the upper side (lock button).  Also on the upper edge are a microphone to suppress noise during a conversation and an audio port.  On the bottom side of the smartphone there is a loud speaker (and its holes are decorated in exactly the same way as the latest version of the iPhone), a conversational microphone and a MicroUSB port.  On the left side there are no controls or communication ports.  Separately, it is worth noting that all sides are made of aluminum, and the back cover is made of polycarbonate.  It has a hole for dual LED backlight for shooting in the dark and the main camera.  It is just like the main key of the front side, protected by sapphire crystal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  CPU, graphics accelerator and memory subsystem </h2><p>  A very powerful processor solution is used in the Meizu MX4 Pro.  Reviews highlight its high level of computing performance.  But at the same time, the energy efficiency of the gadget is at an acceptable level.  Samsung uses the Exynos 5430 as the central processor unit in this smartphone.  Physically, it has 8 cores, but at the same time only 4 of them can be in operation.  That is, this chip is based on big.LITTLE technology.  Its essence lies in the fact that the CPU consists of 2 groups of cores.  4 computing modules based on the ‚ÄúA7‚Äù architecture (in peak load mode they can accelerate to 1.7 GHz) have a low level of performance (but it is enough to solve most everyday tasks) and have low power consumption.  Most of the time this particular computing cluster is in operation.  If demanding software is launched, then a high-performance cluster based on the "A15" architecture is activated.  There are also 4 cores, but they operate at a frequency of 2 GHz.  The result is an ideal balance of performance and power consumption.  This smartphone can easily cope with any software.  Another powerful link in this device is the graphics adapter - Mali-T628 MP6.  He, too, will not have problems launching any, even the most demanding, software.  The amount of RAM in this device is always 3 GB.  But the capacity of the built-in drive may vary.  In the most modest case, its volume is 16 GB.  This is, so to speak, the economy version of the flagship.  The average modification of the smartphone is called Meizu MX4 Pro 32Gb.  It is not difficult to understand from the name, its drive size is 32 GB.  Well, the most advanced version of the smartphone is equipped with 64 GB.  It should also be noted that there is no expansion slot for installing a flash card, and you will have to be content with what is available. </p>

    <h2>  Device display </h2><p>  <span>The Meizu</span> MX4 Pro <span>phone</span> , as already noted, is equipped with an 5.36-inch OTJ display, which is based on the IPS matrix.  The prefix ‚ÄúOTZH‚Äù means that there is no air gap between the screen surface and the touch panel.  Well, the ‚ÄúIPS‚Äù technology suggests that the viewing angles of the screen in this smart phone are close to 180 degrees.  The display resolution is 1536x2560, that is, the image is displayed in the "2K" format.  It is difficult to say in what cases 10 touches to the touch surface of the screen may be needed at the same time, but this feature is implemented in this device.  It is also worth noting the sides of the display, whose thickness is only 2.8 mm. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The capacity of the complete <span>battery</span> is 3350 mAh.  Given the diagonal of the <span>touch screen</span> of 5.36 inches and a fairly energy-intensive processor, this value with an average load is enough for 2 days.  If you use the device to a minimum, it will turn out to last 3 days on a single charge.  But if some serious toy is launched (Asphalt 8, for example), the battery will be discharged in Meizu MX4 Pro in a matter of hours.  Reviews <strong> </strong>  They say that in this mode, the smartphone can last a maximum of 4-5 hours. </p>

    <h2>  Communication kit </h2><p>  An excellent set of wired and wireless transmission methods in Meizu MX4 Pro.  A review of the technical documentation indicates the presence of such ones as: </p><ul><li>  Support for GSM, 3G and LTE mobile networks. </li><li>  An expanded set of Wi-Fi networks (the device successfully works with a, b, g, n and ac at frequencies of 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz). </li><li>  There is also a bluetooth transmitter, with the latest, 4th generation. </li><li>  One GPS transmitter at the software level can interact with all navigation systems: GPS, BDS and, of course, GLONASS. </li><li>  The microUSB port allows you to quickly exchange information with a PC or charge the battery. </li><li>  To output an audio signal, there is a 3.5 mm port located on the upper edge of the device. </li></ul><h2>  Phone cost today </h2><p>  From a technical and software standpoint, the Meizu MX4 Pro is perfectly balanced.  The price for it, it seems, is a little overpriced.  But if you compare it with direct competitors, it becomes obvious that not everything is so obvious.  For example, the very same Galaxy S6 from Samsung, even in the most modest modification, is estimated at 47,000 rubles.  At the same time, in terms of parameters, the most advanced modification of the flagship of this Chinese manufacturer is no worse than it, and in some places even significantly ahead of it.  In this version with 64 GB is estimated at 30,000 rubles.  Meizu MX4 Pro 32Gb costs even less (today you will have to pay about 25,000 rubles for the right to become its proud owner).  In organizing the memory subsystem, he is a direct competitor to the Galaxy S6. </p><p>  Price varies greatly on the Meizu MX4 Pro.  The price depends on the capacity of the integrated flash drive.  Its most modest modification with 16 GB on board is currently estimated at $ 410.  Of course, the price of the device is quite high, but compared to other flagship devices, it doesn‚Äôt seem like that anymore.  Moreover, according to the characteristics, this smartphone is not so much loses to them. </p>
