  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Turkey Hotel Titanic: enjoy your stay</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you are planning to spend your vacation for the first time abroad, it is best to choose a country such as Turkey to visit. Hotel Titanic 5 * near Antalya is ideal for families.  There is a bar with dishes of world famous <span>Turkish cuisine</span> and a pastry shop - especially for children and lovers of sweets.  There is an opportunity to go in for sports and have fun. </p><p>  The prototype <span>of the Titanic 5 * hotel</span> was the legendary <span>ocean liner of the</span> same name <span>,</span> which received worldwide fame.  Inspired by the famous film, architects designed the hotel in such a way that it resembles a ship floating in the ocean.  The location of the Titanic hotel in Turkey is very convenient - it is located near Antalya. </p><p>  One of the countries most visited by Russian tourists is traditionally Turkey. The Titanic Hotel, which enjoys well-deserved fame among tourists, has several pools on its territory, which, connecting with cascades and water slides, encircle the hotel on three sides and it seems that this ship is floating on the water.  The hotel has a place to relax, where you can sit in the shade or lie in a hammock, and in the evening, sitting on ottomans, smoke a hookah. </p><p>  On site there are restaurants, bars and a mini club built in the form of a schooner.  The waiters are dressed in a uniform similar to the uniform of sailors, and the cook in a white captain's uniform.  Nine conference rooms are equipped with modern technology necessary for conferences, presentations and business meetings. </p><p>  Reviews of the Titanic hotel in Turkey say the best hotel rooms are in the bow.  All rooms resemble ship cabins and have either balconies or terraces.  The rooms have a shower, safe and minibar, which is replenished daily.  Rooms are cleaned daily.  On television, on one channel, the Titanic is constantly played, on the other two - pre-recorded programs.  However, news is updated daily. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The rooms are designed as ship cabins.  The bar and main restaurant have helms.  If you do not want to wait long for your suitcases to be brought to your room, bring them yourself.  Most of the tourists are Russians, there are few young people.  Many children under seven years old.  For them, special children's pools are equipped, there is a children's park, a water park, a children's disco is held. </p><p>  The location of the Titanic hotel in Turkey is such that it has its own large sandy beach.  There are always a lot of people on the beach, but there are never problems with places, since there are enough sun loungers.  Beach towels, mattresses, sun loungers and parasols are provided free of charge.  You can go water skiing or a jet ski.  The beach has a shower, there is a dressing room.  In order to rinse your legs, special taps are installed. <br>  The bad thing is that until you reach the sun loungers, all your feet are in the sand, since the paths here are not cleaned.  Such comments can be found by vacationers reading reviews about the Titanic hotel in Turkey.  The sea near the coast is shallow, only after 10-15 meters the depth begins, so for children and those who can not swim - this is a real paradise.  The water in the sea is unclear due to the sand. <br>  In the morning, for breakfast, they give freshly squeezed and slightly diluted with water orange juice, which you can drink as much as you like.  Tea and coffee can be brewed by yourself.  Tea offers several types. <br>  The UAI system includes many types of drinks - from water, cola and fanta to beer and wine.  Of the meat dishes, lamb is especially successful, although other <span>meat dishes are</span> also very tasty.  Fish dishes are diverse, but the most delicious dish comes from salmon.  Chicken and turkey are also served.  Garnish for meat and fish dishes are pasta, rice and potatoes.  Turkish vegetable salads and various sauces, as well as large assorted fruits, are also served daily - after all, here Turkey Hotel Titanic is different in that it serves a lot of sweets, especially baklava. <br>  On the table for sweets there are always several types of compote, though canned.  The bread is baked very tasty, especially all kinds of buns.  Ice cream is given twice a day - for lunch and dinner.  In the afternoon, watermelons or boiled corn are distributed on the beach.  And here they bake very tasty, similar to chebureks, tortillas with meat and cheese.  In a small restaurant with the funny name "Cactus" you can eat potato dishes, as well as sweets and ice cream, and for free. </p><p>  Yes, this is Turkey. The Titanic Hotel offers extensive entertainment programs.  Animators are just great!  They organize all kinds of competitions for children, ride a banana, a pony and horses, paint their faces under the cartoons or animals.  Every evening, shows are held at the amphitheater.  Sometimes live music is played.  Various groups from different countries are performing.  At gala evenings, everyone is treated to a large cake and handed out <span>sparklers.</span>  Disco lasts until three in the night, that's just the music is boring, so people go to bars. </p><p>  Nearby is a traditional Turkish bazaar, but everything is very expensive there.  Although if you bargain well, the price can be knocked down threefold, comparable to the prices in the nearest shopping center. </p>
