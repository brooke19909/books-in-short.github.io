According to organizers who have spent more than five billion dollars, at least 15 million people will flock here every year. </p><p>  After ten years of negotiations and five years of construction on June 16, the wonderful Disneyland in Shanghai, inviting to the magical world of Disney, opened its doors to all guests.  Visitors recalled that torrential rain poured on that day, which did not confuse the crowd of thousands, which stood in bad weather for long lines to the entrance. </p><h2>  Original park </h2><p>  Disneyland in Shanghai can be called genuine Chinese.  There is no America‚Äôs main street, as in other entertainment venues, and instead, visitors stroll along Mickey Avenue, which is one of six thematic areas.  On the longest avenue, you can shake hands with the popular heroes of Disney tales, take pictures with them as a keepsake and buy souvenirs with the main theme. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disneyland in shanghai" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1395725.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment for every taste </h2><p>  Different from the American counterparts, Disneyland in Shanghai, whose photo poorly conveys the full scale of the complex, places the main emphasis on national culture.  For example, in the colorful Tarzan show, the main acrobats are local athletes, and all the cartoon characters wear folk costumes.  Everywhere Chinese philosophy is clearly traced, and animals of the zodiac calendar coexist along with famous heroes in the park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are areas that will delight fans of the blockbusters Pirates of the Caribbean and Star Wars, and in the center is the Sleeping Beauty Castle with eight tall turrets.  Full of shops, beauty salons, pastry shops, it attracts the attention of both women and men, and in the evening, bright fireworks are launched over it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disneyland shanghai reviews" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1395719.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An interesting entertainment will be the help of professional hairdressers and makeup artists who will transform girls into real princesses in a few hours.  The fee for turning into a fabulous heroine is more than $ 400, and Disneyland in Shanghai is incredibly proud of this service.  Reviews of tourists about the park are full of enthusiastic emotions.  Everyone notes that a lot of attractions are absolute novelties that have not been demonstrated anywhere before.  And the Chinese flavor gives a special atmosphere to a fun corner immersing in a world of happiness. </p><h2>  Shopping center </h2><p>  At the entrance to the amusement park is the Disneytown shopping district, designed for adults who love shopping.  A huge center with colorful boutiques will delight all the fashionistas of the world, and pleasant tiredness after many hours of walking through the galleries can be removed by going to a cozy restaurant.  Many establishments offering Asian and European cuisine will welcome dear visitors and offer the most delicious dishes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disneyland shanghai photo" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1395699.jpg" width="600"></div>

The architects who worked on the project for several years created a delightful garden with beautifully trimmed trees, flower beds, comfortable benches, gurgling fountains.  It is so nice to stroll through the maze of alleys and stay alone with nature, recharging with positive emotions! </p><p>  The combination of Chinese flavor and the best animated traditions of Disneyland in Shanghai will not only introduce popular characters to fairy tales, but will also open for all guests the original culture of the country as a whole. </p><h2>  Thematic hotels </h2><p>  Shanghai Disneyland so far covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãseven square kilometers, but the creators say that their brainchild will grow every year.  For those who do not want to part with the park, there are two themed hotels, and their guests, who find themselves in a real fairy tale, will feel like the main characters of famous cartoons. </p><p>  The spirit of Walt Disney magic is in every room, and any adult will be in the fantastic world of childhood. </p><h2>  Disneyland in Shanghai: how to get there? </h2><p>  You can get to the park located 20 kilometers from the city center by metro.  In the new Pudong district, <span>where Shanghai</span> Disneyland <span>is located</span> , there are taxis that will take you to the main attractions of Shanghai. </p><p>  Those who are going to take the subway need line 11, and you need to get out at the specially created station - Disney Resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disneyland in shanghai how to get" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1395708.jpg" width="600"></div>
