She receives negative and positive reviews every day.  But it‚Äôs difficult to determine whether it is worth believing the activities of the company or not.  Especially for novice users who do not yet fully know all the secrets and patterns of working on the Internet.  Someone believes that virtual investment brings income, someone is skeptical.  And how are things really?  What is a Status?  Is it really possible to make money with it? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="igo status reviews negative" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1228344.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Activities </h2><p>  To begin with, it‚Äôs worth understanding what exactly the activity of this or that company is based on.  Only then can we draw any conclusions and assumptions.  "Status" offers its clients and investors asset management.  That is, you can become a member, and then get some profit from the fact that you have the securities of the organization. </p><p>  In principle, there is nothing suspicious so far.  Why?  Many people buy stocks and bonds, assets and other securities from different companies, and then earn a lot of money on it.  It is quite normal for the modern world.  Asset management alone is not so simple.  You need to know where to invest, when and how to operate with your papers.  "Status" assures that with them all these problems will disappear.  Just become an investor. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to invest </h2><p>  Making this idea a reality is easy.  Why?  All this is due to the fact that our current company is actively conducting its activities on the Internet.  How to become an investor in Status?  It is enough to go through the simple registration process on the official website.  After that, you will receive the right to invest money in the company, as well as to receive profit from your donations. </p><p>  How to become an investor?  It has already been said - a few clicks of the mouse on the official page for registration - and all problems have been resolved.  Just try not to rush into this issue.  After all, it is still unknown whether this company can be trusted.  Judging only by the direction of activity, it is likely that we have before us the most ordinary investor firm.  So, you can believe her.  But is it really so?  What else is worth a look? </p><h2>  Promises </h2><p>  For example, on the promises that the corporation gives to all its investors.  The Russian investment company "Status" offers not only to become an investor, but also to receive incredible opportunities to increase your profit.  Moreover, on an ongoing basis.  It is enough to transfer money to the company‚Äôs account at least once. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="asset Management" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1228345.jpg"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What's next?  Nothing.  Just sit and wait.  Every day you will receive a certain percentage of money on your account balance, which directly depends on your investments (5-10% of transfers per month).  And so it will be constantly.  A kind of passive income that attracts many citizens.  Where to invest the money?  In the "Status", if you want to no longer think about your earnings.  That is how the company positions itself.  But can such promises be believed?  New users often trust, but those who have already encountered some kind of investment corporations try to be safe again and check all possible moments that could indicate a fraud.  This is a normal occurrence.  What else is worth a look?  Where to invest money if you need constant earnings on the Internet?  And is it worth doing it at all? </p><h2>  Website </h2><p>  For example, you can pay attention to the official page of the organization.  The Russian investment company Status is not distinguished for its originality in this sense.  And so many leave mixed opinions and advice on the issue of investment. </p><p>  Why?  If you take a closer look, you can notice - the structure of the official page is template.  You can find a lot of duplicates on the Internet, but with other names.  Often, even the information published on the pages will not be any different from each other.  Unless the name of the management company and, of course, management. </p><p>  Therefore, this phenomenon is not credible.  Shareholder reviews remain mixed.  However, to a greater extent they have a negative connotation.  Well, how can a good company, and even a successful one (after all, the "Status" positions itself this way) use a template site that was not even created on a free hosting?  This is hard to understand.  Usually, even conscientious organizations take seriously even the creation of official pages.  So, the first doubts are already taking place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="igo status personal account" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1228347.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Bring anyone you want </h2><p>  What else is worth paying attention to?  For example, the fact that IGO "Status" receives negative reviews quite often from its users for the ambiguity of its activities.  This is normal for many sites, but not for an investment corporation. </p><p>  The thing is that if you carefully study the proposed information, you can see - there are several types of profit making on the site.  The first normal one is dependence on your investments, although a suspiciously high return is offered. </p><p>  But the second method is not at all credible.  This is a referral program.  The more people who come to your corporation from you, the more money you will receive.  And everything will depend on the income of the users you invited.  Of course, the charges will also be constant.  The invitee makes a profit, you are a percentage of his earnings.  It seems to be honest, but it seems to be doubtful.  Especially considering the fact that many invest a lot of money in the project. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to become an investor" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1228346.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Pyramids and finance </h2><p>  It turns out that the MPO "Status" is a pyramid, moreover, a financial one.  The more you invest and invite new investors, the higher your profit.  It is logical, but when you consider that all activity takes place exclusively in the virtual world, there is every reason for concern and risks for deceiving users. </p><p>  In general, financial pyramids are a very bad place to invest.  Unless you have extra money that you can give to charity.  In practice, especially in Russia, such organizations usually do not bring any profit, only continuous, constant costs, and then huge problems. </p><p>  For this reason, MPO "Status" receives negative reviews from citizens more and more every day.  Well, the current population does not trust the financial pyramids.  Many consider this a hoax.  To some extent, it is.  Especially when you consider the experience with MMM.  How many deceived citizens?  Who has achieved justice?  No one.  People simply were left without money, no justice!  Therefore, many shy away from any financial pyramids, not to mention virtual ones. </p><h2>  Assistants </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, our company today has some helpers.  More precisely, companies that are happy to become part of the organization.  It is with their help, according to the creators, that one can profit to one degree or another.  Now it is already possible with almost 100% probability to say what kind of project is in front of us. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to invest" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1228348.jpg"></div>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  How exactly?  Just look at the official pages of companies that operate through the "Status".  What awaits the user?  Most likely a disappointment.  The thing is that almost none of the listed companies has an official page on the Internet.  That is, about all the collaborating organizations on the "Status" page it is written in all its glory, but there is no way to verify the reality of what has been said. </p><p>  This kind of phenomenon does not allow us to think about the integrity of the company in principle.  Why can not you meet with collaborating organizations?  What should they hide?  Most likely, this is the most common invention, which simply attracts misunderstood and gullible users.  It is a very common scheme used by scammers on the Internet for a long time. </p><h2>  Withdrawals </h2><p>  A separate topic is the withdrawals of money that you earned directly from the system.  Suppose we have a really financial pyramid.  But there are organizations that pay their investors.  And only this question excites them.  In principle, it‚Äôs logical - it doesn‚Äôt matter what the organization does, if it fulfills the main promise - it transfers the earnings to you. </p><p>  All conclusions are made on the IPO "Status" website.  "My Account" will help you with this.  According to numerous reviews, you can say - just select the method of transferring funds (to an electronic wallet, bank transfer, card) in the appropriate tab, and then wait a while.  And after rejoicing in the funds received - now you can spend them as you wish.  All money transfers are executed without a commission, which pleases. </p><p>  But do not think that everything is so easy and simple.  Many complain about the MPO "Status" - there are no payments.  That is, the application is filled out, but over time it either disappears or simply ‚Äúhangs‚Äù.  No payments are received: neither to the card, nor to the electronic wallet, nor by bank transfer.  That is, the counters that your personal account offers in MPO "Status" (this is where you can see your earnings) is <span>a hoax.</span>  So, the whole project in itself is a complete swindle and divorce.  You simply give your money to someone unknown. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian investment company" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1228349.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Try catch </h2><p>  The main problem will be after - if you try to track down the company in order to achieve justice.  Why?  The fact is that the city of registration of the MPO "Status" is Moscow.  Moreover, even the address can be found on the official page of this organization.  But if you declare it, then you will not find any hint of an investment company. </p><p>  That is, all the contact information offered to users is a complete fraud.  And you will not succeed in achieving justice.  Moreover, return the funds transferred to the corporation.  Why?  Yes, you have been deceived.  But no one forced to transfer money to the account of an unverified organization.  This is exactly what is considered in Russia in litigation.  Therefore, citizens from financial pyramids try to stay at the maximum distance.  This will help to keep the budget and avoid many problems. </p><h2>  Praise </h2><p>  Well, you can find reviews about the IGO "Status" negative.  Only they, oddly enough, are overshadowed by huge and long opinions of a positive nature.  If we already have a real scam, then where does the praise of the company come from? </p><p>  Everything is extremely easy and simple - this is already a well-known scheme of scammers.  Positive reviews are either compiled independently, or simply bought.  That is, someone is paid only for lying about the activities and success of the corporation.  It was invented a long time ago to attract new customers.  Moreover, positive reviews are not always bought by scammers, even bona fide firms sometimes do this. </p><p>  Distinguishing lies from reality is easy.  It is enough to look at the text and study it - there will be a minimum of useful information, but here you will be told in all its glory about the earnings and opportunities of the organization.  Often, a variety of evidence is provided in support - videos or screenshots with cash withdrawals.  Is it really impossible to believe in this? </p><h2>  About evidence </h2><p>  And there is.  It is impossible to believe even the evidence presented in our case.  After all, both Status and other financial pyramids are ready to do everything to only awaken the trust of users.  And videos and screenshots - all this is easily faked with the most common initial skills in editing graphic files. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shareholder reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1228350.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  It turns out that all the positive opinions about the ‚ÄúStatus‚Äù are lies.  And you can‚Äôt believe them in any way.  Even if you really want to.  Remember, investment companies on the Internet almost do not work.  Only in real life. </p><h2>  Is it worth it to invest </h2><p>  In general, if you want to receive passive (or not) earnings, then it's time to think about your investments.  You can invest in the World Wide Web, only you need to do this with great care. </p><p>  In principle, transferring money to the account of a company is a dubious occupation.  Therefore, it is recommended to avoid such offers.  If you really want to acquire assets and become a shareholder, it is better to contact official banks.  There you will not be deceived.  Otherwise, don‚Äôt sacrifice money for the sake of financial pyramids.  And MPO "Status" (negative and positive reviews we have reviewed) generally get around! </p>
