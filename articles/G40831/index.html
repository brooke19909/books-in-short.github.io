Complex patterns lead you to a standstill?  In this article we will analyze some of the easiest sewing options for this product.  The only thing you need is fabric and a little patience.  Even a beginner can sew a skirt with a smell, the main thing is to clearly follow the instructions. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Many do not particularly understand the design of the product.  What does smell mean?  In fact, everything is quite simple.  In a skirt of this type, one floor of the skirt goes over the other, as if closing it.  For many girls, it is an obligatory part of the wardrobe.  A wrap skirt is considered a basic thing, especially if it is sewn in classic colors.  Comfortable to wear, it can also easily emphasize your figure. </p><h2>  Model selection </h2><p>  Once you understand the essence of the design of this product, it is worth starting to choose the model you are interested in.  You can sew a skirt with a smell in any way.  The simplest models are: pencil skirt and sun skirt.  But this does not mean that they will look worse.  It all depends on the selected fabrics, the correct and accurate tailoring.  Even the simplest product can be beaten with bows, a strap or buttons.  Experienced craftswomen advise trying to sew a half-sun skirt as the first experiment.  This is what we will do. </p><h2>  Necessary materials </h2><p>  Before you begin, you should prepare the following items and tools: </p><ol><li>  Get a silk cloth.  She is well suited for this type of skirt. </li><li>  A centimeter tape to make all the necessary measurements. </li><li>  Scissors, chalk or a dried bar of soap, a ruler. </li><li>  Two buttons, matched to the color of your fabric, measuring 1-1.5 centimeters. </li><li>  Ribbon or elastic of the same color as the buttons. </li></ol><p>  After preparing all the necessary materials, you can try to sew a skirt with a smell for the first time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  If you carefully follow each item, the product will be neat and beautiful.  The main thing is not to worry.  If something starts to go a little wrong, you can always go back to the previous step and redo something. </p><ul><li>  First, take measurements.  We need to know the hips.  You don‚Äôt have to measure anything else.  For example, if you measured 100 centimeters in your hips, then you still need to add 30 centimeters to this value.  This is very important and this step should not be neglected.  This value (your hips + 30 centimeters) will be the width of the future skirt. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.sewcraftyonline.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tape measure" class="if uuid-2961050" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/2961050.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Next, you need to figure out the length of the product.  It is better to take 100-110 centimeters.  But the final decision on the issue of length is yours, since here everything depends on personal preferences and the type of figure. </li><li>  Now you need to cut the resulting rectangle from the general fabric canvas.  Set it aside.  Take the fabric that remains unused.  From it we will cut a rectangle.  Its length will be equal to your waist circumference + the addition of 3 centimeters as a margin on each side.  And the width of this rectangle will be 10 centimeters. </li><li>  Let us lay out in front of us the main cut cloth.  Take chalk or dried soap.  From all 4 sides, it is necessary to note 2 centimeters.  It will be a stock.  On the line, wrap all this stock from 4 sides inward.  Take the iron and smooth the seam allowances. </li><li>  The next task will be the creation of folds.  From the very edge we will measure 4-5 centimeters and mark these areas with chalk.  Then, with the help of a needle and thread, we fix the folds.  After that, you will need to switch your attention to working with the belt. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="whatido.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The process of creating a skirt" class="if uuid-2961061" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/2961061.jpg"></div><ul><li>  We will strengthen this strip so that the belt lasts longer.  For strengthening, you can use a regular lining or freezolin.  This material must be attached to the belt by ironing.  Next, we sew the belt to the front side of the skirt. </li><li>  And the final part.  In order for our skirt to be fastened somehow, we need to sew two buttons to different sides of the product.  Only on the side that you will wrap the button should be attached to the very edge.  And to that side, on which the opposite will be superimposed, the button needs to be sewn to the place where the smell will end. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikiecloud.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Option wrap skirts" class="if uuid-2961058" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/2961058.jpg"></div><p>  Done!  Sewing a wrap skirt without a pattern was very simple.  But despite this simplicity, the product turned out to be very attractive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Summer option </h2><p>  Many people like those products that do not constrain movements.  In summer, I especially want to wear some spacious and cotton fabrics, especially light colors.  We have already figured out how to sew a skirt with a smell.  Doing it yourself was not so difficult.  And what if you try to sew another comfortable, but summer version of such a skirt?  Let's get started. </p><ol><li>  In the same way, we begin work by taking measurements.  Here you need to measure the circumference of the hips, waist, and also know the desired length of the future product.  If you are having difficulty taking measurements, then try tying a rope to your waist.  Its length can be measured much easier. </li><li>  As a material we will use chintz or cotton for a wrap skirt.  The summer version of our product will be different in that it will be much longer than the last, and also easier to pass air.  For the hot season, this is the best option. </li><li>  The length of our skirt will be what you prefer.  But in our version, its length will be equal to 150 centimeters.  To this value we will add 20 centimeters as a fallback.  The width will be equal to the measurement of your hips.  But since our product comes with a smell, at least half must be added to the volume.  If the hips are 110 centimeters, then you need to take a width of 160 centimeters. </li><li>  On the perimeter of the fabric, you need to make folds so that the skirt looks airy and light.  Sew them. </li><li>  In the same way as with the previous version, we make a belt.  This time is significantly longer than the width of your skirt.  Since then we will attach this belt as ties. </li><li>  Before the final stage, the edges of the main panel should be processed.  Then he makes special loops for the belt on the front side.  We do this so that the smell persists. </li><li>  We pass the belt.  We put on a skirt, tie it, that's it. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cotton wrap skirt" class="if uuid-2961069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/2961069.jpg"></div><p>  This version of a wrap skirt turned out to be so simple and airy.  The summer version is distinguished by its simplicity, freshness and suitable style. </p><h2>  Interesting ideas </h2><p>  As an original option, you can consider a plaid skirt.  Such a coloring always remains fashionable, and is also distinguished by its attractiveness.  Many needlewomen believe that it should also be the basic thing in a women's wardrobe.  Such a product can be sewn both long and short.  The main task is the correct combination of square patterns, which not every beginner can do.  Another bold option is a plaid skirt, sewn from different color elements.  This can be done if you take a fabric with squares of several colors at once. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.exoticexcess.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wrap plaid skirt" class="if uuid-2961029" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/2961029.jpg"></div><h2>  Main mistakes </h2><p>  Professionals highlight a number of mistakes that almost all beginners make in this matter.  Here are the main ones: </p><ul><li>  Many are mistaken about the difficulty level of a wrap skirt.  Sewing fast does not mean neglecting all the possible tips and algorithms.  You can‚Äôt just take a cloth and turn around. </li><li>  Another problem arises with measurements.  Many girls think that if you pull in your stomach while taking measurements, the finished product will not fill them.  This is the mistake.  The finished skirt will simply not be of your size, and you will not be able to walk in it for a long time.  It is better to choose the color or pattern that will favorably emphasize your figure. </li><li>  Since the easiest option for making a wrap skirt is the sun, many newcomers simply forget to make allowances when working with such a product.  Without them, the product will not work harmonious and neat.  A wraparound skirt with strings on the ties will be sewn correctly only if you leave at least 3-4 centimeters of fabric on all sides. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.eloquii.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Summer option" class="if uuid-2961040" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/2961040.jpg"></div><p>  A number of mistakes are always replenished, and each person makes them in their specific places.  But above we have listed the most common misconceptions that many beginners encounter. </p><h2>  Sewing tips </h2><p>  Experts often speak out about wrap skirts.  Sewing it with your own hands is not so difficult, but the number of mistakes made by beginners does not decrease.  There are a number of tips that are better to take note of if you intend to make such a product. </p><ul><li>  In order not to spoil a good fabric, especially cotton, make a trial version of the skirt from unnecessary old material.  So you can look at your mistakes and correct them when you are already sewing the final version. </li><li>  When working with light cotton, thoroughly wash the surface on which you will be sewing.  The same applies to the iron. </li><li>  Do not make a belt without lining or reinforcement.  Otherwise, the skirt will not hold well at waist level. </li></ul><p>  These were the main tips that can help you when making a wraparound skirt for your own hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="r.search.yahoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Plaid Skirt Option" class="if uuid-2961063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108958/2961063.jpg"></div><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost of such a product will not be high.  Cotton fabric can be purchased for 300-400 rubles per 1 meter of fabric.  Chintz is sold for 100-150 rubles per 1 meter.  Silk fabric cannot be purchased cheaply.  Its cost can be 1000-2000 rubles per 1 meter.  But you can always find an alternative fabric - a substitute.  Practically everyone has materials at home.  As a result, it was not so difficult to create a wrap skirt.  It was much easier to sew with your own hands than you could imagine. </p>
