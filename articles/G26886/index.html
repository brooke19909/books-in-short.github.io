Then a month after the outbreak of hostilities, the people of Kiev began to leave the city and leave for the villages, which were supposed to save the inhabitants from death.  However, it is worth saying that most people remained in Kiev and were ready for an early battle.  Brave Kievites continued to work, build fortifications and prepare for an attack. </p><h2>  Reasons for the battle near Kiev </h2><p>  After German troops captured the territory near Smolensk, Hitler decided to attack Kiev in order to conquer all Ukrainian lands soon.  He wanted to capture Ukraine because coal deposits were located on its territory.  Hitler believed that this would help provide German troops with heat and food so that they could continue military operations on the territory of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  After the seizure of Ukrainian lands, it was planned to take Moscow into the ring, after which it was possible to surrender from the USSR. </p>

    <h2>  Defense of Kiev 1941. Briefly about military operations </h2><p>  The Great Patriotic War claimed a huge number of heroes' lives.  No one can forget how the Red Army defended their homeland from the enemy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The defense of Kiev in 1941 was a very difficult period for the Red Army and the townspeople.  Despite the unequal forces, the Red Army stood to the last and did desperate things in order to prevent the German troops from moving forward.  Most units of the Red Army lost contact with the higher command, as well as with neighboring units.  Many of them were surrounded and could no longer escape from it.  It is worth saying that most of the soldiers were dying or captured by the enemy. </p>

    <h2>  Lack of ammunition, the number of troops and the help of citizens of the Soviet Army </h2><p>  Already in the first battles, the shortage of weapons and ammunition was palpable.  Hitler planned a lightning seizure of the capital, however, despite the superiority of German troops in numbers, as well as the lack of military equipment, the Red Army soldiers heroically fought the enemy.  The heroic defense of Kiev in 1941 will never be forgotten, because the soldiers of the Red Army and the inhabitants of the city united and bravely fought for the capital. </p><p>  In addition to the <span>military units</span> that defended the capital, the citizens took part in the defense of Kiev.  More than 200,000 residents of Kiev went to war to the front voluntarily.  On the construction of defensive lines, more than 160,000 citizens daily worked, who united in the <span>people's militia.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Defense of Kiev 1941. Summary of the attack on the capital </h2><p>  Hitler's main task was the occupation of the territory of Donbass, as well as the Crimea.  First, these developed agricultural industrial areas would provide the army and rear with resources.  Secondly, the capture of Ukrainian lands would ensure the unhindered advance of the German army towards its main goal - Moscow. </p><p>  After the capture of Smolensk, the German command decided to seize the USSR.  Hitler planned to capture Kiev with lightning speed, but the courageous and freedom-loving troops of the Red Army prevented his dreams from coming true. </p><p>  Already on July 11, German troops tried to break into Kiev and capture the capital, but the staunch defense and counterattacks of the Red Army did not allow the city to be captured with lightning speed.  After that, the enemy decided to bypass Kiev from two sides and on July 30 resumed hostilities and an attack on the city. </p><p>  August 7, the airborne brigade A.I.  Rodimtseva was counterattack.  This helped stabilize the situation, but only for a short time.  It is worth noting that the paratroopers did not have experience, and they also lacked heavy weapons.  They could oppose strong German infantry only with fighting spirit, courage and courage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Soviet command decided to form new divisions and to introduce them into battle.  Only this helped to avoid a catastrophic situation. </p><p>  By August 10, the enemy managed to break through to the southwestern suburbs, but here they failed too: the heroic resistance of the 37th army forced the German troops to stop again. </p><p>  Despite the heroic resistance, the German offensive continued, as well as the defense of Kiev.  July-September 1941 became a very difficult period for the city, because for three months the enemy continued to advance and destroy the Red Army. </p>

    <h2>  Surroundings of Kiev </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the Red Army forces stubbornly and courageously resisted, Hitler decided to turn south the 2nd Field Army, as well as the 1st Panzer Group, which were moving in the Moscow direction.  I must say that at this time, German troops broke through to the Dnieper south.  However, at the end of August, the enemy forces crossed the river north of Kiev, and already in the Chernigov region they connected with their units, which were advancing from the north. </p><p>  Despite the fact that there was a threat of encirclement, Stalin still decided to continue the defense of the capital.  This was reflected in the tragedy of further events, for if the Soviet troops had retreated after the first warning about encirclement, there would have been so many casualties. </p><p>  The defense of Kiev in 1941 was remembered by everyone for a long time.  The heroism and courage of the Red Army soldiers cannot but admire.  Despite the fact that the number of German troops was almost three times higher than the Red Army, they did not retreat and continued to defend the capital. </p>

    <h2>  The defeat of the Soviet troops </h2><p>  On September 9, German troops approached Kiev and surrounded it.  Despite the fact that the Red Army was almost defeated, they still made desperate attempts to break through. </p><p>  Already on September 19, German troops managed to enter the city, and the Kiev group of Soviet troops was forced to retreat.  The Soviet command made an attempt to release the encircled group of forces of the Red Army, but it was unsuccessful.  A lot of soldiers and commanders were killed, and also captured by the enemy.  The defense of Kiev in 1941 took an incredible number of lives of brave and courageous Red Army soldiers who were ready for anything to liberate their homeland.  They gave their lives in order to stay on their land and not give it into the hands of the enemy. </p><p>  It is worth saying that before the start of the defense of Kiev, G.K. Zhukov informed Stalin that Soviet troops needed to be transferred from the bend of the Dnieper. </p>

    <h2>  Human losses and courage of the Red Army </h2><p>  Every student and adult knows how long the defense of Kiev lasted. Nobody can forget the bloody battles, courage, and also the heroism of the Red Army.  Everyone will remember how the soldiers fought for the capital and defended it as soon as they could.  Not a single soldier even had thoughts of leaving the battlefield and putting the capital in the hands of the enemy.  These events will forever remain in memory, because it is simply impossible to forget them. </p><p>  I must say that the defeat of the Red Army was a huge blow to the whole country and greatly influenced the further development of the Great Patriotic War.  Military action claimed the lives of over 700,000 people.  In addition to the enormous loss of life, the USSR lost almost all of <span>Left-Bank Ukraine.</span>  Because of this, the road to Donbass, to the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, as well as to Eastern Ukraine, became open for German troops. </p>

    <h2>  Failure of Hitler's plans </h2><p>  It is important that the defense of Kiev in 1941 was a surprise for the German troops.  The fighting on the territory of the city thwarted Hitler‚Äôs plans for a lightning war and the immediate capture of the capital.  It is also worth saying that this prevented their advance to the capital, thereby helping the Soviet troops prepare for the defense of Moscow.  For 3 months, the Soviet troops managed to strengthen their positions in order to courageously and heroically repel the blow of the German troops. </p><h2>  The consequences of the defeat of Soviet troops during the defense of Kiev </h2><p>  The defeat of the Red Army led to the fact that the road to Eastern Ukraine, Azov and Donbass became open for German troops.  It is worth saying what the retreat of the Red Army led to: </p><ul><li>  On October 17, German troops occupied Donbass. </li><li>  On October 25, enemy troops captured Kharkov. </li><li>  On November 2, German troops managed to capture Crimea and also block Sevastopol. </li></ul><p>  Everyone for a long time remembered the defense of Kiev in 1941. The year 1942 became bloody for Ukraine: the <span>defense of Sevastopol, the</span> Kharkov operation, etc. It is hard to imagine what the <span>Soviet army</span> and residents of the country survived at that time. </p><p>  During the defense of Kiev, all possible measures were taken in order to strengthen the combat ability of the Soviet troops.  They heroically defended their territory and repelled enemy attacks.  It must be said that human losses were enormous.  Many Soviet soldiers were captured by the enemy, but, despite this, their courage knew no bounds. </p><p>  The defense of Kiev in 1941 is an event that absolutely everyone will remember for a long time.  The courage and heroism of Soviet soldiers did not leave anyone indifferent.  They tried their best to repel enemy attacks and proudly recaptured Kiev.  The defeat affected the further development of hostilities and plans of the German command in relation to the cities of Ukraine, as well as to Moscow. </p>
