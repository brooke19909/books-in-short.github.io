And we are talking about the Lumia 430 Dual SIM.  Currently, the approximate cost of this device is about sixty dollars.  The user in exchange for this money receives basic abilities that are placed inside a modern smartphone, dressed in a small but stylish case.  So, we present to your attention Lumia 430 Dual SIM - the most affordable and "insensitive" device running the Windows Phone operating system. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2>

    <p>  First, briefly list the parameters so that it is clear what we have to deal with.  So, what does the device have?  On board it is installed the Windows Phone operating system version 8.1 with a custom shell called Lumia Denim.  The dimensions of the device in <span>three-dimensional space are</span> as follows: it is 120.5 in height, 63.2 in width, and 10.6 mm in thickness.  At the same time, the approximate mass of the smartphone is only 128 grams. </p><p>  Microsoft Lumia 430 is equipped with a screen with a diagonal of four inches.  The display resolution is 800 by 480 pixels.  Density - not higher than 235 dpi.  The matrix of the screen is made by LCD technology.  The system can be controlled using separate keys that are not combined with the display. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To store user data, the owner of Microsoft Lumia 430 provided 8 gigabytes.  The device supports the installation of an additional external drive.  This is a microSD memory card.  The maximum supported capacity is 128 gigabytes.  At the same time, only 1 GB of RAM is provided for using applications and operating system operation.  It will not be enough, but it is not so critical to discard the smartphone. </p><p>  <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 430 will not please its owner with battery life.  The battery that is built into the device is a removable type and is designed for a capacity of about 1,500 mAh.  This suggests that in standby mode, the smartphone will "live" for several days, in a continuous conversation mode - 13 hours, and when listening to music - 46 hours.  By the way, it was about working in a second generation cellular network.  In 3G time will be reduced. </p><p>  As a chipset, the Nokia Lumia 430 has a Qualcomm processor integrated.  This is the Snapdragon 200 model. If this still doesn‚Äôt mean anything to you, we‚Äôll explain.  The processor works with two cores, the average operating frequency.  It is about 1.2 gigahertz.  The set of wireless interfaces consists of Wi-Fi, operating in the b, g, n, "Bluetooth" bands of version 4.0, as well as GLONASS and GPS. </p><p>  Well, it's time to complete the listing of technical specifications.  We will do this by talking about cameras.  So, the main one has a resolution of 2 megapixels.  She shoots video at a resolution of 848 by 480 pixels, with a frequency of 30 frames per second.  The front camera is present, but its quality is disgusting.  It is only 0.3 megapixels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  As they say, people are met by clothes.  But the smartphone is met by the box in which it is located, as well as by its delivery package.  You can immediately notice that the Lumia 430, a review of which is presented in this article, differs significantly in size from older models of the corresponding series. </p><p>  That is why users who were just starting to get acquainted with such models remember how the Finnish manufacturer released his creations in boxes that were pleasant-looking and touch, painted in blue.  By the way, the volume of packaging was compressed as much as possible, which is very interesting.  So, the Lumia 430 phone, the review of which flew around the international network, comes in the same box.  The package is painted in light shades, and the image of the device itself is applied to it. </p><p>  But from words to deeds, and what do we find inside the box?  There will be the subject of our review today, a removable battery with a capacity of 1,500 mAh, a charging unit, as well as all the necessary documentation, including a quick start guide and warranty repair coupon.  We won‚Äôt find a wired stereo headset here, no matter how hard we look: the manufacturer decided, it seems, to save this time and not include it in the factory equipment.  The polygraphy on the box is of high quality, which cannot be ignored.  Among the pieces of paper there is nothing special.  But the charger is monolithic.  The cable cannot be disconnected.  Therefore, if you want to synchronize your smartphone with a computer or laptop, you have to fork out for an additional MicroUSB-USB cable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  A few bad words about charging </h2>

    <p>  Currently, there is a steady trend in the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer.  It consists in equipping the equipment with chargers of poor (simply terrible) quality.  So it is in our case.  The adapter is very, very unpleasant to the touch.  The wire is really thin.  That is why the use of this composition in practice does not deliver any convenience. </p><p>  Many experts still do not understand why the Finnish manufacturer is not working to finally make a normal charger and equip them with all the boxes with smartphones of the Lumiya product range.  This is a separable composition of a network adapter and cable.  But the situation is very well outlined with the help of the proverb "avaricious pays twice."  Therefore, saving on the phone, you will return to the store (most likely) for an additional cable. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  This is not to say that the Lumia 430 smartphone claims to be the <span>most beautiful phone of the</span> year.  This is not true.  In general, at first it‚Äôs even difficult to figure it out and so to say for sure whether to describe the design of the device in detail, in detail.  But since we took up the review, we will do it.  The case, as expected, is classic.  The Finnish manufacturer does everything according to a certain formula, verified over the years.  Each time the hardware is changed.  It is truncated, then supplemented, but the shape of the body, appearance - everything remains almost the same. </p><p>  To immerse the phone, removable additional rear panels are provided.  They are at the ends, as well as on the back side, tightly fit the device.  Thus, it will not work to notice the hardware stuffing of the Lumia 430 Black through the panel.  Why is the Finnish manufacturer doing this?  The thing is that if the phone falls, say, on the asphalt with the front side, only a miracle can save it.  And if the back, then the panel just comes into play.  It prevents damage to the ‚Äúhardware‚Äù of the device, and also protects the <span>function keys</span> located on the edges.  The socket breaks - so it can easily be replaced with a new one! </p><h2>  Average mark </h2>

    <p>  The appearance of the device is difficult to assess as generally terrible.  But he clearly does not pretend to be the most beautiful device of the year.  Such is the average phone.  We can say that this is the most ordinary piece of orange (or black, depending on the color design) plastic.  To the touch - not very pleasant.  Well, what else to expect from cheap plastic?  You can verify this by simply sniffing the rear panel.  Cheapness, visible to the naked eye.  The way it is. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2>

    <p>  Usually, the Finnish manufacturer launches quite high-quality products on the smartphone market in this regard.  However, in this case, the build quality does not please the owners of the device.  Sometimes you can hear the crackling of the back cover.  She bends inward under strong pressure.  Some time after the start of use, she simply begins to sing, creak and generally do what she wants and how she wants.  In conclusion, on this point: if you constantly care about what appearance your device has, and it is really important for you, do not rush to purchase this model.  Otherwise, you risk being disappointed.  Scratches on the case remain free, it is practically not protected by anything. </p><p>  But the good thing is that fingerprints do not remain on the back cover of the device.  In order to leave any traces on the subject of our review, you will need to really, really try.  Nevertheless, this cannot be said about the screen coverage.  Evaluate on a five-point scale, it can only be a solid unit, without any chance of raising the score.  It is almost impossible to erase fingerprints from the display.  The only thing that can save the owner of the device at such moments is only a special cloth made of the appropriate material.  For example, microfiber. </p><h2>  Controls  Left side </h2>

    <p>  In general, all smartphone controls are located in their usual places.  On the left side we have a double key that allows you to adjust the volume in third-party applications, as well as change the sound mode of the device itself.  Double keys are also called a rocker.  They are small in size, but very pleasant to the touch.  The difference in the materials used to manufacture the entire case and the keys individually is striking, so you should not even worry about missing the button. </p><h2>  Top end </h2><p>  It accommodates a jack for connecting a wired headset standard 3.5 mm.  Headphones can be used in third-party applications. </p><h2>  Bottom end </h2><p>  On the opposite side there is a connector for connecting a synchronization cable of the MicroUSB standard - USB 2.0.  As mentioned earlier, the cord is not included in the package.  If you are going to regularly connect the phone to a personal computer or laptop in order to exchange information between devices, you will need to purchase a cable in a mobile phone salon, for example. </p><h2>  Front Panel </h2><p>  From the front, we can see a screen having a diagonal of four inches.  There are also three touch buttons.  They denote the commands "search", "back", as well as "home".  At the top of the screen are sensors and a front camera, which has far from the best resolution.  In general, the set of sensors pleases, it is useful when using a smartphone. </p><h2>  Conclusion and reviews </h2><p>  To be honest, the Lumia 430 is exactly the device that does not cause absolutely any emotions when considering, buying and using it.  It is unlikely that the owner of the phone will admire something for a long time.  Unless only the first time, and even then only because this device is better than the previous one.  You can call the device a remedy for smartphones.  Why?  Because, as soon as you buy it and start using it, any desire to continue to have a similar device on hand will immediately disappear. </p><p>  In general, the subject of our today's review is not capable of anything other than voice calls, text messaging and correspondence on social networks.  A weak battery, poor-quality assembly, a small screen and cameras that are not impressive in quality - all these are just the first items on the list of negative qualities of the device that its owners made.  We are not even talking about hardware stuffing.  However, if you are going to make a present to your child, then the best contender for this place is just Nokia Lumiya 430. </p>
