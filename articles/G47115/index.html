Now only a few hundred local citizens live here, and all other people are numerous visitors who want to sunbathe on the beaches, swim in the sea and get acquainted with the culture and attractions of Greece. </p><p>  Now about the hotel itself.  He is not young, the complex was built in 1970.  But a complete update was carried out recently, in 2015.  So the hotel is modern, with comfortable rooms decorated in a pleasant style.  By the way, until September 1, 2012, this complex was called PGS Steps of Lindos Village 5 *. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The hotel is located on a hill from which you can see stunning panoramic views of local beauty.

The territory can be called closed (which it is, in fact), because the guests are not worried about the noise of discos or the rumble coming from the streets.  Another advantage of the hotel complex.  It is not surprising that lovers of silence and peaceful relaxation come here. </p>

    <h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  People who have already rested here give some advice to those who are just about to come to this wonderful hotel.  First of all, you should definitely take sun protection products with you.  And these are not only sunblock creams and ointments, but also hats.  If a person goes here in the summer, then he will need these devices.  Although everything can be bought at the minimarket of the hotel.  Fortunately, the choice is not bad there. </p><p>  And also, if you want not only to swim and sunbathe, but also to explore local attractions, you should use the car rental offered by the hotel.  Renting a car is a more economical way, unlike a taxi.  Nearby there are a huge number of attractions, and it is nice to explore them by personal transport. </p><p>  And by the way, if you want perfect silence in the apartment, reviews recommend booking a room on the south side. </p><p>  And you do not need to take any extra equipment with you on vacation.  There are towels in the rooms, and separate ones are provided by the pool, specially to be wiped off after bathing.  Hygiene items are also regularly replenished.  If something is required, you can simply ask for it at the reception.  Try to help. </p><p>  In general, if you need rest in a quiet, calm hotel with a decent level of service, you should go here and experience all of the above on yourself. </p>
