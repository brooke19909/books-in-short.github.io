Even 10-15 years ago, almost no one knew about them in the post-Soviet space.  It should be noted right away that these devices are very useful.  They help eliminate cough and not get a cold.  It is especially important to use them in the winter, when heating appliances work.  The humidifier Polaris PUH 2204 is very interesting. Reviews about it are mostly positive.  Consider all the main features of the product, its advantages and disadvantages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.istockphoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ultrasonic humidifier Polaris PUH 2204 reviews" class="if uuid-3146579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/3146579.jpg"></div><h2>  What is a humidifier </h2><p>  This is a special device that is designed to maintain an optimal level of humidity in the room.  The fact is that with the operation of heating devices in the room, humidity decreases.  This negatively affects the indoor microclimate.  People have dry throat from dry air, runny nose and other symptoms of various respiratory diseases.  To eliminate such discomfort, an air humidifier was invented.  There are several types of such devices: </p><ul><li>  Ultrasonic  They use ultrasonic vibrations to spray water and can bring humidity in the apartment to a state of fog.  These devices are the most efficient and economical.  But they have certain requirements for water quality.  With such humidifiers, you must use distilled water. </li><li>  Steam.  These devices work on the principle of an electric kettle.  They bring the water to a boil in their tank and humidify the air with steam.  Such devices have many shortcomings.  For example, they consume a lot of electricity.  Therefore, it is very expensive to use them at home.  Plain tap water is not suitable for them either. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="learn.compactappliance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Humidifier Polaris PUH 2204 manual" class="if uuid-3145411" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3145411.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Nozzle.  High-pressure humidifiers with which water is supplied through nozzles.  So the smallest drops are formed.  These models have one significant minus: all microorganisms, bacteria and impurities that were in the water end up in the air.  Therefore, it is difficult to call such hydration.  To avoid the entry of pathogenic microorganisms into the indoor environment, distilled water must be used in nozzle humidifiers. </li><li>  Sinks of air.  Here the principle is completely different.  Air is fed into the apparatus, where it is captured by special plates and immersed in water.  At the exit, it is already completely cleaned and moisturized.  What is bad about this device?  It has one drawback: you need to change water often.  Use better distilled. </li></ul><p>  The Polaris PUH 2204 ultrasonic humidifier, the reviews of which we will soon analyze, belongs to the first category of devices and boasts its versatility.  Below we consider all its features. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="shop.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ultrasonic Humidifier Polaris PUH 2204" class="if uuid-3145401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3145401.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit about Polaris </h2><p>  It was founded in 1992 by two students of the Moscow Aviation Institute.  It was originally planned to produce fourth-generation televisions.  A year later, the first models were created, but at the production facilities of Philips.  Soon, Polaris mastered the production of refrigerators, microwave ovens, radiators, fans, juicers, blenders and other household appliances.  Since that time, the expansion of the company began.  Its leaders also mastered the sale of well-known brands in the domestic market.  Things went well in both directions. </p><p>  The company began producing climate equipment in the 2000s.  Then in the country began a real "boom" of air conditioners.  Technique "Polaris" was incredibly popular.  Products from promoted brands were expensive, and Polaris offered exactly the same devices at affordable prices.  Among other climatic equipment, a prominent place was taken by an ultrasonic humidifier Polaris PUH 2204. Now we will consider the reviews of those who have already managed to purchase this device and saw it working. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": kukla_v_sinem, "><img itemprop="image" alt="The internal device of a Polaris PUH 2204 humidifier" class="if uuid-3146584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/3146584.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive user feedback on device design </h2><p>  Appearance is the first thing an average buyer pays attention to.  For many, it is very important how the purchase will look in the interior of an apartment or house.  What is the design of the Polaris PUH 2204 humidifier?  User reviews say that the device looks great.  It fits perfectly into any interior.  Its shape is quite original, which allows you to place it anywhere.  It will look interesting everywhere.

Also, the owners of this miracle are outraged by the design of the tank.  Pouring water into it is required by weight, since there is no way to put it in the sink.  This is probably the most significant drawback of this model.  Another drawback associated with the design and construction - too bright LED.  At night, he is able to illuminate almost the entire room.  For many people, this creates discomfort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": kukla_v_sinem, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Humidifier Polaris PUH 2204" class="if uuid-3146599" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/3146599.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive user feedback on the operation of the device </h2><p>  Now let's see what customers say about the operation of the Polaris PUH 2204 humidifier. The feedback from the owners of this product is positive in this regard.  There are almost no negative ones.  Almost all users note that after buying and installing this particular humidifier it became much better to breathe.

In general, buyers are satisfied with such an acquisition.  For little money, the user receives a quality product that positively affects the health of everyone who lives in the apartment. </p><h2>  Negative user reviews on the operation of the device </h2><p>  However, there are those who write about the shortcomings of the apparatus.  Many buyers claim that they came across a defective copy of Polaris PUH 2204. Complaints arise most often about a fan.  People write that in a month he begins to just "howl", and lubrication does not help.  Also, often users complain that some instances of the device work a day or two, and then break.  Repairing them is already impossible or very difficult.  Of course, Polaris devices have a certain percentage of defects.  If during the operation there was no violation of the rules reported by the instruction, the device can be replaced (as indicated in the warranty card).  However, such situations leave an unpleasant aftertaste. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": NeProstoTak, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Open and closed lid on the humidifier tank" class="if uuid-3146644" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/3146644.jpg"></div><h2>  User feedback on the scope of delivery </h2><p>  What is included in the Polaris PUH 2204 humidifier kit?  Instructions, a couple of booklets, a warranty card and the device itself.  Buyers are not very happy with this kit.  They all note that the manufacturer could put in a box and a pair of replaceable filters.  A lot of negative reviews about the instructions themselves.  Otherwise, buyers have no complaints about picking.  Everything else suits them. </p><h2>  Sums up </h2><p>  Should I buy a Polaris PUH 2204 humidifier?  Reviews about this device are mostly positive.  It is recommended to friends and acquaintances by 83% of respondents.  In most reviews, users note a stylish design, quiet operation of the device, excellent humidification in the room, which has a beneficial effect on health, low price.  In Moscow, this device can be purchased for only 2000 rubles.  Some dealers offer it more expensive, increasing the cost due to all kinds of markups. </p><p>  To the advantages of the model, buyers also attribute the fact that the humidity in the room with closed windows and windows is increasing very quickly.  It must be borne in mind that the air temperature in the room decreases by 1-2 degrees.  Another advantage - the device does not emit the smell of plastic or any other.  This device is reliable and comfortable. </p><p>  Among the minuses of the model, many attribute a very uncomfortable gulf of water to the tank.  Not everyone can hold it on weight and at the same time fill it with water.  In addition, the tank with the manufacturer's 3.5 liter capacity holds only 3 liters.  This is enough for about 9-10 hours of work. </p><p>  Buyers warn that only distilled water should be used.  If you fill in any other, soon on the furniture and other surfaces a coating of those impurities that are contained in the water will form. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mediapark.uz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Humidifier Polaris PUH 2204 reviews" class="if uuid-3145398" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/3145398.jpg"></div><p>  Many users note that the control panel on the device is touch-sensitive.  It is enough to bring a finger, and the system changes the operating mode.  There are 3 of them: weak, medium and strong.  However, there is no sound signal on the panel that the water in the tank has run out.  If this happens, the button color changes from blue-green to red.  That is, you have to follow this, which not everyone likes.  The sound signal is much more convenient, but it is not provided for in the design. </p><p>  The respondents say that the humidifier does not turn off automatically when there is no more water in the tank.  This can lead to the failure of the device.  Based on this feature, the absence of an audio signal is a very significant drawback. </p><p>  However, the small price of the device outweighs all the disadvantages.  In general, people are happy with their acquisition. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We examined all the features of the Polaris PUH 2204 humidifier. This device belongs to the budget class and works well.  This model refers to ultrasonic devices and can increase the level of humidity in the room to a state of fog.  It is necessary to purchase it for those people whose humidity in the apartment is below normal. </p>
