For a long time, this mobile operator in Russia has been acting as a company offering many job vacancies.  And all this regardless of your age or status.  So it‚Äôs worth paying attention to our current employer.  But do you really need to apply for a resume, get a job, and also get started?  Maybe it's better not to do that? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="staff pay reviews" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1103385.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Activities </h2><p>  <span>Working at MTS</span> receives good reviews from employees about the company's activities.  And from visitors too.  After all, this company is nothing more than a mobile operator.  Services are provided for both telephones and computers.  For example, it is here that you can buy equipment for the Internet, as well as connect to the World Wide Web. </p><p>  In truth, the services of MTS are diverse.  And they only get good reviews.  But what about the work inside the company?  Maybe it's better to stay away from this employer?  Or is he really able to help build a career? </p><h2>  For almost everyone </h2><p>  Perhaps this is the way it is.  MTS employees give very positive feedback on the activities of the company in terms of age for employment.  After all, this mobile operator offers jobs and part-time jobs for everyone.  Even for teenagers and schoolchildren.  This means that this is a great way to start making money on your own. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="work in mts employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1103386.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The question is a bit different.  Is it worth it?  What vacancies are in demand?  How do they pay labor?  Is there a career opportunity?  Or is it just a mobile operator that lures potential employees with loud promises, and then does not pay any money at all?  Let's figure it all out. </p><h2>  Jobs </h2><p>  So, work at MTS often gets positive feedback from employees.  And not for the fact that even a student is able to find a job.  It is about the proposed vacancies.  In this company you are sure to find something to your liking. </p><p>  Students and schoolchildren are most often recruited as sales managers at <span>stalls</span> in your city.  In addition, the option of working as a promoter is being considered.  But representatives of an older age are allowed to work as a sales manager, and as a consultant, and as a telephone operator, and as a distributor of products in the city.  In general, the alternatives are more than enough.  All this, of course, pleases.  You do not have to carry heavy loads or work physically.  This approach allows employees to give all the best to their positions at 100%.  So in this regard, there are no complaints against the corporation. </p><h2>  Job interview </h2><p>  In addition to a rather loyal list of vacancies, MTS offers to be interviewed for employment.  And this point in most cases plays an important role.  Many employees note that the interview at MTS is very fast and comfortable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="company mts" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1103387.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You will either be invited to the office of the company, or offered to speak with a senior manager directly in the store (salon).  Fill out the questionnaire, answer a few simple questions, announce your desire to find a job, and that‚Äôs all, the problems are solved.  Next, they will tell you about working conditions, payment and discuss with you the desired point of work.  All that will have to be done afterwards is to wait until the employer calls back and informs you whether you are suitable for the position or not.  In most cases, no one is denied.  And MTS employees are happy about this.  Everyone will have the opportunity to <span>show their</span> best side. </p><h2>  Schedule </h2><p>  In terms of work schedule, MTS is also not as notorious as some competitors.  After all, the mobile operator takes into account the fact that he often recruits schoolchildren and students.  In addition, the features of the posted vacancies will also be taken into account. </p><p>  Nevertheless, often you will be offered either shift work, or combination, or on a clear schedule.  For example, 1/1, 2/2, 3/2, 5/2.  You will have to talk about this with the employer in person.  The working hours of many employees are also pleasing.  Usually it does not exceed 8 hours.  For students - no more than 4 hours a day.  Thus, you should not think that you will be forced to work from dawn to dawn.  Although sometimes this kind of practice is available.  About it, MTS employees leave reviews in some cases.  But such a phenomenon rarely occurs.  Therefore, all dissatisfaction is minimized. </p><h2>  Earning </h2><p>  MTS employees often emphasize the fact that earnings in the company are unstable.  Therefore, in this sense, the reviews can be called ambiguous.  In different regions, the attitude to earnings in MTS is diverse. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="employees of the mts company" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1103388.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The salary is most often claimed.  He is too small.  Sometimes the sales manager of goods or services receives about 5-10 thousand rubles.  Poor earnings, which are very difficult to live in the modern world.  But a company called MTS promises you good payments of allowances and all kinds of bonuses. </p><p>  In this sense, there are fewer complaints.  But only if you do not distribute SIM cards and MTS services.  Many claim that in this case you will receive a salary of 160-200 rubles per shift, and as a premium and premiums - a percentage of sales.  By the way, this is a very common phenomenon that many workers do not like.  For this feature, MTS employees do not leave the best reviews about their employer. </p><p>  Why?  There are times when you can‚Äôt sell anything.  So, you have to rely only on salary payments.  He, as we have seen, is not so tall that he was enough to live. </p><h2>  Social guarantees </h2><p>  A social package is far from the last moment to which you should pay attention when applying for a job.  And in our case, work at MTS receives average reviews from employees in this area.  Not the best, but not terrible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS employees Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1103389.jpg"></div>

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

    <p>  The fact is that during the interview you will be promised a full social package.  In practice, it is partially provided.  Often you do not have to rely on paid sick leave, as well as maternity leave.  But just to rest (well-deserved, of course) and to the session they will let you go without problems.  And they will not impose a fine, as is done in most cases.  Undoubtedly, this approach pleases. </p><p>  With a lunch break, things get a little trickier.  For example, it is worth considering that it is not in MTS as such.  That is, if you have a free minute, you can have a bite.  Not?  Then work on.  There are days when you can not interrupt even for a minute.  And sometimes it turns out that you can sit and have dinner at least a day - no one will bother you.  But the absence of a lunch break is not such a problem for a modern employee.  And therefore, do not give up employment because of him. </p><h2>  Relationship </h2><p>  At MTS, employees (Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities) very often note that more or less normal relations develop with the employer.  This is not to say that you will always be treated with respect and fairness.  In Russia, this phenomenon is extremely rare.  Especially if you are an ordinary employee.  But you are unlikely to be rude and humiliate during the workflow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS company services" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1103390.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For major holidays (New Year, for example), MTS decided to organize corporate parties.  And they are going to workers of all statuses.  Even a guide.  In this regard, MTS employees leave reviews about the company very positive.  Everyone will have the opportunity to communicate in an informal setting, then to work normally with each other. </p><p>  Thus, as you see, MTS is far from the worst employer.  Yes, millions cannot be earned here.  But to start a career, this is a good place.  Students often turn to a given mobile operator to earn extra money. </p>
