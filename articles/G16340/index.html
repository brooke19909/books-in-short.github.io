These delicacies are loved by adults and children.  They are different: honey, with cinnamon, mint, chocolate and, of course, Tula.  Production technology remains the same.  Gingerbread is considered a Russian confectionery, part of the country's cultural heritage.  Many are interested: how did this treat come about? </p><div class="photo" data-original="gesture.ru.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gingerbread origin story" class="if uuid-3231713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3231713.jpg"></div><h2>  Where did the gingerbreads come from in Russia? </h2><p>  History does not answer this question.  It is impossible to say for sure, but there is a legend that the Vikings brought them to us.  They supposedly taught the Slavs how to cook delicious honey cakes, which later acquired a form familiar to every resident of Russia.  Initially, the dough for them was prepared from rye flour and honey, which is baked?  received honey bread. </p><p>  But this version is not confirmed by anything.  Slavic tribes living in Russia grew rye and engaged in storing - collecting honey from wild bees.  Therefore, we can assume that this delicacy was not imported from somewhere.  From ancient times it was prepared by the ancestors of the Russian people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.privet-russia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the history of gingerbread in Russia" class="if uuid-3231720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3231720.jpg"></div><h2>  Gingerbread cookies in Russia </h2><p>  According to the official history of origin, gingerbread cookies appeared on the territory of Russia in the 9th century.  The preparation recipe included: rye flour, honey and wild berry juice.  The most significant ingredient in quantity was honey; it amounted to almost half of the total volume.  Each city had its own special recipe.  Over time, various useful herbs began to be added to the gingerbread cookies.  They were considered healing.  After the bath and with hot tea, they really benefited. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The history of the appearance of gingerbread in Russia includes the period of import of exotic spices from India and the East, they began to be added to the dough.  Here, the bakers, who were called gingerbread at the time, had a large field for choice.  They added spices that are hard to imagine today in sweet pastries.  It was dill, black pepper, caraway seeds.  It is more understandable for a modern person to add anise, vanilla, cinnamon, lemon, mint, cloves or ginger to this confectionery.  All of these ingredients were also added to the dough. </p><div class="photo" data-original="evu67.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gingerbread story" class="if uuid-3231722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3231722.jpg"></div><h2>  The origin of the word "gingerbread" </h2><p>  In all likelihood, this confectionery got its name from the word ‚Äúspice‚Äù, which came from the old Russian ‚Äúpeppery‚Äù - ‚Äúpepper‚Äù.
