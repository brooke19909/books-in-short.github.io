Smart watch with heart rate and pressure sensor</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you want to lose weight, gain muscle mass or simply lead a healthy lifestyle and exercise, then the topic of heart rate monitors will probably be of interest to you.  In the distant 80s, the first such devices for domestic use began to appear. </p><p>  And since then, the heart rate sensor has become an integral attribute of athletes.  Gadgets of this plan allow you to track your heart rate, which is very important to achieve maximum effectiveness in training. </p><p>  Today's market offers a huge assortment of various heart rate meters.  Moreover, they all differ in functionality, fixation area, form factor and other characteristics.  And if experienced users are still somehow guided in all this variety, then newcomers shrug their hands and rely on the feedback of friends, as well as a consultant in the store. </p><p>  Well, if the latter comes across sensible and, as they say, in the subject.  Otherwise, you risk buying far from the most useful heart rate sensor for you.  So there are a lot of questions.  We will try to answer them in our article. </p><p>  So, we will figure out how to choose a heart rate sensor, what to pay special attention to and how not to miscalculate with a purchase.  We also denote the most popular and intelligent devices of different price categories.  All the gadgets described below can be purchased both offline and in online stores, so there should not be any serious problems with testing. </p><h2>  Difficulty choosing </h2><p>  To begin with, we will determine what a sports heart rate monitor is and why it is needed.  Such devices are necessary to track the frequency of contraction of the heart muscle, as well as to fix the maximum load on the body.  All this helps the athlete during training to properly respond to the data and make appropriate adjustments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="thebestrunningshoes.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sports heart rate monitor" class="if uuid-2870244" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2870244.jpg"></div><p>  Each sport or physical activity has some kind of optimal heart rate limits.  To achieve your goals and to avoid causing harm to your health, it is very important to monitor these limits and ensure that the pulse remains within the designated limits.  A similar characteristic is called the target zone. </p><h2>  Target Zones </h2><p>  Such zones are usually calculated according to the Martti Carvonen method.  The formula is very simple: MChS (maximum heart rate) = 220 - age.  That is, for example, if you are 20 years old, then the critical parameter for you will be 200 reduction / min.  (220 - 20), and if 40 years old, then, respectively, - 180 (220 - 40). </p><p>  Almost all sports heart rate monitors work in real time and notify the user of critical zones.  Options are customizable based on your age and specific exercises. </p><p>  Target areas (% of MES): </p><ul><li>  50-60% - light loads: walking at a fast pace, warming up, etc. </li><li>  70-80% - it is considered a fitness zone, comparable to jogging and climbing stairs; </li><li>  80-90% - sports dancing, aerobics: burning not only fats, but also carbohydrates; </li><li>  90-95% - skating, skiing, biking and similar active sports; </li><li>  more than 95% - area only for professional athletes: maximum and dangerous load. </li></ul><p>  It is for the determination of such zones that a pulse sensor is needed.  With him, training is much more effective, and most importantly - safer for the athlete. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Types of heart rate monitors </h2><p>  Today, there are two types of heart rate sensors - remote and built-in.  In the first case, we have a device that receives information about heart rate and sends it to another gadget for further processing.  It can be a smartphone, bracelet or personal computer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="simplifaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heart rate sensor on hand" class="if uuid-2870243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2870243.jpg"></div><p>  Types of devices with an external sensor: </p><ul><li>  under the earlobe; </li><li>  on the finger; </li><li>  earphone; </li><li>  on the forearm; </li><li>  breastplate. </li></ul><p>  The most common and most effective option is a chest pulse sensor.  Regardless of the environment, it allows you to get the most accurate results.  And if earlier such decisions were complained of by a constantly slipping strap, today designers use special materials that can reliably hold the sensor even with heavy sweating. </p><h2>  Sensor Features </h2><p>  A good half of heart rate sensors transmit analog and / or digital signals to the hand, wrist, forearm, or chest.  This allows them to work in tandem with more familiar gadgets like smartphones or smart watches.  As a wireless protocol, either bluetooth or ANT + technology is used.  The latter is more economical and supports a much wider range of mobile and specific devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Devices with a built-in heart rate monitor themselves measure heart rate and process the data themselves.  For active and frequent training, this solution is not the best option.  Such devices are more suitable for single measurements, although there are exceptions.  This group includes special rings and fitness bracelets. </p><h2>  The best heart rate monitors </h2><p>  Next, we consider the most popular heart rate monitors, which are distinguished by their quality component, work efficiency and a large number of flattering reviews from users. </p><h2>  Polar H10 </h2><p>  The brand can be called a pioneer in this area.  The very first Polar heart rate sensor appeared more than 30 years ago.  Today, the company offers a rich assortment of various sensors for both professional athletes and amateurs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.polar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heart rate sensor polar" class="if uuid-2870248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2870248.jpg"></div><p>  The H10 model is a chest version where the sensor is attached to the body using an elastic tape made of modern materials.  The latter just does not allow the device to slip, and a competent fastener reliably holds it. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the model </h2><p>  The model weighs only 60 grams and does not feel like some kind of foreign body.  The sensor is designed for autonomous operation within 400 hours on one battery at a temperature of -10 ... + 50 ¬∞ .  In addition, reliable protection allows you to dive with a heart rate monitor to a depth of 30 meters. </p><p>  The model does not have any screen, therefore, it transfers all the data to third-party devices - a smartphone (Android / iOS) or a fitness bracelet.  It is also worth mentioning the possibility of working in tandem with GoPro cameras.  The latter reflect all the data on the pulse, which makes shooting even more naturalistic and spectacular. </p><p>  Estimated cost of the heart rate monitor is about 6500 rubles. </p><h2>  Garmin hrm tri </h2><p>  Garmin brand knows a lot about sports gadgets and offers users a modern and effective tool for measuring heart rate - Garmin Hrm Tri.  The model is attached to the chest by a convenient strap.  The latter is made of high-tech materials and does not slip even with the most intense workouts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heart rate meter" class="if uuid-2870246" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2870246.jpg"></div><p>  The company recommends using the device with any smart watch with a heart rate and pressure sensor from Garmin.  Then the model fully reveals its capabilities and makes training as effective as possible.  Data transfer occurs through ANT + technology, so that the device will behave perfectly paired with other gadgets that support this protocol. </p><p>  In addition to heart rate, the model can measure the vertical vibration of the body and the frequency of steps.  The capabilities of the proprietary application are very wide and are suitable for almost all sports areas - from running to swimming.  Moreover, the data obtained can be shared with like-minded people in real time. </p><p>  The approximate price of a heart rate monitor is about 10,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Sigma PC 15.11 </h2><p>  Here we have a set of watches and a chest strap with a sensor.  Both accessories are waterproof, so you can safely go swimming with them.  All data from the sensor about the current heart rate is transmitted to the watch using analog technology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trisportowy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heart rate watch" class="if uuid-2870249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2870249.jpg"></div><p>  The device records the normal, average and maximum heart rate and immediately displays the received information on the watch dial.  If necessary, you can configure a sound alert when the heart rate has exceeded or, conversely, has dropped below normal. </p><p>  The model copes with the gradation of target zones and simultaneously counts the steps taken, circles and calories burned.  There is also a display of familiar watches - time, date and stopwatch.  The heart rate monitor has a sensible backlight, so there will be no problems reading the information on evening runs. </p><p>  Estimated cost of the model is about 5000 rubles. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi Band 2 </h2><p>  Xiaomi Mi Band 2 fitness bracelet from a well-known Chinese brand is enviable among domestic consumers.  The model has an optical heart rate monitor and, in addition to measuring heart rate, offers a lot of related functionality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kwisko.si" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fitness bracelet xiaomi mi band 2" class="if uuid-2870251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2870251.jpg"></div><p>  The Xiaomi Mi Band 2 fitness bracelet will calculate the distance to the point, calories burned, steps taken, as well as track your sleep and wake you up in time if necessary.  The model is fully revealed, working in tandem with a smartphone, especially if the latter is also a Xiaomi product. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The watch with a heart rate sensor received a convenient and understandable OLED screen, where control is via a sensor.  The manufacturer claims about 20 days of battery life, but with the active use of the battery lasts a maximum of a couple of weeks.  But this is a very good result. </p><p>  The watch case is made of polycarbonate, and the strap is made of thermoplastic silicone vulcanizate.  The protection class of the device meets the IP67 certificate, so the model is not afraid of rain or dirt and works at a temperature of -20 to +70 degrees.  The Bluetooth protocol version 4 is responsible for wireless communication.  Owners speak very warmly about this device, especially non-professional athletes and amateurs. </p><p>  The approximate price of a heart rate monitor is about 1,500 rubles. </p><h2>  Wahoo Fitness TICKR X </h2><p>  The Wahoo Fitness TICKR X chest heart rate monitor turned out to be balanced in all respects.  The sensing sensor is mounted on a strap and analyzes the pulse, taking into account the peculiarities of movement.  The corresponding conclusions not only about the intensity, but also about the correctness of the training will be transmitted both through the usual bluetooth protocol, and through the more advanced ANT +. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.clevertraining.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="chest heart rate monitor" class="if uuid-2870245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2870245.jpg"></div><p>  The device not only shows the pulse, but also counts the calories burned, and also controls the duration of the workouts.  The sensor is provided with its own memory, but with much greater efficiency it works in tandem with a smartphone.  The manufacturer took care of a proprietary application where you can choose the individual load for each athlete. </p><p>  Also worth noting is the good protective performance of the model.  The device is not afraid of dust, dirt and moisture, but you can dive with it to a depth of no more than one and a half meters.  So for swimmers this is not the best option. </p><p>  Estimated cost of the heart rate monitor is about 4,500 rubles. </p><h2>  Nexx HRM-02 </h2><p>  This is a budget option, but this does not make it bad.  This model is perfect for those who are just starting to conquer sports peaks and strive to lead a healthy lifestyle.  There is a minimum of opportunities, but newcomers do not need more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yandex.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heart rate sensor" class="if uuid-2870247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2870247.jpg"></div><p>  The device is attached to the chest with a convenient and durable strap, but for full-fledged work, it will need the help of a smartphone running on the Android platform.  The model works great with a good half of specialized fitness applications, and there were no critical shortcomings during use. </p><p>  The only thing worth clarifying is that the gadget does not work correctly with mobile equipment from Samsung, especially with the version of the Android 5.1 platform.  The manufacturer does not explain what this is connected with, but a similar problem is "cured" by the smartphone firmware.  Nevertheless, athletes and owners of Samsung devices must definitely bear this in mind. </p><p>  The approximate price of the model is about 1,500 rubles. </p><h2>  Ozaki O! Fitness Fatburn </h2><p>  Another very affordable option for beginners and amateurs.  The model is made in China, but judging by the reviews, the build quality is at a very decent level.  The device transmits data via the bluetooth protocol and will be most effective when paired with a smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imediastores.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ozaki O! Fitness Fatburn" class="if uuid-2870250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2870250.jpg"></div><p>  The model, in addition to monitoring the pulse, can take steps, monitor calories burned and notify the user of critical changes when the heart rate becomes high or, conversely, low.  Actually, more is not required for a beginner. </p><p>  One of the notable features of the heart rate monitor is its voice assistant.  The manufacturer has developed a proprietary application for the gadget, which allows you to acquire a virtual, but your own fitness instructor.  After a set of input data, the assistant will offer the best training plan for you. </p><p>  The only critical minus that consumers often complain about is the decent weight of the device - 140 grams.  Users with a modest build sometimes have a feeling of discomfort during class.  But you can close your eyes to this by looking at the cost of the device. </p><p>  Estimated cost of the model is about 1000 rubles. </p>
