The size of the island is relatively small.  Its area is less than 6000 km¬≤.  The nature here is amazing.  On the territory you can find many types of rare plants.  Banana and fig groves, huge centuries-old trees, tropical jungle - all here are extraordinary.  There are a lot of monkeys in Bali.  Often you can see them in human settlements.  Some locals tamed them and keep them as pets.  Balinese are a very friendly people.  They honor their traditions and customs, try to strictly abide by them.  This should be considered for tourists visiting this resort.  Respect for the local order is one of the main conditions for staying on the island.

    <h2>  Climate in Bali </h2><p>  This region has an equatorial <span>monsoon climate</span> .  And this means that the change of seasons is not very noticeable here.  Most of the time in Bali is very hot.  Air temperature often exceeds +30 Àö, and water - +26 Àö.  In lowlands and highlands it can be slightly cooler.  But on the coast and in the resort area, as a rule, it is warm.  The nature of the weather is measured only by the amount of precipitation.  From April to October it is dry and sunny.  From November to April, showers pour.  But this is only a conditional division.  Indeed, in the summer long rains can suddenly suddenly begin, and in winter, warm and sunny weather can be established. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bali season for months </h2>

In March, as a rule, it rains heavily.  But it is very hot here.  High humidity can create some difficulties for individual tourists.  But in April, the season in Bali for all travelers can be considered open.  From May, sunny and dry weather sets in.  The maximum air temperature often exceeds 32 ¬∞ C.  Summer is the most favorable time of the year for any <span>type of vacation.</span>  The banks are blowing fresh breeze.  Therefore, especially strong heat is not felt.  Water temperature is + 27 +.  July and August are very dry.  There is practically no rain.  Many tourists consider this period the best for visiting this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãIndonesia.  Breathes easily.  Humidity is minimal.  Not very hot.  In September, it is also clear and dry.  The swimming season is in full swing.  But at the end of September, the north wind intensifies.  In October, tourists on the coast become less and less.  The reason is the increasing downpours.  At this time, it becomes unbearably hot here.  And high humidity complements the list of disadvantages of this season.  The ocean is getting restless.  Since the beginning of December, the Balinese do not meet winter, but the so-called summer.  This is the time of the lush growth of tropical plants, thunderstorm 3-hour showers and heat.  It is so humid that some houses are covered with moss.  Water in the ocean is like <span>fresh milk.</span>  But swimming in the winter in Bali will be difficult.  A strong wind rises, and with it high waves.  Such weather is good only for surfers.

This is the so-called dry season and it is time for heavy rains on the island.  What are they characterized by?  The rainy season in Bali is usually from November to March.  Showers here are short-lived and they go mainly at night.  By morning, often everything dries up.  After all, it is very hot here.  However, eyewitnesses say that the rainiest months in this area are January and February.  Rainfall can be very long during this time.  Often they go all day.  But the prices for permits during this period fall sharply, which cannot but please our compatriots.  Thus, in the rainy season in Bali, you can significantly save on vacation.  Many tourists come here in December-January to spend New Year holidays here.

    <h2>  Dry season in bali </h2><p>  When is the best time to relax in this region?  Of course in the summer.  The dry season in Bali is characterized by minimal rainfall and less hot weather.  It lasts about six months: from June to October.  This is the most favorable time to visit this island.  A truly unforgettable vacation in Bali can be.

Plus, the dry season is not only in the absence of rain, but also a strong gusty wind, which is important for surfing.  In addition, the period from June to October is the time for many national holidays on the Indonesian island. </p><h2>  Local holidays and festivals </h2>

Of course in Bali.  The holiday season is open year-round.  Thousands of surfers from around the world seek to visit the island.  The only thing you need to pay attention to the tourist who wants to "tame" the rapid wave is that in some period of time some places intended for this sport may be unsuitable.  For example, during the rainy season, surfpots in the south-west of the island often do not function due to low demand from the population and tourists.  And in itself this time is not the best period for gliding along the waves.  In the rainy season in Bali, the beaches become dirty and the waves of the ocean are muddy.  Great places for surfing during this period: Keramas, Serangan, Lembeng, Padang Galak and others.  In the dry season, it is better to visit spots on the southwest coast, those that did not work in winter.

    <h2>  Beach season </h2><p>  In Bali, you can find many magnificent sandy beaches of all shades: from golden and white to dark brown (volcanic origin).  The water here is always warm.  Its average temperature is +26 ... + 28 ¬∞ C.  Holidays in Bali in May, perhaps, can be considered one of the most comfortable weather conditions.  But lovers to lie on a sunny beach in a stormy period should not go here.  Indeed, in addition to heavy rains at this time, severe storms are not rare on the coast.  The water in the ocean therefore becomes muddy, "dirty."  Algae and garbage nails to the shores.  Speaking of swimming here, it is worth mentioning such a thing as the <span>ebbs and flows.</span>  They occur every day throughout the year, only at different times.  Throughout the summer, the weather on the island is beautiful.  Holidays in Bali in August will delight you with gentle warm waves, bright sunshine and a light refreshing breeze. </p><h2>  Best time for excursions </h2>

A 2-week vacation in Bali is not enough to inspect all of them.  The holiday season lasts all year.  But, as a rule, tourists prefer the summer months of the dry season for excursions.  Many of them go on a trip to the island in late spring or early autumn, when it is not so hot here.  And for those who can‚Äôt tolerate the heat, you can recommend a train inland.  There, where hectares of rice terraces are located.  It is always fresh and cool.
