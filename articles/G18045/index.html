At first, the power of the emitters was reduced, but this led to a decrease in brightness.  And the saving was not too big, in comparison with modern lighting devices.  Then fluorescent lamps, CFLs were created.  And now, engineers have achieved maximum savings.  However, no loss of brightness occurred.  We are talking about LED lights, the device, features, advantages and disadvantages of which will be discussed in the article. </p><h2>  LED Downlights: General Information </h2><p>  Such devices differ from their predecessors in lower power consumption at the same brightness and durability.  The scope of their application is very extensive.  They are used as street, industrial and domestic lighting, in the automotive industry, medicine and even crop production.  The use of LEDs in flashlights made it possible to use them much longer without replacing the power element, and modern high-brightness chips left a bulb with an incandescent thread far behind.  As for the luminaires, today products of various types and sizes are produced, which can replace obsolete analogs without unnecessary labor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="digitalnenovinky.sk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="led fixtures armstrong device" class="if uuid-3064247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3064247.jpg"></div><h2>  What types of similar devices exist? </h2><p>  From the huge range of fixtures offered by the manufacturer on the Russian market, there are 4 main types: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Built-in devices installed in suspended and suspended ceilings. </li><li>  Wall-mounted version for mounting on a vertical surface.  Such can be used on the ceiling as overhead. </li><li>  Linear - LED strip can be attributed to them.  This species is used as an extra. </li><li>  <span>Rechargeable LED lights</span> with or without charger.  They are most often used to indicate emergency, fire exits, evacuation directions. </li></ul><p>  Each of these types can be used for various purposes - for indoor, local, emergency or street lighting. </p><h2>  Indoor and local lighting: device features </h2><p>  It must be remembered that the power LEDs are selected in relation to emitters with an incandescent filament of 1: 8.  This means that where a conventional 80 W lamp was enough, a 10 W LED device will be quite enough.  LED emitters have the same socles, which means that all you need to do when replacing simple ones is to turn out the old ones and screw in the new ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="aligre.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED ceiling fixture" class="if uuid-3064233" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3064233.jpg"></div><p>  As local lighting, an ideal option would be to use LED strips or spots, which are enough to direct to a specific area.  Thus, it is possible to perform zoning of the room.  Often local lighting is provided by tabletop appliances.  In this case, just screw the LED lamp with a matte diffuser into them.  It will make the flow softer, which means it will not blind. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  LED Ceiling Lights: Design and Function </h2><p>  Such devices are often used for office premises.  Particularly widespread are lamps that are mounted on Armstrong suspended ceilings.  Previously, their place was occupied by luminescent devices, however, LED devices were much more economical.  The light from them is not so irritating to the eyes, which is important for people spending all day at the workplace. </p><p>  <span>LED Ceiling</span> Lights 600x600 - LED devices that are ideal for suspended ceilings.  Their installation is quite simple.  No fastening is required here.  All that is needed is to hold the lamp diagonally in the square opening of the suspended ceiling, and then, having set it straight, lower it to the seat.  It is more convenient to connect such devices through special WAGO terminal blocks (self-clamping or mechanical).  Installation takes place very quickly. </p><h2>  What to do with Armstrong fluorescent lamps? </h2><p>  Replacing old lighting fixtures with new ones is not always an extra cost.  Fluorescent lights should not be discounted.  Since the installation of LED ceiling lights can be called quite simple, old devices can be easily upgraded to new tubes.  In this case, you will get a very significant savings.  The algorithm of actions will be as follows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="LED Downlights Ceiling Device and Repair" class="if uuid-3064239" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3064239.jpg"></div><p>  Having turned off the power, it is necessary to dismantle the fluorescent lamp and pull out the lamps - they will no longer be needed.  It is also necessary to remove the electronic ballasts (electronic ballasts) and wires, leaving only footprints for the plinths.  The removed wires are used for switching according to the new scheme.  According to it, it should turn out that the phase is fed to one side of the tube (the contact does not matter), and zero to the other.  This is due to the fact that on the base of the LED tube, the pairs of pins inside are closed.  And they make tubes with two contacts only so that they fit the seats and look like fluorescent ones.  It turns out that the arrangement of Armstrong LED lamps can be called not even elementary, but primitive.  All the main electronics are inside the tube lamps. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Instruments for lighting cabinets, shelves and niches </h2><p>  It often happens that when you open the closet, it is impossible to discern what is deep in the shelves.  This is quite simple to fix by gluing a seat for a LED battery lamp with a charger on a double-sided tape.  With its help, you can easily find the necessary things, and it turns on with one movement of the hand.  Frequent charging is not required for such a lamp - it is enough to connect it to the network once every 3-6 months (depending on the intensity of use). </p><p>  Such fixtures are very convenient when installing them in a sideboard or even above a work surface in a kitchen.  This will allow the hostess once again not to strain her eyes, cutting meat or removing bones from the fish.  A storage room, a balcony, a dark corner of the hallway - such a device everywhere there is a place where additional lighting is needed, but there is no desire to stretch the wires, performing wiring. </p><div class="photo" data-original="guide.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED Flashlights" class="if uuid-3064245" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3064245.jpg"></div><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of LED lamps </h2><p>  Such devices, like any others, have both positive and negative qualities, but there are much fewer second ones.  Among the advantages include: </p><ul><li>  low energy consumption with a long service life (up to 50,000 hours); </li><li>  high coefficient of performance (COP), which is achieved due to low heat transfer; </li><li>  the ability to choose any color, including multi-color LED strip; </li><li>  the possibility of dimming, which allows zoning of the premises. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting the harmlessness of LEDs for the human body.  If you pay attention to fluorescent lamps, then over time they begin to pass ultraviolet through cracks in the phosphor.  In addition, their disposal as household waste is prohibited due to the content of heavy metal vapors, including mercury, in the flask.  The device of LED lamps does not provide for the use of substances harmful to the body. </p><p>  As for the shortcomings, there are only two of them: </p><ul><li>  The same LED strip requires the installation of additional equipment - an adapter, and sometimes a controller.  But to hide these devices can be difficult. </li><li>  Crystal degradation.  Over time, the luminous flux decreases.  The intensity of degradation depends on the quality of the chip itself and the power supply with which it works. <div class="photo" data-original="www.grupoblux.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED fixture" class="if uuid-3064232" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3064232.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Features of the use and repair of such devices </h2><p>  The device and the principle of operation of LED lamps imply their operation only with conventional switches.  Do not use circuit breakers equipped with neon lights.  This can lead to low light when the power is off.  In itself, this is not scary, for example, in the bathroom.  However, such a glow leads to rapid degradation of LED elements. </p><p>  Repair of ceiling devices and other types of LED lighting fixtures is carried out only when the voltage is completely removed.  It is not worth hoping that an open switch is enough.  Despite the fact that according to the PUE, a phase must pass through it, some negligent electricians do not bother with checks, breaking the neutral wire.  In addition, even if everything is done according to the rules, electric shock is quite possible.  This happens when the phase passes through the incandescent lamp to zero.  If the fitter at this time is grounded, then an electric shock is provided to him. </p><p>  A little information about the repair of such devices is in the video below. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="Xtbvh9sIHtE" data-url="https://youtu.be/Xtbvh9sIHtE" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/0/4/4/14044.jpg"></div><h2>  LED street lights and how they differ </h2><p>  The use of such devices for flashlights is quite practical, but the energy consumption in this case will be higher than that of appliances for domestic use.  The device of street LED lamps does not differ from those used in apartments.  The only important feature is the increased power.  But despite this, their use is much more profitable than the installation of arc mercury fluorescent (DRL) or arc sodium tubular (DNaT) lamps. </p><h2>  Installation and maintenance of LED lights </h2><p>  Each manufacturer gives their advice on this matter.  That is why you should not ignore the instruction manual.  Following the manufacturer's recommendations will significantly increase the life of the product.  In addition, when connecting, it is easy to make a mistake, which is excluded by following the instructions. </p><p>  All installation work should only be performed after disconnecting the introductory machine.  But even in the absence of voltage in the network, it is necessary to use only a high-quality tool with intact insulation.  Any crack on the handle of the screwdriver should cause it to refuse to work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ecplaza.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LED lamp with charger" class="if uuid-3064236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3064236.jpg"></div><p>  The starter for LED lights is not being repaired (of course, if the home master is not a professional radio technician).  Miniature SMD components are very sensitive to overheating.  And even if by some miracle it is possible to solder one of them, it will not work for more than two or three days. </p><h2>  Where to buy LED lights for the home?  Selection tips </h2><p>  It is better to buy such devices in large specialized stores, which have proven themselves on the good side.  It is better to refrain from purchasing such goods via the Internet - in this case there is no possibility of checking the goods.  Although today there are online resources operating from outlets with a good reputation, it‚Äôs not worth the risk. </p><p>  Any electrical products sold in Russia must be certified.  Therefore, do not be shy to ask the sales assistant to bring related documentation.  If he begins to bustle, and the buyer understands that there are no certificates for these products, then it is better to refrain from buying. </p><p>  Do not choose the cheapest products - such savings can be more expensive.  Low cost hints at the same quality, and in the case of electrical products this is unacceptable.  You also need to pay attention to a clear marriage: uneven coloring, dents, scratches - all this should become a reason for refusing to purchase. </p><p>  And the most important thing.  After purchase, before installation, it is imperative to audit each lamp.  Factory assembly is not human hands.  It is better to double-check everything yourself for personal peace of mind and confidence that at a certain moment someone will not be bombarded with sparks from a sudden short-circuit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pocasie.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lamp Repair" class="if uuid-3064248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3064248.jpg"></div><h2>  What you should know when buying a garden street lamp? </h2><p>  Such devices are not uncommon.  The device of an LED lamp of this type implies a solar battery installed in it, which quite often fails.  In addition to certification, verification options do not exist, therefore, acquiring such equipment, we can only hope for good luck. </p><h2>  To summarize the above </h2><p>  The device of an LED lamp cannot be called complex, however, like any other electrical equipment, such a device requires a careful attitude.  And if it is selected correctly, connected according to the instructions, and during operation, the manufacturer's recommendations are followed, its service life can easily exceed the warranty.  And this is an additional cost savings for replacement.  After all, this is exactly what a person who decides to install LED lamps achieves. </p>
