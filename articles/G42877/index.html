Possessing these simple skills, you can create real pictures without being an artist.  When you first start entering the world of cross-stitch, you need to know the basics.  They can be mastered very quickly if desired. </p><h2>  Where to begin? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thesprucecrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch bouquets of flowers patterns" class="if uuid-3169513" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3169513.jpg"></div><p>  Only a few elements form the basis of this technique: floss thread, canvas, divided into squares, a special needle and a cross stitch pattern.  Daisies or other wildflowers are a great option for beginners.  But this plot is also suitable for experienced embroiderers.  For example, the ‚ÄúBaby in daisies‚Äù cross-stitch pattern is popular among women who dream of replenishment in the family, and it may turn out to be too complicated for those who have only recently become acquainted with this type of needlework. </p><p>  Many signs are associated with different plots, and needlewomen often focus on them to fulfill their desires.  For example, according to embroidery, daisies bring peace and love to the house.  Because schemes with them are so popular.  You can immediately purchase a set with your favorite plot or choose the threads for a drawing found on the Internet yourself.  The first way is often simpler and faster.  Cross stitching a bouquet of daisies, patterns for which you can easily find, can be black and white or color.  It is advisable for beginners to choose the first option in order to get used to associate the icon and color. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ya-rukodelnitsa.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="color scheme" class="if uuid-3170509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45646/3170509.jpg"></div><h2>  The composition of the embroidery kit </h2><p>  The hoop is an optional attribute for this type of needlework, if the canvas is quite dense.  It is more important that the material has a grid of 10x10 squares of holes.  Its presence greatly facilitates the calculation and helps not to get confused in the process.  Cross-stitch kits of bouquets of flowers, patterns of which are usually colored, often contain unmarked canvas.  Therefore, before starting work, you will have to work hard and, armed with a water-soluble marker, mark yourself.  Then the center of the embroidery is marked - usually it is in the picture.  The set must have a special needle, a full set of threads of the required colors and instructions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="alitadesigns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch daisies patterns" class="if uuid-3169528" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3169528.jpg"></div><h2>  How to cross-stitch daisies </h2><p>  Mouline thread is usually sold in skeins, which consists of 6 threads.  The <span>cross-stitch pattern</span> will indicate how many additions each element of the pattern needs to be embroidered.  If the cross is depicted in one addition, then one thread should be pulled out of the skein and embroidered without folding it in half.  ‚ÄúTwo folds‚Äù means that the thread folds in half, as with regular sewing.  The cross during embroidery can be full and half.  This is usually also indicated in the diagram.  With a half-cross, only one part of it is embroidered. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cross stitch pattern baby in daisies" class="if uuid-3169519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3169519.jpg"></div><h2>  Decorative elements </h2><p>  There is also a special backstitch or backstitch stitch.  It is needed to emphasize details or to circle something.  As a replacement for a line, that is, a stroke, in the artist's drawing.  It is performed in one or two additions.  And, as the name implies, when sewing, the needle is pulled out from one point and returns back to the previous one, and not forward, as with an ordinary seam.  An additional decoration can also serve as a ‚ÄúFrench knot".  To do this, the thread is removed from the canvas, wrapped several times around the needle, after which a puncture is made in a millimeter from the exit point, and the knot is tightened.  This is a special technique that requires training, and it is rarely found in cross stitch patterns of daisies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cross baby in daisies" class="if uuid-3169517" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/3169517.jpg"></div><h2>  Work process </h2><p>  After choosing a kit and reading the instructions for embroidery, you can get to work.  It is not necessary to move from the center, but sometimes it is more convenient.  It‚Äôs easy to embroider daisies, the main thing is not to lose count and make sure that all crosses are neat and oriented in one direction.  It is important not to make knots, but to fix the threads on the wrong side, holding the tail with your finger.  Embroider, focusing on the icons and replacing the threads according to the pattern. </p><p>  When the work is finished, it must be washed in warm water, and then ironed through gauze.  Then the crosses will straighten out and no matter how complicated the pattern was - cross-stitching of daisies will look clean and neat.  After that, it's time to move on to the design.  The picture can be inserted into the frame or used to decorate pillows and other decorative products.  Daisies will look gentle and elegant in any of these options. </p>
