For example, a women's <span>t-shirt.</span>  <span>The pattern is</span> very simple to build, the fabric requires a maximum of one and a half meters, the process will take only a couple of hours, and the product will be several times cheaper than in the store. </p><h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><p>  Well-stretchable knitted fabrics, such as stretch, cooler, interlock, ribana, oil, jersey, are suitable for t-shirts.  Unlike plain weaving, knitted fabric on the slices does not crumble.  This makes it possible to sew things without an overlock, using only a straight line of the sewing machine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="T-shirt female pattern" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1895527.jpg" width="502"></div>

    <p>  For sewing, ordinary thread number 40 is suitable.  The needle for the machine should be selected according to the fabric.  So, it must be for knitwear.  The thinner the web, the finer the needle.  This will avoid breaking the threads of the web when piercing. </p><h2>  Workpiece base drawing </h2><p>  The most difficult thing in a pattern of a female T-shirt is a sleeve and armhole.  In order to properly build them, you need not be too lazy and make a blank of the paper.  There is nothing complicated in the drawing.  The pattern of women's t-shirts from knitwear is good in that it does not have a tuck in the chest.  This greatly facilitates the construction of the drawing of the workpiece. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Take measurements: chest, waist, hips, back width.  To get a pattern of a female T-shirt with an adjacent silhouette, you need to immediately take 2-3 cm from these measurements and work with the values ​​obtained.  It will also require values ​​for the length of the product and the length of the back to the waist. </p><p>  A rectangle is built on paper, where one side is the length of the product, and the other is ½ of the volume of the chest. </p><p>  A line is drawn at chest height.  She will determine the depth of the armhole. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern women’s t-shirt for beginners" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1895536.jpg" width="384"></div>

    <p>  ½ of the width of the back is measured along the obtained horizontal line and a dot is placed - this is the back zone. </p><p>  Next, calculate the zone of the armhole: ½ of the chest volume is divided into 4 and +2 cm. </p><p>  Perpendiculars are lifted from two points received.  Thus, the back zone, armholes and front are applied to the drawing. </p><p>  The armhole is vertically divided in half and drawn vertically through the entire rectangle. </p><p>  The waist line is determined according to the measurement “back height to waist”.  Below her 20 cm have a line of hips. </p><p>   of the hips and, accordingly, ¼ of the waist from both vertical sides of the rectangle are measured along the line of the hips and waist. </p><p>  Next, on the pattern of the women's T-shirt, the neck for the back and for the front is drawn from the upper corners of the rectangle.  First, points at a distance ¼ of the neck circumference are determined.  When the shoulder sections are drawn, the neck is deepened by the desired size.  Here you should consider the option of <span>processing the neck</span> and, if necessary, leave an allowance for bending. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Armhole construction </h2><p>  Often, beginners stop at the design of the set-in sleeve.  And in most cases, it looks overstretched and incorrectly sewn in for the simple reason that the armholes and flanges of the sleeve itself were incorrectly built.  The entire design process begins with the construction of shoulder sections. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern women’s t-shirt with sleeves" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1895545.jpg" width="340"></div>

    <p>  From the starting points, the necks rise 1.5 cm in front and 2.5 cm in the back and set points.  The shoulder width is measured vertically and a point is placed 1 cm below the line.  The resulting points are connected, receiving shoulder sections for the back and shelves. </p><p>  On the verticals defining the armhole zone, 1/3 of these perpendiculars are measured from the chest line. </p><p>  A rounded neckline is drawn in a smooth line along the back and front, starting from the extreme point of the shoulder, through 1/3 of the perpendicular height to the middle of the armhole zone along the chest line. </p><p>  After all the constructions, a ready-made drawing of the pattern of the women's t-shirt is obtained.  For beginners, the same step-by-step guide to building a sleeve will be useful.  It is best to build it directly on the armhole.  Then he definitely fits well, without flaws. </p><h2>  Sleeve construction </h2><p>  For the drawing, you will need to measure the volume of the upper arm and the length of the sleeve.  All lines are applied over the finished drawing of the front and back.  Therefore, the details of the workpiece will need to be copied to get three details of the cut. </p><p>  A line equal to the width of the arm is placed along the chest line so that the point of the middle of the armhole is located in the middle of the segment. </p><p>  Based on the rounded lower part of the armhole, build a circle.  On its upper part draw a dusk, lifting it 1 cm from the border of the circle. </p><p>  Next, the whole eye is smoothly drawn, starting from the left point of the arm-width segment through the 1/3 point of the perpendicular height of the armhole zone and the enlarged upper circle border.  The line is mirrored on the second side of the sleeve ridge. </p><p>  From the highest point of the okat, measure the length of the sleeve and draw its lower border.  Next, an average cut is planned on both sides. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of women's t-shirt from knitwear" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1895562.jpg" width="410"></div>

    <h2>  Assembly and processing </h2><p>  To build a pattern of a female T-shirt with a sleeve is half the battle.  It is equally important to carefully assemble all the details.  They begin to sew parts from the shoulder seams.  Then sew sleeves and close the side sections.  It remains to process the neck and tuck the bottom of the sleeves and shelves.  The easiest way to make a beautiful throat is to turn 1-1.5 cm of the cut inside out and stitch it.  But this option is suitable for well stretchable canvases.  In other cases, it can be a <span>slanting inlay</span> or elastic band. </p>
