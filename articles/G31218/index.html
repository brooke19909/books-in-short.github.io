If so, where can I spend the money?  Exclusively to pay for studies or for other purposes?  Let's try to deal with these issues in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="student loan" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/84537.jpg" width="483"></div><br><br>  Firstly, it should be noted that a loan for a student is an ordinary product that is present in the product line of many Russian financial institutions.  Youth funds can be issued in two cases: to pay for their education and for consumer purposes.  Let's consider each of them separately. <br><br>  When is an applicant required to get a loan quickly?  When it became clear that he would not be able to enter the budget department.  Please note that the loan is issued only if the paid office without him does not shine.  To the credit of Russian banks, they very often meet such clients.  The most striking example is the low interest rate.  Its size is estimated at 5% per annum.  The rest of it to the creditor is reimbursed by the state.  Therefore, he obviously will not feel impaired. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="get a loan quickly" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/84540.jpg" width="600"></div>  The total period during which a student at an institute or university can use borrowed funds is 10 years.  But if suddenly after graduation an opportunity arises to early repay it, it is better to do it right away. <br><br>  The disadvantages of this option include two points.  First, the borrower must be at least 18 years old at the time of registration.  Secondly, he will need to attract guarantors to the transaction.  Obviously, the parents of the applicant act in their role. <br><br>  It should also be noted that a loan for a student, with whom we are now dealing, is issued only on condition that the higher education received is the first for a citizen.  In addition, the latter should understand that the program is valid only for specialties, the list of which is established by the state. <br><br>  <strong>For other needs</strong> <br><br>  Another way to get a loan for a student is to get a regular consumer loan.  And here we are talking about the amount of 50 thousand rubles.  The maximum period during which you need to return them is usually 36 months.  If a young man or girl wants to take a lot of money for a long time, then their age should be from 21 years and above. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to get a loan" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/84541.jpg" width="600"></div><br><br>  The easiest way is for those who manage to combine the learning process and work.  Such comrades can expect to receive a loan of up to 150 thousand.  It is clear that they will need to provide their civil passport, TIN code, as well as a document that confirms the income level to a banking institution.  It is noteworthy that the scholarship received by the financial institution cannot be ranked as the latter.  Therefore, a guarantee of fulfillment of obligations - too. <br><br>  It remains now to figure out where to get a loan of the type described.  Here the student does not have many options.  Currently, the funds are ready to lend to Sberbank of Russia, Russian Agricultural Bank, Education Bank, Baltic Bank.  It is difficult to advise anything here, since the choice of a suitable lender is a subjective matter.  For example, if you are interested in the interest rate, then these institutions give out money at 12%, 16%, 13.5% and 19% per annum, respectively.
