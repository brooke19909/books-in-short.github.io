The kitchen knives that looked, at first glance, quite tolerable, with beautifully designed handles turned out to be completely unsuitable for use.  Not only were the materials from which these knives were made of a very dubious nature, but also the whole set of knives had to be thrown away over time, since all its components simply broke.  Moreover, during the operation very unpleasant thoughts arose when looking at peeling paint on the handle of knives, because all this rubbish could easily get into products, and its origin was unknown. </p><p>  Here I decided to try making knives with my own hands.  But it‚Äôs only easy to say, making knives at home is not a simple matter, and the materials needed are appropriate.  First, I used the blade that was left from the Chinese knife that had become unusable, since its handle, made of some kind of suspicious plastic, peeled off a little, becoming an unpleasant look, and then it fell off.  Therefore, I started making knives at home with a knife that has only a handle from its own production.  Having found a piece of beech that is suitable in size, I gave it the desired shape with a hacksaw and file, processed it properly with a sandpaper (first large, then small) to give the surface perfect smoothness.  My handle was of two halves, between which the handle part of the blade was located.  Carefully, using a drill, I drilled holes for fastening in both halves, laid a blade between them and fastened the entire handle with rivets.  And so that there is no gap between the halves of the handle, on the inside of them, I pre-made grooves for the thickness and width of the blade to hide it with a handle. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Honestly, such a knife looked very solidly, the only difficulty was to get the material, it is not always easy to find hardwood, although, on the other hand, nothing is impossible in this.  Next, I decided to make the knife completely, including the blade.  To do this, I bought in the store a piece of stainless steel, half a millimeter thick.  Then, not without difficulty, using a drill and a hacksaw for metal, I cut a workpiece of the right size, trying to give the future blade the necessary shape.  Honestly, to process such a workpiece with a file is a very laborious task, so I used the <span>electric emery.</span>  He sharpened the knife right there, and also polished it with a special circle.  I drilled holes for fixing the handle, well, then everything happened as described above.  The only exception was the material of the knife - now I used a plastic blank, its processing turned out to be less laborious than from wood, but the appearance of the finished handle was, unfortunately, not as pleasant as a knife with a wooden handle. </p><p>  Still, natural material is always more valuable than artificial.  In general, making knives at home turned out to be a very exciting activity, useful both for the household and for one's own development.  Having bought a set for stamping from a friend of a locksmith, I was also able to apply engraving to the knife blades.  I don‚Äôt know how anyone, but I liked to improve, to bring the manufacture of knives at home to quality, and not dreamed of those products that are sold in hardware stores.  In addition, the <span>set of tools</span> necessary for such production is not so large, and at first you can completely get by with only the most common tools. </p>
