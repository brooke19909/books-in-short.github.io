They are considered the most prestigious international awards.  They were founded by Alfred Nobel - a Swedish inventor, linguist, industrial tycoon, humanist and philosopher.  He went down in history as the <span>inventor of dynamite</span> (which was patented in 1867), which played a large role in the industrial development of our planet.  In a testament drawn up by <span>Alfred Nobel</span> , it was said that all his savings would constitute a fund whose purpose is to award prizes to those who managed to bring the greatest benefit to humanity. </p><h2>  Nobel Prize </h2><p>  Today, prizes are awarded in the field of chemistry, physics, medicine, literature.  Also awarded the Peace Prize. </p><p>  The Nobel laureates of Russia in literature, physics and economics will be presented in our article.  You will get acquainted with their biographies, discoveries, achievements. </p><p>  The price of the Nobel Prize is high.  In 2010, its size amounted to approximately $ 1.5 million. </p><p>  The Nobel Foundation was founded in 1890. </p><h2>  Laureates of the Nobel Prize of Russia </h2><p>  Our country can be proud of the names glorifying it in the fields of physics, literature, economics.  The Nobel laureates of Russia and the USSR in these areas are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Bunin I.A. (literature) - 1933. </li><li>  Cherenkov P.A., Frank I.M. and Tamm I.E. (physics) - 1958. </li><li>  Pasternak B.L. (literature) - 1958. </li><li>  Landau L.D. (physics) - 1962. </li><li>  Basov N.G. and Prokhorov A.M. (physics) - 1964. </li><li>  Sholokhov M.A. (literature) - 1965. </li><li>  Solzhenitsyn A.I. (literature) - 1970. </li><li>  Kantorovich L.V. (Economics) - 1975. </li><li>  Kapitsa P. L. (physics) - 1978. </li><li>  Brodsky I.A. (literature) - 1987. </li><li>  Alferov J.I. (Physics) - 2000. </li><li>  Abrikosov A.A. and <span>Ginzburg</span> V.L. (physics) - 2003; </li><li>  Game Andre and Novoselov Konstantin (physics) - 2010. </li></ul><p>  The list, we hope, will be continued in subsequent years.  The Nobel laureates of Russia and the USSR, whose names and surnames we cited above, were not fully represented, but only in such fields as physics, literature and economics.  In addition, the leaders of our country were also noted in medicine and physiology, chemistry, and also received two Peace Prizes.  But we‚Äôll talk about them another time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Nobel laureates in physics </h2><p>  Many physicists from our country have been awarded this prestigious award.

    <p>  Tamm Igor Evgenievich (1895-1971) was born in Vladivostok.  He was the son of a civil engineer.  During the year he studied in Scotland at the University of Edinburgh, but then returned to his homeland and graduated from the Physics Department of Moscow State University in 1918.  The future scientist went to the front in the First World War, where he served as a brother of mercy.  In 1933, he defended his doctoral dissertation, and a year later, in 1934, became a researcher at the Institute of Physics.  Lebedev.  This scientist worked in areas of science that have been little studied.  So, he studied the relativistic (i.e. related to the famous theory of relativity proposed by Albert Einstein) quantum mechanics, as well as the theory of the atomic nucleus.  At the end of the 30s, he was able, together with I.M. Frank, to explain the Cherenkov-Vavilov effect - the blue glow of a liquid arising under the influence of gamma radiation.  It was for these studies that he later received the Nobel Prize.  But Igor Evgenievich himself considered work on the study of elementary particles and the atomic nucleus as his main achievements in science. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  <span>Landau Lev</span> Davidovich </h2>

    <p>  Landau Lev Davidovich (1908-1968) was born in Baku.  His father worked as an oil engineer.  At the age of thirteen, the future scientist graduated from college with honors, and at nineteen, in 1927, he graduated from Leningrad University.  Lev Davidovich continued his education abroad as one of the most gifted post-graduate students on a ticket to the people's commissar.  Here he took part in seminars conducted by the best European physicists - Paul Dirac and Max Born.  Upon returning to his homeland, Landau continued his studies.  At 26, he reached the degree of Doctor of Science, and a year later became a professor.  Together with Lifshits, Yevgeny Mikhailovich, one of his students, he developed a course for graduate students and students in theoretical physics.  P.L. Kapitsa invited Lev Davidovich to work at his institute in 1937, but a few months later the scientist was arrested by false denunciation.  He spent a whole year in prison without hope of salvation, and only an appeal to Stalin Kapitsa saved his life: Landau was released. </p><p>  The talent of this scientist was multifaceted.  He explained the phenomenon of <span>fluid helium</span> fluidity <span>,</span> created his theory of quantum fluid, and also studied the oscillations of electron plasma. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  <span>Prokhorov Alexander</span> Mikhailovich </h2>

    <p>  Prokhorov Alexander Mikhailovich and <span>Basov Nikolai</span> Gennadevich, Nobel laureates of Russia in the field of physics science, received this prestigious award for the invention of the laser. </p><p>  Prokhorov was born in Australia in 1916, where his parents lived since 1911.  They were exiled to Siberia by the tsarist government, and then fled abroad.  In 1923, the whole family of the future scientist returned to the USSR.  Alexander Mikhailovich graduated with honors from the Physics Department of Leningrad University and has been working since 1939 at the Institute named after  Lebedev.  His scientific achievements are related to radiophysics.  The scientist became interested in radio spectroscopy since 1950, and together with Basov Nikolai Gennadievich developed the so-called masers - molecular generators.  Thanks to this invention, a method for producing concentrated radio emission was found.  Similar studies, regardless of their Soviet colleagues, were also conducted by Charles Townes, an American physicist, so committee members decided to share this prize between him and Soviet scientists. </p><h2>  Kapitsa Petr Leonidovich </h2>

    <p>  We continue the list of "Nobel laureates of Russia in physics."  <span>Kapitsa Petr Leonidovich</span> (1894-1984) was born in Kronstadt.  His father was a military man, lieutenant general, and his mother was a collector of folklore and a famous teacher.  P.L.  Kapitsa graduated from the institute in St. Petersburg in 1918, where he studied under Ioffe Abram Fedorovich, an outstanding physicist.  In the conditions of the civil war and revolution, it was impossible to engage in science.  Kapitsa‚Äôs wife, as well as his two children, died during the typhoid epidemic.  The scientist moved to England in 1921.  Here he worked in the famous Cambridge, a university center, and its scientific supervisor was Ernest Rutherford, a famous physicist.  In 1923, Peter Leonidovich became a doctor of sciences, and two years later - one of the members of Trinity College - a privileged association of scientists. </p><p>  Petr Leonidovich was engaged mainly in experimental physics.  He was particularly interested in low-temperature physics.  A laboratory was built specifically for his research in the UK with the help of Rutherford, and by 1934 the scientist created a facility designed to liquefy helium.  Pyotr Leonidovich often visited his homeland during these years, and during his visits the leadership of the Soviet Union persuaded the scientist to stay.  In 1930-1934, specially for him, they even built a laboratory in our country.  In the end, he was simply not released from the USSR during his next visit.  Therefore, Kapitsa continued his research here, and in 1938 he managed to discover the phenomenon of superfluidity.  For this, in 1978 he was awarded the Nobel Prize. </p><h2>  Game Andre and Novoselov Konstantin </h2><p>  Game Andre and Konstantin Novoselov, Nobel laureates in physics in Russia, received this honorary award in 2010 for the discovery of graphene.  This is new material that can significantly increase the speed of the Internet.  As it turned out, it can capture, as well as convert into electrical energy, an amount of light that is 20 times greater than all previously known materials.  The discovery is dated 2004.  So the list "Nobel laureates of Russia of the 21st century" was replenished. </p><h2>  Literature Awards </h2><p>  Our country has always been famous for its artistic creativity.  People with sometimes opposite ideas and views are the Nobel laureates of Russia in literature.  So, A. I. Solzhenitsyn and I. A. Bunin were opponents of the Soviet regime.  But M. A. Sholokhov was known as a convinced communist.  However, all the winners of the Nobel Prize of Russia were united by one - talent.  For him they were awarded this prestigious award.  ‚ÄúHow many Nobel laureates in Russia are there in literature?‚Äù, You ask.  We answer: there are only five of them.  Now we will introduce some of them to you. </p><h2>  Pasternak Boris Leonidovich </h2>

    <p>  Pasternak Boris Leonidovich (1890-1960) was born in Moscow in the family of Leonid Osipovich Pasternak, a famous artist.  The mother of the future writer, Rosalia Isidorovna, was a talented pianist.  Perhaps that is why Boris Leonidovich dreamed of a career as a composer in his childhood, he even studied music with A. N. Scriabin himself. But his love of poetry won.  Poetry brought glory to Boris Leonidovich, and the novel "Doctor Zhivago", dedicated to the fate of the Russian intelligentsia, doomed him to difficult trials.  The fact is that the editors of a literary magazine, to which the author offered his manuscript, considered this work to be anti-Soviet and refused to publish it.  Then Boris Leonidovich transferred his creation abroad to Italy, where it was published in 1957.  Soviet colleagues sharply condemned the publication of the novel in the West, and Boris Leonidovich was expelled from the Writers' Union.  But it was this novel that made him a Nobel laureate.  Since 1946, the writer and poet have been nominated for this award, but were awarded it only in 1958. </p><p>  The award of this honorable award to such, in the opinion of many, anti-Soviet work at home caused the indignation of the authorities.  As a result, Boris Leonidovich, threatened with expulsion from the USSR, was forced to refuse to receive the Nobel Prize.  Only 30 years later, Evgeny Borisovich, the son of a great writer, received a medal and a diploma for his father. </p><h2>  Solzhenitsyn Alexander Isaevich </h2>

    <p>  The fate of Solzhenitsyn Alexander Isaevich was no less dramatic and interesting.  He was born in 1918 in the city of Kislovodsk, and childhood and youth of the future Nobel laureate passed in Rostov-on-Don and Novocherkassk.  After graduating from the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Rostov University, Alexander Isaevich was a teacher and at the same time was educated in absentia in Moscow, at the Literary Institute.  After the start of World War II, the future laureate of the most prestigious peace prize went to the front. </p><p>  Solzhenitsyn was arrested shortly before the end of the war.  The reason for this was his criticisms of Joseph Stalin, found in the writer's letters by military censorship.  Only in 1953, after the death of Joseph Vissarionovich, he was released.  The magazine "New World" in 1962 published the first story of this author, entitled "One Day of Ivan Denisovich", which tells about the life of people in the camp.  Literary magazines refused to print most of <span>Solzhenitsyn's</span> next <span>works</span> .  The reason was their anti-Soviet orientation.  But Alexander Isaevich did not back down.  He, like Pasternak, sent abroad his manuscripts, where they were published.  In 1970, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature.  The writer did not go to the presentation ceremony in Stockholm, since the Soviet authorities did not allow him to leave the country.  Representatives of the Nobel Committee, who were about to present the prize to the laureate in his homeland, were also not allowed into the USSR. </p><p>  As for the fate of the writer, then in 1974 he was expelled from the country.  At first he lived in Switzerland, then moved to the United States, where he was awarded the Nobel Prize very late.  In the West, such well-known works were published as The Gulag Archipelago, The First Circle, The Cancer Corps.  Solzhenitsyn in 1994 returned to Russia. </p><p>  These are the Nobel laureates of Russia.  The list is complemented by another name that cannot be missed. </p><h2>  Sholokhov Mikhail Alexandrovich </h2>

    <p>  We will tell you about another great Russian writer - Sholokhov Mikhail Alexandrovich.  His fate was different than that of the opponents of the Soviet regime (Pasternak and Solzhenitsyn), since he was supported by the state.  Mikhail Alexandrovich (1905-1980) was born on the Don.  He then described the village of Veshenskaya, his small homeland, in many works.  Mikhail Sholokhov graduated from only 4 classes of the school.  He took an active part in the civil war, led a sub-squad taking away surplus bread from wealthy Cossacks.  The future writer in his youth felt his calling.  In 1922 he came to Moscow, and a few months later began to publish his first stories in magazines and newspapers.  In 1926, collections of "The Azure Steppe", as well as "Don Stories" appeared.  In 1925, work began on the novel "Quiet Flows the Don", dedicated to the life of the Cossacks at a turning point (civil war, revolution, World War I).  In 1928, the first part of this work was born, and in the 30s it was completed, becoming the pinnacle of Sholokhov's work.  In 1965, the writer was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature. </p><h2>  Nobel Laureates of Russia in Economics </h2><p>  Our country in this area has not shown itself as large-scale as in literature and physics, where there are many Russian laureates.  So far, only one of our compatriots has received an economic prize.  We will tell you more about it. </p><h2>  Kantorovich Leonid Vitalievich </h2><p>  The Nobel laureates of Russia in economics are represented by only one name.  Kantorovich Leonid Vitalievich (1912-1986) is the only economist from Russia to be awarded this prize.  A scientist was born in the family of a doctor in St. Petersburg.  His parents fled to Belarus during the civil war, where they lived for a year.  Vitaly Kantorovich, father of Leonid Vitalievich, died in 1922.  In 1926, the future scientist entered the aforementioned Leningrad University, where he studied, in addition to natural sciences, modern history, political economy, and mathematics.  He graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics at the age of 18, in 1930.  After that, Kantorovich remained at the university as a teacher.  At 22, Leonid Vitalievich became a professor, and a year later - and a doctor.  In 1938, he was appointed to the laboratory of the plywood factory as a consultant, where he was tasked with creating a method for distributing various resources to maximize productivity.  So the foundry programming method was founded.  In 1960, the scientist moved to Novosibirsk, where at that time a computer center was created, the most advanced in the country.  Here he continued his research.  In Novosibirsk, the scientist lived until 1971.  During this period he received the Lenin Prize.  In 1975, he was awarded, together with T. Kupmans, the Nobel Prize, which he received for his contribution to the theory of resource allocation. </p><p>  These are the main Nobel laureates of Russia.  2014 was marked by the receipt of this prize by Patrick Modiano (literature), Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano, Shuji Nakamura (physics).  Jean Tyrol received an award in economics.  Among them are not present Nobel laureates of Russia.  2013 also did not bring this honorable award to our compatriots.  All laureates were representatives of other states. </p>
