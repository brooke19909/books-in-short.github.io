  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The structure and subject of philosophy</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The emergence of philosophy</span> as a science dates back to ancient times, it was then in Greece that the idea first appeared that the totality of all knowledge about nature and the world could be arranged into a single whole conglomerate, from which later some important axioms and principles could be distinguished.  Then you can sequentially, step by step, you can justify all the remaining knowledge so that they all together will constitute a single whole system. </p><p>  For the first time, the subject of philosophy becomes in demand at the school of Stoics and the Academy of Plato, here it consists of three parts - physics, logic and ethics.  Modern physics is only one of the few natural sciences, while Greek physics represented all the scientific knowledge about nature as a whole and about its individual elements: space, fire, water, minerals, plants and animals.  The Greek classification interpreted physics as the science of what exists in itself.  Ethics was a science about human behavior, his character, actions and generally any aspects related to the life of people, but virtue was the main concept of this teaching.  Logic is the ability to reason and speak, the ability to express actions and things in words. </p><p>  Thus, the subject of philosophy included three separate sciences and three basic <span>philosophical problems,</span> corresponding to three areas of the real world - nature, society, and thinking.  After many years, the greatest scientist - the <span>philosopher Hegel,</span> stated that philosophy was divided and will always be divided into three main aspects - logic, philosophy of nature and philosophy of spirit.  However, already in the first century BC, a fourth was added to three philosophical trends, which narrated the first principles of all things or the divine nature of the whole world.  Thus, the subject of philosophy was replenished with another significant term, which acquired the name metaphysics. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From the fourteenth to the eighteenth century, profound changes took place in science, in connection with the emergence of experimental and mathematical physics, which inevitably affected the worldview of people and the very subject of philosophy.  The structure of philosophical knowledge began to include the search for new methods of reliable teachings in the field of methodology and theory of knowledge.  The founders of the new philosophy are considered to be Descartes and Bacon, who shares the main types of knowledge according to the characteristics of the human soul, otherwise called abilities.  Descartes, in turn, proposed a general picture of philosophy in the form of a tree, where metaphysics is the root, physics is the trunk, and branches are all other sciences, originating from philosophy - medicine, ethics, mechanics.  Thus, metaphysics is considered even more reliable and fundamental science than mathematics, but they all serve in the end, the goals that ethics offers. </p><p>  Until the 18th century, there was practically no difference between the concepts of ‚Äúscience‚Äù and ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù; the subject of philosophy implied the development of very specific <span>scientific knowledge.</span>  The greatest physicist and mathematician of the time, Newton considered himself a true philosopher, and Karl Linney called his work "Philosophy of Botany."  The structure and <span>subject of philosophy</span> is still based on four basic principles: ontology - the science of being, epistemology - the science of knowledge, ethics - the doctrine of good, and the doctrine of their absolute unity - metaphysics.  Despite the fact that the structure and subject of philosophy have changed throughout the entire time of its existence, each of the philosophical teachings has its own internal logic and its own unique direction.  It is these aspects that make the subject of philosophy not only important for understanding, but also very interesting for the study and cognition of the general picture of the world, as well as its place in this world. </p>
