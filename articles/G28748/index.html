It is a beach holiday that attracts travelers from all over Russia in this place.  And this, I must say, is not at all surprising. </p><p>  The beaches of Koktebel are famous for their shallow water.  As experienced tourists say in their comments about staying on vacation here, the real depth here begins a hundred meters from the coast.  Such shallow water, where the water quickly warms up, allows you to have a wonderful vacation with the kids, without worrying much about their safety. </p><p>  As practice shows, in the midst of the holiday season, the beach strip of Koktebel is completely occupied by tourists.  That is why many travelers prefer to organize their stay in private pensions, which have their own beaches closed to strangers. </p><p>  Among the beaches there are several that are especially popular.  Among them is Surf, which is located within walking distance from the famous volcano Kara-Dag.  However, as tourists note in their reviews of the beaches of Koktebel, the infrastructure is not very well developed, so if you want to have a snack, you will have to leave your place and go to a cafe located outside its territory.  However, despite this, a large number of vacationers Surf attracts with its clear water, picturesque landscape, as well as the ability to find unique gems. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Among the popular beaches, pebble is also often mentioned, which is located opposite the Voloshin House-Museum - a local attraction.
