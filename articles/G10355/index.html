Beeline will answer all questions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, the Beeline mobile operator is one of the three leaders in the Russian Federation and neighboring countries in terms of the number of customers, functionality and quality of communication.  Every day this company opens new branches and works on the development of services for comfortable communication of its subscribers.  A striking example of such concern is the Call Me function, which can be used even with zero balance using a simple command.  After dialing a simple combination, the called subscriber will receive a notification containing a request to call back.  Beeline thus allows its customers to stay in touch and solve their life problems even without replenishment of an account. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Please call back Beeline" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/464115.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Who can use this service? </h2><p>  Often in life there are situations when one phone call can solve even big life problems.  But, unfortunately, sometimes we forget to replenish the account on the mobile or simply do not have the financial ability to do this at the right time.  Then the only option to contact the right person is SMS with a request to call back.  Beeline provides this opportunity to all its subscribers, without exception.  That is, regardless of how long the account has been replenished or what tariff plan is used, the service is available at any time.  The only restriction for this option is the location of the subscriber: at the time of sending the message, you must be in the "home" region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS with a request to call back Beeline" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/464117.jpg" width="378"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Service cost </h2><p>  Many people are already accustomed to the fact that additional comfortable services provided by various companies cost a lot of money.  This applies to financial institutions, Internet providers and others.  That is why even those who know how the request is sent to call back do not use this option.  Beeline does not particularly advertise this feature, although it is affordable and free for subscribers.  So it turns out that stereotypes make it impossible for a person to fully use the services provided. </p><p>  You can send the so-called ‚Äúbeggar‚Äù not only with a minimum amount of funds in the account, but also with a negative balance. </p><p>  You can talk about paying for this function only if the called subscriber is in the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãroaming.  Then, for the incoming network notification, funds will be withdrawn from the account in accordance with the terms of the used tariff plan. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline call back request" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/468561.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  How to send SMS with a request in Russia </h2><p>  For subscribers of the Russian Federation to send a notification containing a request to call back, Beeline offers using a digital command 144. Moreover, this combination of numbers on both sides should be highlighted with an asterisk (*), then dial the number of the called subscriber.  You must end the sending with the # sign and the call button. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the called subscriber receives a notification with the request, the sender will receive a report on the delivery of SMS. </p><h2>  Service for subscribers of Ukraine </h2><p>  The question of how to send a request to call back from Beeline is relevant not only for Russians, many Ukrainians are also in search of an answer.  For them, the procedure for sending SMS is identical, only the functional command is not 144, but 130. It also needs to be marked with asterisks (*) on both sides, then dial the number of the subscriber to be contacted.  After that, you need to press the "grid" and the call button. </p><p>  Obviously, even a child can cope with this functional option, and the main problem is associated only with a lack of information on this topic. </p><p>  When recruiting a team, attention should also be paid to the fact that the recipient's number must be dialed in the international format, where after the ‚Äú+‚Äù sign the telephone code of the country, network or city will be indicated, and only then the individual subscriber number.  Only with the exact fulfillment of these conditions will SMS with a request to call back find its addressee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to send a request to call back Beeline" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/468563.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Feature Benefits </h2><p>  This option, provided by Beeline mobile operator, does not require additional connection.  It is automatically activated for all network subscribers, regardless of tariff plans at the time of activation of the SIM card. </p><p>  Even subscribers who use this service quite often do not know that Beeline customers can call back a request not only on the network, but also on numbers of other operators.  This is very convenient, especially when you consider that billing such calls can not be called cheap. </p><h2>  Usage restrictions </h2><p>  Despite the many attractive aspects of this option, there is one limitation that you should be aware of before sending a request to call back.  Beeline provides only 10 SMS ‚Äúbeggars‚Äù for a day.  The following messages will be charged at 00:00 Moscow time, and from that time on, a person can again use the service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to send a call request from Beeline" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/468562.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Disabling Inbound Requests </h2><p>  In cases where for some reason this function is not needed, it can simply be turned off.  However, we are talking only about incoming notifications, the remaining options remain.  That is, the subscriber may be sent a call to call back, Beeline blocks only those SMS messages sent to the number by other subscribers. </p><p>  So, in order to deactivate incoming notifications of this function, you should use a simple digital command.  For subscribers of the Russian Federation, you need to dial the number 144 on the phone, highlighting it with "asterisks", then 0, the "bars" and the call button.  After sending, the system will block all incoming notifications with a request to call back.  As for the Ukrainians, they are also given an identical opportunity, only code 144 needs to be replaced with 130. </p><p>  Ease of use of the service is complemented by the fact that the established ban on alerts can be turned off at any time.  To do this, use the same combination as when deactivating notifications.  Therefore, depending on <span>personal circumstances,</span> each subscriber can independently control and regulate the process of using this service. </p>
