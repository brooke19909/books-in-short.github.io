Many prefer cheaper resorts in Greece, but in vain.  Cyprus has its own zest in the form of clean beaches, rich excursion programs and quality service.  Perhaps the only drawback to trips here may be their high cost.  Nevertheless, if you still decide to go on vacation to the island, then pay attention to the hotel in Cyprus "Anastasia Beach 4 *". </p><h2>  Location of Anastasia </h2><p>  The complex is located in the southeast of the island of Cyprus, in the small tourist village of Protaras.  This place is famous for its clean sandy beaches and small rocky bays.  The area is remote from the club life of the resort of Cyprus, so it is suitable for lovers of a quiet holiday with your family.  Also, prices are lower than in other resorts of the island.  At the same time, the town is located near the famous center of nightlife in Cyprus - Ayia Napa. </p>

    <p>  The Anastasia Hotel (Cyprus) itself is built right on Marlita Beach.  The center of Protaras is only 15 minutes away.  The sandy beach is located 200 meters from the hotel, so the road to it will take 5-10 minutes on the strength.  You can get here from the nearest <span>Larnaca airport,</span> which is 65 kilometers away.  A trip by car on smooth roads will take no more than an hour.  The pebble beach of Kalamies is 1 kilometer from the hotel.  Attractions lovers will also have something to see.  5 km away is the Agia Napa Monastery, as well as the Cavo Greco National Park.  Tourists with children should visit the Protaras Ocean Aquarium, located 3 kilometers from the hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General Hotel Information </h2><p>  "Anastasia" was built in 1998, during the development of the resort of Protaras.  It's hard to believe, but a few decades ago there was a virgin forest, where only date trees and shrubs grew.  Hotel Anastasia (Cyprus) has one large four-story building, which has almost 200 rooms.  It should be borne in mind that the hotel staff speaks only English and Greek, so there may be problems with the understanding of Russian-speaking tourists. </p>

    <p>  For guests, mainly multi-bed rooms are offered.  The hotel is designed for families, so children with all ages are welcome here.  And animals, on the contrary, are not welcome here.  Their placement is strictly prohibited even at an additional cost.  Check-in at 14:00 local time.  At the same time, tourists are often settled in a neighboring hotel for 1-2 days.  Eviction takes place no later than noon.  Mostly British, Poles, Germans, Greeks have a rest here, but Russian tourists are not so common. </p><h2>  Rooms and their equipment </h2><p>  The main building of the building has 190 rooms.  Among them are family rooms and bridal apartments.  Each room is soundproofed from the others, so guests will not hear their very noisy neighbors.  The rooms have a good, modern renovation, designed in a classic style.  All have spacious, furnished balconies, and some have a private terrace.  The windows mostly overlook the sea, but it is possible to view both the surroundings and the water park. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Guest reviews about the hotel </h2><p>  But, considering the Anastasia Hotel <span>(Protaras, Cyprus), reviews</span> of which are mostly positive, it is worth considering the negative opinions of guests.  Tourists note the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  On arrival, tourists can often be transferred for several days to another hotel, because Anastasia does not have enough places; </li><li>  monotonous nutrition, consisting mainly of fast food; </li><li>  very noisy in the evenings due to animation and a restaurant with live music; </li><li>  poor private beach with constant wet sand, so you have to go to neighboring ones; </li><li>  all animation is conducted in English only; </li><li>  very slow and expensive internet; </li><li>  all sockets in the hotel are in English, so you have to buy adapters in the store. </li></ul><h2>  Should I choose Anastasia? </h2><p>  Choosing this hotel for relaxation, it is worth paying attention that it is more designed for English tourists.  They are populated here primarily, and all events are held in English.  But the staff understands Russian and can even help solve your problems.  It is also worth considering that temporary check-in at another hotel is a normal practice on the island of Cyprus.  The Anastasia 4 * Hotel, reviews of which note this pattern, is no exception. </p><p>  Despite these shortcomings, Anastasia is perfect for a quiet family vacation, for older couples, as well as for small friendly companies. </p>
