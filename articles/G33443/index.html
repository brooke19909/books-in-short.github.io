There long before our era, public baths were created at the homes of wealthy citizens and gymnasiums - peculiar educational institutions, access to which was open to all comers.  However, this type of Mediterranean culture received its highest prosperity in ancient Rome. </p>

    <h2>  The tradition established in ancient Rome </h2><p>  The <span>Roman emperor</span> Agrippa, who ruled from 25 to 19 years BC, founded the tradition of building public baths, called "baths".  Before his death, he bequeathed his brainchild for free use to all residents of the Eternal City, and his successors supported this initiative.  What are the terms, the Romans knew before.  Close trade and political ties with Greece played a big role in this, but only with the light hand of Agrippa did they manage to fully appreciate this achievement of civilization. </p><p>  The baths in Rome, without losing their functionality, have become a true attribute of luxury.  Made from expensive varieties of marble and richly decorated with mosaics, they were decorated with sculptures made in the best traditions of ancient art.  The creators of the term spared no money either on the columns supporting the vaults of the premises, or on bronze doors decorated with intricate ornaments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of the Roman term </h2><p>  It is characteristic that the baths in Rome did not need water heating - they were originally built near hot springs with a temperature of 37-40 ° C, from which they got their name.  Numerous pools were filled with this warm water, and it was changed two or three times a day without any special expenses. </p>

    <p>  Antique saunas had various devices and internal layouts, but they certainly preserved premises that had a strictly defined purpose.  Moving from one to another, the terma visitor completed the entire bathing cycle for several hours. </p><h2>  The path of earthly bliss </h2><p>  First of all, this is the so-called apoditerium, which was a cool dressing room, where it was nice to enter from a street filled with daytime heat.  This was followed by tepidarium - a warm room, the temperature in which did not exceed 40 ° C.  Humidity in it was moderate and amounted to 40%. </p><p>  From it, the visitor entered the callidarium, where the air temperature rose significantly and reached about 50 ° C, and the humidity was 100%, and from there, pretty steamed and crushed, it turned into a dry steam room - laconium.  According to the climate established in it, it was similar to a modern Finnish sauna.  At a sufficiently high temperature, reaching 80 °, the humidity did not exceed 20%. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Further in the next room, called the "frigidarium", this minion of pagan gods was expected by two pools filled with warm and cold water.  They accomplished what is now called contrast bathing.  And the crown of the entire bathing cycle was Lavrium.  There, in the hands of skilled masseurs, he was to taste the truly heavenly bliss. </p><h2>  The technical structure of the Roman baths </h2><p>  However, one can get a complete idea of ​​what the terms are, only by touching on the question of their technical structure, which made it possible to set the desired temperature and humidity in the premises.  It must be recognized that in this regard, Roman architects showed extraordinary ingenuity.  They have developed a very effective central heating system, called the "hypocaust". </p><p>  Water and air, heated in furnaces located in the basement, rose through special channels and circulated in the cavities of the walls, as well as under the floor, which had a double coating for this purpose.  The floor and walls were made in such a way that their outer layers let in only a strictly defined amount of heat and thereby ensure the desired temperature in each room. </p>

    <h2>  Baths that have become urban cultural centers </h2><p>  Antique baths were very popular among the population and soon after their appearance became generally accepted centers for leisure activities.  In this regard, their content began to grow rapidly.  Sports halls, libraries and even theaters were added to the premises of the bathhouse complex.  A special role was given to the eating of food, which became the reason for the appearance in the departments of departments, which became the prototypes of modern restaurants. </p><p>  The memory of the glory that was once used by the famous baths of Diocletian, the Roman emperor who ruled at the end of the 3rd and beginning of the 4th century, has been preserved to this day.  They were built in the period from 298 to 305 and then were solemnly consecrated in honor of the emperor.  It was a truly grandiose building, covering an area of ​​fourteen hectares and capable of simultaneously accommodating more than three thousand people. </p><p>  According to descriptions that have reached us, the baths of Diocletian included gardens decorated with numerous fountains and pavilions, as well as libraries, halls for public gatherings, sports and theater.  Today, in their place is the Republic Square, and where the central hall was once located, the Catholic Church was erected. </p>

    <h2>  What are terms these days? </h2><p>  In the modern world, the traditions laid down in ancient antiquity received a new embodiment.  All over the world there is a huge number of recreation and entertainment complexes built on their basis, where everyone can relax, relax after work, and at the same time relieve stress and have a good time. </p><p>  An example of this is the "Khvalynsky terms" - a complex located in the city of Khvalynsk, Saratov region.  Its peculiarity lies in the fact that here guests are provided with an open-air heated pool.  It is difficult to convey what a pleasure awaits those who will plunge into its waters in winter after practicing skiing on the surrounding slopes. </p><p>  In addition to winter bathing, “Khvalynsky Therms” offer to visit a sauna located on their territory, designed for one hundred people, or to steam in a Russian bath with indispensable birch brooms, as well as fragrant tea spilled from a samovar.  Not forgotten are those who wish to be cleansed not only by the body, but also by the soul.  They can go to the consecrated spring located on the territory, equipped with a font.  For the youngest guests of the complex, a children's town has been built, in which they will find many pleasures. </p>
