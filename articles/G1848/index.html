Rest 2013, reviews of which have already been left by tourists, made it possible to enjoy not only the sea, the beach and the surrounding landscapes, but also to see many interesting things.  So, once at this resort, you can explore the dolmens, which are able to discover the secrets of distant times.  These funerary structures were erected for the burial of residents of tribes that previously inhabited this territory.  Unfortunately, the burial mound located near secondary school No. 12 and dating back to the Middle Ages practically did not survive.  Another dolmen is located in the western part of the village on the right coast of the Aderba River.  It will be interesting to see the temple of St. Sergius of Radonezh. </p><p>  In addition to dolmens, vacationers can take a walk and explore the entire village, since it is small in size and is divided into two parts by the river.  There are only three central streets.  The first street bears the name of Lenin, preserved according to the traditions of Soviet times.  It is with her that the rest begins in Divnomorskoye.  Reviews indicate that it is the most inhabited and noisy.  All kinds of shops, souvenir tents are concentrated here.  In addition, there are several recreation centers and guest houses.  It begins at the entrance to the village and reaches the embankment itself.  For those who prefer a quiet area, it is better to choose a place on Gornaya Street.  There are practically no cafes and clubs, which saves her from noisy youth companies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center arion divnomorskoye reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5484/254567.jpg" width="600"></div>
