    <p>  The base is hooped, hands in a free state.  If the seam should be thick, you must use a two-layer woolen thread, if thin - then a single layer.  When embroidering, it is advisable to use a thread of not more than thirty-five centimeters.  This is necessary so that the stitches have a neat appearance, the yarn does not wear out and does not interfere with the work process. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When working on wool embroidery, be sure to use wax or conditioner.

    <h2>  Knitting embroidery technology </h2><p>  Embroidery on knitwear with woolen threads is a rather complicated, but at the same time interesting process.  From the ordinary thing, you can get the original and unique.  If ordinary embroidery is done using the hoop, then they are not used here.  Knitted fabric has the ability to stretch in length, so you can not pull the product in all directions and tighten the threads.  It is advisable to use a knitted liner to prevent material from being pulled together. </p><p>  A feature of embroidery on knitted fabric is that it can be improvised here. </p><p>  First, transfer the drawing to tracing paper, and from it already to the knitted fabric.  The pattern should be small in size. </p><p>  When creating decorative seams, knitwear is optional.  The seam occupies a small area, which leads to the fact that the material does not contract. </p>
