  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Should I buy an iPad? Pros and cons of the tablet</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Increasingly, from advertising and other <span>media,</span> we hear about the Apple brand, which gained its fame thanks to the creation of a number of high-tech devices with a prefix in the form of the letter i (iPod, iPhone, iPad).  A line of portable and easy-to-use music players, which in addition had a unique external design, won their first audience.  The developers ‚Äônext step was the patented <span>touch-sensitive monoblock</span> form of a mobile phone, the smooth lines of which with rounded corners and one function button on the front panel became a kind of quality mark.  I-news became more and more popular not only among the youth audience of the consumer market, but also won the hearts of much more practical business people. </p><p>  The latest generation of devices from Apple were portable tablet computers that did not require an additional keyboard, mouse and other accessories.  In fact, this is a <span>touch panel</span> that is slightly smaller than <span>an</span> A4 <span>sheet</span> , combining the functions of not only a stationary workstation.  After all, the iPad boasts a high-resolution camera, as well as a number of built-in and ready-to-use applications.  But is such a little thing really necessary for every modern person?  Let's see if it is worth buying an iPad to the average user with the gifts of technological progress. </p><p>  To weigh the pros and cons, first of all, you need to consider in detail all the characteristics and parameters of the tablet.  The pros and cons of this device will speak for themselves. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Positive aspects of the iPad </p><p>  - Compactness.  The question of whether to buy an iPad will not arise for those who vitally need to always have a device with them that provides convenient access to the Internet.  With this tablet, you can use the search at any time, as well as download the necessary files.  iPad is convenient on the go and does not take up much space in the bag. </p><p>  - Cinema and music in a convenient format.  Do you like to travel, and do you prefer to pass the time on the road watching new movie distribution?  Or maybe you can not imagine a vacation without your favorite music, which should always be at hand?  Then do not rack your brains when deciding whether to buy an iPad.  The drive in this device allows you to store a large number of good quality multimedia files in it.  Large and clear due to high resolution, the display will satisfy even the most demanding moviegoers.  The iPad already has built-in players that can play almost any file format. </p><p>  - Own application store.  For the entire line of tablet computers of <span>the</span> Apple <span>brand</span> , a so-called licensed application store has been developed, in which, after registration, each iPad owner gets the opportunity to purchase and download all the necessary add-ons directly to their device.  The same applies to games that are created specifically for this new product. </p><p>  - Paradise for gamers.  If you think that using your touchpad to enjoy your favorite ‚Äúshooters‚Äù is not as convenient as using a full-fledged computer, then you are mistaken.  Just a couple of touches, and now the game reality is subject to each of your movements.  In addition, due to the growing popularity of the "apple" company, an increasing number of strategies began to be issued taking into account the peculiarities of launching on a tablet.  In addition, there are a number of games created only for tablets from Apple.  Still wondering if you should buy an iPad?  Say a confident yes to the gaming reality of the new format. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The negative sides of the iPad </p><p>  Of course, there are spots on the Sun.  Even the most flawless at first glance, the device will always have several drawbacks.  The same goes for the iPad. </p><p>  - Cost.  The promoted brand, as well as the versatility of this tablet destroys all hopes of accessibility for mass consumers.  The newer is the generation of the representative of the iPad line, the higher will be its cost.  But shouldn't its benefits be appreciated?  You decide. </p><p>  - The same type of generation.  Each launch of a new level tablet is accompanied by a loud presentation and preliminary waiting.  However, it should be noted that over and over Apple adheres to 80 percent of existing characteristics.  Basically, the screen size changes slightly, and the memory and RAM are also increased.  Of course, the picture becomes even more realistic, special effects are even more vivid, but is there any need to overpay for this?  So whether it‚Äôs worth buying the iPad 3 just to follow the trend of constant updating, or you can restrict yourself to the first tablet model, you need to think again. </p><p>  - Fragility.  Unfortunately, this tablet is quite easy to damage even by a careless touch on the display.  This expensive little thing is very sensitive to contacts with dust, dirt, water, as well as mechanical shock.  Should I buy an iPad if you are used to simple and careless handling of equipment?  Probably not.  If only the regular spending of amounts of this scale is not an everyday routine for you. </p>
