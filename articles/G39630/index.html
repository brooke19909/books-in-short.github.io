    <p>  In 1954, this model of the camera was considered truly the most modern and highly technological development in the field of photography.  Almost all amateur and amateur photographers, as well as researchers, dreamed of "Zorkom".  The basis for the success of this device is the use of professional metal cassettes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It was possible to take photographs using the "Vigilant" camera with two hands and using a tripod.  In the latter case, it should be remembered that there is a special socket at the bottom of the camera that allows you to firmly and stably attach the support.  And the leather case made it possible to shoot without removing the device. </p><p>  The Zorkiy camera has become a real work of engineering.  In the process of working with him, it was recommended to adhere to the following sequence: </p><ol><li>  If a retractable lens is inserted in the device, set it to the working position. </li><li>  One of the existing ways to determine the exposure time for a given aperture. </li><li>  Set the aperture to the lens. </li><li>  Turn on the shutter. </li><li>  Set shutter speed. </li><li>  Focus the lens. </li><li>  Start shooting by gently pressing the button. </li></ol><p>  When shooting with two hands, it was necessary to hold the device confidently, but without undue stress.  This device once again proves that the USSR cameras deserve respect! </p><h2>  FED-2 </h2>

    <p>  <span>The FED camera</span> is a professional device for photographers made in 1952.  In terms of state and functionality, it was a truly ingenious development during the middle of the last century and occupied an honorable place in the category "cameras of the USSR". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The shooting could be carried out from any position and by any means known at that time.  Instant photo, from a tripod, from a hand, with a shutter speed - anything.  For FED-2 was nothing impossible.  He was especially fond of journalists and photo artists who actively filmed landscapes, sporting events and panoramas. </p><p>  FED was produced at a specially built factory of the Trudkommuna of the NKVD of the Ukrainian SSR named after  F. E. Dzerzhinsky entirely from Soviet raw materials.  As a negative material, a standard perforated film of 1.60 m segments was used for it, which provided simultaneous charging of the apparatus for the production of 36 shots. </p><p>  The design of the FED-2 camera was based on the principle of automatic operation and the conjugation of mechanisms.  In other words, by opening the shutter, the photographer thereby rewound the film and counted the number of shots taken. </p><h2>  "Moscow" </h2>

    <p>  In 1959, the camera itself included the Moment-24C professional shutter camera, a case, a film reel, a release cable, a transfer and storage box, as well as detailed instructions with a passport and a description of the operation of the device. </p><p>  On the <span>Moscow camera,</span> the manufacturer provided warranty service for one year after the acquisition, provided that the device was not opened and disassembled outside the factory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main feature of the camera was aperture optics.  Also a nice addition for all amateur photographers was a case with a special shoulder strap. </p><p>  In the manufacture of this model, Soviet engineers truly surpassed themselves.  The optical focus, a range finder with an extensive base of 65 mm, as well as a central shutter with eight automatic shutter speeds, coupled with a flash synchronizer, could not leave indifferent any amateur photographer in the USSR. </p><p>  <span>The Moscow camera</span> could take as many as 12 pictures of 6x6 cm format without additional recharging.  Now these figures may seem ridiculous to us, but in 1954 it was on the brink of science fiction, for which, no doubt, it is worth once again to thank the Soviet engineers who produced such precise mechanisms in the post-war years.  This device glorifies the cameras of the USSR, helping them occupy a high place in the list of the best in the world! </p><h2>  "Zenith" </h2>

    <p>  "Zenith" belonged to the category of mirror devices.  It was intended for a wide variety of types of shooting and could support both color and black and white film.  People who most often used this device could be described in two words: a highly skilled amateur photographer.  In those days, the old Zenith model was still very difficult to use for an ordinary photographer and not so effective for a professional photojournalist, so it was assigned to the ‚Äúabove average‚Äù class. </p><p>  The main advantage of the model was certainly the so-called current focus mirror.  It allowed to constantly observe the object, focus sharpness and increase the clarity and sharpness of the image.  The old Zenit camera could be used with lenses that have 37 to 1000 mm in focal length, as well as special elongated rings that allow reproduction and close-ups of small objects - the so-called macro and micro shots. </p><h2>  "Change-2" </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shift 2" class="if" height="468" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45350/1498523.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The Smena-2 camera belongs to the class of small-sized devices.  It has a rather rigid structure, the main purpose of which is purely amateur photography.  In <span>Soviet times,</span> professionals avoided this model.  For their purposes, it was too simple, although, on the other hand, for ordinary amateur photographers, its functionality was simple and intuitive. </p><p>  This camera came complete with a technical passport, as well as a lens, which easily ensured the creation of five automatic shutter speeds and a number of arbitrary ones.  The device was also equipped with a self-timer function and a special synchronizer for working with the flash lamp. </p><p>  By rotating the lens, it was easy to sharpen the desired object.  The borders of the image were indexed using an optical search engine, which was originally mounted in the Smena-2 camera.  This device could be easily charged in the light, which is also important.  In addition, it was equipped with a special mechanism for rewinding the film for only 1 frame, which was a truly super-modern development in the mid-20th century. </p><h2>  "Satellite" </h2>

    <p>  Announcing the release of the next model of the Sputnik camera, the manufacturer told the broad masses about the so-called stereo kit.  Manufacturers claimed that a special stereoscopic photograph would help to take pictures, allowing you to get a true spatial representation of the location of things, objects and various objects. </p><p>  This kit included the Sputnik camera itself, as well as a special copy frame and a stereoscope.  With the help of "Sputnik", an image consisting of several slightly different photographs was obtained, upon examination of which one could notice a merging, three-dimensional image.  According to eyewitnesses, the spectacle was truly bewitching.  The camera itself could be charged with an ordinary roller film.  The photographer could make 6 specialized stereoscopic frames or 12 standard ones.  In addition, this model was equipped with an automatic release function that actuated the shutters after approximately 7-8 seconds.  Previously, USSR cameras could not boast of such. </p><h2>  "Sunrise" </h2>

    <p>  "Sunrise" was produced in the USSR from 1964 to 1968 in the city of Leningrad, at the plant of the Optical-Mechanical Association named after V.I. Lenin.  This unit had a rather attractive case, which was based on an aluminum alloy and an opening rear wall (by the way, it was very convenient).  The rewinding of the film, as well as the platoon of the apparatus, was carried out using a trigger. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the trigger was located on the very rim of the lens, which is very unusual for models of that time.  The "Voskhod" camera had a mass of 850 grams and had the ability to shoot frames 24x36 mm in size using a flash with sync contact of categories "X" and "M". </p><h2>  Interesting fact </h2><p>  By the way, this, it would seem, not the most popular model at that time in the Soviet Union had a total number of 59,225 copies produced.  Unlike other models, this camera can now be easily purchased in Russia and the CIS countries.  Until now, a sufficiently large number of ideally working models of the "Sunrise" have been preserved. </p><h2>  We remember, we are proud </h2><p>  The article examined technical specifications, features and interesting features of the most popular Soviet cameras.  Of course, progress never stands still, and, understanding this fact, I would like to once again note the work of Soviet engineers.  It was thanks to their efforts that Soviet cameras were not ashamed to show to foreigners, and the photographs taken with their help were of the highest quality! </p>
