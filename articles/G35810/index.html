    <h2>  Restaurants, cafes and bars on site: features and reviews </h2><p>  For a meal, you can also eat at the beach cafe.  There tourists are waiting for snacks, hot dishes, soups and, of course, soft drinks. </p><p>  The hotel also has a poolside bar and lobby.  Vacationers are unlikely to order there anything substantial from food, but they will easily quench their thirst. </p><p>  In addition to Cohiba, there is an Italian restaurant on site, where you can dine by ordering the desired dish in advance. </p><p>  In general, tourists like the cuisine.  A variety of dishes and snacks arouse their real delight.  However, sometimes unfortunate incidents like overcooked food happen, which provokes some, however, very rare negative reviews. </p><p>  Freshly squeezed juices, as well as cocktails, of which there are more than twenty species, are especially praised.  Tourists note the decent quality of local alcoholic beverages. </p><h2>  Beach holidays among coconut trees </h2><p>  But the greatest delight they have is a beach holiday in the Punta Cana area.  Riu Naiboa 4 * (traveler reviews confirm this) has a charming, and most importantly, clean coral beach surrounded by palm trees.  The hotel employees regularly clean the algae that the ocean brings, so relaxing there is comfortable and pleasant. </p><p>  To get from the hotel to the coast, you need to take a two-minute walk.  And there vacationers are already waiting for free sunbeds and towels.  The hotel does not provide umbrellas, so lying in the sun all day is not recommended.  It is better to spend time by the ocean in the morning and evening.  At this time, the scorching Dominican sun does not strive to burn the skin. </p><p>  When the sultry heat makes spending time on the beach impossible, tourists should go to the pool, where you can also swim and sunbathe, lying on sun loungers under umbrellas. </p><p>  A special pleasure is swimming in the ocean.  Many people wonder: is he calm in the <span>Punta</span> Cana area?  Riu Naiboa 4 * is unlikely to suit extremals dreaming of giant waves.  Arena Gorda beach is protected by a reef located 200 meters from the coastline.  Huge ocean waves crash against it and do not reach the bathing area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="riu naiboa 4 punta cana booking" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42406/1355211.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment and sports </h2><p>  Sunbathing and swimming in the long run can get bored, and then it's time to dilute the rest with the entertainment that the hotel generously provides its guests: catamarans, kayaks or pedal boats, scuba diving lessons, windsurfing, and snorkeling. </p><p>  At the disposal of vacationers are a SPA-center, jacuzzi, sauna, gym, massage room. </p><p>  Hotel guests can stretch their muscles on one of the four tennis courts belonging to Riu Naiboa 4 * (Dominican Republic / Punta Cana), as well as fight with each other in billiards or play a game of golf. </p><p>  During the day, animators engage tourists in various games: beach volleyball, water polo, darts or ping pong.  And in the evening a fascinating show awaits them.  Moreover, it does not repeat from time to time.  Every evening, hotel guests enjoy a new program.  However, tourists evaluate the animation contradictory.  One she seems sluggish, the other it is enough for outdoor activities. </p><p>  After the show, many go to the Pacha nightclub.  Entrance to the disco is free, but this does not apply to alcohol.  The club will have to pay for them. </p><p>  Fans of gambling can visit the casino of the neighboring Riu Palace Macao 5 * hotel. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  One of the most important components of overseas leisure is shopping.  Buying souvenirs and other cute little things is almost always included in the mandatory program.

The hotel's animators develop special programs, and in the evening they hold a disco for children. </p><p>  However, in their reviews, tourists note that this is not enough, and constant noise, day and night, clearly will not benefit small children.

Hotel Riu Naiboa 4 * (Dominican Republic / Punta Cana) provides him with 90 free minutes per day, for which you can not only make all the necessary calls on mobile applications, but also post new photos to social networks. </p><p>  According to reviews of former guests, they managed to be on the Internet for a longer period of time.  Its quality in the hotel, however, sometimes suffers due to a weak signal. </p><h2>  What else do you need to know about the hotel? </h2><p>  In addition to all the abovementioned entertainments and services, the tourist should know that there is a laundry on the hotel territory, where, if necessary, one can take his belongings, as well as a solarium and a hairdresser. </p><p>  Riu Naiboa has a currency exchange office, and at the reception you can rent a car for personal use and leave it in the parking lot provided by the hotel. </p><p>  Riu Naiboa vacationers pay with Visa and Mastercard credit cards. </p><h2>  Travel Planning: Dominican Republic, Punta Cana, Riu Naiboa 4 * </h2><p>  Tours at Riu Naiboa can be booked at any time.
