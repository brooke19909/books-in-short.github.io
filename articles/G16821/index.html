But the main thing is that this city is a storehouse of ancient civil buildings: chambers of merchants of the 17th century, huts of ordinary inhabitants of the posad, decorated with tiles and carvings, as well as delightful works of wood masters of the 19th century.  In any case, it is worth visiting Gorokhovets.  Attractions will be appreciated by every tourist. </p>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  It is widely believed that the name Gorokhovets comes from the nickname Gorokh.  But history does not report who was its bearer.  The first mention in written sources dates back to 1158, but back in the 11th century, many Slavs inhabited these lands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the center of the city stood the Kremlin on Nikolskaya Gora.  Powerful earthen ramparts and other fortifications made of wood were built around its perimeter.  These wooden structures were destroyed in the Time of Troubles.  The location away from the restless borders of the state saved Gorokhovets from attacks and destruction.  The Kremlin and the posad on the very bank <span>of the Klyazma River</span> have been preserved to this day <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The winter lasts in the Vladimir region for more than 4 months, it is snowy with an average temperature of -8.5 degrees.  Climate and relief contributed to the creation of ski slopes in these places.  Gorokhovets is also famous for its excellent slopes.  Attractions of this level will please any skier. </p>

    <p>  "Puzhalova Gora" is the most famous ski resort.  This name comes from a legend.  Once upon a time, the Tatars were about to attack the city, but in the skies above this mountain the image of the Russian combatant became noticeable.  The enemies fled in horror, and the name from the word ‚Äúscare‚Äù was fixed. </p><p>  In the springtime, snow melts as soon as possible, in summer the temperature is at around 16 degrees.  Gloomy rainy weather is in autumn. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Nicholas Monastery was erected in the XVII-XVIII centuries.  The focus is on Trinity Cathedral.  The lower floor is occupied by a winter church, and the upper one is a summer building.  This place offers a magnificent view.  Gorokhovets <span>(Vladimir region)</span> advertises its sights and regularly praises it.  It‚Äôs not without reason, this city has something to show tourists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The masonry of the cathedral contains particles of the relics of St. Sergius.  He at one time gave a blessing to Andrei Rublev in the work of writing icons.  The monastery is located on the slope of the Puzhalova Mountain, which faces the Klyazma. </p><p>  The southeast of the square is famous for the <span>Sretensky monastery,</span> which was erected in the XVII-XVIII centuries.  You can enter the monastery by going under the bell tower, which shot up 35 meters.  Within its walls are traces of the Holy Gates that have been seen by all the parishioners of the monastery.  It was from the bell tower in 1689 that the foundation was laid for the construction of a monastery of stone.  Deservedly considered the most memorable temple in the city, thanks to the wealth of architecture and decorative elements.  The town of Gorokhovets is very friendly.  Sights delight and immerse in the history of Russia. </p><p>  The construction of the <span>Znamensky Monastery</span> began in 1598.  After 81 years, stone structures appeared in his yard: the Church of the Sign of the Virgin and the bell tower.  He stands on the picturesque bank of Klyazma. </p><p>  In winter, the road to the monastery lies on an ice road.  In summer, getting into it is easiest via a bridge on pontoons.  In the offseason, you should look for a boat.  Guests here are always welcome.  The monastery exists at the expense of its own economy. </p><h2>  Notable houses </h2><p>  Travelers often notice wooden architectural forms.  House of businessman Shorin is widely known in Gorokhovets.  An interesting house was erected in 1902.  The owner of the house was directly involved in the foundation of the shipbuilding plant of the city of Gorokhovets.  Everyone knows that Gorokhovets is famous for its old streets.  Attractions there are located at every step. </p><p>  On Lenin Street (in the center of the city) you cannot pass by a large number of architectural monuments.  Among them is the mansion of Prisheltsov, in which at different times there was a cell of the Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party and the district party committee. </p>

    <p>  Semenichev House was built at the turn of the XIX-XX centuries by a large factory owner.  In the 21st century, a museum is located here. </p><p>  In the fence of the Holy Sretensky <span>Convent there</span> are temples of the 17th century: </p><ul><li>  Church of the Presentation of the Lord. </li><li>  Church of St. Sergius of Radonezh. </li></ul><p>  Everyone remembers the city of Gorokhovets for its buildings.  Sights (reviews from tourists are more positive, but young people do not really like to wander around this city) are worth it to be seen. </p><h2>  Museum </h2><p>  In School Lane, the fifth house is occupied by a museum of history and architecture.  It will help to form a holistic view of the development of the city.  Museum exhibits are housed in the merchants' chambers of Sapozhnikov and the Church of St. John the Baptist.  The museum exposition is one of the most entertaining on the Golden Ring route. </p>
