  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dmitry Tolstoy: biography and social activities</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Dmitry Tolstoy is a statesman who held high posts under the three emperors of Russia: Nicholas I, Alexander II and Alexander III.  Opponent of the reformist activities of Alexander II, he faithfully carried out the duties assigned to him, but resigned, feeling disapproval from the sovereign.  Called upon by the next emperor, Alexander III, inquired: ‚ÄúIs it convenient for the emperor to see in your service the opponent of the reforms of your predecessor?‚Äù  The post was accepted after hearing a positive response. </p><h2>  Childhood, education </h2><p>  Dmitry Andreyevich was born almost 200 years ago, in March 1823, in Moscow.  The Tolstoy noble family gave Russia many talented people who glorified it in politics, economics and culture. </p><p>  Until the age of seven, the boy was brought up at home, but the death of his father changed his usual way of life.  In addition to him, two more children grew up in the family, and the mother accepted the proposal that V. Ya. Venkstern made to her. </p><p>  Dmitry Tolstoy was sent to a boarding house at Moscow University to study, from that moment on, his uncle Dmitry Nikolaevich became his trustee.  A convinced monarchist, he had a huge influence on the formation of the views of his nephew. </p><p>  The next stage in the training of the young man was the famous Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum, which was considered the best educational institution in Russia.  Enrolled here at the age of fourteen, he was very serious about getting a good education.  Looking sensibly at things, the young man understood that in the absence of an inheritance he should rely only on himself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Education at the Lyceum was equated with a university, and a careful selection of disciplines, excellent teachers, a well-thought-out daily routine of a closed institution gave very good results.  Even among the chosen youth, well-educated and well-read, Dmitry stood out for his successes, knowledge and diligence. </p><p>  In 1842 he graduated from high school with a gold medal.  "Distribution" was carried out depending on the rating.  Dmitry, who received the highest grade IX (corresponded to the rank of captain), was awarded the allowance and was credited to the ‚Äúhighest personnel reserve‚Äù. </p><p>  A successful nobleman, not obligated to serve, he could lead an idle lifestyle, traveling, attending balls and concerts.  But in the absence of any money (he had to visit friends at dinners without invitations), he went to serve in the office of Nicholas I. </p><h2>  Beginning of a career </h2><p>  The emperor trusted his office more than the government, all the most important matters requiring the direct intervention of the sovereign were decided here.  Therefore, for the four years spent here, Dmitry Tolstoy passed a good administrative school.  But in 1847 he resigned to engage in scientific work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deduhova.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="State Duma meeting" class="if uuid-3133967" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3133967.jpg"></div><p>  His work on the history of finance of the Russian state was highly appreciated by the Academy of Sciences, and the author was awarded the Demidov Prize of five thousand rubles.  In addition, Count Dmitry Andreevich Tolstoy noticed Nicholas I and granted him a diamond ring. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In September 1847, he returned to service, receiving the post of official of special assignments of the VI class at the Department of Spiritual Affairs.  Soon, Dmitry Andreevich will become vice-director of this institution, continuing not only bureaucratic, but also scientific activities. </p><h2>  The personal life of Count Tolstoy </h2><p>  Being in love with the beautiful Maria Yazykova, Dmitry Andreyevich refused to marry her.  Listening to the opinion of his uncle, who considered it reckless to marry for love when both spouses have no money, he chose a girl with a good dowry. </p><p>  Sofya Dmitrievna Bibikova, the daughter of the Minister of the Interior, was not beautiful, did not shine with her mind, but brought several Mikhailovsky estates with her family that were near Ryazan.  In addition, she became a loving and caring wife, fulfilling all the whims of her husband. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deduhova.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Living room on the estate" class="if uuid-3133966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3133966.jpg"></div><p>  The Count, who for the first time received large material property in his power, enthusiastically took up business affairs, putting everything in strict order, demanding timely and complete reports from managers, delving into the slightest nuances.  His wife, maid of honor, and later the stats lady of the empress, did not prevent her husband from managing the estate. </p><p>  By the way, Count Dmitry Tolstoy wanted to make of his favorite estate in the village of Makov a mayorat, that is, indivisible when changing the owner of the land.  In addition, in order to be different from the numerous Tolstoys, he wanted to complicate his surname by making it Tolstoy-Makovsky so that the descendants were named that way.  But he simply did not have time to complete any of this. </p><h2>  Career under Alexander II </h2><p>  In 1865, Dmitry Tolstoy received the post of Chief Prosecutor of the Holy Synod, led by 15 years.  Here, with his characteristic energy, he carried out a number of activities for the department and for the transformation of theological educational institutions.  After the assassination attempt on the Tsar, Tolstoy received the post of Minister of Education, remaining the head of the Synod, senator and clerk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="duma.gov.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Society meeting" class="if uuid-3134005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3134005.jpg"></div><p>  With his energy he was in time everywhere.  Strictly, in a businesslike way, he monitored the spending of state money for its intended purpose, introduced changes to the curriculum.  In 1871 he carried out a reform in secondary education.  During this period, he was awarded the highest rank of empire - a real privy councilor.  By virtue of its nature, the Count did not recognize compromises, did not take public opinion into account, and therefore made a lot of ill-wishers.  Criticizing the reforms of the emperor, he fell out of favor and in 1880 resigned, returning all the posts to the sovereign. </p><h2>  Career under Alexander III </h2><p>  Having ascended the throne after the death of his father, Alexander III, an opponent of the innovations of the previous emperor, urged Tolstoy to lead the Imperial Academy of Sciences.  Scientists warmly approved and gladly accepted this candidacy, since his academic activities, business acumen, energy, as well as scientific works and awards were widely known. </p><p>  Dmitry Andreyevich combined this post with the post of Minister of the Interior and, feeling the emperor‚Äôs support, energetically embarked on counter-reforms in the areas entrusted to him: he stopped the work of many illegal parties, held many political courts, and closed dubious publishing houses.  By the end of the 80s, terrorist attacks in the country stopped and the revolutionary movement was quiet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.scoopnest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="In full dress" class="if uuid-3133965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3133965.jpg"></div><p>  During his faithful service to his country, the Count was awarded many high Russian and foreign awards.  In the photo Dmitry Tolstoy, still a young man, in a ceremonial uniform and with a very serious face, which was very consistent with his character. </p><p>  The death of Dmitry Andreyevich in 1889, the emperor received with great sorrow. </p>
