    <p>  Each room has its pros and cons.  If you take into account the general opinion, then each client considers the presence of a wonderful spacious balcony where you can relax, the room always has bath accessories, daily cleaning, windows offer excellent views of the pool and the sea.  The small kitchenette where you can cook your own food is pleasing.  The disadvantages include some equipment malfunctions, but they can be quickly resolved, there may be problems with the furniture, but all this does not affect the quality of rest.  Arriving at the resort, few are all the time in the room. </p><h2>  About nutrition </h2>

    <p>  Many guests are not too happy with this item, but here everything is purely individual.  Fruits are produced daily, but their variety is not so great.  Usually these are the fruits of local trees.  Fish is offered, as a rule, it is served in batter or grilled.  Some guests are frustrated by the lack of seafood.  Cooking is not the hotel‚Äôs greatest strength.  I was pleased with the fact that there were always all kinds of fresh juices on the table, as well as fresh milk.  Sweet tooth will find your favorite desserts on the table.  Fresh pastries are available. </p><p>  The bar always has a large selection of spirits.  But not all of them are of high quality, so when you use you need to be pretty careful not to harm your health. </p><p>  The undoubted advantages of the institution are its location and chic territory - everything is planted with greenery and looks simply luxurious.  I like the fact that the territory is very well looked after, it is incredibly nice to be here.  The little visitors of the complex are delighted with such a large area, they always have where to run and frolic, and this is really a definite plus for both children and parents. </p><p>  Good conditions for people leading an active lifestyle are offered by the TT Hotels Hydros Club.  Tennis court, golf course, sporting events - all this is available to the clients of the complex. </p><p>  According to most vacationers, the hotel deserves its stars.  Minor flaws overlap with numerous advantages.  This hotel complex is definitely recommended for families with children.  Young people will not be bored here either. </p>
