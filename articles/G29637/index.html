The largest city of Siberia is by no means the oldest in its open spaces.  The history of the city barely exceeded the second century.  Previously, there were rural settlements at this place, but the actual date of the founding of Novosibirsk should be considered 1893.  The city owes its birth to the Trans-Siberian Railway, which was under construction at that time, which in this place approached <span>the Ob River.</span>  The construction of a bridge over one of the great Siberian rivers was a rather difficult engineering task.  But in the process of solving it, a village of builders and engineers was formed, which later became the city of Novonikolaevsky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Novosibirsk" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/277165.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <p>  Architectural sights of Novosibirsk </p><p>  The city began to grow rapidly in Soviet times, in the era of industrialization.  The Great Patriotic War played a huge role in its development, when industrial enterprises from the European part of the country were evacuated here.  These circumstances affected the appearance of the city.  The main attractions of Novosibirsk were concentrated in its central part.  Only a few expressive buildings have survived from the pre-revolutionary era.  First of all, it is the building of the Commercial Club (now the <span>Red Torch</span> Drama <span>Theater</span> is located here <span>), the</span> Novosibirsk Regional Museum of Local Lore, housed in the old merchant trading building, and the red brick Cathedral in the name of Alexander Nevsky in the <span>Neo-Byzantine style.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Novosibirsk city sights" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/277161.jpg" width="492"></div>  But the main architectural sights of Novosibirsk are the legacy of the Soviet era.  The rapid development and construction of the city took place at a time when the ideas of constructivism dominated architecture.  They largely shaped the modern face of the city.  A striking example of this style is the building of the <span>Novosibirsk-Glavny</span> railway <span>station</span> on Garin-Mikhailovsky Square.

    <p>  The unconditional masterpiece included in many architectural textbooks and monographs is the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theater.  Listing the sights of Novosibirsk, it should be put in the first place.  This is the largest theater building in Russia, the Moscow Bolshoi Theater could easily be located under its dome.  The history of its construction is complex and dramatic.  In 1937, they were declared "enemies of the people" and construction managers were shot.  And the thing was that they had to solve engineering problems of unique complexity, often having no analogues in world practice.  And at the scheduled time the building was simply impossible to build.  Its construction continued even during the war. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The main attractions of Novosibirsk" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/277164.jpg" width="496"></div>
