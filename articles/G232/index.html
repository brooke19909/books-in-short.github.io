According to historians, the construction was led by Adelantado Francisco Pizarro, whose name is associated with the conquest of the Inca Empire.  Subsequently, the outpost became the administrative center of the Latin American country of Peru. </p>

    <h2>  Why is the city of kings? </h2><p>  Ships that entered the port, moving further up the fairway of the Rimak River, which flows into the Pacific Ocean, sailed inland, into its mountainous part of the Andes.  The outpost served as a kind of bridgehead, which allowed the Spaniards to carry out aggressive campaigns, spreading their colonial possessions.  The city of Lima (Peru) developed gradually. </p><p>  It is not surprising that this circumstance explained the choice of location for the construction of the port town.  Over the next two centuries, he was destined to survive the heyday, justifying its name - "City of Kings."  Lima gradually grew.  Like mushrooms after the rain, new gorgeous houses of the Spanish nobility appeared, decorated in the then fashionable Baroque style.  Everyone wanted to get closer to the main city square. </p><h2>  City development </h2><p>  The successful location of Lima contributed to the prosperity of trade.  In parallel, the development of culture and enlightenment took place.  The founding of the University of San Marcos in 1551 is proof of that.  This is the first educational institution of this level in Latin America.  In the middle of the 18th century, a powerful destructive earthquake occurred in this part of the Pacific coast, which resulted in the death of a tenth of the urban population.  A terrible natural phenomenon destroyed many buildings, the former splendor of which no one will ever be able to admire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, Lima <span>(the capital of Peru)</span> is <span>a metropolis</span> with more than eight million people.  Its residents have the opportunity to use exclusively land transport.  It is not surprising that a large concentration of buses and cars (among them a lot of outdated models), pedestrians hurrying to work or on other matters are the cause of congestion on the streets.  Rare motor vehicles, whose technical condition is far from perfect, saturates the air in the city with exhaust gases, thereby worsening the environmental situation. </p>

    <p>  On the territory of the capital and beyond, vacationers have beautiful beaches.  Unfortunately, bathing lovers will be disappointed - the water here is far from warm throughout the year.

Although the <span>height of the pyramid is</span> much less than that of an Egyptian relative, but still it is real.  Once upon a time, Indians in this place made sacrifices to their deities in a playful way.  To familiarize yourself with the pyramid, you will have to pay $ 5, and accompanied by a guide - from $ 20. </p>

    <h2>  The complex of St.  Francisco </h2><p>  When planning a sightseeing tour, you should not miss the opportunity to get acquainted with the complex of St. Francis.  His highlight is the painting "The Last Supper."  On it, unlike the famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci ‚ÄúThe Last Supper‚Äù, Christ with his apostles is depicted in an unusual perspective - they regale themselves with a guinea pig and wash down with chicha.  The complex of St.  Francisco comprises several objects: a monastery, a church, chapels, catacombs.  Here is such a different and attractive for tourists Lima (Peru).  <span>The sights of the city</span> are striking in their beauty and antiquity. </p><p>  After the earthquake of 1672, the destroyed structure had to be restored.  According to experts, this complex should be attributed to the category of the most significant architectural samples that are made in the Baroque style. </p><h2>  Fountain complex </h2><p>  It is unlikely that somewhere else in the world there will be such a complex of fountains that can be compared with Park la Reserva in terms of occupied space, which served as a reason to include it in the Guinness Book of Records.  The show is especially impressive in the evening, when the noise of fountains is accompanied by national Peruvian and classical music. </p><p>  After the organization of such a monument, hundreds of tourists from all over the world went to Peru (Lima).  Hotels can be found in many areas of the city.  Prices are very affordable, ranging from 25 to 1000 dollars per day. </p>

    <h2>  Temples of the Preincan civilizations </h2><p>  Before the Spaniards appeared in Peru, civilization already existed.  This can be judged by the presence of dilapidated temples.  They are located near residential areas.  The complex of Huq Pukljan, which played the role of a religious and at the same time administrative center, is of archaeological value.  A wall built in the middle of it divided it into two separate parts.  Researchers suggest that the complex was built in the sixth century.  These buildings are famous for Lima (Peru). </p><p>  From the century before last to the present day the first scientific studies and impressions of travelers have reached.  Only in the 50s of the last century archaeologists began excavations.  It was possible to extract artifacts in large numbers, among which: </p><ul><li>  household items (ceramic products and textiles); </li><li>  stone tools; </li><li>  the remains of fruits, vegetables and animals. </li></ul><p>  The latter were probably presented to the deities so that they were more supportive.  Six years ago, researchers received information that they were able to find four mummies related to the pre-Ink culture of Vari.  Everything that was found in the excavation sites of Uaki Pukljana is now located as museum exhibits.  Nearby is the Huaca Pucllana restaurant, where visitors can, sitting at tables and savoring drinks, periodically turn their heads towards the architectural complex. </p>

    <h2>  "Sugarloaf" and other constructions of the Indians </h2><p>  In the San Isidro area, there is an <span>archaeological site</span> called Huaca Vallejarca (or Pan de Asucar, Spanish translation of ‚ÄúSugarloaf‚Äù) - a reconstructed clay pyramid.  The approximate time of its creation falls on the period between the 3rd and 6th centuries.  In the museum, near the pyramid, all discovered artifacts are exhibited. </p><p>  If you leave Lima from the southeast side and continue to move in the same direction, then after about 40 km you will be lucky to discover an archaeological complex called Pachacamac.  In ancient pyramidal temples, it is difficult to examine the traces of frescoes.  Also nearby are residential buildings and other objects of archaeological value.  Pachacamac complex is known as a religious center, therefore, for a long time invariably attracts pilgrims from all over the coastal territory of Peru. </p><p>  In the civilization of the Indians that preceded the Inca Empire many centuries ago, the deity Pachamak (translated as ‚ÄúHe who gives life‚Äù) was worshiped as the creator of the Universe.  He is subject to the most significant elements - earthquakes and fire.  According to researchers, in the territory where the Pachacamac complex is located, the first Indian settlements began to appear at the beginning of the third century from the birth of Christ.  About the specified period, the construction of the first religious buildings took place.  The peak of Pachamak‚Äôs power falls on the 7th century (the times of Vari culture).  Moreover, it was so large that neighboring lands fell into its sphere of influence.  Beautiful and majestic Lima (Peru).  Photos of ancient monuments can be found in this article. </p><h2>  Complex El Paraiso </h2><p>  Those who are planning a trip to the Pachamak complex would like to advise them to ascend to the Temple of the Sun.  Tourists enjoy the indescribable view of the Pacific Ocean, which can be observed only from the top of the mountain.  From this perspective, a completely different Lima (Peru) will appear. </p>

    <p>  Just two kilometers from the Peruvian capital, heading north, is the huge archaeological site of El Paraiso, which occupies more than 50 hectares of land.  It‚Äôs hard not to notice.  The buildings discovered on the territory of the complex date back to antiquity - over two millennia before the birth of Christ.  In those days, the population could be at least 3 thousand people.  And now in some places you can find what remains of the living quarters and places of worship. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the existence of the El Paraiso complex was known many years ago, none of the archaeologists seriously engaged in excavations.  December 2012 was marked by the beginning of the implementation of a grandiose project.  It took only three months for the excavation to be a major success.  The scientific world learned about the discovery of an underground religious center near the main religious building.  Its four levels relate to different historical segments and are arranged in chronological order.  Concerning the time of construction, a hypothesis was put forward that it falls on the third millennium BC. </p><h2>  Paragliding over Lima </h2><p>  Nothing can be compared with the impressions that remain after contemplating Lima from a bird's eye view.  This <span>type of excursion</span> is made possible by a paraglider.  A certified instructor is always with the pilot during the flight, so you can not worry about safety.  So the lack of any skills and experience cannot serve as an obstacle to getting pleasure and a dose of adrenaline. </p><p>  The city of Lima (the capital of Peru) is in great demand among tourists.  Health facilities are also located in the area.  By the way, in 2004 there was a large-scale strike of the city‚Äôs medical staff. </p>
