Bali is a fabulously beautiful island with unique flora and fauna.  There are also rich cultural traditions.  Therefore, with confidence we can say that these are real and truthful reviews of tourists.  Rest in Bali is a great opportunity to restore strength, get a charge of positive and joy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="handluggageonly.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best view of bali" class="if uuid-2311652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76668/2311652.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to stay in Bali </h2><p>  The choice is small: it is either rice plantations of Ubud or the coastal territories of the island.  Far from the ocean, the infrastructure, to put it mildly, is not developed: there are interruptions in the Internet, and there is practically no transport connection.  But Ubud attracts tourists with low prices for rental housing and the lack of resort bustle: life there is quiet and measured. </p><p>  The coast attracts surfers from around the world.  Also at the water's edge people who are simply in love with the ocean prefer to live.  But you have to pay for beauty and convenience: prices for services and accommodation in these areas are much higher than in the "continental" part of Bali.  Reviews of tourists on the network indicate that theft flourishes in crowded coastal areas.  Also there is very noisy and dirty. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the south and southwest of Bali, life is in full swing, and around the clock.  A lot of noise, fuss, people.  Not everyone likes this. </p><p>  The southeast coast is much calmer.  Moreover, the waves are not so big.  It is this part of the island that is widely represented on the Internet by a large number of photos and reviews.  Bali is most attractive in these places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kopyok.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel on the island of Bali" class="if uuid-2311613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76668/2311613.jpg"></div><h2>  Rental of property </h2><p>  Find and rent a house, room, apartment is not difficult.  The easiest way is to rent a scooter or bicycle and go on it to the desired area.  Simply ask passers-by about housing.  They will immediately tell you who is renting.  You can search through ads on social networks (primarily on Facebook). </p><p>  Many offers for renting rooms in villas or in costa. </p><p>  Costa is a kind of guesthouse.  Electricity, as a rule, is paid separately by the guest.  You need to be prepared for the poor and unstable work of the Internet.  And yet, according to reviews, in Bali, anywhere in the world, communication with the world is not reliable. </p><p>  Villas belong to luxury housing.  They are under 24-hour security.  Nevertheless, cases of theft are not uncommon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.balitourismboard.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Popular transportation in Bali" class="if uuid-2311680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76668/2311680.jpg"></div><h2>  Traveling Bali on a moped </h2><p>  Bali is in some ways similar to other Asian regions.  These territories are united by the love of their inhabitants for mopeds.  Unfortunately, the movement of bikers is chaotic.  Compliance with traffic rules is out of the question - local residents do not know what it is. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the summer season of 2017, renting a moped cost 800 thousand rupees (4000 rubles for our money) per month.  Car rental would cost one and a half thousand rubles a day.  By the way, in order to rent a car, you must show category B. </p><p>  You can rent a vehicle without any bureaucratic delays: no contracts, keys are simply handed over.  By the way, local law enforcement officers are very willing to take bribes.  Tourists who rested in Bali do not respond very well to local law enforcement officers: they like, they say, to profit from visitors. </p><h2>  Taxi service </h2><p>  In Bali, you can order a taxi through a special mobile application.  But there are many "bombs" that work unofficially.  Contacts with representatives of this ‚Äúcaste‚Äù often end in scandal: enterprising illegal taxi drivers seek to get the maximum benefit and deceive tourists. </p><p>  The services of official taxi services are distinguished by price loyalty.  Last summer, a transfer from the airport to Seminyak cost only $ 7 (about 400 rubles in equivalent).  For illegal carriers, prices are two to three times higher. </p><p>  In addition, it is possible to call a taxi motorcycle.  In our area you will not find such a wonder. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.myholidayguru.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach on the island of Bali in Indonesia" class="if uuid-2311620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76668/2311620.jpg"></div><h2>  Trade in Bali </h2><p>  A lot of small shops.  Customers in such establishments are languishing from the heat, as they, of course, do not have air conditioning.  But the prices are the most attractive.  There are also network sellers on the market: IndoMarket, Carrefour, Mini Mart, Pepito and others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Tourists should be vigilant when visiting the Mini Marta: sellers in these stores do not hesitate to cheat buyers. </p><p>  And in the assortment of "Pepito" there are products of European origin.  But this, of course, is not cheap pleasure. </p><p>  The main thing that distinguishes the stores in Bali from the Russian ones is the presence in almost every free toilet.  Free! </p><h2>  Internet on the island of Bali.  Reviews </h2><p>  Local providers are just awful.  Firstly, the Internet works at a snail's speed.  Secondly, failures constantly occur.  Often, apartment owners are cunning and claim that they provide high-speed and uninterrupted access to the network.  As a rule, in the vast majority of cases, this is an ordinary trick, designed for tourists.  It seems that on the island, in principle, there is no stable and fast Internet. </p><p>  You can purchase SIM cards of local mobile operators providing Internet access.  In this case, for 15 gigabytes of traffic you will have to pay about six hundred rubles (the price level of the past, 2017).  But this is not a panacea: the mobile Internet also works very badly.  It would seem a trifle.  But this fact, of course, overshadows the rest in Bali.  Online reviews suggest that this is not an exaggeration. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Relax in a hammock in Bali" class="if uuid-2311609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76668/2311609.jpg"></div><h2>  When to go to Bali </h2><p>  The high season falls on the months from May to October, that is, from late spring to mid-autumn.  Going to the island in April, it should be borne in mind that you will have to become a ‚Äúhappy‚Äù witness to the local New Year - Nyepi.  On this day, no institution works in Bali.  Even the airport, and that one is worth it.  People are not allowed to go outside.  The owners of the apartments warn their guests in advance so that they stock up on provisions.  The indigenous people of Bali believe that if someone takes to the streets on this special day, then evil spirits will notice this person and will commit atrocities for a whole year.  What a strange holiday! </p><p>  It is not surprising that during the ‚Äúcelebration‚Äù of this peculiar New Year many travelers leave to see the neighboring island of Lombok. </p><p>  <span>In February, Bali,</span> according to tourists, is flooded heavily.  Although with a great desire, you can enjoy a beach holiday even in winter.  It rains, as a rule, in the morning and in the evening, with good weather during the day.  And the temperature allows you to sunbathe on the beach.  Many go to Bali in March.  Reviews of tourists about rest in early spring are also very joyful and positive.  After all, March pleases vacationers with low prices for housing and food.  At the same time, it rains quite rarely. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.baliecostay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Traditional Bali Cuisine" class="if uuid-2311647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76668/2311647.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost of food and kitchen </h2><p>  The cuisine of the Indonesian islands is very diverse.  The cost of food varies and depends on the level of the institution and geographical location.  Last year, a snack in a cafe could be for 450-600 rubles.  For this money they will bring 2 any dishes and 2 drinks (fruit shake or juice). </p><p>  Many recommend trying the so-called bakso.  This is the name of the local meatball and tofu soup.  One serving costs only a dollar.  The soup is prepared right in front of visitors.  But local chefs, alas, did not hear about compliance with sanitary and hygienic standards: before cooking, the cook does not wash his hands, with unwashed hands he puts food on the plate. </p><p>  After visiting Bali, you must definitely try gado-gado (a very spicy first dish based on coconut milk), fried noodles with eggs (with chicken or fish), nasi goreng (fried rice with eggs and fish or chicken). </p><h2>  Local drinks </h2><p>  In Indonesia, it is far from everywhere that alcohol can easily be purchased: it is a Muslim country.  Often, the menu of many catering establishments generally lacks alcoholic beverages.  If you are lucky to find beer, then it will be sold at a very high price. </p><p>  But at every step very tasty all kinds of fruit necks (smoothies) are sold.  Drinks are prepared in front of customers.  It is delicious and very healthy. </p><p>  Bali is just a paradise for connoisseurs of good coffee.  Here you can enjoy the rich taste of different varieties: Luwak, Javanese, Balinese.  There are many shops selling local coffee at affordable prices. </p><h2>  Local fruits </h2><p>  Prices for local fruits (avocados and passion fruit) are very low.  You can not say about the prices of the usual apples and pears.  But practically no one takes them.  Is it worth it or go to Bali to eat pears with apples?  The answer is obvious - no! </p><p>  Fruits are sold by locals.  They are also sold in stores.  But prices in stores, of course, are much higher.  In addition, local residents are happy to bargain and give samples of their products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.myholidayguru.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Volcano on the island of Bali" class="if uuid-2311625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/76668/2311625.jpg"></div><h2>  Excursion programs </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there are no programs for Russian-speaking tourists.  You can join the English-speaking group.  But not everyone speaks a foreign language at a level sufficient to understand the guide.  But still, if you set a goal, you can find people on social networks who are ready to provide guide services in Russian. </p><p>  It is better to travel and explore the island on your own, in the company of friends, by renting a car.  On the Internet there is a fairly detailed and interesting description of all the key attractions of Bali.  Reviews of such improvised excursions are the most enthusiastic. </p><p>  Of course, you must definitely look at the Bali volcano, as well as take a trip to the picturesque beaches of the island. </p>
