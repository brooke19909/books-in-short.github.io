However, no matter how beautiful an ordinary chandelier is, the principle of its operation is always the same - part of the bulbs is turned on from one key, part from another.  But you want something new and interesting.  In addition, in the evening, especially in the winter, when it gets dark early, it is not very convenient to turn off the light and get to the bed by touch.  Sometimes even thoughts appear to hold a switch to bed so as not to suffer.  In such cases, a good solution would be to purchase a LED chandelier that works from the remote control, the connection and repair of which will be discussed in today's article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lalique.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="connecting LED chandelier with remote control" class="if uuid-3065560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/3065560.jpg"></div><h2>  The principle of operation and the installation of ceiling lights with remote control </h2><p>  The scheme of such a chandelier includes 2 groups of LEDs - the main and decorative.  The first is intended for lighting and most often has a cold or warm white tint.  The second, decorative, can be either plain or multicolor.  It serves to create a certain atmosphere and can work both in soft glow mode and in color music. </p><p>  The correct operation of both groups is provided by controllers connected to the signal receiver from the remote control, but there is also the possibility of manual control.  You can connect the LED chandelier to a two-gang switch or the included control unit, which is mounted in place of a simple disconnector. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Below is a video review of one of these devices with a remote control. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="jaWqoncIYt8" data-url="https://youtu.be/jaWqoncIYt8" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/0/6/8/14068.jpg"></div><h2>  What you should know when installing: safety precautions </h2><p>  When starting such a job, you should remember the safety rules for its production.  Connecting the LED chandelier to the network begins with a complete blackout of the line to which the room is connected.  To do this, disable the machine going to it.  It is not worth hoping that to release the voltage, just press the disconnect key.  After all, it is not known which "specialist" performed the installation.  It is possible that the switch does not open the phase conductor, but the neutral conductor. </p><p>  Next, the wires coming out of the ceiling are stripped and routed in different directions to prevent a short circuit.  Now you can apply voltage and find the phase wire (if there is a two-key switch, there will be 2 of them) and mark it.  After that, the voltage is turned off again, a check is made of its removal by the indicator.  Only after the production of all the above steps can you start connecting the LED chandelier. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oregonuforeview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="connection of an LED chandelier with a control panel" class="if uuid-3065102" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3065102.jpg"></div><h2>  Mounting the lighting device on a single-key switch </h2><p>  In this case, 2 or 3 (in the presence of grounding) wires will come out of the ceiling.  In this case, the yellow-green core is connected to the body of the chandelier, if it is metal.  It is better to connect the wires (supplying and from the lamp) not to the usual twisting, but using screw terminal blocks or self-clamping WAGOs.  Moreover, their design should be selected depending on the type of wire.  For flexible cores, you will have to purchase more expensive products with a mechanical clamp (reusable).  If a rigid copper or aluminum cable is used, disposable self-clamping can be used. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the connections are made, you can apply voltage and check the operability of the chandelier.  If the LED chandelier with the remote control is connected correctly, close and lock the decorative cover. </p><h2>  <span>Connecting luminaires</span> to a two-gang switch </h2><p>  Here the algorithm of work is almost the same, with slight deviations.  When searching for a phase, first leave only one key turned on.  Having noted the phase going from it, check the second and also mark it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.woodyrustics.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.woodyrustics.com/listing/472159295/steel-pipe-chandelier-with-rustic-wood"><img itemprop="image" alt="connecting LED chandelier" class="if uuid-3065112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3065112.jpg"></div><p>  When connecting an LED chandelier with a control panel, you need to pay attention to the color of its wires.  There must be two identical ones - phase conductors will be connected to them, and one different for zero.  Otherwise, all actions are identical. </p><p>  Important!  Regardless of whether work is performed under voltage or without it, it is necessary to use only high-quality tools with intact insulation.  After all, it is not known to whom it would occur to turn on the machine in the shield, especially if it is on the stairwell.  We in Russia do not have to be surprised at such things. </p><h2>  Mounting the LED control unit </h2><p>  Some models are equipped with a special dimmer.  It provides an opportunity to reduce the intensity of the light flux.  Also, the device allows you to switch modes and change color.  To install it, you will need to dismantle the switch, and instead connect the regulator.  It is not difficult to do this - just look at the diagram contained in the technical documentation of the device.  The very connection of a ceiling LED chandelier with a control panel is identical to the previous version. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://ru.aliexpress.com/af/0.html?SearchText=duplicator+automatic+garage+gate+door+remote+controller+with&amp;dp=c7951336d05924674407cb13346d1e3d&amp;af=151121&amp;cv=47843&amp;afref=https%253A%252F%252Fyandex.ru%252Fclck%252Fjsredir%253Ffrom%253Dyandex.ru%25253Bimages"><img itemprop="image" alt="connecting chandelier led ceiling" class="if uuid-3065108" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3065108.jpg"></div><p>  If you draw parallels, then the lighting device with a remote control is more convenient to use.  The control unit provides additional comfort, however, the more nodes, the lower the reliability - this is an indisputable fact.  Therefore, if there is a choice between an LED chandelier with a separate regulator and without it, it is better to stop on the second option. </p><p>  Recently gaining popularity ceiling lighting devices controlled by a smartphone.  Their cost is much higher, but there is not much difference between them and devices with remote control.  Then the question arises - is it worth it to purchase expensive equipment, if almost the same functionality is cheaper? </p><h2>  Height-adjustable lighting </h2><p>  Similar devices can be used for a dining area or a desktop in an office.  This is quite convenient when it is necessary to increase the intensity of lighting in a specific area without disturbing others.  There are no significant differences in installation with the previous options.  The fastening strength, as well as the correct connection of the LED chandelier with a height adjuster, are checked identically.  Exceptions are devices equipped with special motors.  They may contain not 2, but 3 controllers.  At the same time, one of them works with a mechanism for automatically raising / lowering the lighting device.  The cost of such ceiling lights is quite high.  Perhaps that is why they did not get too widespread in Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="homedesignalternatives.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://homedesignalternatives.com/dining-room-decorating-ideas/"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED chandelier with height adjustment" class="if uuid-3065131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3065131.jpg"></div><h2>  Some tips for purchasing a ceiling light </h2><p>  In order for the LED chandelier to please smooth operation for a long time, when choosing it, it is worth paying attention to some nuances: </p><ol><li>  First you need to inspect the packaging.  A self-respecting manufacturing company will not lay the product in a faceless gray box - it should be solid and tight.  Details must be indicated on it, a link to the site, contact numbers. </li><li>  It is mandatory to check two basic documents - certificates of conformity and quality.  And if the second can be compiled according to the norms of the producing country, then the second must be necessarily marked with Russia. </li><li>  Check that the warranty card is filled out correctly.  It stamps the date of sale, stamp and signature of the seller. </li><li>  The cash voucher must be kept - without it, warranty repairs can be forgotten. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="movableassets.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://movableassets.com/2014/10/"><img itemprop="image" alt="rooms with very high ceilings" class="if uuid-3065115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3065115.jpg"></div><h2>  What you should know about lamp repair </h2><p>  Like any equipment, such devices can fail.  And sometimes this happens immediately after connecting the LED chandelier.  This is unpleasant, but not fatal.  You should consider the most common malfunctions of such equipment and their causes: </p><ol><li>  The chandelier responds to the switch, but does not ‚Äúsee‚Äù the remote control - the batteries have run out, the remote control or the receiver has failed. </li><li>  The lamp randomly changes modes - a malfunction of the control unit. </li><li>  There is no reaction to the switch and remote control - lack of power, burning of the neutral wire. </li><li>  One of the modes does not work - the replacement of the corresponding controller is required. </li></ol><p>  Any damage can be corrected or replaced by a failed node.  The main thing is to approach this work with all responsibility and accuracy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.copycatchic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="connecting the LED chandelier to the network" class="if uuid-3065127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3065127.jpg"></div><h2>  Final word </h2><p>  Connecting an LED chandelier is no different from a regular one.  Their difference is only in the presence / absence of electronics and cost.  This means that if the home master is at least superficially familiar with electrical installation, this work will not be difficult for him, and the mounted ceiling device will please the eye with a soft and comfortable light for a long time to come.  After all, it is for this purpose that similar equipment is purchased. </p>
