Against the background of instability of the national currency exchange rate, oil prices, decrease in investment in the country, this issue is of paramount importance.  And it is not surprising that many are thinking about how to save money in such difficult conditions. </p>

    <p>  The situation is also complicated by instability in the banking segment.  As a result, citizens no longer have full confidence that through such tools as a bank cell or deposit, they can save their own savings.  And keeping them "under the mattress" is also far from the best option. </p><h2>  Reasons for economic deterioration </h2><p>  Before proceeding to consider how to save money, it would be more appropriate to determine why the Russian economy is currently going through far from good times.  The reasons for this situation are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Hostile policies of Western countries.  The economic sanctions of the leading Western European powers, the decrease in the number of foreign investors, the corruption component - all this seriously hit our financial market. </li><li>  Dependence of the Russian economy on oil prices.  Unfortunately, the Russian economy depends on commodity trading.  The fall in the cost of a <span>barrel of oil</span> automatically reduces the ruble, as a result of which the domestic central bank raises interest rates. </li></ol><p>  Given the above, it is really very difficult to predict where it will be profitable to invest capital, not to mention how to save money. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Expert opinion </h2><p>  At the same time, some economic observers are convinced that in the near future the country expects a decrease in household incomes and a decrease in lending in the banking sector.  In the second half of the year, the economic situation will improve somewhat due to new investments and projects. </p><p>  Almost all experts are inclined to believe that the political ‚Äúcomponent‚Äù will determine the Russian economy along with other factors: imposing their opinions on Western European countries, an attempt to implement territorial claims. </p><h2>  Bank strike </h2><p>  Another serious weapon that can be used to destroy the Russian economy is to disconnect the country from the international SWIFT system.  If this happens, then the ability to manage Western investment and equity placed in foreign banking institutions will be nullified. </p>

    <h2>  Ways to save your own savings </h2><p>  So how to save money in a crisis?  For some, the latter is a fierce threat, and for someone - an opportunity.  That is why today we should not choose a wait-and-see attitude and watch when the economic situation in our country straightens.  On the contrary, you need to be very active and act. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Real estate investment </h2><p>  Not sure what to buy to save money?  A profitable investment of capital remains and will remain the purchase of land, residential and commercial real estate - this is a ‚Äústable currency‚Äù.  However, do not forget that apartments and offices are becoming cheaper from time to time, so you should buy them in developing cities, where their cost in the coming decades will be reliable. </p><p>  Considering the question of what to buy in order to save money, it should be noted: after becoming the owner of a luxury apartment, do not expect that you will return the investment spent in a few months - this will take several decades.  If you are not ready to wait so long, then you should opt for other options for increasing capital. </p>

    <h2>  Foreign currency investments </h2><p>  You have no idea how to save money in a crisis?  The best way is to convert a certain portion of hard-earned money into foreign currency (Euros, American dollars, <span>Swiss francs).</span>  Against the background of instability of the ruble exchange rate, such a measure would be very appropriate.  However, in any case, part of its income must be stored in national currency, since it is very difficult to predict what its jumps will be at one time or another. </p><h2>  Bank deposits </h2><p>  If you are seriously worried about the question of how to save money from inflation, then the most common answer to it will be: with a <span>bank deposit.</span>  At the same time, you should not forget that using this tool is beneficial only if the storage of funds is implied for a long time, and financial losses may exceed interest.  Before trusting your capital, carefully check the reliability of a banking institution.  From the entire range of bank deposits, choose the one whose conditions allow you to withdraw the deposit in whole or in part without loss of interest.  It will be right to keep your savings not in one banking structure, but in several (keep in mind that the size of one deposit should not exceed the amount of 650,000 rubles - insurers give a guarantee on the return of the deposit up to 700,000 rubles). </p>

    <h2>  Precious metals </h2><p>  Some solve the problem of how to save money in Russia in a traditional and proven way - they acquire precious metals on them.  However, some experts believe that this is not only a standard, but also a risky way to save money.  They explain their position by the fact that silver and bronze are exchange products, therefore, their price can seriously fluctuate.  A huge number of Russians prefer to keep their capital in gold, because this <span>precious metal</span> never cheaper, but only more expensive.  In addition, gold has such a quality as durability, which means that after 100 years you can sell it at a profit for yourself. </p><h2>  Investment in mutual funds </h2><p>  Want to learn how to save and increase money?  Put them in one of the reliable property complexes, the activities of which will be coordinated by the management company.  This type of investment is something between a stock market activity and a bank deposit. </p>

    <p>  The most promising in terms of benefits is considered to be investment in bond and equity funds.  At the same time, be prepared for the fact that here you need to be able to take risks correctly. </p><h2>  Stocks </h2><p>  If you are seriously worried about how to save money in case of default, then it is best to invest them in stocks.

You need to constantly be in the know: every day to analyze the news, timely become a bidder and be able to competently play on the exchange difference.  In any case, the following awaits you: either you become a millionaire, or you go broke. </p>

    <h2>  General recommendations </h2><p>  If you do not want to lose your savings, reputable experts recommend that you follow some rules of conduct. </p><p>  First, create a <span>reserve fund</span> for yourself <span>,</span> which will be replenished monthly at a rate of 10% of your earnings.  If ‚Äúblack days‚Äù in the economy suddenly come, then the deferred money will help you stay afloat for some time.  If you are the owner of the company, you should also create a reserve fund, which will receive money for unforeseen expenses. </p><p>  Secondly, learn to save.  In recent years, the level of consumption in society has grown to enormous proportions, when both necessary and unnecessary things are bought.  The economic crisis reduces the degree of purchasing power, and the consumer begins to spend money wisely. </p><p>  Third, regularly review your family‚Äôs expenses.  Think about what costs you can refuse. </p>
