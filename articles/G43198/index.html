The spin speed is quite high, according to consumers, and reaches 1,400 rpm. </p><p>  Customers often choose this model for the reason that it belongs to energy class A. The manufacturer has provided for SensoCare technology, which ensures flawless washing.  You can get a clean cloth of any type at the output.  The function is responsible for combining the amount of water and temperature, speed and spin time. </p><p>  The sensor of the machine weighs the laundry and adjusts the washing parameters.  This allows you to save water and electricity, which, according to the hostesses, is very important today.  The Gorenie washing machine (Slovenia manufacturing country) has a heating element with a smooth nickel-plated surface.  Due to this, less scale is formed on the element.
