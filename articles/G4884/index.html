    <p>  Social benefits are provided in our country in accordance with the law ‚ÄúOn State Allowance for Citizens‚Äù.  A certain category of people can receive such a benefit; a special procedure is also provided for their payment. </p><p>  According to this law, this year the parents of the child, grandparents, immediate guardian or other relative who cares for the baby are entitled to receive benefits every month. </p><p>  <span>The payment</span> of the <span>childcare</span> <span>allowance</span> may be accrued only to one person; therefore, the employer may pay it only to the person for whom certain documents were issued. </p><p>  There is a slight difference in where you can receive social benefits.  In order to be appointed, you need to apply directly to your place of residence, to the <span>organization of social</span> guardianship (in the event that you do not use unemployment benefits).  After you apply for benefits to be awarded, a decision on his appointment will be made in ten days. </p><p>  If you are officially employed, you should contact your employer with this question.  If you are engaged in two or three jobs at once, the benefit in question must be paid at the main place of work. </p><p>  In order for you to pay social benefits, there are deadlines set by law: you must always contact the appropriate service before the child is two years old. </p><p>  Also today there are some features of obtaining these benefits.  So, if you go to work again, then immediately there will be a complete cessation of payments for child care.  But if before the end of the allotted period you decide to leave work, the payment of benefits will resume again. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If a woman begins to work part-time, the specified allowance will be paid in full.  It will also be charged if mom is a student and decides to continue her studies. </p><p>  In the place where you work, the allowance can be received along with the salary. </p><p>  The social benefits that a single mother receives are somewhat different from other charges of this kind.  In modern society and by law, the concepts of this <span>social status are</span> somewhat different.  So, according to Russian laws, a single mother is a woman who gave birth to her child out of wedlock, or after three hundred days have passed since the divorce was officially filed. </p><p>  The law provides for a certain amount of benefits for single mothers.  Very often, women do not have enough information about these payments. </p><p>  In order for a single mother to receive children's payments, she needs to submit an application and collect a package of documents.  These papers are represented by a birth certificate, a certificate from the Housing Office, a work book, passport, passbook.  All this seems to me to the social protection authorities, a certificate of family income is added. </p><p>  Children of single mothers who go to kindergartens and schools eat there for free.  There are certain benefits when paying for music classes, sports sections, art schools, and circles. </p><p>  All these benefits are valid until the child is eighteen years old.  And if a single mother has a disabled child, then she must provide four days off, which are additionally paid. </p><p>  In the Labor Code, such women are also entitled to a certain amount of privileges.  So, they have the opportunity to receive increased <span>child allowance.</span>  Single mothers are insured and have certain social guarantees in case the employment contract is terminated.  They are also given an additional vacation of two weeks <span>(without pay).</span> </p>
