  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to recover a sim card</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Small plastic rectangles - SIM cards - entered our lives along with mobile phones.  Our SIM card is always a real storehouse of important information, because on it we store both our entire notebook, and incoming SMS messages with touching declarations of love, and even carefully note the pin codes from our <span>bank cards</span> somewhere <span>.</span>  Therefore, the loss of a good old SIM card is always a real disaster.  Let's look at various life situations when the question arises, which is the title of this article. </p><p>  <strong>Situation No. 1. How to restore a SIM card if you forget the PIN code</strong> </p><p>  As they say, with whom it does not happen.  Remember that after entering the wrong PIN code three times, the SIM card will be blocked.  If this happened, then try to find in your bins an envelope with the contract that you were given when buying a SIM card.  Each SIM card relies on a PIN code and a Pak code.  Enter the pack code.  If you threw away all the documents issued with the SIM card, or even entered the pack code incorrectly, then read situation No. 2. </p><p>  <strong>Situation No. 2. How to restore a SIM card if it is damaged</strong> </p><p>  If for any reason your SIM card is damaged, broken or simply refused to work, you need to replace it.  Do not worry, your old number will remain with you.  To replace a SIM card, you should go to the nearest customer service center of your mobile operator (not to be confused with a regular network salon), without forgetting to take your passport.  As a rule, if you have documents, the SIM card issued in your name will be restored to you by the office staff in a couple of minutes.  Question price?  Check with your operator, but one way or another, recovery will not take away more money from you than purchasing a new SIM card.  In this case, the balance on your new SIM card will remain the same as on its predecessor, and your loved ones, friends and colleagues will be able to reach you by the numbers already known to them long ago. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Situation No. 3. How to restore a SIM card: loss of a SIM card with a mobile phone</strong> </p><p>  The trouble can lie in wait not only for your fragile SIM card, but also a mobile device that you can lose, drown in a pond.  The phone may steal.  In the event of such circumstances, you should immediately call your operator (this can also be done from a landline phone - you can easily find all the numbers on the Web), give your passport details and ask to block your SIM card, briefly explaining the reason.  Then you act similarly to situation No. 2, that is, keep your way to the service center. </p><p>  <strong>Situation No. 4. How to restore a SIM card if it is framed not in your name</strong> </p><p>  Yes, of course, it‚Äôs not so easy to solve the problem.  The fact is that if you, even for a long time, used a SIM card, which was issued to another person upon purchase, then it is unlikely to be restored.  Although ... you can, of course, try, however, your chances are small, since the operators carefully care about the safety and peace of mind of their customers.  However, there is good news for MTS subscribers.  If you come to the service center of this operator and ask to restore the SIM card that was not issued to you, you will be given a statement form in which you state the essence of the issue.  Then they will arrange a small (10 questions) questioning - what numbers do you call most often, how much and when did you pay for the phone last time, etc.  Answer - "flag", that is, a SIM card in your hands, do not answer - go yourself and look for the truth in another place. </p><p>  And finally, another situation that may entail the restoration of a SIM card.  If you have not called from a phone number for more than 90 days (there are some disagreements with the Law on Communications, which are related to the deadlines), then your number is canceled and after a short period can be sold to another client.  If you have time before this sad moment, you will be given the opportunity to restore your number, but for a fee. </p>
