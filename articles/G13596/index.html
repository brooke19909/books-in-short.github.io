They save space in the cabin and have high functionality.  The DVR and at the same time the radar detector of the Korean manufacturer Sho-Me Combo 1 is a vivid representative of such equipment.  Devices of this type allow you to control the situation on the road thanks to the recording in two modes: day and night.  The device from the Korean company "Sho-mi" is distinguished by reliability, workmanship and a long service life.  Sho-Me Combo 1 (DVR with radar detector) due to its multiple advantages has gained a large number of positive reviews in our country. </p><h2>  Key Features of a New Generation DVR </h2><p>  The Shambo Combo 1 video recorder has a color LCD screen (5.2 cm).

    <h2>  External design and equipment </h2><p>  Considering the latest ‚Äúbreakthroughs‚Äù in technology related to minimizing the size and streamlining of the shapes of various devices for a car, the video recorder in question looks quite voluminous, although many of the company's developments are compact.  The large dimensions of the Sho-Me Combo 1 are associated with a <span>horn antenna</span> installed inside the housing <span>,</span> designed for good reception of radar signals (speed control).  Many users note that the device on the windshield takes up very little space, does not obstruct the view and looks quite organic. </p><p>  The device in question consists of the following parts: </p><ul><li>  Microwave antenna horn. </li><li>  Video camera. </li><li>  Eye of the laser sensor. </li><li>  Slots for the bracket slide (upper plane of the device for the car). </li><li>  A display showing the driver a high-quality picture, which is an undoubted advantage of the technique. </li><li>  Holes speaker and microphone. </li><li>  MicroSD <span>card slot</span> (on the right side). </li><li>  On / off button. </li><li>  Power connector (on the right side of the device). </li><li>  Record button (on the left side). </li></ul>

The method of fixing the bracket is a suction cup made of silicone to the windshield.  There are double buttons on the device that are responsible for the quick and easy control of the equipment and work with the entire menu.  <span>The power adapter</span> does not have distinctive features. </p><p>  The device is made of high-quality black plastic (initially a brown-tinted device was produced in Korea).  The body is streamlined, with smooth transitions of lines.  The stylish design of the radar recorder will fit perfectly into any car salon.  Strong fixation is ensured by the presence of a suction cup.  The average dimensions of the device allow it to look neatly on the windshield of the vehicle. </p><p>  A charger connected to the cigarette lighter, a USB cable for connecting to a PC and a spare mount are supplied with the combination device. </p>

    <h2>  Combined DVR functionality </h2><p>  Using a modern and high-quality DVR Sho-Me Combo 1 is quite simple, the main thing is to turn on the device and drive.  Recording will start automatically as soon as power is supplied.  No special knowledge and skills are required from the driver.  The Sho-Me Combo 1 radar detector will begin to search for speed signals, as well as search for satellites in order to determine the territorial location of the vehicle.  It is best to purchase a memory card for these purposes, which will be discussed below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  All the necessary device parameters are displayed on the screen in a format similar to most mobile phones, so you don‚Äôt have to learn anything new.  Under the main picture and above it a status bar is displayed.  A red marker blinks at the top, indicating that the video is currently being recorded.  You can also see the current time, the amount of charge until the device is completely turned off, the microphone‚Äôs operating mode, a memory card is inserted or not, as well as a burning block of the included ranges for determining speed radars.  <span>Sho-Me Combo 1, reviews</span> of which are mostly positive, has a Lai-On battery. </p>

    <h2>  Characteristics of the device as a radar detector </h2><p>  The device has a voice notification, automatically saves all settings, updates the database of radars and all installed cameras (software update is possible).  Sho-Me Combo 1, reviews of which affect positive comments on radar detection ranges, works in all possible directions: from Amat and LISD to Places and Strelka, fixing the signal strength.  Modes with names such as ‚ÄúTrack‚Äù and ‚ÄúCity‚Äù can minimize false positives. </p><p>  The device has the ability to automatically mute the volume, the brightness of the display can also be adjusted.  At a certain selected speed, alerts about received signals can be turned off. </p><h2>  High quality video </h2><p>  When shooting video at the bottom of the screen, you can always see the time and date of what is happening (all data is synchronized with the satellite).  In addition, vehicle name and recorder name entries are output.  The speed of the vehicle, the coordinates of the current location of the vehicle are indicated.  Video is available for viewing in two video players. </p><p>  As a result of video recording, it turns out to be of excellent quality, all vehicles are well distinguished, events on the road do not blur (visibility distance is about 20 meters).  A higher range can be "extended" using post-processing freeze frame.  At night, the numbers of a passing vehicle are distinguishable (taking into account the brightness of the included headlights).  The processor of the device in question copes well with such a difficult task as brightness differences in the dark.  ‚ÄúHighlights‚Äù from oncoming cars are not observed. </p>

I like the quality of shooting, the presence of loop recording.  The emphasis is also placed on the convenience in removing and installing the device, many drivers consider the fastening reliability and the ability to turn in different directions to be a big plus.  The radar detector is a matter of admiration for car owners: everyone who purchased this device during the ride did not miss anything important, since the device captures absolutely everything. </p><p>  An experienced driver will appreciate the device that combines the two functions necessary for the trip - a radar detector and a DVR.  It is also worth paying attention to the wide dynamic range of the video, improved color reproduction in night mode, given the fact that for such a set of functions the price is quite affordable - from ten thousand rubles (the maximum that can be found in retail electronics stores is 15,000 rubles )  Based on the listed characteristics and positive feedback from consumers, the DVR and at the same time the Sho-Me Combo 1 radar is one of the best representatives in its sector. </p>
