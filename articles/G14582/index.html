    <p>  Tourists with children often choose day trips to nature reserves.  This includes visits to waterfalls, temples, a walk through the jungle, communication with animals. </p><p>  Fans of shopping in Patong also have something to entertain themselves.  At night, endless markets unfold here, where you can buy whatever your heart desires. </p><h2>  The cost of trips </h2><p>  Thailand is considered that country, the cost of trips to which can be much lower than a separate hotel reservation and airfare.  That is why the bulk of tourists come here on holiday packages, although if you plan a long vacation, then, of course, it is worth comparing prices: it is likely that an independent trip to this Asian country lasting about a month will cost less. </p><p>  Also, the price of tours to Tai much depends not only on the date of vacation, but also on the resort where you plan to go.  The cheapest destinations are Pattaya and Bangkok, here you can often find last-minute tours at low prices.  The sea, of course, in these cities is not as clean as on the islands, but the sights and nature are not inferior. </p><p>  Prices for trips to Phuket and Samui are an order of magnitude higher than for tours to Pattaya, but despite the high cost, the islands are gaining more and more popularity with tourists every year.  If you carefully examine the tourist market, then here you can find a cheap hotel and truly enjoy the beauty of the Gulf of Thailand. </p>
