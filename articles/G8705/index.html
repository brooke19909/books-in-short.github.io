Europa Park, Hansa, Fantazyland - in total there are about fifty such places in the country.  Almost every major German city has an amusement park for children and adults.  And many of them are ready to compete with the popular Parisian Disneyland.  Each of these amusement parks has its own characteristic - and regional - feature.  For example, in Lubeck, on the seashore, the Super Waterfall flows and the Flying Shark floats.  In Heide-Park - the highest tower Scream, where you can feel the sweet delight of <span>free fall.</span>  The city of Gunzburg will win your hearts by the fact that its amusement park is completely built from the Lego constructor.  And in Bruhl, which is halfway between Cologne and Bonn, in Fantasyland, there are so many attractions that it’s hard to describe.  But here we will talk about the real king of entertainment, which Germany is rightly proud of.  Europa-park is the topic of our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Germany europe park" class="if" height="426" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/465286.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is located </h2><p>  This is the second after Disneyland amusement park in the small town of Rust.  The place was not chosen by chance.  To Rust from Frankfurt am Main - 238 km, from Munich - 350, from Stuttgart - 170. The city is located near the border with France.  The world famous resort of Baden-Baden is only 60 kilometers from here.  This amusement town is located in the federal state of Baden-Württemberg (South-West Germany).  Europa Park is the closest (4 km) to <span>the</span> Ringsheim <span>train station</span> .  But the most convenient way to get to the town of Freiburg.  From there, special buses go to the park.  The same shuttles run from the Herbolzheim train station.  By car, follow the A5 (Basel - Freiburg) to Rust. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Europe park in Germany photo" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/465285.jpg" width="400"></div>

Since then, the rides have become more sophisticated, and the <span>audience</span> appreciated it.  In 2011, the park was visited by four and a half million guests.  It is the second most visited attraction town in Europe.  Since the founding of the European Union, the concept of the park has changed.  Its owner, Ronald Mack, has shifted the focus from simple rocking-swarms to the promotion of the united family of nations - the EU.  More than a hundred attractions designed with pure German pedantry, 100% safe, represent the countries of Europe.  In addition to roller coasters and the like, chilling entertainment, there are a variety of shows daily.  Since the calculation is to attract foreign tourists, knowledge of the language requires the minimum.  And in some representations this is not necessary either.  After all, 150 artists from more than 20 countries work here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Europe park germany reviews" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/465282.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <h2>  The infrastructure of the complex Europa-Park (Germany) </h2><p>  Feedback from tourists who have visited this region of thrills suggests that the vast territory is divided into sixteen thematic sectors.  13 of them represent European countries: Austria, Great Britain, Germany, Greece, Holland, Iceland, Spain, Italy, Portugal, three countries united under the name of Scandinavia, France, Switzerland and, finally, Russia.  There are three more fabulous lands that are not on the world map: the Viking Land, the Kingdom of Miniports and the Enchanted Forest.  Each sector bears the cultural characteristics of the region.  So, in “Italy” you will instantly find yourself at the center of the <span>Venetian carnival,</span> and in “Spain” - at a medieval tournament.  The Russian village, the myths of Ancient Greece, lost off the coast of Portugal Atlantis - all can not be counted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Amusement park" class="if" height="493" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/465283.jpg" width="600"></div>

So you can identify those attractions that will amaze your imagination.  But I must say that some of them do not let children who are not yet eleven.  It makes no sense to deceive the guard: if the child is below 140 centimeters, he will not be allowed.  But for little children, there are plenty of amusements in the park. </p><p>  Closest to the main entrance is "Germany".  The Europa Park is represented by the owners - a couple of funny Euro Mouse mice and Fan elephants.  German Boulevard will lead to the castle of Balthazar.  There rotten stumps sometimes turn into gnomes.  Reviews from extreme sports fans report that the highest <span>roller coasters</span> are located in France.  In “Iceland” they are smaller, but on the attraction “Blue Fire” the cars make a <span>dead loop.</span>  The water slide "Poseidon" is located in "Greece".  “Switzerland” is famous for the high-speed descents “Swiss bobsled” and “Lightning Matterhorn”.  The third most adrenaline ride is the wooden "Odin's Hills".  You can find rafting in the fjords in Scandinavia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Germany parks" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/465287.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Russian sector </h2><p>  With the money of Gazprom, the German amusement park has acquired, perhaps, the most exciting Euromir roller coaster.  The 980-meter-long track is twisted around five mirror towers.  Gondolas not only accelerate to 100 km / h, but also rotate around its axis.  Finding such an attraction is not difficult: just go to the sound of screeching skiers.  Next to the Euromir are models of the GUM and the space station.  You can have lunch at the Russian Village, and you can buy souvenirs at the Granny shop. </p><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  All such German parks, located, as a rule, in small towns, have hotels, campsites and guest houses.  Europa Park is no exception.  You can choose one of four hotels: Castillo Alcazar, El Andalus, Santa Isabel or the Colosseum.  Living in them will not only save you time on the road to the park.  Guests of these hotels have the exclusive right to access the attractions one hour before the official opening.  There is a separate entrance for this.  Tickets can be bought at the hotel reception. </p>
