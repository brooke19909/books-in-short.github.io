DTS mode - what is it?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the world of sound and video, there is such a thing as sound in the DTS format.  Often, movies in HD and Full HD quality provide such an audio track.  However, few people actually understand what the meaning is in the abbreviation DTS.  This is not only the name of the format, but also the name of the developer.  It's time to clarify the basic concepts of DTS.  What is this thing and why do users need it?  We will talk about this in this article.  But first, some information about the creation of DTS and the meaning that the developers originally invested in this abbreviation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thbp.dk" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.thbp.dk/movies/wallpapers/dts.htm"><img itemprop="image" alt="what does DTS mode mean" class="if uuid-2237839" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2237839.jpg"></div><h2>  DTS  History of creation </h2><p>  In 2004, one little-known American company introduced the world to a new development.  The guys decided to call her DTS.  <span>What it is?</span>  <span>This is a</span> high-quality multi-channel audio path that could be successfully used for voice acting of films instead of the usual Dolby Atmos.  The main difference from the latter is that TPA does not care how many channels there are in the user's speaker system.  The audio track is not based on the number of channels, but on the location of the subject in space.  Therefore, DTS can very well work both with acoustics in 7.1 format, and with ordinary stereo speakers.  This is truly a breakthrough. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.lifewire.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.lifewire.com/dts-neo-x-1846849"><img itemprop="image" alt="equipment with DTS function" class="if uuid-2237852" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2237852.jpg"></div><h2>  TPA in modern realities </h2><p>  Nowadays, TPA has completely supplanted Atmos from user computers.  This happened because the Atmos was rigidly attached to the configuration of the speaker system and the location of its individual components.  TPA is deprived of this drawback.  Therefore, its use is preferable to a regular user.  And the sound of DTS in our time is much better than the same Dolby Atmos.  Although the latter is still used in cinemas and other entertainment venues of a similar type. </p><p>  Nowadays, the situation looks like this: TPA is much more popular than the outdated and very demanding Dolby Atmos.  Therefore, even the owners of entertainment centers are seriously thinking about the possibility of a complete transition to the new standard.  As for PC and laptop users, they should take into account that only Microsoft operating systems (starting with Windows 7) and Mac OS from Apple provide Mac OS full support for this format.  Unfortunately, users of Linux, Ubuntu and other Linux-like systems remain out of work.  These OSs do not even know how to correctly convert multi-channel TPA to stereo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DTS Acoustic Scheme" class="if uuid-2237849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2237849.jpg"></div><h2>  Should I use DTS instead of Atmos? </h2><p>  This is a controversial issue.  Theoretically, the sound path in TPA should be much better, since a completely different compression ratio is used.  It is also not clear what to do if you have an acoustic system imprisoned for Atmos.  TPA developers declare that their codec doesn't care what columns the user has.  Sound DTS can convert to as many channels as necessary.  Therefore, it is worth taking a closer look at this format and codec.  It is much more convenient and simpler to use it than the outdated and technically very demanding Atmos. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of course, these statements are true for individual users.  And what about the owners of cinemas that purchased speakers specifically for Atmos?  They too can safely use TPA, as it adapts to the speakers.  And the sound quality should increase, since TPA uses a lesser degree of compression of the audio path.  So the owners of cinemas will also not be left out of the way when switching completely to this format. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gumtree.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.gumtree.com/p/home-cinema/yamaha-5.1-surround-sound-system-home-cinema-dolby-dts-with-speakers/1248974853"><img itemprop="image" alt="Appliances DTS AC" class="if uuid-2237861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2237861.jpg"></div><h2>  TPA mode in phones </h2><p>  Sometimes in modern smartphones you can find such an option as "DTS mode".  What is this thing?  Is its use in mobile devices justified?  In smartphones of recent production, the usual "improver" of sound, which is capable of creating pseudo-multi-channel sound, is called by the big name DTS.  However, when using headphones, this mode does not improve the sound, but rather worsens it.  It is technically impossible to achieve high-quality sound in an ordinary mobile phone (unless the device is equipped with a dedicated DAC).  Therefore, do not believe the big names.  It is better to use normal stereo mode.  The sound will be much better. </p><p>  The devices of the Huawei company (starting with Honor 2) are often equipped with such an "improver."  As a rule, the sound in headphones with the TPA option turned on becomes more voluminous.  But at the same time, the detail is completely lost.  Therefore, many users prefer not to use DTS mode.  What kind of improvement is this if the sound only gets worse?  You can, of course, purchase headphones with a dedicated DAC, but the sound from this is unlikely to get any better.  Mobile devices are not designed for high-quality music playback. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crutchfield.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="receiver with DTS X" class="if uuid-2237850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2237850.jpg"></div><h2>  Receivers with TPA support </h2><p>  Nowadays, almost all home cinema companies, individual receivers and even multi-channel amplifiers supply their devices not only with Dolby Atmos codec.  DTS decoder is also present in these gadgets.  And this is a prerequisite.  Moreover, most brands have already understood the full potential of the new technology and prefer to support the DTS format specifically.  Masters such as Denon, Yamaha, Marantz, Panasonic, Sony, Pioneer and others have already realized the charm of this technology.  But this does not mean at all that their devices have ceased to support Dolby Atmos.  Just TPA is a priority. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.whathifi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="receiver with DTS" class="if uuid-2237848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2237848.jpg"></div><p>  Now even the poorest and cheapest receiver supports DTS Sound.  What is this if not proof of the popularity of the format and decoder?  However, Atmos is not going to give up positions.  Manufacturers have not yet canceled its support.  Although this is quite possible in the near future. </p><h2>  TPA effects </h2><p>  Many users of PCs, laptops, and mobile gadgets often notice something like DTS Effects in some "advanced" players.  What is it?  These are special settings that apply when playing a particular file.  Theoretically, they should correctly interpret multichannel sound in the DTS format and convert it for playback on speakers of type 2.0.  However, in reality it‚Äôs just the settings of the software equalizer, which add a little clarity and volume.  And nothing more.  Of course, you can use them.  But the abuse of such settings will lead to distortion of the sound path.  And instead of a quality track, you get insane porridge. </p><h2>  The use of TPA at home </h2><p>  DTS decoder can adjust the sound to the speaker system that is used by a specific user.  Therefore, this format is more suitable for use at home.  Atmos is rigidly attached to the channels.  But in our apartments it is not always possible to correctly place multi-channel speakers.  Most often, our compatriots use the usual AC-format stereo.  And the DTS codec does a great job of converting multi-channel audio into two streams.  For a full and high-quality DTS, it is enough to have a modern receiver and some high-quality speakers in 2.0 format.  It is not necessary to spend money on multichannel acoustics. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  So, we just sorted out the DTS sound format.  That this is a high-quality audio path that can adapt to a specific speaker system is understandable.  But this is also the name of the company that invented this format and introduced it into use, the name of the decoder used in modern receivers, and the designation of the codec that is used in video players on computers.  TPA came into our life in order to replace the outdated Dolby Atmos.  And he has all the data for this.  Many have already understood the charm of the new format.  Yes, and HD-content on torrents is presented only with a track in this format.  The revolution has come true. </p>
