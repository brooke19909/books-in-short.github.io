This hotel is not a five-star club palace of the Thousand and One Nights, which many vacationers in Turkey are used to.  Just a modest family pension.  And he stands not on the shore, but in the center of the city.  Nevertheless, many of his guests really like it.  Almost a forest zone with fresh air, and at the same time - close to restaurants and shopping streets.  Calm, measured life and tempting mountain routes.  Deep blue sea and youth parties.  And this is not all that this mini-hotel in the Toros Mountains can offer you.  No wonder the guests often call him the best "troika" of all possible in Kemer.  But let's talk about all this in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Infinity hotel 3" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/450479.jpg" width="315"></div>

    <h2>  Kemer - the city where the hotel is located </h2><p>  Infinity Hotel 3 * is located in one of the most popular and rave places in the Mediterranean coast of Turkey.  This is Kemer, historical Lycia, which was known even during the time of Alexander the Great.  It is located near Antalya.  Its main wealth is green forests on the hillsides and the gentle warm sea.  As well as caves, waterfalls, fresh water grottoes and beautiful landscapes.  The sea is classically bathed here - between May and October.  But some manage to plunge into salt water in the winter.  If earlier under the name ‚ÄúKemer‚Äù an old Turkish village was hiding, now they call it a huge resort area, consisting of nearby villages.  These are Tekirova, Goynuk, Beldibi ... But the Infinity Hotel 3 * hotel on the map of Kemer is located in its central part. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Infinity hotel 3 kemer center" class="if" height="218" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/451199.jpg" width="293"></div>

Groups of vacationers use a transfer from their company or hotel, and individual tourists just sit on dolmushi, which depart from the bus station every quarter of an hour or after filling.  But there is no direct connection between the airport and the ground station.  I have to go with a change.  City buses run to the station from where the minibuses depart.  Transport links are developed and very convenient, so you can get here almost until late in the evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Infinity hotel 3" class="if" height="219" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/451200.jpg" width="291"></div>

From sports entertainment - billiards, darts, table tennis.  You can watch a large company TV in a special salon.  In the evenings, shows are sometimes held - belly dancing, discos - only until the lights out, that is, until ten in the evening.  There is no animation of its own, but these entertainments are the work of the bartender.  There is an opportunity to play volleyball and football, as well as engage in water sports.  The public at the hotel is different, mainly international: Poles, Germans, Dutch.  So you can get to know each other at parties. </p><h2>  Bars and Restaurants </h2><p>  Infinity Hotel 3 *, despite its three-star rating, is not a bed and breakfast boarding house, but offers its guests the same all inclusive system.  You can eat in the main restaurant and two bars (one of them is by the pool).  Rich, plentiful breakfasts: milk, jam, honey, cottage cheese, yoghurts.  Lots of baking.  On hot, often chicken, fish and a variety of vegetables.  Good cheeses and mashed soups.  Every Sunday there is an incendiary ‚Äúgrill party‚Äù with barbecue and barbecue.  The bar mainly serves light snacks, beer and local wine.  Meals can also be ordered in the room.  However, this, like ice cream, fresh juices, drinks at a disco, is paid.  You must also remember that "all inclusive" does not work around the clock, but until the end.  Bars serve drinks and snacks for free until twenty-two hours.  During excursions, tourists are given <span>dry rations.</span>  More demanding vacationers who want to taste Turkish cuisine will find many restaurants and cafes nearby in Kemer, where you can have a cheap meal.  Tourists write that the food is tasty and similar to homemade.  Every day - fruits and watermelons.  They praise pastries and spaghetti with feta cheese. </p><h2>  Beaches and the sea </h2><p>  The sea from the Infinity Hotel 3 * is quite far.  There are only two beaches in the village, and both are municipal.  One of them is pebble, and almost all first-line hotels are located on it.  And the second (near the Moonlight Park) is sandy, bulk.  To the nearest beach you need to go seven hundred meters.  Pebble beach, so you‚Äôll probably need slippers.  But to the sandy strip by the sea, which is assigned to the hotel - a kilometer and a half.  But a special bus runs from the hotel to the beaches.  He has a flight schedule and goes to the sea twelve times a day.  This schedule usually hangs on the <span>information</span> desk of the reception.  Near the sandy beach of Callisto there is a small water park and a dolphinarium.  So the children will have fun there.  Since all the beaches are public, then, of course, umbrellas, sunbeds and deck chairs are paid there.  And on the sandy shore there are also gazebos with curtains and soft seats.  Recently, the hotel bus has been taking tourists to the new Kindyl beach (pebble, with a pier, closer to Goynuk).  In addition, the hotel itself has two swimming pools, one of which is designed for very young children.  True, you can‚Äôt swim there after six in the evening.  But it is clean, it is being monitored, and chlorine is practically not felt in the water.  A special wooden sun terrace surrounds the pool.  Free sunbeds and mattresses are always there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Infinity Hotel 3 Kemer" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/450513.jpg" width="600"></div>

Visit Kemer parks: ethnographic Yoryuk and entertaining ‚ÄúMoonlight‚Äù.  Well, if you want to see the sights that are further away, then the hotel can organize trips to the fantastic surroundings of the city.  You will see the ancient ruins of Phaselis and Olympos, located in the coniferous forests by the sea, and the fire-breathing Mount Musa-Dag in the village of Cirali, and the zoo in the village of Tekirova (and at the same time try the amazing fish that is prepared only here).

Wi-fi at the hotel is paid, it costs about ten dollars a week.  Sun loungers and the place on the beach where the bus carries are three conventional units per person (because the beach is alien).

Many people call their vacation excellent, including families with children.  Guests note that tourists often move to Infinity from other hotels of this class due to the fact that it is less clean, comfortable and quiet.  The quality of food in the hotel is also better than in the surrounding "treshki".  A lot of positive feedback about the wonderful nature around, which simply pleases the eye.  The hotel is liked by young people who love to hang out.  And so many excursions are offered that tourists complain: either they didn‚Äôt pay because they traveled, or they overlooked them because they refused the art of traveling.  An excellent hotel in order to see beautiful landscapes, swim in the warm sea and live in a clean quiet place - this is how our compatriots summarize their impressions of the hotel.  If you tune in to a good rest, then not in every ‚Äúfive‚Äù it can be so great. </p>
