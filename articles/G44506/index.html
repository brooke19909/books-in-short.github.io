    <h2>  Mohair Properties </h2><p>  A thread made from Angora goat fur has several advantages: </p><ul><li>  Hypoallergenicity.  The high-tech process for the production of mohair allows you to get yarn of excellent quality.  Natural mohair does not cause any allergic reactions.  Even if a thing made from this type of thread is put on a naked body, then neither itching, nor redness, nor any other irritation of the skin will occur. </li><li>  Comfort  Things knitted from mohair yarn retain heat well.  At the same time, it is not hot in them, since the canvas easily passes air. </li><li>  Strength.  Although the natural mohair thread is very thin, it is very difficult to break it.  And the canvas, knitted from it, retains its shape and structure well the entire period of wear. </li><li>  Wear resistance.  During washing and drying, it is important to comply with all the rules for performing these procedures, then the product does not deform (does not stretch and does not fall off).  Mohair lends itself well to painting by special means, with subsequent good performance properties, that is, the color does not wash off and does not fade when processing the product. </li><li>  Ease.  Knitting mohair with knitting needles allows you to get almost weightless things as a result.  A shawl, cardigan, sweater, beret or other wardrobe items made of this type of thread are practically not felt on the body, but at the same time they warm well and create a festive and gentle look. </li><li>  Security.  Mohair thread slowly gets wet.  This property can be very useful if you are exposed to rain.  A sweater or jacket made of mohair will be able to save the body from hypothermia for some period of time.  Yarn of this type is slowly ignited, which is also another of its advantages. </li></ul><h2>  Classification of Mohair Yarn </h2>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main types of mohair threads are divided into species depending on how old the animal or whose fur is the starting material.  Kid Mohair yarn is the thinnest and most delicate.  The thickness of the villi is not more than 27 microns.  Such a thread is made from the wool of the kids, which are sheared for the first time.  Air shawls, stoles, scarves, and children's things are made of it.  Knitting from kid mohair with knitting needles can be compared to weaving lace.  Products look like thin cobwebs. </p><p>  As a result of cutting animals from 1 to 2 years old, wool is obtained from which Goatling yarn is made.  It is slightly thicker and tougher, but this does not impair its qualities and properties.  Use it to make sweaters, vests, cardigans, dresses and other types of clothing. </p><p>  The wool of an adult goat (from 2 years) as a result of processing turns into a Goatling mohair.  Such a thread differs from the previous ones in a higher degree of stiffness and strength.  At the same time, it retains all the properties of mohair.  Its thickness is 30 microns.  In addition to clothing, yarn is used to make plaids. </p><h2>  Composition of mohair yarn </h2><p>  So that natural wool fibers of the thread hold the shape well, it is spun with the addition of a court - a material that fastens the hairs.  Therefore, it will be wrong to say that mohair is a 100% woolen thread.  Today's technology allows the production of yarn, which consists of 83% Angora goat wool.  If you see yarn, where the number will be indicated more, know that before you fake and knitting from mohair with knitting needles (just such a "mohair"), you most likely will not bring any pleasure.  A combination of yarn with other types of yarn is allowed.  In this case, goat hair makes up from 10 to 80% of their total amount, which should also be indicated on the label. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__fyw"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__1-vn-module__fyw"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__2-vn-module__fyw"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__3-vn-module__fyw"></div><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__4-vn-module__fyw"></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  We knit from mohair: tips </h2><p>  If you decide to make the product yourself from a thread of this kind, be sure to take note of the following recommendations. </p><p>  Having decided on the model of the future product, you need to choose yarn and knitting needles.  When buying threads, carefully read the information on the label attached to the skeins.  If the composition of the thread suits you, pay attention to the recommended size of the needles for work.  The quality of the future knitted fabric depends on them.  <span>Openwork knitting</span> with mohair is obtained by using a tool whose thickness is 2-4 times the thickness of the yarn.  A warmer and denser fabric is made with a small number of knitting needles. </p><p>  Before you start knitting with the needles of a model from mohair, practice the selected pattern.  At first, it may be difficult for beginner needlewomen to work with such a thin and soft thread, but after knitting several rows of a sample your hands themselves will "understand" with what stretch to hold the yarn and how to tighten the loops.  After that, you can begin to implement the product itself. </p><p>  The next part of the article presents models of garments that can be knitted from mohair.  Focusing on them, you can make such beautiful and warm things with your own hands as a scarf, sweater and sweater. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How to knit a scarf? </h2><p>  Knitting a mohair scarf with knitting needles by technology is no different from making it from another kind of yarn.  When calculating the loops, keep in mind that the thread is thin, so their number will be larger than if you knit a product of the same size, but from a <span>thicker yarn.</span>  If you plan to get a scarf as a result of the work, which will be used specifically for warming the neck, then it is better to make it with a thread in two or even three additions with patterns from the front and back loops: elastic bands of different types, pearl pattern, ‚Äúcheckerboard‚Äù.  Then the canvas will turn out to be voluminous and very warm.  Lightweight female scarves resembling lace are knitted in one thread.  They are more used as a decorative decoration of the general image.  For the manufacture of such accessories use <span>openwork patterns of knitting</span> with mohair.  The photo shows a diagram of one of these drawings.  The scarf or scarf made by him will turn out to be weightless and very tender. </p><h2>  Knitting a fluffy warm sweater </h2>

    <p>  The model of this wardrobe item, the manufacturing process of which is described below, refers to the unisex style.  It is suitable for both men and women.  Focusing on the calculations presented in this master class, as a result you will get a 48 size sweater. </p><p>  For work, you need knitting needles on fishing line No. 5 and 400 g of mohair / wool / polyamide yarn (100 m / 50 g). </p><p>  Knitting sweaters from mohair or any other yarn with knitting needles starts from the bottom edge.  For the manufacture of this model, dial 82 loops.  Start work on creating the front part.  Perform elastic by alternating one front and one wrong loops.  Knit this pattern until the width of the placket reaches 6 centimeters.  Next, go to the execution of the front surface.  Knit the fabric in a straight line until the total length of the part is 57 cm. Now perform the reduction to form a neckline.  To do this, close the central 8 loops, and then knit each shelf separately, continuing to reduce the number of loops for rounding.  In each second row from each inner edge, close 1 loop of 2 loops and 3 times of 1. After that, close the loops that remain on the knitting needles.  The total height of the canvas should be about 64 cm. Similarly, knit the back part, but only to cut the neck at a height of 64 cm, close the central 12 loops, and 3 loops 1 time from each edge. </p>

    <p>  Next, we knit sleeves from mohair.  On the knitting needles, dial 32 loops and make an elastic band 1 x 1 strip 5 cm wide. In the last row add 24 loops at an equal distance from each other.  Knit the sleeve further with ordinary facial stitching, performing additions to form a bevel.  To do this, add 1 loop 13 times in each 4th row in each 4th row, and then 1 loop 4 times in each 2nd row.  When the sleeve reaches 44 cm, finish the job.  Tie the second part in the same way. </p><p>  The knitting patterns of the mohair are over.  Now proceed with the assembly of the product.  Connect the front and back parts along the shoulder seams together.  Next, lift the loops on the knitting needles along the neckline and knit 6 cm with an elastic band, forming an edge.  Sew the sleeves and sew them in a sweater.  The last seams are drawn along the side lines of the product.  Hide the ends of the threads on the wrong side.  Fluffy warm sweater is ready! </p><p>  The presented description is a guide to the implementation of the classic sweater model.  If you need a larger product, initially increase the number of loops.  To reduce the pattern, respectively, reduce the number of loops in the set row. </p><p>  Experienced needlewomen can make a sweater not with a smooth surface, but with any other desired pattern.  On mohair products, drawings from plaits or braids look good.  They also belong to the category of patterns suitable for women's and men's products. </p><h2>  Knitting sweaters from mohair </h2><p>  The next master class tells how to make a women's sweater with knitting needles for sizes 42-44.  This model is knitted with a double thread (yarn consumption - 100 g / 200 m), which contains 70% mohair and 30% acrylic.  In the work it is recommended to use knitting needles No. 4, 7, 9, as well as circular No. 9. </p><p>  The product is carried out in two patterns - the front surface and the <span>English gum.</span>  How do we knit them?  Schemes for the implementation of these figures, as well as conventions are shown in the photo below.  Let's look at the sequence of the details of the sweater and their assembly into the whole product. </p>

    <p>  To tie the backrest, for knitting needles No. 7 you need to dial 59 stitches.  Knit them with the front surface, reducing on the sides in each 10th row 1 loop 3 times.  As a result of this work, 53 loops will remain on the knitting needles.  When the height of the part reaches 28 cm, add 1 loop 3 times in each 8th row from each edge.  And again, 59 loops will remain on the knitting needles.  At a web height of 46 cm, begin to perform armholes.  To do this, close 3 loops on both sides of the product, and then 1 loop 3 times in each 2nd row.  As a result, 47 stitches remain on the knitting needles.  To form a neckline at the 18th centimeter from the beginning of the armholes, close the middle 17 loops.  For rounding, perform additional additional reductions along the inner edges of the neck 2 times in 2 and 1 loop in each second row.  When the height of the backrest reaches 66 cm, bevel the shoulders.  To do this, on each shelf, close 5 loops 2 times in each 2nd row.  On this knitting finish.  The total height of the product will be approximately 68 cm. </p><p>  So, we gradually master the simple knitting of mohair sweaters with knitting needles.  Next, we proceed to the design of the right shelf of the front part.  On knitting needles No. 7, type 4 loops and knit the front surface, while doing additions on the right side (where there will be a fastener) in each second row 3 times 1 loop, 7 times 2 and 4 times 1 loop.  At the same time, carry out the fitting in the same way as you did on the back part.  When the height of the shelf is 42 cm, perform the reduction to form the neck.  To do this, reduce in each 4th row after the edge 9 times 1 loop.  At a detail height of 46 cm, close 3 loops to form an armhole, and then 3 times 1 loop in each second row.  When the total height of the part reaches 66 cm, bevel the shoulder similarly to the part of the back and finish knitting.  Perform the left shelf symmetrically with the right. </p>

    <p>  We continue to knit mohair with the <span>needles of a women's sweater by</span> decorating our sleeves.  Now take the tool at number 9 and dial 39 loops.  Knit the fabric, alternating the patterns "English gum" (11 cm) and "front surface" with knitting needles No. 4 (3 cm).  When the part reaches a height of 59 cm, stop changing patterns and tie the product only with English rubber.  At the same time, make reductions along the edges to form a sleeve ridge in each second row 1 time 2 loops, 7 times 1, and 1 time 2 loops.  Close the remaining 11 stitches on the needles.  The total height of the part will be approximately 70 cm. Tie the second sleeve in the same way as the first. </p><p>  The next stage is the assembly of the details of the sweater in a single product.  Sew the sleeves and sew them in the right places.  Next, connect the parts of the back and shelves along the lines of the shoulders and sides.  Now start knitting a wide border.  To do this, lift 252 loops on circular knitting needles No. 9 around the edge of the sweater and knit a band of 18 cm wide with English rubber. Next, close the loops, cut the thread. </p><h2>  Options for the execution of other products in one description </h2><p>  Elegant, warm, soft and very stylish jacket will turn out as a result of such an exciting type of needlework as knitting.  A mohair cardigan, coat, sleeveless jacket are those things that you can accomplish by focusing on the above master class.  Increase the height of the shelves and parts of the back to the size you want, and the product will be longer.  These will already be blanks for an elegant cardigan or an original coat.  Sleeveless will be even easier.  Instead of sleeves, neatly tie the armholes with several rows of English gum and close the loops. </p><h2>  Care for Mohair Yarn </h2>

    <p>  Knitting from a thin mohair with knitting needles is a rather laborious task, but very exciting.  In order for the items made by your golden pens to last for a long time, it is important to properly care for them.  Wash them with your hands in warm water (30-35 degrees) with the addition of a wool cleaner.  You can use regular shampoo instead.  Do not wash the mohair in the machine and especially do not use the "Spin" function.  After soap treatment, rinse the product thoroughly in several waters and gently wring it out by hand.  Then lay it out on a horizontal surface, spreading all the details.  Place a sheet folded several times or a fluffy towel under the product.  Moisture will be absorbed in them.  Dry the mohair in a warm place.  Avoid direct sunlight.  Turn your clothes over to the other side from time to time.  If the product is wrinkled, wrap it (wet) on a rolling pin or towel folded into a roll, and gently roll it on the table.  Then fold it back carefully and leave to dry completely. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Knit with needles?  The diagrams, descriptions, recommendations given in this article will help all needlewomen to master the technology of making products from thin mohair yarn.  We wish you successful mastery of new knowledge and skills in this craft, beautiful and original works, and light eyelets! </p>
