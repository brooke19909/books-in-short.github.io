Despite the fact that this is a fairly small village, it has everything you need for life.  If we talk about Vardan, its attractions are distinguished by one interesting fact.  Many tourists are attracted by the local cuisine.  After all, these are unique dishes that can be tasted only in these places - as recipes are known exclusively to indigenous people.  So, gourmet gourmets are frequent guests of Vardane.  In general, this place definitely has something to do.  The gentle sea, a pleasant pebble beach - many just come for this.  Boat trips are also carried out on a boat or yacht.  There is everything you need for a comfortable pastime: cafes, restaurants, bazaars, small shops, ‚Äúlive‚Äù music in the evenings.  And in the neighboring village called Loo there is a water park, which is definitely worth a visit. </p><h2>  Description of the village </h2><p>  Honestly, even the language does not dare to call Vardana a village.  It looks more like some small foothills of Scotland.  The first impressions of getting into Vardan are very bright - a riot of colors, green hills, a high, clear sky.  The nature in which this village seems to bathe amazes with its diversity.  What are the high <span>Caucasus mountains, the</span> sight of which is breathtaking.  The beach strip stretches along half a kilometer - this is a very long coastline for such a place.  By the way, it‚Äôs very convenient to enter the water - the beaches are pebbled, this is firstly, and secondly, the bottom is shallow, which by itself determines a comfortable entry.  Because Vardane, whose attractions are mainly concentrated on the coast, is a great place to spend time with children here.  And it's not just about the sea and beaches.  Tourists can visit children's attractions, water parks - this area of <span>entertainment in the Lazarevsky</span> area is very well developed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
