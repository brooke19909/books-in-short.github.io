    <h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  The formed village occupied 13.5 thousand acres of land and was named Nikolaevsky.  But in 1885, having become a county town of the Turgai province, it was renamed Kostanay.  From the Kazakh language, this word was translated as "parking of the Kazakh tribe."  It was formed from two components: "braid" - a yurt, and "Tanay" - a Kazakh tribe.  In 1884, a church, court, school and other public buildings were built on its territory.  By 1913, the city of Kostanay was replenished with new residents.  Its population reached 28,300 people, whose main activity was agriculture. </p><h2>  Further development </h2><p>  This was possible due to its location on fertile chernozem lands.  Widely developed trade.  The city of Kostanay served as a commercial platform for such goods as salt, fish, leather, wool, grain, furs, flour, meat, beer and other agricultural products.  In order to expand the delivery of products to other regions of Russia, a railway was built in 1913. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Industry in the city began to develop only after several enterprises producing shoes, artificial fiber, and clothes were evacuated to its territory during the Patriotic War.  In order to ensure their work, as well as the comfort of the workers, they began to lay engineering networks, equip the city, and green the streets. </p>

    <h2>  Memory of centuries </h2><p>  The main streets of the city of Kostanay, and at first there were only ten of them, were witnesses of the events that took place here throughout its existence.  Most often, street names reflect the historical past, the names of the heroes.  And at the end of the 19th century they were called here according to the name of the provinces, where the settlers arrived from: Tomsk, Penza, Tashkent, Samara, Troitskaya, Orenburg and others. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main street was Bolshaya.  She ran from the Tobol River to the railway station.  It housed the houses of wealthy merchants - Yaushev, Kargin - as well as grocery stores and shopping malls.  Soviet power gave this street a new name - Proletarian.  Two years later, she began to be called Soviet.  And after two more - by Lenin Street.  But more than once she had to go through the renaming.  In 1975, it became Leninsky Prospekt, and in 2000 - Al-Farabi Avenue. </p><p>  In general, many streets in the city with the advent of Soviet power began to be called differently.  And this is not surprising.  Tsarskaya became the street of Leo Tolstoy, Barabashevskaya was renamed in honor of Lawrence Taran.  But this happened in many cities at that time.  The main thing is that the renaming does not affect what was located on these streets.  And in Kostanay, you can see many interesting buildings and monuments on them. </p>
