  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Quadcopter Syma X5C with camera: instruction</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern quadrocopters with cameras allow you to capture truly gorgeous views.  However, their cost is quite high, and not everyone can afford such an expensive "toy".  Yes, and for beginners it will not be the best decision to immediately buy an expensive model.  For such cases, the Syma X5C is the right choice.  This quadrocopter, despite its low cost, allows you to understand the basics of control, as well as take your first videos from a bird's eye view.  In order to understand what is remarkable for this model, you should familiarize yourself with its official characteristics, as well as user reviews. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  This model is an ultra-budget solution for those who want to get acquainted with the capabilities of quadrocopters and feel in the role of operator and pilot.  It is equipped with a simple camera that allows you to record low resolution video.  This will be enough to conduct training flights. </p><p>  A 3.7 V battery and a capacity of 500 mAh are used as an energy source.  It lasts on average for 6-7 minutes of flight, which is a good result for a copter of this class.  Its weight is only 108 grams in a complete set, so it is recommended to carry out flights either in full calm or with minimal wind.  Otherwise, it will be rather difficult to keep it and there is a risk of losing this interesting toy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="quadrocopters.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="quadrocopter syma x5c" class="if uuid-2779768" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779768.jpg"></div><p>  The main traction force of the <span>Syma X5C quadrocopter</span> with a camera is provided by four collector-type motors, which are the best option because they are able to work stably at high speeds.  For control, a remote control is used, in which it is necessary to install 4 AA batteries.  It allows you to set the height and direction of movement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thanks to the built-in 6-axis gyroscope, the quadrocopter is able to position itself well in space, confidently keep its direction, and also freeze in place in calm weather. </p><p>  To shoot video on the Syma X5C, a camera with a resolution of 0.3 megapixels is used.  The result is a video file with sides of 640 * 480 pixels.  For artistic shooting, this, of course, is not enough, however, as a training sample, these indicators are enough. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gizlogic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="quadcopter syma x5c with camera" class="if uuid-2779769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779769.jpg"></div><h2>  Factory equipment </h2><p>  The quadcopter, in fact, is completely ready for use out of the box, you only need to buy batteries for the remote control.  The drone itself is delivered in a partially disassembled state - before the flight, you need to install the screws, protection, camera and landing supports. </p><p>  In addition to the above, the kit includes a cable for charging the battery, a card reader for connecting memory cards to a computer or laptop, a set of spare screws, a screwdriver and an English-language book with recommendations for the user.  The Syma X5C instruction in Russian is unlikely to be needed, since it is possible to understand the management and assembly intuitively, as well as using the above illustrations. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Basic principles of operation </h2><p>  The maximum distance at which reliable signal transmission can be ensured is about 50 meters.  However, even under direct visibility conditions, the signal can sometimes be interrupted.  If this happens, it is recommended to try to get as close to the copter as possible to be strictly under it.  If you adhere to these recommendations, the chance to reconnect and not to drop the drone to the ground is quite high.  Since its mass is small, drops do not always lead to damage, but it‚Äôs better not to risk it again. </p><div class="photo" data-original="droneandquadcopter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="syma x5c instruction in Russian" class="if uuid-2779770" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779770.jpg"></div><p>  It is recommended to indicate your phone number on the case, so that in case of accident there is a chance to regain the toy.  You can lose the Syma X5C quadrocopter without observing the flight time and suddenly discovering that the battery is dead.  Therefore, during the flight, the wound-up timer will not interfere, which will notify about the imminent discharge of the battery. </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  If it was decided to fly with a little wind, it is best to start a flight against its direction.  Thus, even if the connection is lost or the battery dies, the Syma X5C quadrocopter will bring it closer to the operator, and it will be much easier to find it. </p><p>  If unreadable files appear on the camcorder's memory card, you should not immediately attribute this to a malfunction and delete them.  Most likely, this is a consequence of a sudden power outage, which is why the file simply was not completed correctly.  Checking the flash drive using the standard chkdsk utility will help repair the damaged file and view it. </p><p>  In order to increase the flight time, it is recommended to purchase a 750 mAh battery.  It has the same dimensions, but slightly more weight.  Thanks to such a replacement, it will be possible to fly on a single charge up to 10 minutes.  In addition, having several charged batteries with you, you can replace them directly in the field, which will allow you to make several flights in one go. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gizmoreport.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="syma x5c instruction" class="if uuid-2779771" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779771.jpg"></div><h2>  Model reviews </h2><p>  Better than those who have already tested this quadrocopter in the field, no one can describe it.  That is why it is worth paying attention to the reviews and instructions for Syma X5C users who were able to test it.  Among the positive aspects, they note the following: </p><ul><li>  High strength.  Due to its small mass and durable plastic, the quadrocopter is well experienced in collisions with obstacles. </li><li>  Stability and ease of management.  High-speed engines make it very "responsive", and allow you to easily change direction. </li><li>  Low cost.  Given the reasonable price, the Syma X5C drone becomes the best option for training.  Even in the event of a breakdown, it can be easily restored due to the availability of all parts. </li></ul><p>  Among the minuses, the following stand out most: </p><ul><li>  A sharp loss of connection.  Sometimes a connection break occurs just like that, from scratch.  As a result, most often, the copter falls to the ground.  Sometimes the connection is interrupted due to battery discharge. </li><li>  The lack of instructions in Russian.  Syma X5C is a fairly simple device, but some beginners still lack clarification. </li><li>  Poor image quality.  The camera is installed the simplest, so you should not expect high-quality shooting.  It is at the level of ultra-budget push-button phones. </li><li>  Low range  On average, it is not recommended to overcome the 50 meter line, as this is fraught with the loss of the quadrocopter from view due to its small size, and subsequent breakdown of the connection. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="hackedgadgets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="quadcopter syma x5c parsing" class="if uuid-2779767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779767.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The model under consideration is the best option for beginners who want to understand the basics of quadrocopter control.  It has a good list of advantages that allow you to confidently control the drone.  Due to its light weight, you can not be afraid to drop the quadrocopter to the ground as a result of an unsuccessful maneuver.  If necessary, the Syma X5C can be repaired using available parts and gaining the necessary experience for the future, which will come in handy after buying a more expensive model. </p>
