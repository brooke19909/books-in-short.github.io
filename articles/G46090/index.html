In what year serfdom was abolished</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The legally registered status of dependency of peasants is called serfdom.  This phenomenon characterizes the development of society in Eastern and Western Europe.  The formation of serfdom is associated with the evolution of feudal relations. </p><h2>  The origin of serfdom in Europe </h2><p>  The essence of the feudal dependence of the peasants on the landowner was to control the personality of the serf.  He could be bought, sold, forbidden to move around the territory of a country or city, and even control issues of his personal life. </p><p>  Since feudal relations developed depending on the characteristics of the region, serfdom took shape in different states at different times.  In Western Europe, it entrenched in the Middle Ages.  In England, France, Germany, serfdom was abolished by the XVII century.  Reforms concerning the liberation of the peasants are rich in Enlightenment times.  Eastern and Central Europe are regions where feudal dependence lasted longer.  In Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, serfdom began to take shape in the XV-XVI centuries.  It is interesting that in the <span>countries of Northern Europe the</span> norms of feudal dependence of peasants on feudal lords did not work out. </p>

    <h2>  Characteristic features and conditions of the formation of feudal dependence </h2><p>  The history of serfdom allows us to trace the characteristic features of the state and social system, in which relations of dependence of the peasants on rich landowners are formed: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  A strong centralized authority. </li><li>  Social differentiation by property. </li><li>  Low level of education. </li></ol><p>  At an early stage in the development of feudal relations, the goals of enslavement were to attach the peasant to the land allotment of the landowner and to prevent the flight of workers.  Legal norms regulated the process of paying taxes - the absence of population movements facilitated the collection of tribute.  In the period of developed feudalism, prohibitions became more diverse.  Now the peasant could not only independently move from place to place, but also had no right and opportunity to acquire real estate, land, and was obliged to pay a certain amount to the landowner for the right to work on his plots.  The restrictions for the lower strata of the population varied regionally and depended on the characteristics of the development of society. </p><h2>  The origins of serfdom in Russia </h2><p>  The enslavement process in Russia - at the level of legal norms - began in the 15th century.  The abolition of personal dependence was made much later than in other European countries.  According to censuses, the number of serfs in different territories of the country was different.  Dependent peasants already at the beginning of the XIX century began to gradually move to other classes. </p><p>  Researchers are looking for the origins and causes of serfdom in Russia in the events of the period of the Old Russian state.  The formation of social relations took place in the presence of a strong centralized power - at least for 100-200 years, during the reign of Vladimir the Great and Yaroslav the Wise.  The main code of laws of that time was Russian Truth.  It contained the norms that governed the relations of free and not free peasants and landowners.  Dependents were servants, servants, purchases, soldiers - they fell into bondage under various circumstances.  The smerds were relatively free - they paid tribute and had the right to land. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Tatar-Mongol invasion and feudal fragmentation became the causes of the collapse of Russia.  The lands of the once united state became part of Poland, Lithuania, Muscovy.  New enslavement attempts were made in the 15th century. </p>

    <h2>  The beginning of the formation of feudal dependence </h2><p>  In the XV-XVI centuries, a local system was formed on the territory of former Rus.  The peasant used the landowner's allotments under the terms of the contract.  Legally, he was a free man.  The peasant could leave the landowner to another place, but the latter could not drive him away.  The only restriction was that you could not leave the site until you paid its owner. </p><p>  The first attempt to restrict the rights of peasants was made by Ivan III.  The author of ‚ÄúSudebnik‚Äù approved the transition to other lands during the week before and after St. George's Day.  In 1581, a decree was issued banning the exit of peasants in certain years.  But this did not attach them to a specific site.  The decree of November 1597 confirmed the need for returning fugitive workers to the landowner.  In 1613, the Romanov dynasty came to power in the Moscow kingdom - they increased the search and return of the fugitives. </p><h2>  About the Council </h2><p>  In what year did serfdom become a legal norm?  The officially dependent status of the peasantry was approved by the Council Code of 1649.  The document was significantly different from previous acts.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Code in the regulation of relations between the landowner and the peasant was the ban on the latter to move to other cities and towns.  As a place of residence, the territory on which a person lived according to the census of the 1620s was fixed.  Another fundamental difference between the norms of the Code is the assertion that the search for the fugitive becomes indefinite.  The rights of the peasants were limited - the document practically equated them with the slaves.  The farm belonged to the master. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The beginning of serfdom is a series of restrictions on movement.  But there remained norms that protected against the willfulness of the landowner.  The peasant could complain or sue, could not be deprived of land simply by decision of the masters. </p><p>  In general, such norms enshrined serfdom.  Years have gone by to complete the process of formalizing complete feudal dependence. </p>

    <h2>  The history of serfdom in Russia </h2><p>  After the Council Code, several more documents appeared that reinforced the dependent status of the peasants.  The tax reform of 1718-1724 was finally attached to a certain place of residence.  Gradually, restrictions led to the formation of the slave position of the peasants.  In 1747, landowners received the right to sell their employee in recruits, and after another 13 years - to send to exile in Siberia. </p><p>  At first, the peasant had the opportunity to complain about the landowner, but since 1767 this was canceled.  In 1783, serfdom spread to the territory of <span>Left-Bank Ukraine.</span>  All laws confirming feudal dependence protected only the rights of landowners. </p><p>  Any documents aimed at improving the situation of peasants were virtually ignored.  Paul I issued a decree on a <span>three-day corvee,</span> but in fact, the work lasted 5-6 days.  Since 1833, the landowners received a legally fixed right to control the personal life of the serf. </p><p>  The stages of serfdom provide an opportunity to analyze all the milestones of the consolidation of peasant dependence. </p>

    <h2>  On the eve of reform </h2><p>  The crisis of the serf system began to make itself felt from the end of the 18th century.  This position of society hindered the progress and development of capitalist relations.  Serfdom became the wall that separated Russia from the civilized countries of Europe. </p><p>  Interestingly, feudal dependence did not exist throughout the country.  Serfdom was not in the Caucasus, the Far East, in the Asian provinces.  At the beginning of the XIX century it was canceled in Courland, Livonia.  Alexander I issued a law on <span>free cultivators.</span>  His goal was to ease the pressure on the peasants. </p><p>  Nicholas I made an attempt to create a commission that would develop a document abolishing serfdom.  The liquidation of such addictions was hindered by the landlords.  The emperor ordered the landowners upon the liberation of the peasant to give him land that he could cultivate.  The consequences of this law are well known - the landowners stopped releasing serfs. </p><p>  The complete abolition of serfdom in Russia will be carried out by the son of Nicholas I - Alexander II. </p><h2>  Reasons for agrarian reform </h2><p>  Serfdom hindered the development of the state.  The abolition of serfdom in Russia has become a historical necessity.  Unlike many European countries, industry and trade developed worse in Russia.  The reason for this was the lack of motivation and interest of workers in the results of their labor.  Serfdom became a brake on the development of market relations and the completion of the industrial revolution.  In many countries of Europe, it successfully ended at the beginning of the XIX century. </p><p>  The landlord economy and feudal relationship building ceased to be effective - they became obsolete and did not correspond to historical realities.  The labor of serfs did not justify itself.  The dependent position of the peasants completely deprived them of their rights and gradually became a catalyst for rebellion.  Social discontent was growing.  Reform of serfdom was needed.  Solving the issue required a professional approach. </p><p>  An important event, the consequence of which was the reform of 1861, is the Crimean War, in which Russia was defeated.  Social problems and foreign policy failures pointed to the unproductive state and domestic policies of the state. </p>

    <h2>  Views on serfdom </h2><p>  The attitude to serfdom was expressed by many writers, politicians, travelers, and thinkers.  Credible descriptions of peasant life were censored.  From the beginning of the existence of serfdom, there were several opinions on his account.  We distinguish two main, opposite.  Some considered such relations to be natural for a monarchical state system.  Serfdom was called the historically determined consequence of patriarchal relations, useful for educating the population and an urgent need for full and effective economic development.  The second, opposite to the first, position speaks of feudal dependence as an immoral phenomenon.  Serfdom, according to fans of this concept, destroys the social and <span>political system</span> and economy of the country.  Supporters of the second position include A. Herzen and K. Aksakov.  The publication of A. Savelyev refutes any negative aspects of serfdom.  The author writes that statements about the calamities of the peasants are far from the truth.  Reform of 1861 also caused mixed reviews. </p><h2>  Reform Project Development </h2><p>  For the first time, Emperor Alexander II spoke of the likelihood of the abolition of serfdom in 1856.  A year later, a committee was convened to develop the draft reform.  It consisted of 11 people.  The Commission concluded that it was necessary to create special committees in each province.  They should study the situation on the ground and make their amendments and recommendations.  In 1857, this project was legalized.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe initial plan to abolish serfdom is the elimination of personal dependence while maintaining the landowners' rights to land.  A transitional period was foreseen for the adaptation of society to the reform.  The possible abolition of serfdom in Russia caused a lack of understanding among the landowners.  The newly formed committees also fought over the conditions for reform.  In 1858, it was decided to ease the pressure on the peasants, and not to abolish dependence.  The most successful project was developed by Y. Rostovtsev.  The program provided for the abolition of personal dependence, the consolidation of the transition period, the provision of land to the peasants.  Conservative politicians did not like the project - they sought to limit the rights and sizes of allotments of peasants.  In 1860, after the death of Y. Rostovtsev, V. Panin took up the development of the program. </p><p>  The results of several years of work of the committees served as the basis for the abolition of serfdom.  The year 1861 in the history of Russia became a landmark in all respects. </p><h2>  Manifesto Proclamation </h2>

    <p>  The draft agrarian reform formed the basis of the "Manifesto on the abolition of serfdom."  The text of this document was supplemented by the "Regulations on the Peasants" - they described in more detail all the subtleties of social and economic changes.  The abolition of serfdom in Russia took place <span>on February 19, 1861</span> .  On this day, the emperor signed the manifesto and made it public. </p><p>  The document program abolished serfdom.  Years of non-progressive feudal relations are in the past.  At least so many thought. </p><p>  The main provisions of the document: </p><ul><li>  Peasants received personal freedom, were considered "temporarily liable." </li><li>  Former serfs could have property, the right to self-government. </li><li>  The peasants were given land, but they had to work it out and pay for it.  Obviously, the former serfs did not have money to buy back, so this item formally renamed personal dependence. </li><li>  The sizes of land allotments were determined by the landowners. </li><li>  Landowners received a guarantee from the state on the right of redemption.  Thus, financial obligations fell on the peasants. </li></ul><p>  Below you are offered the table "Serfdom: the abolition of personal dependence."  We analyze the positive and negative results of the reform. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 325px; height: 207px;"><tbody><tr><td>  Positive </td><td>  Negative </td></tr><tr><td>  Obtaining personal civil liberties </td><td>  Movement restrictions remain </td></tr><tr><td>  The right to freely marry, trade, file complaints with the court, have property </td><td>  The inability to buy land actually returned the peasant to the position of a serf </td></tr><tr><td>  The emergence of the foundations of the development of market relations </td><td>  The rights of landowners were placed above the rights of commoners </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  The peasants were not ready to work, did not know how to enter into market relations.

She was not a progressive factor in the development of society. </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  The year 1861 in the history of Russia was a turning point in social foundations.  The feudal relations that were entrenched in society could no longer be of use.  But the reform itself was not well thought out, so it had many negative consequences. </p>

    <h2>  Russia after the reform </h2><p>  The consequences of serfdom, such as a lack of readiness for capitalist relations and a crisis for all classes, indicate the untimely and ill-conceived changes proposed.  The peasants reacted to the reform with large-scale speeches.  Rebellions swept many provinces.  During 1861, more than 1,000 riots were recorded. </p>

    <p>  The negative consequences of the abolition of serfdom, which equally affected the landlords and peasants, affected the economic condition of Russia, which was not ready for changes.  The reform liquidated the long-standing system of social and economic relations, but did not create a base and did not suggest a way for the further development of the country in the new conditions.  The impoverished peasantry is now finally destroyed by the oppression of the landlords and the needs of the growing class of the bourgeoisie.  The result was a slowdown in the country's capitalist development. </p><p>  The reform did not free the peasants from serfdom, but only took away their last opportunity to feed their families at the expense of the landlords, who are required by law to support their serfs.  Their allotments decreased in comparison with the pre-reform.  Instead of the quitrent they worked with the landowner, huge payments of various kinds appeared.  The rural community has virtually completely taken away the rights to use forests, meadows and ponds.  The peasants were still a separate powerless class.  And still they were considered as existing in a special legal regime. </p><p>  The landlords, on the other hand, suffered many losses because the reform limited their economic interest.  The monopoly on peasants eliminated the possibility of free use of the latter for the development of agriculture.  In fact, the landowners were forced to give allotment land to the peasants.  The reform was characterized by inconsistency and inconsistency, the absence of a solution to the further development of society and the relationship between former slaves and landlords.  But, ultimately, a new historical period was opened, which was of progressive significance. </p><p>  Peasant reform was of great importance for the further formation and development of capitalist relations in Russia.  Among the positive results, the following can be distinguished: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ After the liberation of the peasants, there was an intense trend in the growth of the market for non-professional workers. </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ The rapid development of industry and agricultural entrepreneurship has developed through the granting of former serfs civil and property rights.  The estate rights of the nobility to the land were eliminated, and the opportunity appeared to trade in land allotments. </p><p> ‚Ä¢  1861-      ,          <span> </span> . </p><p> ‚Ä¢        ,     ,   .             ,   ‚Äì   ,       ,        . </p><p> ‚Ä¢         ,      . </p><p>            ,  -      ,        . </p><p> At the same time, the emergence of the proletariat as a separate class is noted.  The abolition of serfdom in Russia was followed by zemstvo (1864), city (1870), judicial (1864), <span>military (1874) reforms,</span> which were beneficial to the bourgeoisie.  The purpose of these legislative changes was to translate the system and administrative management in Russia into legal compliance with new developing social structures, where millions of emancipated peasants wanted to be entitled to be called people. </p>
