In it, a huge area is reserved for natural enclosures, in which about ten thousand representatives of the animal world feel at ease in an approximate natural habitat.  That is why every year you can admire the offspring of even those species of animals that rarely breed in unnatural environments.  The white teddy bear Shilka, a favorite of the Novosibirsk children and the star of the zoo, was born here.  The zoo holds children's contests and holidays.  One of the results of this competition was an exhibition of birdhouses, the unique and inimitable beauty of bird houses, which welcomes visitors to the zoo.
