Photos of this largest <span>city</span> in the <span>Caucasus are</span> now decorated with skyscrapers, but it remains recognizable.  Of course, this is the <span>capital of Azerbaijan,</span> many of us will say.  And indeed it is.  But <span>Baku</span> only became the <span>capital of</span> the 1920s.  But the history of this city has more than one century.  In this short essay we will try to understand the essence of the capital of Azerbaijan, the main milestones of its history and culture, as well as determine its significance for the whole East, and even more so, the Caucasus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baku what is" class="if" height="229" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1696510.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Etymology of the name </h2><p>  Why was the city called "Baku"?  What does this word mean?  After all, it has been known since the 5th century.  On this occasion, scientists have put forward many versions.  One of them says that ‚Äúbaku‚Äù in translation from Turkic means a hill or elevation, since the ancient cities were built in such a way as to control the valleys.  The second asserts that we are talking about the ethnic name of the fire-worshipers who in ancient times inhabited the peninsula.  These Zoroastrians were called "Bakans."  And there is a poetic version.  According to her, the name of the city came from the Persian phrase ‚Äúwind blow‚Äù.  After all, on this hill, the snowstorms often rage.  But historians question the third version and say that it is very late and comes from the 17th century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is baku" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1696520.jpg" width="313"></div>

Interesting facts </h2><p>  Now let's talk about the grand significance of Baku.  What does this city represent in the geopolitics of the East?  It is located on the <span>Absheron Peninsula</span> and is the largest metropolis not only in Azerbaijan, but throughout the Caucasus region.  And he is not offended by the number of inhabitants.  More than two and a half million people live in the city and its agglomeration.  In general, by its antiquity, the population and size of the territory of Baku is considered one of the oldest, largest, economically strong and mysterious places in the East.  Initially, his story was related to oil.  The local "black gold" is mentioned in documents relating to the period BC.  In addition, the city stood at the crossroads of the Great Silk Road, so trade here has always stood at a high level.  And in the 19th century, oil-producing enterprises puffed up the surroundings so much that the authorities ordered from now on to engage in mining only in certain places called the ‚ÄúBlack City‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is baku photo" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1696518.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Historical places </h2><p>  This city, based on its antiquity and rich cultural life, is very attractive for tourists.  Take, for example, its old quarter - Icheri Sheher.  After all, it was there, to recreate the oriental flavor, the film "Diamond Hand" was shot.  All, probably, will immediately remember a fragment with the words "qigil-qigil, ai-lulu."  And what about the early medieval luxurious <span>palace of the Shirvanshahs?</span>  This ensemble is located in the city center.  Here you can see the tombs of the rulers, a mosque of the 15th century, ancient baths, the chambers of the learned Seyid Bahuvi and, of course, the shah‚Äôs chambers themselves.  Giz Galasy (tower of maidens) is one of the most mysterious buildings in Baku.  What is hidden behind its construction, who is its architect, why does it have no analogues in the architecture of the Middle East?  The answers to these questions, alas, are not, but the tower has long become a symbol of the capital of Azerbaijan. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  What is Baku for travelers who flock here from all over the world?  This is an ancient city that can boast of history and grandeur at the same time, and also show that it is not at all alien to modernity.  In the perception of tourists, it is somewhat similar to Dubai, with the only difference being that they admire the ancient buildings here during the day and the futuristic "Flaming Towers" in the evening.  There are very beautiful landscapes, friendly people, delicious cuisine.  Almost all large hotel chains have their own representative offices here, which makes the vacation of tourists as comfortable as possible.  Photographing in the capital of Azerbaijan is simply all in a row.  The excursions here are stunning; in a few days a lot of new experiences are being gained.  Could ancient Baku have imagined that such a simple eastern settlement would turn into a developed economic and cultural center ... </p>
