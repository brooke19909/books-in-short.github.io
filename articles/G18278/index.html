    <p>  However, the institution has its drawbacks.  There are visitors who were dissatisfied with the rude attitude of security officers towards them.  Some clients are outraged by the behavior of the administrator and consider him an incompetent employee.  There are visitors who are not satisfied with the range of dishes and drinks.  They consider it not diverse enough.  As another drawback, customers call the incompetence of a disc jockey.  Several visitors said that the choice of music in the institution was uninteresting and, in their opinion, did not favor dancing.  However, it should be remembered that Broadway is a club designed primarily for lovers of <span>retro-style</span> songs <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Broadway club fishing photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59230/2184897.jpg"></div>  Therefore, the musical repertoire is appropriate here.
