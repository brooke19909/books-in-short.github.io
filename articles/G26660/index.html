Users of the Beeline Internet Home service in Kazakhstan will be able to also view all the information they need on the official website. </p><h2>  Getting data on the balance of traffic in the contact center </h2><div class="photo" data-original="callminer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline Call Center" class="if uuid-3090694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/114778/3090694.jpg"></div><p>  To connect to the Beeline support service, you need to dial 06116 from your mobile number. The service is available around the clock.  Besides the fact that you can check the rest of the traffic on Beeline in Kazakhstan, the contact center allows you to find out the following information: </p><ul><li>  current promotions and offers from the operator; </li><li>  status of the user service package: calls and SMS; </li><li>  conditions of the current tariff plan; </li><li>  list of connected services; </li><li>  addresses of the nearest company offices, etc. </li></ul><p>  After greeting the answering machine and choosing your preferred language of communication (1 - Kazakh, 2 - Russian), the available balance, the name of the tariff plan and the current balance of the Internet package at the time of the call are voiced.  Call to this number is free for Beeline subscribers. </p><p>  Thus, there are four ways to check the rest of the traffic on Beeline in Kazakhstan: through the USSD command, calling the contact center, in the My Beeline mobile application and on the company's website. </p>
