    <h2>  Sur reservoir: fishing </h2><p>  <span>In the Penza region</span> there are many lovers of spending free time with a fishing rod on the shore of a reservoir.  So, they argue that on the shore of the Sur reservoir in winter, bream is perfectly caught.  It belongs to the class of schooling fish and is active throughout the entire time when the reservoir is covered with ice.  Shoals of bream move in certain directions.  They believe that they move along closed and cyclic routes.  On the Sursky reservoir, the bream has its own places for parking, recreation and food search. </p><h2>  Mileyka </h2><p>  On the shore of the Sur reservoir there are bases where fishing and beach vacations can be combined.  For example, BO Mileyka is located in the west of the region, 20 km from Kuznetsk, two km from the villages of Maryevka and Bestyanka. </p><p>  There are all conditions for organizing fishing, both in the warm season and in winter.  In particular, in addition to summer houses, heated cottages are also available for vacationers.  There is a bathhouse and cafe, and hot days can be sunbathed on the free beach. </p>
