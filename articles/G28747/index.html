The sandy beach is considered the property of the hotel, so only Club Lella Mariam guests relax there.  You should not take sun loungers and umbrellas to the beach, since all this can be taken already in place. </p>

    <h2>  Club Lella Mariam 4 *: guest reviews </h2><p>  Reviews of guests who had the opportunity to visit the hotel are mostly positive.  Young people are delighted with the abundance of entertainment and the modern night disco.  Daytime life is no less entertaining, because there is an opportunity to recover from stormy nightly entertainment.  They respond especially well to hotel employees who are ready at any time to provide the necessary services to all visitors. </p><p>  For an objective assessment, it must be said that in addition to enthusiastic reviews, there is restrained, and in some cases, sharp criticism.  Most often, vacationers are outraged due to the strange interior and decoration of the rooms.  However, supporters of such claims should visit luxury hotels with sky-high prices in order to compare and understand the advantages and advantages of Club Lella Mariam 4 * (Djerba). </p><p>  The positive hotel also receives reviews thanks to the sophisticated and incredibly delicious cuisine.  Almost all hotel guests with genuine enthusiasm talk about this.  The menu in the hotel is represented by a wide variety of different classic dishes.  However, gourmets are given the chance to fully satisfy their gastronomic needs.  The variety of delicious meat dishes will not leave indifferent fans of hearty food. </p><p>  The pearl of the hotel complex, according to holidaymakers, is the delightful beach and the warm blue sea located in the immediate vicinity, as well as the opportunity to get umbrellas and sun loungers for free. </p>
