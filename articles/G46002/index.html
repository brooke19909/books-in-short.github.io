Reviews about him are intriguing.  On six thousand square meters in the "Moscow City" is a children's town, which can take about half a million guests a year. </p><p>  Eyewitnesses claim that Masterslavl is a children's city of professions, created in the form of a model of an ordinary Russian town of the nineteenth century.  Thanks to this project, the organizers were able to show children the complexity and responsibility of adulthood.  They are completely immersed in the world of independent life, with its problems and concerns.  Each child, having chosen a profession for himself, can ‚Äúfeel‚Äù it sufficiently on himself. </p>
