    <h2>  First we make the flowers </h2><p>  This information will be useful to anyone who wants to know how to make the number ‚Äú1‚Äù from napkins.  This stage is very simple, but it takes a lot of time, since a fairly large number of flowers will be needed to create a number.  If there is such an opportunity, it is better to involve assistants in this matter. </p><p>  To create this option, the figures begin to work with the use of red two-layer napkins 33 cm in size. Two flowers are obtained from one such napkin.  To make a flower, you should: </p><ul><li>  cut the napkin in half; </li><li>  fold the halves again in half and cut again; </li><li>  fold the two quarters together and fasten them in the middle with a stapler; </li><li>  then a circle is cut out of the square.  You can do this by eye; </li><li>  further, starting from the top, each layer in turn compresses each layer; </li><li>  then the flower is expanded, carefully spreading each petal. </li></ul><p>  To optimize the process, the craftswomen are advised to first make as many such blanks as possible, and then create beautiful flowers from them. </p><p>  White flowers are also made according to the same principle.  If you come across white napkins, which, unlike the red ones, are single-layer and smaller in size, some efforts will have to be made to create the same ones as the red ones.  It is necessary to put together three white napkins, put a red square of the required size on top of them and cut a blank along its contour.  Then everything is done according to the scheme described above.  In total, for the designation of the number ‚Äú1‚Äù, it will be necessary to make 86 red and white colors - 65. This will take about four hours. </p>

    <h2>  Frame </h2><p>  If you want to know how to make a figure out of napkins, you should learn how to make a cardboard frame for it.  It is not particularly difficult if a flat figure is created.  It will be more difficult for those who are interested in how to make a three-dimensional figure from napkins.  For the construction of a three-dimensional frame, two sheets of corrugated cardboard 50 x 30 cm in size will be needed. The front parts of the ‚Äúunit‚Äù are cut out of them.  The remaining trim will go to the sides of the digits. </p><h2>  Stages </h2><ul><li>  On one of the sheets draw the outline of a figure.  The width can be determined by focusing on the number of rows of flowers that need to be glued to it.  For example, based on the size of the cardboard, you get 2 rows of flowers.  At the same time, the width of the figure around the entire perimeter will be about 9 cm. </li><li>  Then cut out one.  If the cardboard is very dense and hard, you can use a construction cutter. </li><li>  The resulting figure is superimposed on the second sheet of cardboard, outlined along the contour and also cut out. </li><li>  Then make blanks for the side parts.  To do this, measure and cut strips of 9 cm wide from cardboard.  Experienced craftsmen advise making them as long as possible - so it will be more convenient to stick them. </li><li>  Then, with adhesive tape, they first glue one and then the second half of the unit with strips prepared for the ‚Äúsidewalls‚Äù.  Craftswomen recommend using softer and more flexible cardboard for the sides, which will be easier to bend and glue along the outline of the figure. </li></ul><h2>  How to collect and decorate a figure? </h2><p>  Those who want to know how to make a number from napkins should also familiarize themselves with the final stage of the process. </p><p>  At this stage, glue the flowers to the frame.  For this, the craftswomen recommend using the ‚ÄúMoment‚Äù universal glue-gel, since it is colorless and sets quickly enough.  In order not to crumple the flowers, lightly press on them from above, then gently press their base under the petals with your finger.  After the glue dries, the flowers are straightened to make them look more magnificent. </p><p>  There are many ways to complete a single image.  One of them is the decoration with a golden crown.  On the Internet you can find a ready-made stencil of the right size, print it and cut it out. </p>

    <p>  Since the figure is two-sided, the crown should be the same.  Therefore, on a sheet of holographic cardboard (A4 format), it should be circled twice, cut out both halves and glue them.  As a result, the crown will be ‚Äúgolden‚Äù on both sides.  At the end, the figure is solemnly ‚Äúcrowned‚Äù by gently gluing the crown to the flowers. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Often, mothers, preparing for the children's celebration, ask the question: how to make the number 5 from napkins, 2, 3, or some other?  Guided by the instructions given, you can make any number or even a letter from napkins.  Happy holiday! </p>
