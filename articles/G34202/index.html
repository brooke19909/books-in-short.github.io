This area is located in the Main River Valley, which extends over the federal state of Bavaria. </p><p>  Wurzburg is a free city with a population of more than 130 thousand people.  It is fifth in Bavaria in size after Munich, Augsburg, Nuremberg and Regensburg. </p><p>  The city is rich in numerous architectural and historical monuments.  The article presents some of Wurzburg's most interesting sights with photos and descriptions. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="49.7897393" data-lng="9.920131900000001" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/9/3/6/13936.png"></div><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Wurzburg in 2004 celebrated its next anniversary - 1,300 years.  Famous for the fact that the University.  Julius-Maximilian is the oldest institution of higher education in Germany.  It was founded in 1402.  Today, about 25,000 students gain knowledge here, and this makes up one fifth of the total population of the city. </p><p>  Fortress Marienberg is a symbol of the city of W√ºrzburg.  Throughout the history of its existence, the city has undergone multiple destruction.  In the last days of hostilities, the city was subjected to heavy bombardments, and as a result of the seventeen-minute raid of aircraft of the Royal Air Force of Great Britain, taking place in mid-March 1945, more than 50 thousand civilians were killed.  90% of the old part of the city was destroyed.  Despite all this, Wurzburg today is one of the most beautiful German cities, built up with Baroque buildings.  The city is also known as a center for the production of Franconian wine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="global-geography.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View from the fortress" class="if uuid-3058594" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3058594.jpg"></div><h2>  About <span>Wurzburg sights</span> with photos </h2><p>  Germany has many amazingly beautiful cities with their own unique history.  Among them is the city of W√ºrzburg, worthy of special attention and respect.  There are countless sights in it, and now it is difficult to believe that most of the city was almost completely destroyed.  Thanks to the industriousness and efforts of the German people, everything was rebuilt and rebuilt again, including the Wurzburg residence, which was entered on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1981.  The image of the residence in 2010 was minted on a gold commemorative coin in denominations of 100 euros. </p><p>  Marienberg Fortress offers a magnificent view of the surroundings of W√ºrzburg, including the K√∂ppele pilgrimage church. </p><div class="photo" data-original="global-geography.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedrals of the city" class="if uuid-3058583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3058583.jpg"></div><p>  Many city attractions are best viewed on foot.  An interesting object is the church of St. Mary, built in the late Gothic style.  In total, there are more than 50 cathedrals and churches in W√ºrzburg, among which the wonderful St. Kilian Cathedral, which has 4 towers.  The old buildings of the University of W√ºrzburg are also of great historical and architectural importance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.thousandwonders.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fortress Marienberg" class="if uuid-3058568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3058568.jpg"></div><h2>  Fortress Marienberg </h2><p>  Wurzburg is rich in terms of historical buildings.  It will be especially interesting for history buffs to watch them.  The symbol and hallmark of the city is the Marienberg fortress.  It is with her that all tourist guides begin. </p><p>  This citadel was erected in 1201, and until the time when the city residence was built in the city (XVIII century), the fortress was the seat of the archbishop.  She provided him with reliable protection against the multiple claims of the townspeople. </p><p>  The fortress is visible from everywhere, from all points of the city.  However, she does not suppress her powerful bastions.  Rather, it fits gracefully enough into the landscape surrounding it.  It is located on a steep slope on which a wonderful garden planted with Franconian grapes has been cultivated for many centuries.  Thanks to such a beautiful frame, the fortress looks quite peaceful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lettersoftravel.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wurzburg city" class="if uuid-3058559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3058559.jpg"></div><h2>  Fortress history </h2><p>  The fortress in W√ºrzburg began to be built in 1200.  At that time, a conflict was brewing between the townspeople and Archbishop Konrad von Querfurt, and he decided to build a "solid house" for himself on Marienberg Hill.  The erected citadel became the seat of government and a fortification.  The fortress tower and part of the palace were preserved from that construction. </p><p>  In the XIV century, the fortress was surrounded by a wall with many towers.  And in subsequent times, it was subjected to perestroika.  She withstood the siege during the Peasant War, which occurred in 1525.  The fortress was also tested during the Thirty Years War.  After the fortress was taken by the Swedes (1631), the rulers who remained shocked by the only defeat decided to build powerful bastions, towers with loopholes and a large number of gates.  And this made the Marienberg fortress completely impregnable at that time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The inside of the fortress" class="if uuid-3058585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3058585.jpg"></div><p>  The Old Bridge leads over the Main river to the citadel.  It was built in the years 1473-1543.  He replaced with himself the former Romanesque bridge in that place - the building of 1313.  In the fortress, which is one of the main and most significant historical sights of the city of W√ºrzburg, today there are two cultural historical institutions: the Museum of F√ºrstenbau and the Museum of Maine Franconia. </p><h2>  Other sights of the city </h2><p>  In addition to the Marienberg fortress, the city has a huge variety of other interesting historical and cultural places.  <span>The Wurzburg residence, a</span> UNESCO heritage site, is a magnificent Baroque architectural complex, built in 1719-1744. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wurzburg Residence" class="if uuid-3058550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3058550.jpg"></div><p>  Interesting objects for visiting tourists are the Museum At the Cathedral, which contains approximately 300 works of sculpture and painting, as well as a mineralogical museum owned by the university.  The latter contains a unique collection of rocks, minerals, precious stones, meteorites and ore. </p><p>  The Old Bridge over Mine, known as the oldest bridge on the river, is decorated with statues of saints.  And the ancient crane, which has a double arrow and dates from 1773, also belongs to the river sights of the city. </p><h2>  Festivals and other events </h2><p>  Wurzburg is famous for its festivals.  In addition to the city's traditional wine festivals, there are classical music festivals (Bach and Mozart), an African culture festival, a jazz festival and a film festival. </p><div class="photo" data-original="christopherandbanks.blog" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wine cellars" class="if uuid-3058664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3058664.jpg"></div><p>  This city is home to the largest (third largest in Germany) wine-making company Juliusspital with a tasting room and wine cellars.  In the underground vaulted cellars are huge wooden barrels filled with wine.  Some of them are over one hundred years old. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Fortress Marienberg is one of the points of the German romantic road, often called one of the most interesting routes in Bavaria.  A lot of historical events significant for the city took place near its walls, from peasant riots to fierce battles in World War II.  Only one single time in many years of existence Marienberg was taken by enemies (1631) - the Swedes. </p><p>  Today, this fortress itself is an open-air museum.  Walking along these stately walls on warm sunny days can bring a lot of pleasure and benefit.  Panoramic views from this place inspire photography enthusiasts and artists. </p>
