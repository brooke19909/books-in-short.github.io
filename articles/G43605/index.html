    <p>  Another advantage of the hotel, many guests consider the presence of terraces and verandas in the rooms.  Here, if you wish, you can sit in the evening with a cup of tea or coffee while admiring the garden.  The only drawback of the hotel's verandas among tourists is the fact that the tables of neighboring rooms here are separated from each other only by a wicker. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  No special amenities in the territory of the hotel Almiros Apartments 3 * are offered to tourists.  There is no pool at the hotel.  The same goes for safe, laundry and other similar services.  However, if desired, hotel guests can visit the pool of a neighboring hotel for free.
