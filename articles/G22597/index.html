Vasily Golitsyn (prince) - the founder of the oldest branch of the Golitsyn clan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The clan of the Golitsyn princes has a rather long and interesting history.  She devoted a large number of works of specialists in genealogy.  Of particular fame is the founder of one of the branches of this family - Vasily Vasilievich.  We will study the biography of this person, as well as the history of the Golitsyn princes. </p><h2>  The emergence of the Golitsyn family </h2><p>  The Golitsyn family originates from the Grand Lithuanian Prince Gediminas and his son Narimont.  The son of the latter, Patrickey, in 1408 went to the service of the Prince of Moscow Vasily I. Thus, the Patrickev family was founded. </p>

    <p>  The grandson of Yuri (the son of Patrickey) - Ivan Vasilyevich Patrikeyev - was nicknamed Bulgak.  Therefore, all his children began to be written as the princes of the Bulgakov.  One of Ivan‚Äôs sons - Mikhail Bulgakov - received the nickname Golitsa, and all thanks to his habit of wearing a plate glove on his left hand.  His only son, Yuri, who was in the service of Tsar Ivan the Terrible, was sometimes written as Bulgakov, and sometimes as Golitsyn.  But already the descendants of the latter were called exclusively by the princes Golitsyn. </p><h2>  Division into four branches </h2><p>  Yuri Bulgakov-Golitsyn had sons - Ivan and Vasily Golitsyn.  Vasily Bulgakov had three sons, however, all of them were childless.  This branch of the Golitsins broke.  One of the sons of Yuri Bulgakov-Golitsyn was the commander and statesman of the Time of Troubles Vasily Vasilyevich. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But the line of Ivan Yurievich gave numerous offspring.  His grandson Andrei Andreevich had four sons, who were the ancestors of the branches of the Golitsyn clan: Ivanovich, Vasilievich, Mikhailovich and Alekseevich. </p><h2>  Youth Vasily Golitsyna </h2><p>  Prince Vasily Golitsyn was born in 1643 in Moscow.  He was the son of the boyar Vasily Andreyevich Golitsyn, who held high positions under the tsar, and Tatyana Romodanovskaya.  The family had four children, but, given that the eldest son Ivan did not leave any descendants, Vasily became the ancestor of the eldest branch of the Golitsyn princes - Vasilyevich. </p><p>  Vasily Golitsyn lost his father at the age of nine, after which the care of his son and other children was completely placed on his mother's shoulders.  The young prince was addicted to knowledge of sciences and received a good education at that time at home. </p><h2>  In public service </h2><p>  With the onset of fifteen, a new stage in his life began: Vasily Golitsyn (prince) joined the service of the Russian Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich.  He held the positions of cup-holder, steward and charioteer.  But Prince Vasily Golitsyn became especially promoted after the accession of <span>Fyodor Alekseevich</span> in 1676.  He was immediately granted the boyar post. </p><p>  Under Tsar Fedor, Vasily Golitsyn was elevated in a fairly short time.  Already in 1676, he was instructed to deal with the issues of Little Russia (present-day Ukraine), so he left for Putivl.  It should be noted that Vasily Golitsyn perfectly solved the tasks.  After this, the prince was forced to face the Turkish-Tatar threat, which escalated in 1672-1681, when the Russo-Turkish war was underway, and participated in the <span>Chigirin campaigns.</span>  In 1681, the <span>Bakhchisaray peace</span> was concluded <span>,</span> which in fact established the status quo.  After that, Vasily Golitsyn returned to Moscow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Having headed the Vladimir court order, Vasily rather closely became close friends with the Tsar‚Äôs sister Tsarevna Sophia and her relatives Miloslavsky.  Then he became the head of the commission, which was in charge of reforms in the army, which to a large extent contributed to the strengthening of the Russian army, which is clearly illustrated by the future victories of Peter I. </p><h2>  Elevation </h2><p>  In 1982, Tsar Fedor died.  As a result of the Streletsky uprising, Tsarina Sophia came to power, who favored Prince Golitsyn.  She became a regent with the young brothers Ivan and Peter Alekseevich.  Vasily Golitsyn was appointed the head of the <span>embassy order</span> .  The prince began to actually control the foreign policy of the Russian kingdom. </p><p>  And the times were turbulent: relations with the Commonwealth, with which Russia was de jure at war, worsened;  hostilities began with the Crimean Tatars, despite the recently concluded Bakhchisaray peace treaty.  It was Vasily Vasilievich who had to decide all these issues.  In general, in this regard, he acted quite successfully, preventing a direct clash with the Poles and Turks at a time when Russia was not profitable. </p><p>  However, Vasily Golitsyn was distinguished by pro-European views and always sought rapprochement with Western states to counter Turkish expansion.  In this regard, he temporarily abandoned the struggle for access to the Baltic Sea, confirming in 1683 an agreement previously concluded with the Swedes.  Three years later, the Golitsyn embassy concluded the Eternal Peace with the Commonwealth, legally ending the Russian-Polish war, which lasted from 1654.  According to this agreement, Russia and the Commonwealth pledged to start military operations against the Ottoman Empire.  In this regard, the next Russo-Turkish war began, in the framework of which not very successful Crimean campaigns were undertaken by our troops in 1687 and 1689. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  One of the most famous diplomatic events of that time was the conclusion of the Treaty of Nerchinsk with the Qing Empire.  This was the first official document that laid the foundation for the history of centuries-old diplomatic relations between Russia and China.  Although it must be said that in general this agreement was disadvantageous for Russia. </p><p>  During the reign of <span>Princess Sophia</span> Alekseevna, Vasily Golitsyn became not only a leading figure in the country's foreign policy, but also the most influential official in the state, in fact being the head of the government. </p><h2>  Opal and death </h2><p>  Despite his talents as a statesman, Vasily Golitsyn to a large extent owed his exaltation to the fact that he was the favorite of Tsarevna Sophia.  And this predetermined his fall. </p><p>  Upon reaching adulthood, Peter I removed from power Sofya Alekseevna, and Golitsyn tried to secure the reception of the sovereign, but he was refused.  Vasily Vasilievich was taken into custody on charges of unsuccessful Crimean campaigns and that he acted in the interests of the regent, and not the tsars Peter and Ivan.  His life was not deprived only thanks to the intercession of his cousin - Boris Alekseevich, who was the educator of Peter I. </p><p>  Vasily Golitsyn was deprived of the boyar title, but left in princely dignity.  An eternal exile awaited him with his family.  At first, Kargopol was designated the place of her serving, but then the exiles were transported several times to other places.  The last point of reference was the village of Kologory of the Arkhangelsk province, where before the omnipotent statesman died in 1714 in obscurity. </p><h2>  Family of Vasily Golitsin </h2><p>  Was twice married Vasily Golitsyn.  The first marriage of the prince was combined with Theodosia Dolgorukova, but she died, without giving him children.  Then Vasily Vasilievich married the daughter of boyar Ivan Streshnev - Evdokia.  From this marriage there were six children: two daughters (Irina and Evdokia) and four sons (Alexei, Peter, Ivan and Mikhail). </p><p>  After the death of Vasily Golitsyn, the family was allowed to return from exile.  The eldest son of Prince Alexei Vasilievich suffered from a mental disorder, because of which he could not be in the public service.  He lived all his life on the estate, where he died in 1740.  From his marriage to Martha Kvashnina, he had a son Mikhail, who fell into disgrace of the Empress Anna Ioannovna and became a court jester with her.  He died in 1775. </p><p>  Another son of Vasily Golitsyn - Mikhail - became famous for his service in the Navy.  He was married to Tatyana Neelova, but had no children. </p><h2>  Dmitry Golitsyn - statesman of the Petrine era </h2>

    <p>  One of the most prominent statesmen of his era was <span>Dmitry Mikhailovich Golitsyn.</span>  The prince, born in 1665, was the son of Mikhail Andreyevich, the founder of the Mikhailovich branch, and thus was the cousin of Vasily Vasilyevich, whom we spoke about above.  But, unlike his relative, for his exaltation he should be grateful to Peter the Great. </p><p>  His first significant post was the post of stolnik under the sovereign.  Later, Prince <span>Dmitry Golitsyn</span> participated in the Azov campaigns and in the Northern War.  But his main achievements were in the civil service.  In 1711-1718 he was the Kiev governor, in 1718-1722 - the president of the Chamber Board, which corresponded to the modern post of Minister of Finance.  In addition, Dmitry Mikhailovich became a member of the Senate.  Under Peter II, from 1726 to 1730, he was a member of the Supreme Privy Council, and from 1727 - president of the Commerce Collegium (Minister of Commerce). </p><p>  But with the coming to power of the Empress Anna Ioannovna (whose name he himself named when choosing a candidate worthy to take the throne), he was disgraced because he tried to legislatively limit her power.  In 1736, he was imprisoned in the <span>Shlisselburg fortress,</span> where he died the following year. </p><h2>  Mikhail Golitsyn - General of the times of Peter the Great </h2><p>  Dmitry Golitsyn‚Äôs brother was born in 1675, Prince Mikhail Mikhailovich.  He became famous as a famous commander. </p>

    <p>  Prince Mikhail Golitsyn proved himself well during the Azov campaigns of Peter I (1695-1696), but gained real fame during the Northern War.  It was he who led many brilliant operations against the Swedes, in particular at the Battle of Grengam (1720). </p><p>  After the death of Peter I, Prince Golitsyn was awarded the highest military rank of Field Marshal at that time, and under Peter II he became a senator.  From 1728 until his death (1730) he was president of the military college. </p><p>  Mikhail Mikhailovich was twice married.  From both marriages had 18 children. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that one of his younger brothers, oddly enough, was also called Michael (born in 1684).  He also gained fame on the military path, participating in the Northern War.  And from 1750 until his death in 1762, he led the entire Russian fleet, being the president of the Admiralty College. </p><h2>  Alexander Golitsyn - the successor of his father‚Äôs business </h2><p>  One of the sons of Field Marshal Mikhail Mikhailovich was Prince Alexander Golitsyn, born in 1718.  He also became famous in the military field.  He was one of the leaders of the Russian troops during the Seven Years War against Prussia (1756-1763), as well as during the Russo-Turkish Won (1768-1774), which ended with the signing of the famous Kuchuk-Kainardzhi peace. </p>

    <p>  It is not known how much benefit the Russian state would bring to Peter Golitsyn, if in the same 1775, at the age of 38, he had not been killed in a duel. </p><h2>  Lev Golitsyn - a famous winemaker </h2><p>  Prince Lev Golitsyn was born in 1845 in the family of Sergei Grigoryevich, who belonged to the branch of Alekseevich.  He became famous as an industrialist and entrepreneur.  It was he who established the industrial production of wines in the Crimea.  So this region is a winemaking region not least thanks to Lev Sergeyevich. </p>
