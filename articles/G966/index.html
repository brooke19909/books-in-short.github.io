  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Pokrovsky", Novosibirsk: address, developer, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Novosibirsk is a large Siberian city, the development of which does not stand still.  The borders of the city do not cease to expand, it is actively being built up, new residential complexes, separate residential districts with their own infrastructure are appearing.  Have you looked closely at the real estate of the Siberian city?  Then pay attention to the project of the residential complex "Pokrovsky" (Novosibirsk).  What kind of project is this?  What are its virtues?  Is it worth investing in the construction of the project?  About this in detail in the framework of this material. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  New Novosibirsk buildings are currently represented by an abundance of options.  But not everyone can offer comfortable living conditions.  If you want to live within walking distance from the metro, use the entire infrastructure, enjoy the amazing view from the window, our material will surely be useful to you.  LCD "Pokrovsky" (Novosibirsk) - a 25-storey residential building, erected using monolithic-brick technology.  The project is being built in several stages, the first is scheduled for delivery in the 1st quarter of 2019, and completion is scheduled for 2020. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yuga-build.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Pokrovsky Novosibirsk" class="if uuid-3206903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3206903.jpg"></div><p>  When designing the complex, all preferences of modern residents of the city were taken into account, as well as unique construction technologies and improvement of the territory adjacent to the residential building were used.  Underground parking, games and sports grounds, storage rooms, well-developed infrastructure are the advantages that modern customers will appreciate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The Pokrovsky residential complex (Novosibirsk) is being built along Dusi Kovalchuk Street, just a few minutes' walk from Zaeltsovskaya metro station.  At the moment, this is one of the most attractive places to live.  If we talk about Novosibirsk. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.0538239" data-lng="82.90048060000004" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/0/7/1/17071.png"></div><p>  This is practically the center of the city, in any case, the area located quite close to it.  Less than a kilometer away is one of the most important and significant sights of the city - the Novosibirsk Zoo, as well as parks and squares that fill the area with fresh air, greenery, thereby creating the most favorable living conditions. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  The reviews of Pokrovsky residential complex (Novosibirsk) suggest that the complex is really well located, guaranteeing transport accessibility for every resident.  By private car you can drive to the busy Lenin Square, and from there you can already get to anywhere in the city.  Within walking distance are two metro stations, as well as bus stops.  There are enough public transport routes in the direction of the complex, which compensates for the lack of a personal car in the family if you choose Pokrovsky LCD (Novosibirsk).  How to get to the complex?  Quite often on the forums you can find such a question.  From the city center on all buses running to Narymsky Square. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="forum.ngs.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pokrovsky residential complex Novosibirsk" class="if uuid-3206905" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3206905.jpg"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Residential complex "Pokrovsky" (Dusi Kovalchuk, 242, Novosibirsk) is an excellent option for various categories of citizens, including families with small children, because the developed infrastructure of the district allows providing comfort of living.  The nearest kindergarten "Golden Cockerel" is located directly in front of the house.  Within walking distance there are three more wonderful gardens recognized as the best in the city. </p><p>  The situation in schools in the district is also excellent: to the secondary school No. 120 only 200 meters.  To the gymnasium with in-depth study of foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äã- five minutes in a calm step without dangerous sections and intersections.  Children's and adult clinics within walking distance of the new building.  In a word - the social infrastructure of the district is at the highest level of development. </p><div class="photo" data-original="3830809.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new buildings of Novosibirsk" class="if uuid-3206904" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3206904.jpg"></div><p>  If you purchase apartments in Pokrovsky residential complex (Novosibirsk), you certainly will not experience a shortage of grocery stores, service organizations.  In addition, the first floors are reserved for bank branches, laundries, drugstores, dry cleaners, hairdressers, and office premises. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Landscaping </h2><p>  The developer of the residential complex "Pokrovsky" (Novosibirsk) has planned large-scale improvement of the territory adjacent to the complex.  Thanks to this, there will be a place near the house for walking with children, relaxing in the form of shady alleys with benches, playgrounds.  There is also a place for sports: horizontal bars and street exercise machines will be installed in the courtyard.  The yard of the residential complex "Pokrovsky" will definitely become one of the most modern and interesting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pokrovskiy-novosibirsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Pokrovsky Dusi Kovalchuk 242 Novosibirsk" class="if uuid-3206907" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3206907.jpg"></div><p>  A three-level underground parking provides places for all car owners, isolating the yards from through traffic and mass traffic.  Many residents of a megalopolis dream of this. </p><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  The choice of housing is represented by an impressive variety: from compact one-room studios to spacious and comfortable three-room apartments with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãover 100 square meters.  Layouts literally satisfy every customer, whatever their taste preferences. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smy9.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Pokrovsky Novosibirsk builder" class="if uuid-3206908" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3206908.jpg"></div><p>  The newlyweds will surely appreciate the small studios and affordable one-room apartments, having received a rather comfortable space that can be arranged for your lifestyle.  Two-room apartments with large kitchens, isolated rooms, an additional bathroom are an excellent option for large and friendly families.  Planning LCD "Pokrovsky" (Novosibirsk) - the opportunity to organize a decent space for life, to use every square meter of apartment space. </p><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  The cost of apartments in the residential complex "Pokrovsky" is hardly budgetary.  So the studio can be purchased for 2.5 million rubles, but a full three-room apartment of 95 squares will cost 5.5 million rubles.  But the developer (SMU No. 9) took care of comfortable and favorable conditions for acquiring the cherished square meters: installment payment, the opportunity to take part in the action, arrange a mortgage with a minimum interest rate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="3830809.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Pokrovsky Novosibirsk how to get there" class="if uuid-3206910" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3206910.jpg"></div><h2>  Customer opinion </h2><p>  The reviews left by the first buyers regarding the Pokrovsky residential complex are clear evidence that the developer tried to take into account the interests of future residents, their need for comfort and safety.  Enormous attention of potential owners produced smoke-free stairwells.  Recently, cases of massive fires in residential buildings and shopping centers have become more frequent, so additional safety precautions and ensuring complete fire safety are becoming an integral part of modern residential complexes.  At each entrance, two high-speed silent elevators were installed: passenger and freight. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pokrovskiy-novosibirsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Pokrovsky Novosibirsk layout" class="if uuid-3206909" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3206909.jpg"></div><p>  What attracts potential buyers in the first place?  Of course, location.  The house is located on the second line from the road, so noise from the carriageway, as well as dust, dirt and exhaust fumes do not reach it.  At the same time, it was possible to maintain transport accessibility and proximity to all objects of social and commercial infrastructure. </p><p>  Well, of course, the complex has everything that is needed: equipped with playgrounds and sports grounds, gazebos, recreational facilities for all tenants, an underground three-level parking, and a completely pleasant and very unexpected gift. </p><p>  Many are skeptical about the reputation of the builder, or rather, its absence.  And all because Pokrovsky LCD is the first residential development project for the company.  But what pleases is the honesty of the developer, he does not hide the lack of many years of experience, on the contrary, presents it as an advantage, an opportunity to take a fresh look at modern real estate.  You can visit the development site, get acquainted with all the lines of completion and completed work, the materials and technologies used, and only after that sign the contract. </p><h2>  The opinion of the neighbors </h2><p>  Of course, today many are afraid to invest in shared construction.  And the reason for this is the multitude of frozen construction projects, unfinished facilities, roughly speaking, long-term construction.  But we managed to find reviews of those who constantly live in the area, for example, on the contrary, construction, so we can definitely say about how quickly and efficiently the work is done. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ksonline.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Pokrovsky Novosibirsk" class="if uuid-3206915" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3206915.jpg"></div><p>  So, the majority of residents confirm that the workers are quite nimble, construction is carried out both day and night, all materials are delivered on time, eliminating even the possibility of downtime.  The house, of course, in many ways resembles a typical anthill with a huge number of neighbors, but only in a modern interpretation: there is enough space on the territory for walking, relaxing, playing sports - it will not be crowded and uncomfortable for anyone here.  Moreover, across the road are two of the city‚Äôs most magnificent parks. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  If you have looked closely at the new buildings of Novosibirsk for a long time, choosing a project in full compliance with your taste preferences and requirements, the developer offers the best option.  It is unlikely that another city complex will be able to offer so many advantages: excellent location, excellent transport accessibility, own landscaped house, underground parking at three levels, well-developed urban infrastructure. </p><p>  Be sure to take a closer look at the Pokrovsky residential complex, visit the construction site to draw up your own subjective opinion and see with your own eyes the scale of the development.  Experts are convinced that the project will impress and pleasantly surprise you and, perhaps, after your first visit, you will want to become the owner of a spacious apartment here. </p>
