What is he so famous for?  And you can answer this question if you try to make poppy from foamiran - a wonderful detail for any interior! </p><h2>  What a miracle? </h2><p>  Do not close this article if you are first hearing the name of such material.  Undoubtedly, he appeared in stores recently, so not all the masters had time to get to know him well. </p><p>  What is a foamiran?  It is a very ductile material that also resembles latex, rubber and even suede due to its texture.  It was because of the suppleness and plasticity that they began to actively use it in the manufacture of artificial flowers, which are simply unusual. </p>

    <p>  All bends, the smallest folds and streamlined shape of flowers of any kind, foamiran takes without much effort.  Thanks to these properties, foamiran poppies, photos of which you can now see, are so realistic that it is easy to confuse them with a real living original. </p><p>  What are its other advantages?  As it became known, flowers and artificial bouquets quickly gather dust and begin to accumulate dirt on themselves, which is why the path of wet cleansing is the only solution for such cases.  And at the moment, our material does not fail us at all: it is perfectly washed even under running water, it is easily cleaned and dries quickly.  Isn't it a miracle? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Prepared layout </h2><p>  In order for the poppies made from foamiran to look natural with their own hands, you need to prepare a kind of ‚Äúpattern‚Äù in advance, which can be obtained in several ways. </p><p>  Firstly, it is to take a flower of a real living poppy, disassemble it neatly into parts and, alternately applying all the details of the flower to the paper, circle them with a pen or pencil.  Thus, your sketch will be very close to the original and ready in a couple of minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="poppies from foamirana photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29368/2121608.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If you do not have the opportunity to find live poppies, then you can draw the outlines of the petals yourself.  Foamiran poppy templates are presented in our article, and you can safely use them if you imagine the shape of the petals is very difficult.  In fact, this option is extremely unreliable, since until the very end it will not be clear how the finished result will look. </p><p>  Well, the easiest way that we can offer you: just print this poppy pattern from foamiran given to us and cut along the contour.  Then you will succeed quickly, simply and reliably. </p><h2>  Get ready please </h2><p>  It's time to prepare the necessary materials in order to create <span>a poppy flower from foamiran.</span>  All this can be found in any store for creativity or ordered in an online store, if your city does not have any large hypermarkets with products for needlework. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="foamiran poppy patterns" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2120025.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Now we take the mass for the modeling, on which you chose, and knead it well.  When the "plasticine" has already become malleable, create a kind of plate of material and drip paint into the center.  Do not put too much dye in order not to get a dark and gloomy color. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Thoroughly knead "plasticine", and before our eyes we observe a change in its color: from a snow-white lump, the mastic is gaining shades of fresh green.  We divide the finished ball into 5 parts: 3 large and 2 small, and prepare for the next stage. </p><h2>  Let's get in </h2><p>  The turn of the formation of the center of the poppy begins.  To do this, make a small "loop" at the end of a wire tied in advance and put a large ball of mastic on it. </p><p>  Now, with the help of scissors or an ordinary stationery knife, we begin to form the middle.  Divide the circle in half twice and get the base, consisting of 4 equal parts.  And along the edge, namely from one notch to another, we cut the plasticine with scissors, plucking the small tips. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make poppy seeds from foamiran" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2120039.jpg"></div>

    <p>  After this, the "burrs" need to be pressed a little so that they do not stand out from the general flower box.  We also put small plasticine balls on wire loops in order to later make small poppy buds out of them. </p><h2>  Foamiran poppy: working with the material </h2><p>  Now we take sheets of material for flowers, push the contour through with toothpicks and cut out elements of the future bouquet.  When all the details are ready, you can start tinting with pastels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY poppy seeds" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2120040.jpg"></div>

    <p>  To do this, simply put the ‚Äústick‚Äù of the pastel on paper and use a knife to grind it to air powder so that it is not difficult to collect paint with a brush.  In yellow we tint all the petals of white foamiran on both sides, leaving no gaps. </p><p>  We cut the green pastel and cover it with the lower bases of the large petals, which will be next to the stem.  In pink, we tint only half of the petal blank to create an ombre effect. </p><h2>  Thermal heating </h2><p>  So it was the turn of the iron, which must be set in advance for warming up.  When the desired temperature is reached, we apply the blanks alternately, forming the necessary outlines of the flower parts: </p><ul><li>  From the sepals (a small round billet) we form a kind of cup with an outstanding base. </li><li>  We heat the large sheet and twist it so that when we look at it we can see both the upper and lower parts. </li><li>  And we first fold the poppy petal at the base into an accordion, which we then twist.  Near the edge, you can make a recess deeper, and the base, on the contrary, lift up.  After we open the blank, it takes a form that is very difficult to distinguish from the original. </li></ul><h2>  The final assembly of the flower </h2><p>  Now you can combine all the details together to get ready-made flowers.  Let's start with making poppy buds: to do this, take a blank of the poppy stem and glue two petals opposite it to it.  On top of the petals we place two sepals details also, opposite each other.  At this stage, the buds are considered ready. </p>

    <p>  The main poppy from foamiran is created no more complicated than buds.  Just place the purchased stamens around the hardened box, creating a semblance of a halo.  The main thing is to consider that in real poppies these same stamens are very small, even almost invisible, so you should choose the most suitable ones from all. </p><p>  For one poppy we need only 4 petals, which we place step by step: first the first two are opposite each other, and then the others, only on the sides.  The result is something like a cross from petals.  And now, the poppy flower itself is already ready, it remains only to add greenery to the bouquet. </p><p>  On pre-prepared short wires wrapped in corrugated paper, glue large leaves.  And already such a workpiece can be attached to the "main" stem with the help of good old corrugated paper and glue or tape.  It is specially used for making bouquets and is sold in flower shops. </p><p>  As the final touch of a practically finished bouquet, slightly dust the greenish boxes so that they are not very noticeable. </p><p>  Well, that‚Äôs all, our lesson is over, and now you know how to make poppy seeds from foamiran, which can become not only an excellent component of a homemade bouquet, but also a wonderful decoration in the shape of a brooch, pendant or handmade wreath. </p>
