  <section class="page js-page"><h1>United Arab Emirates: history and interesting facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of the Arab Emirates has a long history.  The appearance of people in the territory of the current UAE was associated with the appearance of the first people who left Africa, about 125,000 years BC.  e., which became known thanks to finds on the archaeological site of Faya-1 in Mleikh, Sharjah.  Burial sites dating back to the Neolithic and Bronze Age include the oldest known site in Jebel Buhais.  This area was home to a thriving Bronze Age commercial culture during the Umm Al-Nar period, whose representatives traded between the Indus Valley, Bahrain and Mesopotamia, as well as Iran, Bactria and the Levant.  The geography of the United Arab Emirates is characterized by an almost complete absence of mountains and a uniformly low relief. </p><p>  In the subsequent period, a nomadic lifestyle arose, and there was also a leap in the development of water management and irrigation systems, stimulating people to settle both on the coast and in the interior.  The Islamic Age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the Sassans and the subsequent battle of Dibba.  The long history of trade in the UAE has led to the emergence of the city of Julfa in the modern emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, which has developed as a major regional trading and maritime center in the area.  The largest cities in the country are Abu Dhabi and Dubai - one of the cities of the Arab caliphate, laid down even under the first rulers of this state. </p><p>  The maritime dominance of Arab merchants in the Persian Gulf led to conflicts with European peoples, including the Portuguese and the British.  But the history of the Arab Emirates is just beginning! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.iexplore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the Arab Emirates" class="if uuid-3123392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/3123392.jpg"></div><h2>  Wars and treaties </h2><p>  Long before the emirates and the "sea wars" appeared, the Sultanate of Muscat was located on the territory of this country.  After decades of maritime conflict, coastal territories became known as Authentic states.  In 1819, the indefinite "General Agreement" on the marine world was signed with the British (ratified in 1853 and re-established in 1892), according to which the True States became a British protectorate. </p><p>  This arrangement ended with the independence and creation of the United Arab Emirates on December 2, 1971, immediately after the UK left its treaty obligations.  Six emirates joined the UAE in 1971, the seventh, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the federation on February 10, 1972.  All this is reflected in the administrative division of the United Arab Emirates.  From this point of view, the country is not unitary. </p><h2>  Religion and Culture </h2><p>  Islam is the official religion of the country, and Arabic is the state language.  The second official language of the United Arab Emirates is English.  Oil reserves in the UAE are the seventh largest in the world, and natural gas reserves are seventeenth.  Sheikh Zayed, the ruler of Abu Dhabi and the first president of the UAE, monitored the country's development and directed oil revenues to healthcare, education and infrastructure.  The economy of the UAE is the most diversified in the Gulf Cooperation Council, while its most populous city, Dubai, is the center of international aviation and maritime trade. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, now the country is much less dependent on oil and gas than in previous years, and is economically focused on tourism and business.  The UAE government does not levy income tax, although there is a corporate tax system and value added tax was set at 5% in 2018.  Islam is the dominant religion and has taken root quite quickly.  The reasons for the collapse of the Arab caliphate did not affect the speed of spread of Islam. </p><h2>  Worldwide recognition and international status </h2><p>  The growing international authority of the UAE has led to its recognition as a regional and middle power.  This country is a member of the United Nations, the League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, OPEC, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Gulf Cooperation Council. </p><h2>  Federation of Absolute Monarchies </h2><p>  The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a country on the Arabian Peninsula located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf and the northwest coast of the Gulf of Oman.  The UAE consists of seven emirates and was founded on December 2, 1971 as a federation.  Six of them (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al-Qaiwain and Fujairah) united on that December day.  The seventh, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the federation on February 10, 1972.  Seven sheikhs were previously called ‚ÄúTrue States‚Äù in connection with the contractual relations established with the British in the 19th century. </p><p>  Despite the fact that one of the reasons for the collapse of the Arab caliphate at one time was the excessive decentralization of power, the emirs nevertheless risked forming a federation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldtravelguide.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interesting facts about the UAE" class="if uuid-3123396" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/3123396.jpg"></div><h2>  Ancient history </h2><p>  Artifacts discovered in the UAE tell of the oldest story, starting at least 125,000 years BC.  e., when people appeared and settled in this region.  The territory was previously home to the "people of the Magans", known to the Sumerians, who traded with both coastal cities and continental settlements.  The rich history of trade with the Harappa culture of the Indus Valley is also confirmed by jewelry and other items, and there is also plenty of early evidence of trade with Afghanistan and Bactria, as well as with the Levant. </p><h2>  Ancient bedouins </h2><p>  Throughout the Iron Age and the subsequent Hellenistic period of Mliih, this area remained an important trading center.  As a result of one of the battles of the ‚Äúwar with apostates‚Äù that took place near the city of Dibba, the region became Islamized in the 7th century.  Small trading ports developed alongside internal oases such as Liva, Al Ain and Dhayd, and tribal Bedouin society coexisted with a settled population in coastal areas.  Bedouins forever inscribed themselves in the history of the Arab Emirates. </p><h2>  European invasion </h2><p>  A series of invasions and bloody battles took place along the coast when the Portuguese, under the command of Albuquerque, invaded the area.  Conflicts between the maritime communities of the True Coast and the British led to the looting of Ras Al Khaimah by the British troops in 1809 and again in 1819, which led to the conclusion of the first of a series of British treaties with the True rulers in 1820. </p><p>  These agreements, including the Eternal Sea Peace Treaty, signed in 1853, led to peace and prosperity along the coast and supported the vibrant trade in high-quality natural pearls, which lasted until the 1930s.  When the pearl trade ceased, leading to significant difficulties among coastal communities.  Another treaty of 1892 transferred foreign relations to the British in exchange for protectorate status. </p><div class="photo" data-original="global-geography.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Abu Dhabi" class="if uuid-3123406" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/3123406.jpg"></div><h2>  British decision </h2><p>  The British decision taken in early 1968 to end its presence in the Union States led to the decision to establish a Federation.  This was the result of a decision between two of the most influential rulers, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan from Abu Dhabi and Sheikh Mohammed Ibn Rashid Al Maktoum from Dubai.  They invited other rulers to join the Federation.  At one point, it seemed likely that Bahrain and Qatar would also join the Union, but both ultimately decided on independence. </p><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  Today, the UAE is a modern oil exporting country with a highly diversified economy, in particular, Dubai is turning into a global center of tourism, retail and finance, where the tallest building in the world and the largest artificial seaport are located. </p><h2>  Back to the past </h2><p>  The period from 300 BC  e.  0 year was called both Mleikhoy and the late pre-Islamic period, and is a consequence of the collapse of the empire of Darius III.  Although the era was called Hellenistic, the conquests of Alexander the Great did not go further than Persia, and he left Arabia untouched.  However, the Macedonian coinage found in Ed-Dur dates back to Alexander the Great, and Greek manuscripts describe the export from Ed-Dur as ‚Äúpearls, purple dyes, clothing, wine, gold, and slaves.‚Äù </p><p>  The most complete evidence of the settlement of people in this territory is in Mleikh, where in antiquity a thriving agricultural community lived.  It was here and during this period that the most complete evidence of the use of iron was found, including nails, long swords and arrowheads, as well as smelting residues.  Civilizations of the Persian Gulf (on the map it is located between Arabia and Iran) and Mesopotamia developed faster than all the rest. </p><h2>  Islamic faith </h2><p>  Islam is the official religion of the United Arab Emirates.  More than 80% of the population of the United Arab Emirates come from other countries.  Almost all of the country's citizens are Muslims: approximately 85% are Sunnis and 15% are Shiites.  There are also no fewer Ismaili Shiites and Ahmadis.  Immigrants in the country are mainly from South and Southeast Asia, although there are a significant number of migrants from the Middle East, Europe, Central Asia, the Commonwealth of Independent States and North America. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Abu Dhabi on top" class="if uuid-3123418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/3123418.jpg"></div><p>  Among the inhabitants of the country there are more Sunnis than Shiite Muslims.  There are also a small number of Ismaili Shiites and Ahmadis.  The UAE judicial system is based on continental law and Sharia law.  She inherited the country from the ancient Sultanate of Muscat. </p><p>  The arrival of the messengers from Muhammad in 632 marked the conversion of the region to Islam.  After the death of Muhammad in the city of Dibba (modern emirate of Fujairah), one of the main battles of the "riddles" took place.  The defeat of the "infidels" in this battle led to the victory of Islam on the Arabian Peninsula.  So in the history of the Arab Emirates, Islam has become the leading religion. </p><h2>  War with neighbors </h2><p>  In 637, Julfar (today Ras al-Khaimah) was used as a springboard for the conquest of Iran.  For many centuries, Julfar was a wealthy port and center of the pearl trade, from where seekers of wealth and adventure embarked on a journey across the Indian Ocean. </p><p>  Attempts by the Ottomans to expand their sphere of influence in the Indian Ocean failed, and it was the expansion of the Portuguese into the Indian Ocean at the beginning of the 16th century, following the route of the exploration of Vasco da Gama, that led the Portuguese to plunder many coastal cities.  After this conflict, Al-Kassimi, a maritime state located on North Lengheh, dominated the waterways of the South Gulf until the arrival of British ships, which came into conflict with officials. </p><h2>  Pirate beach </h2><p>  Subsequently, the region became known to the British as the "Pirate Coast", as the al-Qashimi raiders based there pursued merchant ships, despite the British fleet patrolling ships in the area in the 18th and 19th centuries.  There was a series of conflicts between Arabs and the British between 1809-1819. </p><p>  After several incidents in which British ships were aggressed by al-Qashimi, British expeditionary forces arrived at Ras Al Khaimah in 1809, and the so-called Gulf Campaign began.  This campaign led to the signing of a peace treaty between the British and Husan bin Rahmakh, the leader of al-Qashimi.  The agreement was terminated in 1815.  J.J. Lorimer claims that after the annulment of the agreements, the state of al-Qashimi "surrendered to the carnival of sea lawlessness." </p><p>  After 12 months of repeated attacks at the end of 1818, Hassan bin Rahma made a series of calls for peace in Bombay, which were rejected by the British.  The naval forces commanded by the rulers of al-Qashimi during this period amounted to approximately 60 large ships, each carrying from 80 to 300 people, as well as 40 small ships stationed in other nearby ports. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="UAE military aircraft" class="if uuid-3123492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/3123492.jpg"></div><h2>  British colonization </h2><p>  In November 1819, the British embarked on an expedition against al-Qashimi under the command of Major General William Keyr Grant, who was heading for Ras al-Khaimah with a platoon of 3,000 soldiers supported by a number of warships.  The British made an offer to Said bin Sultan of Muscat, inviting him to become ruler of the Pirate Coast if he agreed to help the British on their expedition.  He sent a military force of 600 people and two ships.  It is worth saying that since then the country has not resolved territorial disputes with contractual Oman.  So, since then, the Oman exclave has been inside the UAE. </p><p>  After the fall of Ras al-Khaimah and the final surrender of Fort Daya, the British established a garrison in Ras al-Khaimah of 800 sepoys and artillery before visiting Jazirat al-Hamra, which was declared abandoned.  They continued to destroy the fortifications and large vessels of Umm al-Qaiwain, Ajman, Fasht, Sharjah, Abu Hale and Dubai.  The ten ships that took refuge in Bahrain were also destroyed. </p><p>  As a result of this campaign, a peace treaty was signed next year with all the sheikhs of the coastal communities - the so-called "General" naval treaty of 1820. </p><h2>  Ban slavery </h2><p>  Following the agreement of 1820, followed by the "Agreement banning the export of slaves from Africa on board ships belonging to Bahrain and the right to trade."  By this time, some minor principalities were included in the larger neighboring states, and among the signatories were sheikhs Sultan bin Sakr from Ras Al Khaimah, Maktum from Dubai, Abdulaziz from Ajman, Abdullah bin Rashid from Umm al-Qawain and Said bin Tahnun from Abu Dhabi. </p><p>  The treaty guaranteed security only to British ships and did not impede coastal wars between tribes.  As a result, the raids continued intermittently until 1835, when the sheikhs agreed not to participate in military operations at sea for one year.  The ceasefire resumed every year until 1853.  At that time, both the British and the Arabs traded through the Persian Gulf.  On the map, it is located between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sharinghistory.museumwnf.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Burning dubai" class="if uuid-3123501" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/3123501.jpg"></div><h2>  Eternal world </h2><p>  In 1853, the Eternal Sea Armistice banned all acts of aggression at sea and was signed by Abdullah bin Rashid of Umm al-Qaiwain, Hamed bin Rashid of Ajman, Saeed bin Butti from Dubai, Saeed bin Tahnun (known as the ‚Äúleader of the whispers‚Äù) and Sultan bin Sacrom (known as the ‚Äúleader of the hosmeis‚Äù).  Another obligation to suppress the slave trade was signed in 1856, and then in 1864, as an ‚ÄúAdditional Article to the Armistice of the Sea, which provides for the protection of the telegraph line and stations dated 1864.‚Äù  Imamat Oman did not participate in this truce. </p><h2>  Insulation </h2><p>  Signed in 1892, the "Exclusive Agreement" obliged the rulers not to enter into "any agreement or correspondence with any power other than the British government."  In addition, the agreement obliged the sheikhs to deny representatives of other countries from visiting their state.  It was also supposed to prohibit any action with the land (assignment, sale, rental, etc.) with all, with the exception of the UK government.  In return, the British promised to protect the Treaty Coast from any aggression at sea and help in the event of a ground attack. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the agreements with the British were of a maritime nature, and faithful rulers were free to manage their internal affairs, although they often attracted the British (and their naval firepower) to more frequent disputes with each other and with other countries, such as Oman.  Relations between Oman and the UAE for many years remain so complicated that sometimes they come to hostility. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandleisure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ruins of Emirate Cities" class="if uuid-3123519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/3123519.jpg"></div><p> The disputes of the Arab emirs with Oman were often associated with debt to British and Indian companies.  In the late XIX - early XX centuries, a number of changes occurred in the status of various emirates, for example, Rams and Ziya (now part of Ras Al Khaimah) were signatories to the original treaty of 1819, but were not recognized by the British as independent states. </p><p>  While Fujairah, which today is one of the seven kingdoms that make up the United Arab Emirates, was not recognized as part of a single state until 1952.  Kalba, recognized by the British in 1936 as a single state, is today part of the emirate of Sharjah.  The most interesting fact about the UAE is precisely the moment that this country, in essence, is partly a federation, and partly a confederation of absolute monarchies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sheikh and the British Queen." class="if uuid-3123547" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/3123547.jpg"></div><h2>  Oil discovery and modernity </h2><p>  In the middle of the 20th century, the British discovered oil fields in Arabia.  They were immediately bought up by the British oil concessions thanks to special agreements with local emirs.  However, when the country gained independence, oil fields were nationalized and distributed among the emirs.  Money from the sale of oil allowed the UAE to become rich, becoming a powerful regional power. </p>
