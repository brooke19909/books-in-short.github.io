    <h2>  Short description </h2><p>  The landscape architect used a predominantly <span>regular style,</span> which was very popular in the late XIX century and early XX.  The architectural center is not the house, which is typical of the regular style, but the depth of the park.  The most important elements of the garden are paths and paths connected in a single network. </p><p>  There are two almost straight roads in the Southern Cultures Park in Adler: from the main entrance and into the courtyard, which then merge into a central alley.  Then the road leads to the stairs and to the lower part, from where it passes to the highway in the direction of the sea and the main stall, the main pond. </p><p>  Paths and small paths form curtains, where vegetation is planted.  Deciduous and coniferous trees grow in separate groups.  Valuable tree species flaunt in open glades: Atlas cedar, sunny cypress and blue fir.  In some parts of the garden there are only exotic plants - palm trees and bamboo. </p><p>  The key place is still allotted to artificial ponds, where swans of white and black color live.  There are islands and bridges on the pond in the eastern part.  And on the ground floor near the second pond there are lawns that recreate Baroque drawings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Adler‚Äôs Southern Cultures Park has a unique collection of plants that you can admire at any time of the year.  Today, there are about 1.4 thousand species. </p><p>  From the hill (15 meters), poured according to the design of Regel, a panorama of the whole territory opens.  From here you can see lawns, ponds, and paths. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="south culture park adler Price" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2225510.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Founder and creator of the park </h2><p>  The park was founded in 1910.  In those days, these lands belonged to General Drachevsky D.V.  From the territories of the "Random" estate with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã34 hectares, 11 hectares were allocated for the garden.  To implement his project, the general invited the architect of landscape gardening art - Regel A. Although there is a version that he participated in the creation of the garden in absentia, and in Sochi the gardener R. Skryvanek was doing all the work </p><p>  In the 20th year of the last century, the park was run by the state farm Random, and after 9 years the garden was given an existing name. </p><p>  In the 30s, the park had a real flowering.  Professor Artsybashev D. brings here decorative plants from the East.  At some point, the park becomes the most unique and largest in the entire territory of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  The last mass plantings were made in the 50s of the last century, it was then that the eucalyptus alley appeared. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Post-Soviet time </h2><p>  During this period, the Southern Cultures Park in Adler is completely desolate.  The alleys are not looked after, and the whole composition loses its value.  Exotic plants begin to age and die prematurely due to the proximity of groundwater. </p><p>  Tornadoes in the 1980s and 2000s cause virtually irreparable damage to all plantings. </p><p>  However, in 2008 the park was visited by about 10 thousand people.  In the same year, reconstruction begins.  About 200 large trees, 560 rose bushes, annual and perennial plants appear in the garden.  Paths are cleared and benches are set up.  All efforts cannot be said to be in vain, but one cannot breathe new life into the park.  After some couple of years, the garden comes to desolation again, even employees are not paid wages.  The scandal attracts the attention of the authorities, and the park begins to receive funding. </p>
