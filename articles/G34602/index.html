    <h2>  Who is the designer </h2><p>  ‚ÄúGardens of Dreams‚Äù was designed by Abakan landscape designer Denis Safronov.  Previously, he also created two similar parks in the capital of the Republic of Khakassia, one of which is the poetic name ‚ÄúInspiration‚Äù.  It is worth noting that both new attractions work year-round and are never empty. </p><h2>  Description of the park </h2><p>  If you still think <span>where to go with children in Krasnoyarsk,</span> be sure to visit the "Gardens of Dreams".  Its organizers managed to place alpine slides, fountains, all kinds of attractions, a Japanese garden, pancake houses and two catering facilities in a small area.  In addition, there are numerous arbors, swings, a shooting gallery, a statue of Buddha and a pond with real carps.  There are even pens with rabbits, geese and goats.  Bunnies and birds can even be fed.  For this, feed is sold at the entrance for 40-50 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to real animals in the landscape park "Gardens of Dreams" there are also all kinds of sculptures: Krasnoyarsk and Thai geese, female figures (though for some reason, bare).  And also small houses equipped with a barbecue area.  However, even trees and plants look so beautiful and wonderful here that you can admire them every day. </p>

Adults will surely enjoy the huge lake in which koi carps splash in the thickets of water lilies. </p><p>  You can see the fish from a wooden gazebo located on the shore.  Only they are frightened by the children who throw coins and pebbles into the water, so they tend to hide somehow.

    <h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Park "Gardens of Dreams" in Krasnoyarsk is considered the best in the city.  Everything here is very beautiful and cultural: a large number of flowers, including in pots, clean paths, ponds, streams, carved benches.  Local flower beds are somewhat reminiscent of Thai.  Everything here is well-groomed and pleasing to the eye.  But this does not count all the advantages of a new park attraction, they can also be reckoned with: </p><ul><li>  the presence of both paid and free children's attractions; </li><li>  the possibility of holding a fiesta in a hammock to quiet music; </li><li>  feed animals (except goats, they apparently have weak stomachs); </li><li>  arrange a gorgeous photo shoot on the background of the photo zone and the beautiful landscape; </li><li>  the presence of cozy cafes in which you can always eat; </li><li>  all kinds of promotions and discounts on paid services for regular customers, groups of 10 people, senior citizens and disabled people. </li></ul><p>  In addition, there is a free library in the Gardens of Dreams park in Krasnoyarsk, where you can read books on landscape design and gardening, as well as the market for garden plants.  And all would be well, but without a "fly in the ointment" was also not complete.  So, according to reviews of Krasnoyarsk residents, they do not like: </p><ul><li>  a small assortment of local cafes; </li><li>  a small area for ordinary walks; </li><li>  a fairly high price for tickets; </li><li>  lack of shady places (planted trees have not yet grown). </li></ul><p>  Also, some residents say that the organizers should solve the issue of parking.  So far, there‚Äôs nowhere to put cars particularly.  But all these shortcomings are still lost against the pluses given in the description of the ‚ÄúGardens of Dreams‚Äù park in Krasnoyarsk.  Therefore, at least once a month you should definitely come here. </p>
