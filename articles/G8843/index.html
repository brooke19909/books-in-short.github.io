However, this concerns not only the execution of orders, but also the appearance.  In the field form, a gateway must be present, which is located on the inside of the collar.  In this regard, the question arises of <span>how to hem a collar on a military uniform.</span> </p><h2>  What is a gateway? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="blog.livingourdreamlife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is necessary for hemming a collar" class="if uuid-2256953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2256953.jpg"></div><p>  This clothing item is a white strip of fabric that is sewn to the tunic from the inside.  It would seem, why is it needed, but the gateway has certain functions that it performs: </p><ul><li>  protects the skin from contact with coarse material that went on sewing military uniforms so that the skin is not injured; </li><li>  far from always the case seems to wash the issued form in time, and therefore the gateway also performs a hygienic role. </li></ul><p>  The need for gateways was thought when the First and Second World Wars were waged.  The neck should be clean so that hard-healing wounds do not form.  When active hostilities take place, it‚Äôs not up to personal hygiene, but maintaining the health of soldiers is also an important task.  Gradually, the gateways became part of the tradition, and now their wearing is consistent with the military regulations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What will be needed for hemming? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.guggenheim.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="necessary fittings" class="if uuid-2256949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2256949.jpg"></div><p>  How to sew collars on a form?  To accomplish the task, you need to acquire such materials and tools: </p><ul><li>  fabric for hemming (white calico, having the size of a collar); </li><li>  white threads; </li><li>  needle; </li><li>  iron. </li></ul><p>  When hemming a gate, you need to do this carefully so that there is no feeling of discomfort during daily wear of a military uniform. </p><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  How the collars in the army are hemmed will be described later in the article: </p><ol><li>  At the first stage, it is necessary to iron both the fabric itself, from which the collar will be made, and the collar of the form itself. </li><li>  As mentioned above, the size of the fabric strip and the gate must match.  If your hands have a smaller fabric, then you need to observe the same indentation on each side of the collar.  Much less problems if the strip of matter is slightly larger.  Here it will be enough to cut off the extra piece or just tuck the fabric from both edges. </li><li>  A white thread is inserted into the needle, threaded and secured with a knot so that it does not pop out during operation. </li><li>  Usually, a blind stitch is used for sewing.  There is nothing complicated here, the thread is threaded behind the collar of the tunic, which consists of two layers of material. </li><li>  To make the collar look neat, you need to make about 12 stitches. </li><li>  Particular attention should be paid to ensure that the needle must be inserted into the fabric to the place from which it comes out with the previous stitch.  As a result, the seam is smooth and beautiful. </li><li>  Recommended stitch length is approximately 4 cm. </li></ol><p>  This manual describes in detail <span>how to hem a collar on a military uniform.</span> </p><h2>  Some tricks </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bblackandsons.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to hem a collar on a military uniform" class="if uuid-2256925" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66225/2256925.jpg"></div><p>  Soldiers entering the conscript service receive 12-piece ready-made gateways each year, which can be replaced with plain fabric, it will be necessary to make the necessary part of it yourself in order to hem the collar on a military uniform.  According to the charter, the gateways must be changed every day, and if the fabric is washed after use, its appearance leaves much to be desired.  You can buy the necessary material or finished product in a military store. </p><p>  According to observations, a double layer of material is best suited.  In this case, the fabric will not puff and will not rub the skin of the neck. </p><p>  The gateways are checked for cleanliness every day in the morning. </p><p>  Now you know how to hem a collar on a military uniform. </p>
