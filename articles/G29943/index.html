  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Construction of industrial buildings: planning and design, mandatory conditions and requirements, documents</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you want to build a quality building (no matter what), you have to meet various conditions and restrictions.  For example, without good planning and design, the chances of success are significantly reduced.  Moreover, there are both the requirements of common sense, and construction standards.  Only private houses with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãless than 300 square meters can do without the latter. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The construction of industrial buildings and structures is regulated by a number of legislative acts.  In addition, there are regulatory regulatory documents.  Before the construction of facilities, it is necessary to study the planning and architectural requirements for the project being created.  First of all, it is worth mentioning the building density and number of storeys on the land plot, indentation of the structure and buildings from the borders, landscaping and landscaping.  But on this the list of requirements established by regulatory documentation is not calculated.  Of greatest practical interest is the urban planning code.  But not only it should be applied.  Urban restrictions are also required. </p><h2>  What areas need to be addressed? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mepsolutions.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="construction of industrial buildings and structures" class="if uuid-3094343" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/3094343.jpg"></div><p>  So, let's say that there is a need to carry out the construction of an office building.  In this case, you need to pay attention to: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The name of the construction object, information about the customer, work plans, location (construction) of the object, the intended purpose of the land plot, its area, documentation confirming ownership. </li><li>  The main technical and economic indicators, the maximum permissible height of the building, the protected areas of utilities (if necessary, pay attention to the survey). </li><li>  Providing conditions for transport and pedestrian communication, provide places for permanent storage of cars, take into account the requirements for the preservation of cultural heritage sites, landscape zones, historical ranges, protective zones and other similar zones. </li><li>  Improvement in accordance with applicable law. </li><li>  Construction of warehouse and industrial buildings should be carried out in the presence of a cadastral certificate, plan, location of the object, a copy of geodetic surveys. </li></ol><h2>  Urban planning </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mauricebergmanarchitect_demo.websiteworks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="construction industrial building" class="if uuid-3094345" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/3094345.jpg"></div><p>  This is an integral part of the documentation on the basis of which conditions and restrictions are formed.  What is it for in construction?  The building for industrial purposes should have well-thought-out systems of service, transport support, engineering communications in order to ensure continuity of business.  And it‚Äôs best to think through important points in advance, rather than improvise in the process.  By the way, this will also help to determine the approach, materials and a number of other points.  For example, it may make sense to build not a capital and costly building from concrete / brick, but to use the best practices for metal structures.  This, moreover, will be significantly faster. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  And if there is no desire to do all this? </h2><p>  In this case, the turnkey construction of industrial buildings will help.  Usually this is done by experienced companies, which have a fairly significant portfolio of projects and professionals.  If we talk about working with metal structures and sandwich panels, then this is a very popular direction.  And many companies offer their services to create projects from these materials.  At the same time, the organization of the construction of the industrial building and the flow of ongoing processes is carried out taking into account his wishes.  It is just necessary to formulate requests and provide the financial resources necessary for their implementation.  Everything else will be done by specialists. </p><h2>  Design and planning </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.archdaily.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="turnkey construction of industrial buildings" class="if uuid-3094347" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/3094347.jpg"></div><p>  So, the construction of the facility is planned.  It is necessary to pay attention to the following parameters of the future building: capitality, explosiveness, number of storeys, fire hazard, fire resistance, and service life.  Others may be taken into account.  All of them play a role in choosing the place of construction, materials used, labor costs and affect the final cost of the entire project.  In practice, all of this has to be planned and controlled during such stages: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Carrying out landscaping. </li><li>  Marking the territory. </li><li>  The construction site and its equipment. </li><li>  Foundation laying. </li><li>  Creation of structural elements and construction of the building frame. </li><li>  Installation of walls, floor ceilings and the creation of engineering systems. </li><li>  Laying flooring. </li><li>  Installation of production lines, conveyors, equipment, bridge cranes and other similar objects that are necessary for the implementation of manufacturing activities. </li><li>  Decorating and launching an industrial facility. </li></ol><h2>  Specific moments in the design and planning </h2><div class="photo" data-original="restoreforce.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="building permit" class="if uuid-3094351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/3094351.jpg"></div><p>  It is necessary to take into account the setting of goals and the goals pursued.  For example, when the proposed production technology allows, it is better to dwell on the construction of multi-story buildings.  This saves the area occupied by the facility.  If low requirements for service life are provided, then often the emphasis is on the use of cheap materials.  In the absence of increased requirements for such a characteristic as vibration resistance, the process can be carried out using lightweight metal structures or modules.  Their distinguishing feature is quick-erectability, high speed of creation of objects and the ability to dismantle them without causing irreversible damage to the structure.  But for the choice you need to take into account the capitality of the object and its fire resistance.  The first parameter is determined depending on the purpose of the building.  In other words, it is influenced by the processes carried out in it.  Regulation in this case is carried out by the "Building Code".  According to them can be allocated: </p><ol><li>  First grade.  It is characterized by the presence of increased requirements. </li><li>  Second class.  Differs in moderate requirements. </li><li>  Third class.  It is characterized by the presence of minimum requirements. </li></ol><p>  The construction of industrial buildings should also be characterized by an orientation towards the choice of a group of building materials to be used in the process: </p><ol><li>  Fireproof.  Fire can damage them, but the distinguishing feature is that it takes him a very significant amount of time before the appearance of the first significant negative results. </li><li>  Flame retardant.  A distinctive feature of the materials of this group is that they can burn, but this process develops very slowly and there is a possibility of self-extinguishing the fire.  Very often, the movement of fire can be characterized as smoldering. </li><li>  Combustible.  These materials are subject to the rapid and strong spread of fire. </li></ol><h2>  Mandatory conditions and requirements </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ranbuild.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="construction of an office building" class="if uuid-3094346" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/3094346.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, a lot depends on what goals and indicators are being pursued.  For example, if you plan to build a capital building with the highest requirements (for example, fire resistance of the first degree), then this involves the use of fireproof materials.  By lowering the requests, the level of execution decreases.  For example, for objects of the fifth degree of fire resistance, the use of only combustible materials is provided.  In general, all this falls under state regulation.  Therefore, emergency situations should not arise, since this area has been actively developed and improved for several years.  Of course, if you fulfill all the requirements in full, and not want to do everything according to the documents at the highest level, then in reality, save here and there. </p><h2>  What has not been mentioned yet? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.heraldnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="construction of warehouse and industrial buildings" class="if uuid-3094350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/3094350.jpg"></div><p>  A permit for the construction of an industrial building can be issued to conduct activities in any temperature and climatic conditions.  True, it is necessary that the design of the facility corresponds to them.  Interestingly, in industrial construction it is often much more difficult to apply a standard approach than to design something from scratch.  This is due to the fact that objects often have unique requirements that they need to complete their work.  For example, a river or several nearby main roads with convenient access to them may be required.  The construction of industrial buildings must take into account all these points.  Indeed, in the modern world such an affordable abundance is achieved not only thanks to scientific and technological progress, but also to the very perfect supply business. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ny.curbed.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="organization of the construction of an industrial building" class="if uuid-3094352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37840/3094352.jpg"></div><p>  Here, and considered all the basic information that you should know about.  If a certain hitch or uncertainty arises, it is always necessary to refer to the Building Norms and Rules, choosing the exact document that considers the current situation.  In it you can find answers to almost any requests and challenges facing the company.  Focusing on this regulatory document, the construction of industrial buildings allows you to count on obtaining high-quality results and achieve your goals in terms of the quality of the facilities being created.  That's all, perhaps, and can only be thanked for attention. </p>
