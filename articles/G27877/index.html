However, all of these individual rooms are very small.  For a family of three, it‚Äôs quite suitable, especially at the initial stage, until you manage to save up for more spacious apartments.  You need to be prepared for the neighbors located right behind the wall and a few meters from the front door, since all apartments are located in one corridor.  It should be noted that this is the most ideal option for a small family, in fact there are much worse options. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Types of Small Families </h2>

    <ol><li>  Dormitory, where there are small rooms and a shared toilet with shower, kitchen.  This is a large <span>communal apartment.</span>  No privacy, everything that happens behind the wall is heard by the rest.  There is no way to go to the toilet or shower when you want.  Frequent quarrels with residents in the kitchen and other difficulties.  The disadvantage of such communal apartments is the inability to buy such housing or to acquire ownership.  You need to understand that all these apartments belong to a single enterprise, where everything is privatized and owned by one owner. </li><li>  Separate apartments ranging from 12 to 45 square meters, designed for two or even three rooms, but small in size.  This is the most economical option.  Any opportunity to purchase housing is considered a real success, including a small family.  What is it?  Not a mansion, but still a roof over your head, under which you can fully live.  A separate <span>long corridor,</span> designed for 8-12 apartments, is an ideal option for a small family. </li></ol><h2></h2><h2>  To whom does the small family fit? </h2>

These people know what a small family is like, that this is not a separate full-fledged apartment, but still the most affordable way to buy a small living space.  In areas remote from the center you can find quite acceptable options for buying an apartment of this kind.  The cheapest will, of course, be a dormitory, which is ideal for students.  For a young family, a small-family apartment with its own bathroom and bathroom is better.  For visitors, you can find numerous advertisements in newspapers or contact the real estate agency, where there are a lot of such offers. </p><h2></h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="small family apartment" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17593/349064.jpg?1394176190703" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Little Fills Now </h2><p>  Today's real estate - small families, guest houses and other types of housing - has undergone significant changes.
