  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Find a phone by Google account: procedure, necessary data, recommendations and tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any mobile phone may be lost or stolen.  More recently, users did not hope that the device can be returned.  Today, there are special search functions that significantly increase the chance to return the loss.  It's time to get acquainted with the main ways to find the phone on a Google account. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Finding out which devices are connected to your Google account is easy.  It is enough for the user to open the browser and go to the official Google website.  Then you need to open the page of recently used devices and find the phone by Google account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="home.bt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Application activation" class="if uuid-3152782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3152782.jpg"></div><p>  In order to carry out a search, the following conditions must be met: </p><ul><li>  mobile phone must be activated; </li><li>  the device is tied to a <span>Google account;</span> </li><li>  <span>the option "Remote control" is activated on the device</span> </li><li>  <span>the gadget is defined on Google Play;</span> </li><li>  <span>Location sharing and network access activated on your device.</span> </li></ul><p>  If the user has disabled the geodata transfer function, it will be impossible to find the phone using the Google account.  In order to activate this option, just open the "Settings" section and click on the "Options" button.  In the menu that opens, you need to touch the line "Location services" and activate the checkbox on the search "By network coordinates". </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Activating remote device control </h2><p>  The user will need to go to the "Settings" menu and find the "Security" item.  Then you need to select the line "Device Administrators" in the right pane.  Near the item " <span>Android</span> Remote Control <span>", check the box and open this section.</span>  <span>After that, just click on the "Enable" button in the "Activate device administrators" box.</span> </p><h2>  <span>How to find a phone</span> on Google Play </h2><p>  To do this, go to the official Google Play website and open the "Settings" section.  All attached devices will be presented to users in the list.  Finding a phone from a <span>Google account</span> is easy, but the device must be turned on.  Otherwise, the user can only find out information about the last Internet connection. </p><h2>  How to find a gadget using a PC </h2><p>  <span>Before you begin the search, you must log in to Google.</span>  <span>The user</span> will need to click on the "Google Apps" icon.  The page that opens should be scrolled down and click on the "Phone Search" tab.  If several gadgets are tied to one account, you need to choose among them the one you are interested in.  After confirming the system, you can choose a method that allows you to find the phone on your Google account from your computer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kdocx.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Search for a gadget" class="if uuid-3152778" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3152778.jpg"></div><p>  The system offers two main options: search on the map or ring in real time.  The latter method works perfectly if the mobile device is lost in the car, at home or in the office.  Activating this feature will cause the mobile device to ring for 5 minutes, attracting the attention of others.  The indicated sequence of actions will help not only find the phone by Google account, but also find out the full history of movements. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Search using another smartphone </h2><p>  In order to simplify the search for a stolen or lost device, you can use special mobile applications.  Such programs are provided completely free of charge.  <span>Find</span> My Device application allows you to quickly find your phone by Google account.  In order to enter the program that is installed on someone else‚Äôs device, you must click on the ‚ÄúLogin as a guest‚Äù button.  After that, you will need to go through the authorization procedure and prove that the account really belongs to the user.  The system should then be allowed to provide location data.  The program allows the user to log out of the account and remotely erase the data. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tnwildlifecenter.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phone settings" class="if uuid-3152781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3152781.jpg"></div><p>  There is a convenient web interface with which you can find your phone through your Google account.  To do this, just go to the official website of the company and click on the search page adapted for mobile devices.  The user will need to go through the authorization procedure, and then repeat the actions performed with the computer. </p><h2>  What is needed for successful tracking? </h2><p>  Users need to pay attention to certain conditions before proceeding with the search procedure.  The mobile device must be connected to the Device Manager service, and also have a <span>GPS</span> module <span>.</span>  <span>The standard Device Manager application is installed on all Android phones.</span>  <span>In this application, you need to activate the Remotely Locate Device slider and enable remote memory erasure.</span> </p><h2>  account settings </h2><p>  The user will need to activate the localization detection services.  This can be done as follows: </p><ul><li>  go to settings; </li><li>  Find the "Location" tab and check the box next to the map item; </li><li>  open the tab "Access to location" and activate the option to regularly receive data on the location of the device. </li></ul><p>  The specified sequence of actions will help users answer the question about how to find the phone using a Google account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.express.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Location Activation" class="if uuid-3152783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3152783.jpg"></div><p>  Experts report that this feature is available only for mobile devices with firmware version 2.2 and higher.  Devices with an older operating system appear in your account, but you cannot connect to them. </p><h2>  3rd party applications </h2><p>  The device owner can use not only standard services from <span>Google, but also the convenient Find</span> My Mobile <span>program</span> .  The service is tied to the account data and creates an account.  At the page linking stage, these actions are performed automatically.  The application works in the same way as other counterparts from Google.  Using this program, you can find the phone by Google account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="solarconflict.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Registration procedure" class="if uuid-3152784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3152784.jpg"></div><p>  For the application to work correctly, it is necessary to go through the authorization procedure using the login and password <span>from Google.</span>  <span>Then you need to find your gadget and click on Locate</span> My Phone.  You will need to wait for the map to load and click on the <span>Locate mobile</span> section <span>, and then on Start Tracking.</span>  <span>After that, the user will be presented with a mark on the map about the estimated location.</span> </p><h2>  The main functions of the service </h2><p>  The user can not only find the phone on the Google account, but also send messages to the mobile device and activate the sound signal on the gadget.  Also, the owner of the device can clear the data on the smartphone.  Thus, the attacker will not use records, photos and other personal data.  In addition, the user can set the access key to the mobile device at a remote distance.  The capabilities of the advanced service allow you to track even the movement of the gadget. </p><h2>  Brief conclusion </h2><p>  Experts say the search process should begin as early as possible.  This will increase the likelihood of finding the phone on your Google account and pick it up when you reach a certain place.  It should be taken into account and some error maps on the territory of the CIS countries.  In fact, the gadget may be within 10 meters of the indicated mark on the map. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Finding a smartphone using a PC" class="if uuid-3152785" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3152785.jpg"></div><p>  Users who are worried about whether the phone can be found on a Google account can not worry, since the chances of returning the device are quite high.  The service provides good opportunities to ensure that users' gadgets are in integrity and security.  Keep in mind that deactivating the location sharing option cuts off the ability to find a phone using a Google account. </p>
