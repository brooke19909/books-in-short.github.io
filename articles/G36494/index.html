Spending evenings for classic knitting or reading books is certainly interesting, but there are still so many exciting activities in the world!  We began to learn about some of them only now.  For example, a cereal picture was such a rarity until recently, and now more and more often it can be found in an ordinary apartment.  It would seem that rice, buckwheat, peas - this is what we eat, but they fit perfectly into the decor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY paintings from cereals" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/212779.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <p>  Necessary materials </p><p>  What do we need to "write" such <span>pictures with our own hands?</span>  Almost everything is suitable for cereals: millet, rice, buckwheat, oats and wheat, even poppy and sesame, although these products have nothing to do with cereals.  In principle, everything in the kitchen will work: seeds, pasta, any spices, including salt and sugar.  As a basis, take thick paper, cardboard or plywood.  Also, you can not do without glue and a simple pencil.  For convenience, you can prepare small containers in which you will pour the necessary material. </p><p>  Creating a picture of cereals </p><p>  A master class on this topic can be easily found on special resources devoted to needlework and creative creativity.  We will introduce you to the basics of the mentioned skill.  Before you begin, decide what you are going to portray.  So, with a simple pencil, draw a sketch on the paper on which you are going to glue.  Think about which cereal will be on one or another piece of your drawing.  Coat the area that you intend to fill thoroughly with glue and immediately sprinkle the grains; the layer of consumable should not be too thick. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cereal picture" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/212781.jpg" width="506"></div>  If necessary, cereals can be painted using ordinary paint, such as gouache.  Do not try to immediately create masterpieces, start with something simple.  For beginners, it will not be difficult to portray, for example, sunflowers.  They are easy to draw, and such a picture looks very beautiful.  The middle of the flowers can be filled with buckwheat, which will need to be painted with black paint.  Make the rim of the rice and paint it dark.  Let‚Äôs take millet for the petals, and green peas for the leaves and the stem.  Although they can also be made from rice, and then painted in the desired color.  But it is much more interesting to use precisely different materials - both cereals and spices.  The result will be amazing!  Everything, our picture of cereals is ready!  But you can complicate the task a bit by filling all the free spaces of any of the cereals, preferably of small caliber.  For a change, try laying out images with pasta and spices.  So, for example, sunflower seeds can be made not from buckwheat, but from black pepper peas.  And as carved leaves or spikelets, pasta is suitable, since there is plenty to choose from.

    <p>  To create it, as a basis, you need a sheet of plywood.  It is necessary to draw borders on it with a pencil.  It can be rectangles, squares, circles - all that your fantasy tells you.  So you need to divide the entire surface.  From thick cardboard, it is necessary to cut the sides that will be glued along the lines of the figures, and to separate the cereals from each other.  We coat the formed cells with PVA glue and cover it well with cereals and spices.  It is important that the base does not shine through the artistic material.  Now you need to complete the frame.  For this, you can also use any improvised material.  A frame made of small, neat bunches of hay will look good.  For greater reliability, it is advisable to coat the product again with glue on top or cover it with a protective varnish.  Such a picture of cereals is perfect not only for kitchen decor, but also for the living room, dining room.  It is also a great option for a gift to family or friends.  Such an eco-picture made of natural material will delight anyone with its unusual texture.  And if you take a child with the decor of cereals, he will not only have a great time, but also will train <span>fine motor skills of his</span> fingers, which is very useful. </p>
