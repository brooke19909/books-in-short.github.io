  <section class="page js-page"><h1>AMOLED display - the foreseeable future</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  We constantly hear that many world companies are constantly working on creating new devices and technologies of the future.  This future is already starting today, because we use devices that seemed to be very complex and impossible 5-10 years ago.  However, it is precisely such devices, such as mobile phones, computers, tablets and more, that are developing most rapidly.  This also includes communication and data transfer technologies.  In fact, we can observe that some kind of globalization and unification into one network are happening now. </p><p>  However, the devices themselves are also undergoing major changes.  They become smaller and more compact, but under such a small case they manage to ‚Äúhide‚Äù a much more complex and powerful filling.  With the proliferation of touchscreen smartphones and tablets, special demands have been placed on screen quality.  And the requirements are such that the tablet or smartphone is in no way inferior to the screens of computers or modern TVs in the quality of the image display.  And manufacturers have created a new technology - AMOLED display. </p><p>  AMOLED Technology </p><p>  The full name of this technology is Active Matrix <span>Organic Light Emitting Diode.</span>  Most companies have already switched to using this technology in their devices - almost all screens of new devices are created using this technology.  The essence of this innovation is that the AMOLED display allows you to solve a standard problem for all previous generations of screens - poor color reproduction, low contrast, low brightness and, as a result, the screen fades in bright sunshine.  In other words, a phone or any other device is almost impossible to use in bright <span>daylight.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to external improvements, the AMOLED display is designed to solve another problem - power consumption.  Since with the development of devices and increasing capacity, energy consumption is constantly growing.  Now manufacturers are trying to reduce this dependence so that smartphones can work longer.  The AMOLED display can efficiently consume battery power, and the screen has always remained the most energy-consuming part, especially with the advent of large <span>touch displays.</span> </p><p>  Disadvantages and advantages of AMOLED </p><p>  Like any relatively new technology, AMOLED is not without flaws.  It takes time to get rid of them.  The screen may fade a little over time, in addition, the improved brightness and contrast sometimes make the image unnatural, and due to problems when trying to display the color balance, some noise may appear. </p><p>  Nevertheless, AMOLED technology continues to develop successfully, and many experts and ordinary users have recognized its advantages.  Gradually they bring it to mind, now AMOLED TVs have begun to appear actively, which successfully displace plasma panels.  The only thing that remained the main obstacle to market promotion is a higher cost.  As a rule, users are distrustful of new technologies, because the price is higher, and the devices themselves have some drawbacks. </p><p>  However, there were much fewer minuses even at the very beginning of the advent of technology and its use than pluses.  And after manufacturers were able to lower the price of their devices, consumers became interested in technology and began to actively purchase such smartphones and televisions.  Tablet computers were not left behind, now, before buying, the client usually checks which screen, what capabilities it has, etc.  We can say that consumers have become more picky, so they want to choose only the best.  Along with this, companies striving for leadership positions strive to bring to mind the products on offer.  And for the technology of AMOLED screens - this is definitely a step into the future. </p>
