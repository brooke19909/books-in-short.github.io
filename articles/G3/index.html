    <h2>  Connecting DVD models </h2><p>  The <span>connection</span> diagram <span>for the</span> specified type of <span>car radio</span> involves the use of straight through adapters with two connectors.  As a rule, manufacturers do not use an extension cord for the subwoofer.  In this case, the installation of the device should begin by connecting the stereo unit.  To do this, carefully inspect the adapter.  Many models are made with linear outputs.  In this case, the connection is via a contact conductor.  However, it is important to note that there are devices with coaxial outputs on the market. </p><p>  An adapter with a receiver is selected for them.  The front speakers are connected via blue wires.  The rear speakers can be connected via an adapter or a double adapter.  Various extension cords are used to connect the subwoofer.  In some cases, they can be installed with insulators.  A fuse is used to protect the stereo unit.  The output for the battery is usually indicated in red. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Pioneer MVH-15UB Connection Diagram </h2><p>  The Pioneer car radio connection diagram involves the use of a one-way adapter.  The stereo unit in this case is connected quite simply.  An adapter for this is used on two connectors.  There are green wires for connecting the front speakers.  The model‚Äôs subwoofer can only be connected through an adapter.  In this case, the fuse is used without a receiver.  In order for the system to work without failures, it is very important to check the condition of the insulators.  Connecting to the battery connector last. </p><h2>  Installation of the Sony XAV-601 radio tape recorder </h2><p>  The connection diagram of the <span>Sony car radio</span> involves the use of a simple adapter adapter.  In total, the model has three outputs.  In this case, the stereo unit is equipped with three linear connectors.  A fuse is used to protect the device.  An extension cord is required to connect it.  In some cases, an additional insulator is installed. </p><p>  However, it is important to note that it is not included in the standard kit.  The front speakers in the device can only be connected through gray conductors.  In this case, the subwoofer is connected without an extension cord.  In order to avoid cases of short circuit, insulators are used.  The rear speakers of the car are connected to the system last.  The left speaker is connected to the blue wire of the second adapter.  A red connector is provided for the right speaker. </p><h2>  Connecting the Sony XAV-603 to a subwoofer and speakers </h2><p>  The connection diagram of this type of car radio requires two adapters and one adapter.  For a high-quality installation of the device, it is first of all important to tackle the stereo unit.  In total, it has two line outputs.  They are necessary for connecting adapters.  The adapter is connected to the system only through an extension cord.  In this case, the fuse is standardly used with a contactor.  After connecting the stereo unit, you should take up the subwoofer. </p><p>  To do everything efficiently, you will need two isolators.  The wires to the subwoofer are blue.  In this case, an extension cord is not required.  To solve problems with high humidity, pads are used.  All connectors must be clean.  After connecting the subwoofer, you can start connecting the front speakers.  This is pretty easy to do.  The adapter in this case is required with a coaxial output.  A yellow wire is connected to the left speaker. </p><p>  There is a blue output on the right column.  In this case, the wire is used in the appropriate color.  The rear speakers, according to the standard scheme, are connected through a second adapter.  The connectors on it should be painted green.  The left speaker is connected through a red wire.  On the right column you can see the blue connector.  In this case, the wire is selected from the adapter of the corresponding color. </p>

    <h2>  Sony XAV-605 Connection Diagram </h2><p>  The car radio connection diagram has two adapters.  In this case, they must be a contact type.  The stereo unit of the car radio is made with coaxial connectors.  To properly install the device, you must first take the adapter.  In total, six wires depart from it.  The model controller is used without a receiver. </p><p>  A blue wire is used to connect the stereo unit.  The battery connector can be accessed through the red socket, but in this case the wire is used with an insulator.  A fuse is required to protect the system.  He must be together with the stereo unit.  After installing the subwoofer, you just have to connect the speakers. </p><h2>  Installing the Digital DCA-115: expert advice </h2><p>  The connection diagram of the specified model of the radio implies the presence of feed-through adapters and three adapters.  The fuse in this case is used with the controller.  You can connect the device immediately through the stereo unit.  Also, installation is allowed to start by connecting speakers. </p><p>  If you select the first option, the adapter is used with a linear output.  In this case, a red wire is supplied to the stereo unit.  The front speakers are connected through the controller.  The extension cord should not be used.  A red wire is taken on the left speaker.  There is a blue connector on the right speaker.  To connect it, a wire of the corresponding color is used. </p>

    <h2>  Digital DCA-122 model reviews </h2><p>  These car radios can easily be connected through a conventional adapter.  It is used as standard with contact type adapters.  An extension cord is required to connect the stereo unit.  It moves away from the linear connector.  You can recognize it by color (blue output).  A two-way adapter is used to connect the front speakers.  In total, he has two line outputs.  First of all, it should be noted that the left column is connected through the red wire.  The right speaker of the model has a blue connector.  A wire of the corresponding color is used for it. </p><p>  Then it remains to connect the subwoofer.  An extension cord is used for this from the first adapter.  In this case, the wire moves away from the coaxial output.  According to experts, the isolator from the subwoofer is installed last.  It is also important to note that the conductor must be connected to the fuse.  The circuit for <span>connecting the amplifier</span> to the car radio has two contactors and only one adapter. </p><h2>  Installation of the JVC KW-SD70 radio </h2><p>  The JVC car radio connection scheme involves the use of two-period contactors.  In this case, there are three adapters.  Fuses in the model are included with the receiver.  The installation of a radio tape recorder of the specified manufacturer should begin with the stereo unit.  First of all, a wired type adapter is taken.  It has three small linear connectors.  They are used to connect speakers.  In this case, the adapter must be used with blue connectors. </p>

    <p>  If you believe the reviews of experts, it is more advisable to install a fuse last.  In some cases, the adapter is fixed with insulators.  The stereo unit must be installed near the contactor.  A standard adapter with coaxial outputs is used to connect the front side speakers.  In this case, the wires are gray. </p><p>  A transient adapter is used to connect the rear speakers.  The insulators in this case should move away from the line connectors.  The left rear speaker is connected through the red conductor.  There is a green output on the right speaker.  Therefore, the wire should use the appropriate color. </p>
