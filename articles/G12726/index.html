    <h2>  General view </h2><p>  This hotel complex is located in close proximity to the beach - only two hundred meters separates guests from the Black Sea.  And this is not the only plus in the location of the hotel.  Near it you can find anything you want - numerous shops, a supermarket and a public transport stop.  Moreover, a water park is located very close by - just 800 meters from the hotel.  And to the city of Nessebar, which is a real national treasure, you need to drive 10 minutes by car or minibus.  Be sure to visit this place while staying at the resort.  After all, this is a real miracle - a city that went under the water several centuries ago.  By the way, the airport is not very far - a little more than 20 kilometers.  So tourists can easily get to their temporary residence. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Outdoor activities </h2><p>  Guests of MPM Hotel Kalina Garden 4 can enjoy various on-site activities.  There is a spacious <span>swimming pool,</span> not far from it there is a terrace where you can sunbathe and a cozy garden.  Guests can also enjoy a delicious barbecue.  It should be noted that there is a children's section in the pool, so people who come to rest with their child will have something to occupy the baby with.  Every evening, the animation team conducts a variety of show programs and theme parties.  And for young guests - special children's performances. </p>

    <h2>  Bar and restaurant services </h2><p>  Many potential guests pre-study what the hotel can offer them in terms of food, since not all hotels offer breakfast and lunch.  MPM Kalina Garden 4 (Bulgaria) mainly operates the buffet system in the main restaurant.  There is also a snack bar where guests can order ice cream, pastries, a variety of snacks or fresh pizza from 10:00 to 18:00.  They also offer evening treats (from 22:00 to 23:00).  Alcoholic drinks can be ordered from 10 am to 23 pm.  The lobby offers non-alcoholic cocktails and freshly squeezed juices.  There is also a bar next to the pool.  And besides, there are various cafes nearby, only few of the guests staying at Kalina Garden MPM need them. </p>

    <h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  The hotel is a six-story building, which has 310 rooms of various types.  In "Kalina Garden" there are standard rooms, connected rooms and spacious apartment-suite.  The first type includes rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 30 square meters - three adults or two with children can easily accommodate there.  Suite apartments are large rooms with a bedroom and a living room, a maximum of four people are allowed.  Individual accommodation services include the provision of an extra bed if guests come with children.  By the way, if the child is not two years old, then he lives for free, in addition, a crib will be put in the room specially for him.  The only restriction that is set here is that you can not move with your pets.  I must say that MPM Kalina Garden 4 (Bulgaria) is quite popular, because rooms are booked here several months before check-in.  It should be noted if you want to come to this place to relax.  Perhaps such a demand can still be explained by fairly reasonable prices set by the hotel.  For example, one double room will cost two guests 40 thousand rubles.  This is due to the fact that the hotel operates on an all-inclusive basis.  The rooms, by the way, have everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Comfortable beds, refrigerator, TV, air conditioning, bathroom, hairdryer, toiletries, the toilet itself and much more.  In general - everything is cozy, at home and no frills. </p>

    <h2>  Comments and reviews of tourists </h2><p>  Many people choose a country such as Bulgaria to spend their holidays.  Hotel Kalina Garden is also often the choice of tourists.  And I must say, he makes excuses.  Guests say the hotel lives up to all expectations.  The rooms are very comfortable, clean and spacious, the food is above all praise, everything is always tasty, fresh and original.  In addition, very attentive waiters - as soon as the refreshments at the buffet were over, they immediately added more.  Many argue that even taking breakfast alone can be completely satiated.  Fans of entertainment note the attention of an unobtrusive, but interesting animation.  And, of course, everyone liked the friendly and welcoming staff.  The hotel receives positive reviews from guests of completely different age categories, and this can rightfully be considered one of the best recommendations. </p>
