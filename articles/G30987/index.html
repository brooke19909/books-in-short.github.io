This is facilitated by the low cost of recreation and the original culture of the country, as well as the opportunity to come here on vacation even in the winter season and the diverse orientation of local resorts.  Occupation to the liking here will be found by party-goers and people who are looking for a calm and measured rest.  The cost of living also varies.  You can rent luxury apartments or book a small and inexpensive room in a three-star hotel.  One of them is Ambassador City Inn Wing 3 *.  We will tell about it in more detail in our article, we will consider its numbers and location, as well as the infrastructure and reviews of tourists. </p><h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  Pattaya is a very large and lively resort, so you need to carefully choose a place to relax, so that, for example, a lover of peace and quiet does not accidentally settle on a street full of vibrant nightlife.  To begin with, it is worth noting that the Ambassador City Jomtien Inn Wing 3 * hotel is located near Jomtien Beach.  Its distinguishing features are picturesque landscapes along the coast, as well as a relatively calm environment, as large nightclubs and bars are at a decent distance from here.  Nevertheless, the unassuming tourist will not be bored here: along the beach on the embankment there are many classic bars, shopping centers and a fishing park, there is also a small water park where you can relax with small children. </p><p>  At the same time, prices in this area are slightly lower, since most often Jomtien Beach is chosen by local residents for relaxation.  Nevertheless, tourists can always easily visit other <span>areas of Pattaya.</span>  You can head to the local islands for diving or surfing.  If desired, tourists can also reach Bangkok - the journey will take about 2 hours.  You can come to Pattaya all year long, as the weather is always hot here.  However, the best option would be from November to March.  In the remaining months, you can get to the rainy season.  It is hotter in the resort in December and February, at which time the sea warms up as much as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel Ambassador City Inn Wing 3 *: basic information </h2><p>  Choosing a hotel to stay, many tourists are repelled primarily from their own finances.  The described hotel is perfect for a budget holiday, while the quality of the services provided here is at a high level.  The fact is that the Ambassador City Jomtien Inn Wing 3 * complex is one of the most crowded hotels in Pattaya.  It has the largest territory, and the beach adjacent to it is considered the longest in the resort.  This huge hotel complex is suitable for absolutely all categories of tourists: youth companies, businessmen, and couples with small children stay here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wotif.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Exterior of the main building" class="if uuid-2343861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2343861.jpg"></div><p>  This hotel is simply amazing in its size.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãits territory is 184,000 square meters.  m. There are four main residential buildings: </p><ul><li>  Ocean Wing - a seventeen-story building that offers 1666 rooms; </li><li>  Tower Wing - 42-storey building, which houses 1457 apartments; </li><li>  Inn Wing - a four-story building without an elevator, which is more suitable for youth companies, for which 748 rooms are offered; </li><li>  Garden Wing - a six-story building, accommodating 342 rooms. </li></ul><p>  In total, the Ambassador Inn Wing 3 * hotel in Pattaya has about 4,000 apartments, which can simultaneously accommodate more than 8,000 people.  The complex was built in 1997.  Pets are not allowed in the hotel.  But accommodation is allowed with children of any age.  It is worth noting that during registration all guests are charged a fee ($ 100) as a deposit for 1 room.  And you need to pay it only in cash.  The hotel has Russian-speaking staff, so you can come here without even knowing English. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Despite its huge size, the Ambassador City Jomtien Inn Wing 3 * complex (Thailand) has a favorable location, which also attracts tourists here.  It is located on the southern tip of Jomtien Beach in a quiet and remote place from the bustle of the city.  The hotel is built right on the coast, so the road to the beach will take only a few minutes, and the distance to it will depend on the building in which the guests settle.  Quite a few cafes and restaurants are open on the waterfront, offering you to try national dishes at low prices.  A large shopping center is 200 meters away.  The boat club is 1.2 km from here.  The central area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPattaya is 10 km away from the complex, but you can get to it by public transport or taxi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Some rooms have an open terrace" class="if uuid-2343849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2343849.jpg"></div><p>  Perhaps the main drawback of the location is the considerable distance from the transport hubs.  <span>Suvarnabhumi</span> International <span>Airport</span> is 100 km from the hotel, so tourists have to spend several hours on the way to the resting place.  In this regard, when buying a ticket it is worth taking care of the transfer.  The hotel offers this service by picking up its guests from the airport on a modern and comfortable bus equipped with comfortable seats and air conditioning, so the road is easily transported. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What categories of apartments did the hotel prepare for tourists? </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the Ambassador City Jomtien Inn Wing 3 * complex in Pattaya does not offer a wide variety of rooms.  Almost all living rooms have a standard category and are designed for two adults, to which a child can be hooked on an extra bed.  However, if desired, large families and youth companies can book connecting rooms that are interconnected by an interior door.  Non-smoking apartments are also available.  But there are no rooms equipped with everything necessary for guests with physical disabilities, so they should find a more comfortable option for accommodation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The appearance of the hotel rooms" class="if uuid-2343844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2343844.jpg"></div><p>  All rooms consist of a bedroom and a bathroom.  It is important to know that not all apartments have balconies.  To this end, you need to choose the Ocean Wing enclosure for placement.  Room sizes range from 18 to 24 square meters.  m. All apartments are renovated in a modern style.  The last renovation was carried out in 2012.  Guests can choose from rooms with double and single beds. </p><h2>  Basic amenities found in the room </h2><p>  All apartments of the Ambassador City Inn Wing 3 * hotel in Thailand have the same equipment.  It is also worth saying that the living rooms are cleaned daily by the hotel staff.  They regularly change bed sheets and towels in the bathroom.  Also, guests can find the following equipment in their rooms: </p><ul><li>  a small refrigerator in which food and drinks can be stored for free; </li><li>  TV of the old model - it does not have a flat screen, but a set of satellite channels, mostly English, are connected to it; </li><li>  central air conditioning - it is regulated by specialists who set the level of cooling depending on the outdoor temperature; </li><li>  Wired telephone - with it you can make local and international calls, but only for a fee; </li><li>  hangers and dryers for clothes; </li><li>  minibar for storing drinks - one bottle of drinking water per day is provided free of charge, and for other drinks you can pay separately if you wish; </li><li>  toiletries in the bathroom - guests are given a set of towels, a shower cap, liquid soap, shampoo and bath gel. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The terrace overlooks the sea" class="if uuid-2343847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2343847.jpg"></div><h2>  Where can I eat? </h2><p>  The hotel complex Ambassador Inn Wing 3 * in Thailand is a large hotel.  Many guests spend their holidays on its territory, so there are many establishments offering a snack for a small fee.  When making a ticket, tourists can include breakfast in its price.  They are served daily at the main restaurants, which serve a common buffet.  As a rule, each building has its own catering establishment.  In addition, for a fee and upon reservation, you can visit the restaurants of Japanese, Chinese, Asian, international, Thai and American cuisines. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The hotel has several restaurants" class="if uuid-2343850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2343850.jpg"></div><p>  Some restaurants are open around the clock, and their guests in institutions are served exclusively by the menu.  If you want to treat yourself to soft drinks or snacks, you can find them in six bars that are located around the entire perimeter of the hotel, including the pool and the beach.  A games room is open every day, where drinks and snacks are served until 23:00.  There is also a sports bar in the hotel where you can not only have a refreshing cocktail, but also watch the broadcast of a match.  Drinks and meals at these establishments are not included in the price and are available for a fee. </p><h2>  The hotel territory and its infrastructure </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the territory of the Ambassador City Inn Wing 3 * Hotel in Pattaya is really huge, so there are many infrastructure facilities that provide their services for free or for a fee.  We list the most significant of them: </p><ul><li>  the therapist‚Äôs office provides its services only for a fee and opens upon request, and if necessary, the doctor can be called directly to the room; </li><li>  a beauty salon and hairdresser are also paid; </li><li>  car parking is only free for hotel guests and without reservation; if you wish, you can rent a car at the reception; </li><li>  valuables and large bags or suitcases can be left in the luggage storage room; </li><li>  ATM and currency exchange are located at the reception; </li><li>  in the laundry you can hand over clothes for washing, as well as clean shoes and leather goods; </li><li>  there are several shops, including a souvenir shop; </li><li>  The business center, equipped with modern computers and projectors, is located in the Ocean Wing building; its halls can accommodate up to 5000 delegates. </li></ul><p>  In addition, the complex can connect to wireless Internet.  For a week of use, a fee of approximately 150 baht is charged. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Souvenirs can be bought at the store." class="if uuid-2343863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2343863.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The main advantage of the Ambassador Inn Wing 3 * hotel, which significantly distinguishes it from other Pattaya hotels, is the presence of its own sandy beach.  Its length is almost 1 km.  Free sun loungers, umbrellas and air mattresses are located on the coast, and towels can be obtained from the administrator after making a deposit.  The lack of a road between the beach and the hotel is another significant plus.  There are volleyball courts, showers, a bar and toilets on the coast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wotif.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The view from the hotel windows" class="if uuid-2343854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2343854.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to swim in fresh water, then pay attention to the outdoor pools, which are located directly on the territory of the complex.  There are five of them.  The pools share a common terrace for sunbathing, which also houses free sun loungers and sun umbrellas.  All pools are open daily until 17:00. </p><h2>  Is there any other entertainment? </h2><p>  Of course, not only a beach holiday offers guests the Ambassador Inn Wing 3 * complex.  There are many options for other entertainment that will satisfy both lovers of active activities, and tourists who prefer a quiet pastime.  For example, for a fee, guests can visit the spa, which offers wellness treatments or massages.  On its territory there is a sauna and a jacuzzi.  It is completely free to use the gym. </p><p>  For sports enthusiasts, basketball, tennis, including table tennis, and water activities are also provided.  For a fee, you can ride the sea on a banana or catamaran.  In the evening, you can visit the indoor billiard room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pasirinksparnus.lt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Billiard room" class="if uuid-2343862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2343862.jpg"></div><h2>  What conditions are provided for guests with children? </h2><p>  Often, tourists with young children come to the Ambassador Inn Wing 3 * hotel.  However, it cannot be said that they are provided with a wide selection of amenities and services.  So, they can request a crib in the room, but their number is limited, so not everyone has enough furniture in the high season.  Of the entertainment for children, only a separate children's pool is provided.  There is no animation and a mini-club here, so parents will have to take care of organizing their child‚Äôs leisure activities on their own.  However, if necessary, they can still call a nanny, but she provides her services only for a fee.  Also, tourists are unlikely to find a nanny who is fluent in Russian. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about Ambassador City Jomtien Inn Wing 3 * </h2><p>  This hotel is distinguished by its enormous size, therefore, of course, its staff cannot treat all the guests resting in it with equal attention.  For this reason, the hotel has a controversial reputation, although the unassuming tourists liked it here.  In their reviews of Ambassador Inn Wing 3 *, they describe many of the benefits of staying at a hotel, among which are the following: </p><ul><li>  Well-groomed area, which is regularly cleaned by hotel staff.  It is strikingly different from the usual streets of Pattaya, which are simply strewn with garbage. </li><li>  Five spacious pools suitable for swimming adults.  At the same time, there are never many tourists in them, and there are enough sun loungers for all guests. </li><li>  There is almost no garbage on the coast.  The water in the sea is also very clean, so you can swim in it even with young children, which is a rarity for crowded Pattaya. </li><li>  At the entrance to the hotel has its own market, where they sell products and souvenirs without huge margins. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Room Interior" class="if uuid-2343875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44085/2343875.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  However, a considerable number of guests did not like the rest at the Ambassador Inn Wing 3 *.  They felt that for the fee charged for accommodation, you need to demonstrate better service.  At the same time, some note that the shortcomings were usually insignificant, while others, on the contrary, complain that the rest was completely ruined.  In order not to be among them, before the trip, all tourists should familiarize themselves with negative reviews.  In them, tourists indicate the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Almost all rooms do not have their own balcony.  In addition, some rooms need serious repairs, as they look untidy. </li><li>  Monotonous breakfasts quickly get bored.  Also, the choice of dishes is not very large, and the cooks cook tastelessly, so many guests ate at other establishments. </li><li>  The hotel staff speaks almost no Russian or English.  Employees have a strong emphasis, which is sometimes impossible to understand.  Therefore, they ignore many problems of tourists, pretending that they do not understand their complaints. </li><li>  Not all elevators work properly, for this reason guests have to wait a long time for them to get to the last floors in their rooms. </li><li>  A lot of Chinese people are resting on the hotel territory, who make a lot of noise, behave unrestrainedly, and sometimes even indecently. </li></ul><h2>  Should I choose this hotel for relaxation? </h2><p>  Everyone must decide whether he needs to buy a ticket to the Ambassador City Inn Wing 3 * hotel.  Reviews are most often different and contain both advantages and disadvantages.  Therefore, when making a decision, it is worth relying on your own desires.  If you want to relax in a quiet and peaceful place, where there are no many other tourists, then this place is unlikely to suit you.  And if a convenient location is more important for you, then the hotel will become a worthy option for you. </p>
