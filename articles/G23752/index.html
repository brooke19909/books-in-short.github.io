  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Newspaper weaving</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the oldest crafts was wickerwork, and the most common wickerwork was baskets.  And in our time, master-inventors invented a new craft - paper weaving.  From ordinary newspapers and unnecessary magazines, it turns out, you can make real masterpieces! </p><p>  This <span>type of weaving is</span> very economical, because you do not need to spend money on expensive materials, for example, expensive yarn or beads.  A new type of weaving is not only cheaper and more convenient than traditional, but also more affordable.  Probably for many people this fascinating activity today is becoming a favorite thing - a hobby! <br>  Paper weaving is available to everyone, and to see this, you just need to try. </p><p>  <span>Weaving from newspapers</span> for beginners should first of all begin with the preparation of materials for work and tools.  You can use any paper, but color newspapers or magazine pages are best.  It is fashionable to make frame parts from dense sheets.  In addition to paper, you need to prepare a knife or scissors, a knitting needle No. 1,5 or No. 2 and a knitting hook.  The knitting needle is needed for twisting the tubes, and the hook - for dragging the paper rod between the rows, when you need to hide the edge at the end of the weaving. </p><p>  Weaving from newspapers for beginners should begin with the technique of making a paper tube or vine.  A vine of paper can be made infinitely long by growing paper fragments.  Sheets of paper build up with glue, but you can do without it.  Moreover, the use of glue sometimes softens the joints and makes these places in the product the most vulnerable. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From newspapers you can weave a variety of objects, for example, the most ordinary baskets.  And although they are inferior in strength to the baskets of vines, with proper processing they can last quite a while. <br>  You can make paper tubes without the help of knitting needles, twisting sheets of paper obliquely. </p><p>  Weaving from newspapers for beginners is better to start under someone else's guidance.  To start work, several rectangular sheets are prepared.  The size of the sheet should be half a magazine or a quarter newspaper.  When the technique of manufacturing paper tubes is mastered well enough, you can choose for yourself a different optimal sheet size. </p><p>  To twist the tubes, the needle is placed on the lower corner of the sheet at an angle of forty-five degrees and begins to rotate.  When the leaf is completely screwed onto the knitting needle, you need to glue a corner with glue and stick it to the tube.  One end of the duct should be slightly wider than the other.  Thanks to this difference, it will be possible to lengthen the tubes by investing one in the other.  If the gap is three centimeters, then you can fasten the tubes without glue.  Smooth tubes can be laid aside, and then used for panels.  For work, you may need both round tubes and flat ones.  To do this, they need to be smoothed out with a rolling pin or ironed with an iron. </p><p>  Weaving from newspapers for beginners can begin with the manufacture of a round basket, as it is easier to manufacture than another.  First you need to cut a round bottom on which tubes are glued in the form of rays and close with the same circle on top.  There should be an odd number of rays!  A load is placed on the circle so that the parts stick together better.  After that, you need to put the form on the bottom and bend the rays.  So that the rays do not crumble, at the top they can be pulled together with an elastic band.  Weaving newspapers for beginners is best done not up, but down.  To do this, the workpiece must be turned upside down.  Now you need to braid the rays, constantly increasing the paper vine.  The end of the working vine is smeared with glue and fixed with a paper clip.  When the basket is ready, the remaining tips of the beams are bent and hidden inside with a hook.  Too long ends need to be cut.  The finished product can be varnished. </p><p>  As you can see, newspaper weaving is not at all difficult to master.  After the first product is completed, you can move on to more complex methods of weaving and even come up with your own. </p>
