    <h2>  Hamina's story </h2><p>  Hamina was built on the site of the town of Vekhkalahti.  The first mention of this area dates back to the 13th century.  Vekhkalahti received the status of a city only in 1653. But already in 1712 it completely burned down during the retreat of the Swedish-Finnish troops.  Then the city of Friedrichsham was rebuilt at this place, which in <span>Finnish</span> turned into Hamina.  The city has a circular development, which is already a rarity in world architecture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Legend of the Mill Millstone Monument </h2><p>  Hamina's attractions are unusual.  One of them, a monument to millstone installed in the Summer Park, is even associated with a whole legend.  According to her, in 1783 a meeting between Catherine the Second and the Swedish King Gustav the Third took place in Hamina.  According to legend, he wanted to marry the empress, but she set him a condition that he had to fulfill. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of hamina" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1728688.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  Gustav III was supposed to kiss Catherine II through an opening in a millstone.  And not the Empress‚Äôs pen, but lips.  The Swedish king could not fulfill this condition and as a result received a polite refusal from the royal sweetheart.  Now this millstone has become a place of pilgrimage for lovers.  Many couples try unsuccessfully to do this trick. </p><h2>  The famous fortress of the city </h2><p>  The fortress star decorates the center of Hamina.  This is one of the surviving amazing ancient ring buildings.  The fortress was founded by the Swedes as a defensive bastion. </p><p>  In modern times, ramparts and walls outline the borders of the historic center of Hamina.  If you look at the fortress from a height, then it resembles a star in outlines.  Due to this, she received such an original name. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hamina center fortress star" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1728733.jpg" width="550"></div>

They start only manually.  Previously, the Town Hall was set aside for banking and prison facilities.  In the building there were police, shops and guardhouse.  Now the City Hall is located in the Town Hall. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="from St. Petersburg to Finland" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1728639.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  School of officers and a monument to the baker </h2><p>  There are two interconnected monuments in Hamina.  The first is the school of officers located on the territory of the star fortress.  The educational institution has been elevated to the status of a museum.

At the same time, she was a kind of psychologist for them, listened, helped with advice in love affairs.  According to legend, she not only brought cakes to the school, but also accompanied the cadets with them even on maneuvers.  Often prompted them with the right decisions.  As a result, the baker became a kind of tactical adviser. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to the Barbarian Baker" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1728736.jpg" width="600"></div>
