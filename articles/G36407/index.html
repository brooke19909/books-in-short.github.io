Answer the question</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Still threads and disputes on the topic of hacking of one or another console do not cease.  If you ask yourself whether it is possible to flash PS4 - one of the most popular gaming systems of our time, then you can come across very interesting solutions to the problem.  Someone creates peaceful tweets about a successful hack, and someone devotes entire sites to this and offers a long-awaited solution to the problem in exchange for a real amount of money. </p><h2>  The perfect console </h2><p>  ‚ÄúIs it possible to flash PS4‚Äù - many users ask this question.  Among them, there are also those who do not own this console, but wish to purchase it in the future.  Why is she so coveted among gamers? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.console-deals.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to flash ps4?" class="if uuid-2237707" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55840/2237707.jpg"></div><p>  The fact is that Sony has created a truly perfect gaming system.  The Playstation series has always been distinguished from its competitors by high technical characteristics, convenient accessories, software and affordable virtual entertainment.  It's no secret that Playstation consoles boast the best anti-burglary protection, which is also constantly updated. </p><p>  Those who are familiar with the PS series remember well how much time it took to hack the PS3, the console of the previous generation that lasted over ten years on the market.  It is not surprising that Sony tried to protect its new creation even better. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  PS3 Hack History </h2><p>  The previous generation of Playstation consoles was able to leave a big mark in the <span>gaming industry.</span>  What is the history of breaking into anti-piracy protection, which did not allow gamers to use unlicensed products.  At the same time, another PS3 competitor, Xbox360, could not give a decent rebuff to the hackers and fell almost immediately after its release. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how ps4 pro differs from ps4" class="if uuid-2237709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55840/2237709.jpg"></div><p>  It took many years to bypass the console‚Äôs protection from Sony.  The big problems for hackers were the program code itself, as well as the task of creating an ingenious technical device that would help with hacking.  The volume of work was really amazing, so the first real success made itself felt only four years after the console was released. </p><p>  At first, hackers used a special USB stick, which was known as the Jailbreak.  He managed to spoof the PS3 and launch unlicensed games using images from the hard drive.  Soon, JailBreak was followed by a full-fledged hack, which was the result of a decoded key. </p><h2>  What happened next? </h2><p>  Of course, the news about the long-awaited bypass of the defense did not please either Sony or video game developers.  For the first hacks, counter-actions were taken in the form of various updates and official firmware.  However, the company soon abandoned the struggle to maintain a full license. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The PS3 hack path took a lot of time and effort.  The result of this work was the possibility of buying an already flashed console on which the CobraOde chip mod was installed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gamespot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to flash ps4 pro" class="if uuid-2237712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55840/2237712.jpg"></div><h2>  So is it possible to flash PS4? </h2><p>  In 2016, at a specialized conference, hackers talked about the successful process of breaking the latest generation console.  The result of the work done was demonstrated there: bypassing the protection was achieved by installing the Linux operating system on the PS4, but the team decided not to disclose other details.  As a result, the players again did not receive any accurate information about the appearance of hacked consoles in the public domain. </p><p>  At about the same time, one of the hackers decided to tell the community about the PS4 vulnerabilities found.  Such a move, of course, did not please Sony, and they threatened the enthusiast with a future arrest.  However, players are in no hurry to believe every rumor that appears.  It's no secret that sometimes companies launch thoughtful PR moves with news about hacks of their consoles in order to attract attention and, as a result, increase sales.  Therefore, until reliable messages began to appear regarding whether it is possible to get Sony Playstation 4 firmware, one should not hope for anything specific. </p><h2>  News from Brazil </h2><p>  Does this mean that the problem of how to flash or flash the Playstation 4 yourself can be put aside in the long box?  Probably not. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gamingcentral.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to flash or reflash playstation 4" class="if uuid-2237722" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55840/2237722.jpg"></div><p>  Not so long ago, news appeared on the Web that Brazilian hackers managed to install several unlicensed games on the PS4.  Unfortunately, such an achievement cannot be considered a full-fledged hack, since the user is given only a limited selection of pre-installed content. </p><p>  How does this happen?  Some Brazilian company specializing in firmware installs ten pirated games on the user console.  If after some time the client wants another kit, then he will have to pay an additional amount of money.  The Brazilians decided not to distribute any details about how this firmware works. </p><h2>  PS 4 Pro Output </h2><p>  The release of new modifications only complicates the work of crackers.  September 2016 turned out to be very productive for the Playstation.  In addition to the release of various exclusives, the company announced the release of two new modifications under the names "Slim" and "Pro". </p><p>  This begs another question: how is the PS4 different from the PS4 Pro?  The latest modification includes improved hardware and more computing power.  Despite such improvements, it is still part of the seventh generation of the Playstation and supports all the games that have ever been released and are still being released for the standard version of the console. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ibtimes.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sony playstation 4 firmware" class="if uuid-2237727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55840/2237727.jpg"></div><p>  Sony representatives have repeatedly noted that what distinguishes the PS4 Pro from the PS4 is mainly suitable for players who manage to buy a <span>4K</span> TV for their use <span>.</span>  From this we can conclude that the transition from the standard version to the latest modification is completely optional.  Can I flash PS4 Pro?  Unfortunately, until the issue of bypassing the PS4 protection is resolved, it makes no sense to talk about hacking the console with improved performance. </p>
