They are lined with their sandy beaches - one better than the other. </p><h2>  Pineta Park Deluxe <span>4 * (Marmaris): reviews</span> and prices <strong> </strong></h2><p>  If you plan to stay in a hotel, it is always important to find out what former guests think about it.  Basically, tourists share only positive opinions about holidays in Pineta Park Deluxe 4 *.  Reviews vacationers, of course, are subjective.  Despite this, the vast majority of guests were very pleased with the food, the polite attitude of the staff and the comfort of the rooms.  Families with children celebrate the wonderful program of animators, a spacious mini-club with everything necessary for the development of young guests (toys, pencils, etc.), the presence of several children's dishes on the menu.  The presence of special high chairs in the restaurant is another plus that vacationers celebrate. </p><p>  But, of course, it doesn‚Äôt happen that everyone likes everything 100%.  Of the negative impressions about the hotel, one should single out dissatisfaction with the lack of a private beach and, accordingly, the need to pay for sunbeds with umbrellas. </p><p>  The price range in 2014 (per day) ranged from 1850 to 8800 rubles per person.  The cost depends on several factors and can vary greatly even in a short time period.  The price depends on the occupancy of the hotel complex, on the schedule of charter flights and the general demand for tourist packages to Turkey. <br><br>  Booking a room through travel companies is not the only way to get a "place in the sun" in Pineta Park Deluxe 4 *.

It is fast and convenient, because you don‚Äôt even have to leave the house. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Deluxe Hotel Pineta Park 4" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23243/508052.jpg" width="600"></div>
