One of the most interesting places is the island of Phangan.  Sights of the region are worthy of the attention of travelers.  On the island there are two national parks, temples and man-made monuments that attract guests. </p><h2>  Island location </h2><p>  Phangan Island is located in the Gulf of Thailand, it is also called Koh Phangan.  It is located in the province of Surat Thani, just 15 kilometers from the famous island of Koh Samui.  The name of the island comes from the Thai word ‚ÄúKo‚Äù, which means ‚Äúisland‚Äù, and ‚ÄúNgan‚Äù - ‚Äúsand spit‚Äù. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="9.731875299999999" data-lng="100.01359290000005" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/5/7/1/17571.png"></div><p>  There are very pronounced ebbs on Koh Phangan, at this time one can observe exposed braids around the island.  70% of the territory is occupied by mountains, which are completely covered by tropical forests.  The remaining 30% of the island is coconut beaches and plantations.  Rama V was very fond of resting on Phangan. He first visited the island in 1888, after which he came fourteen more times. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agenziaviaggimikadotravel.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What to see on Koh Phangan yourself" class="if uuid-3222257" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3222257.jpg"></div><p>  In tourist terms, Phangan began to develop only the last thirty years.  They began to build bungalows for travelers.  Until that time, the islanders were engaged in coconut cultivation and fishing.  The island became famous due to the fact that it does not hold Full Moon parties.  On a full moon day, thousands of tourists from around the world gather here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Than Sadet Park </h2><p>  One of the attractions of Phangan is Than Sadet National Park.  It is located near the river Than Sadet.  You can visit the park only by renting a car.  But it‚Äôs easier to get a ticket for a sightseeing tour.  The park is open around the clock; admission to it is completely free.  On its territory you can see tourists with tents that camp along the coast of the river.  The main attractions of the park include several waterfalls and Mount Ra, whose height reaches 600 meters.

The pond must be shown to tourists during organized excursions.  You can get to it by your own car, by taxi or with an excursion group.  The lake is located on the east coast of the island.  According to tourists, it fascinates with its beauty and size.  The fact is that in the tropical climate of the country such reservoirs are a rarity.

You can only get to it by a rented car.  It is open to all comers and works only during daylight hours.  The temple was erected on a high hill.  During its construction, all the rules of traditional Chinese architecture were respected.  The temple was named after the goddess Guan Kin.

On its territory there is a statue of the goddess. </li><li>  The second zone is focused on conducting meditation practices, as well as on religious and solemn events. </li></ol><p>  Another part of the temple is reserved for a special room in which there is a statue of Buddha. </p><h2>  Observation Decks </h2><p>  If you want to appreciate the attractions of Koh Phangan in Thailand, pay attention to the observation deck.  There are a lot of similar places of natural origin in the region.  But not all Phangan sites can be easily reached.  All of them are located on the tops of the mountains.  There are no roads to such places.  You need to get on foot along dirt tracks or sandy paths. </p><p>  Among all the sites of the island, there are only two that can be reached by motobike.  One of them is located near Had Rin Beach.  You can drive up to it on a bike, but then walk the rest of the way.  No less attractive is Wat Khao Tam.

The road to it is very simple, so getting there is not difficult.  There is a waterfall on the way from Chaloklum to Tongsalu.  From the main highway you can get on a narrow path. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.welovekohphangan.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What to see on Phangan necessarily" class="if uuid-3222247" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3222247.jpg"></div><p>  In the shade of trees near the waterfall, a recreation area is equipped.  Locals even rent modest apartments for those who want to spend a little more time here.  Water masses fall from a height, creating a lot of spray.  The approach to the goal can be judged by the increasing noise that the waterfall creates.  An interesting fact is that in the dry season Paradise is not anything interesting.  If at this time you visit a waterfall, then in place of the seething masses you will see only a thin brook.  But in the rainy season, the waterfall is so full that you can even swim in its waters. </p><h2>  Wat Paa Sang Tham Temple </h2><p>  What to see on Phangan necessarily?  If you are interested in Thai culture, then visiting the temples will help you get to know the local traditions.  The temple complex differs from others in that monks live on its territory.  Stone statues of Buddha are located among stone boulders and wild thickets.  Thanks to this, the complex has a mystical look. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thaitour.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What to see on Phangan necessarily" class="if uuid-3222253" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3222253.jpg"></div><p>  A walk through the territory is a calming effect on guests.  The peculiarity of the temple complex is that everyone can temporarily become his novice.  But for this it is necessary to obtain the permission of the abbot.  Everyone can visit the temple. </p><h2>  Diving </h2><p>  Koh Phangan is considered one of the most attractive diving spots in Thailand.  Along the coast, the island has many interesting places where beginners and experienced divers are taken.  Ang Tong Park is very interesting in this regard. It consists of a large number of small islands with corals and an incredibly rich underwater world.  There are diving schools on the island.  In addition, local residents offer a wide selection of sea excursions. </p><h2>  Tongsal Night Market </h2><p>  A peculiar attraction of the island is the night market near the village of Tongsala.  Trading begins every evening.  Here you can buy real culinary delights made from seafood.  The whole market is full of colorful trays with goodies.  Every traveler should visit the market.  You will not find such a variety of food anywhere else.  Yes, and lower prices for excellent dishes, too.
