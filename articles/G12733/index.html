    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Despite the overall positive picture of the rest at the Messongi Beach Resort <span>(Corfu), reviews</span> about it also contain a number of negative comments.  From them we can conclude a number of negative points: </p><ul><li>  it‚Äôs quite difficult to get an iron, because it is constantly busy (it seems that he is alone in the whole hotel); </li><li>  in standard rooms there is no hair dryer; </li><li>  because of the terrible audibility in the rooms, it is simply impossible to rest and sleep; </li><li>  the main building of the hotel is quite old, and therefore redecorating to maintain it in good condition is not enough; </li><li>  the bathroom has poor ventilation, which smells very damp and sewage, and mold appears on the walls; </li><li>  rather old and shabby furniture in the rooms, which has long been in need of replacement ;; </li><li>  the elevator is old enough, and therefore it works slowly and somehow creaks menacingly; </li><li>  while taking a shower, the curtain does not save at all, and therefore it floods everything around with water; </li><li>  hot water is served only early in the morning and late in the evening; </li><li>  there are no clothes dryers on the balconies; </li><li>  poor-quality local alcohol in restaurants and bars (the only thing that is usable is beer); </li><li>  not only that sunbeds and umbrellas on the beach are paid, they also do not give out towels (you need to bring your own or buy at the supermarket); </li><li>  the internet works very poorly; </li><li>  very old bedding, and towels washed and full of holes; </li><li>  very little entertainment for children; </li><li>  the hotel has no smoking ban, and therefore there are puffs of tobacco smoke around; </li><li>  for the entire period of their stay at the hotel, the maids have never put either shampoo or shower gel in the bathroom; </li><li>  paid water slides. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the resort </h2><p>  A true summer tale can give you <span>Greece, the island of Corfu.</span>  Hotel "Messongi Beach" is very popular among tourists.  This is a good option for a quiet holiday with your family, or with a noisy group of friends.  Minor flaws fade before all the advantages of this hotel.  Large clean beach, beautiful area, excellent food - what else is needed for relaxation!  If you are not going to sit in the room all day, then you are unlikely to be upset by old repairs or dust on the floor. </p>
