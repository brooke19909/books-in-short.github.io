  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crusades</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Crusades were undertaken by Western European Christians from 1095 to 1291. Their goal was to free the Holy Land (Palestine) from Muslims.  Crusades are considered the most important historical stage of the Middle Ages. </p><p>  The common people, kings, and servants, and knights, and the clergy, and the feudal nobility participated in the events of that time.  Thus, the Crusades united all layers of society that existed in the Middle Ages. </p><p>  Vowers had various motives.  Someone wanted to get rich, someone thirsted for adventure, many were driven exclusively by religious feelings. </p><p>  Leaving for the Crusades, the crusaders sewed red crosses onto their chests on clothes, returning from them onto their backs. </p><p>  Legends surrounded this historical era with a halo of romanticism, courage, chivalrous spirit and greatness.  However, in many ways the stories are too exaggerated.  In addition, there is the fact that, despite heroism, the proclamations of the popes and an unshakable faith in their endeavor, Christians were never able to free the Holy Land.  On the contrary, their campaigns led to the fact that Muslims were even more firmly established in the position of undisputed rulers of Palestine. </p><p>  <strong>Reasons for the Crusades.</strong> </p><p>  The foundation was laid by the <span>popes.</span>  They were considered the leaders of all such events.  Popes and other masterminds promised earthly and heavenly rewards to those who are willing to endanger themselves for this holy enterprise.  Attracting volunteers took place against the backdrop of religious zeal in Europe at that time.  Despite the motives that guided the volunteers, they were all sure that they were fighting for the cause. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The immediate reason for the start of the crusader campaigns was the increasing power of the Seljuk Turks.  In the 1070s, <span>this power</span> conquered the lands of <span>Asia Minor</span> and the Middle East.  After these natives of <span>Central Asia</span> began to expand the boundaries of their territory.  Muslims threatened the <span>Byzantine Empire,</span> which caused their ruler to turn to Western Christians for help. </p><p>  The conquest of the Seljuk Turks took place against the backdrop of a general religious Western European revival in the 10-11 centuries. </p><p>  In the 11th century, the number of pilgrims to the Holy Land increased significantly.  The ‚ÄúWrong Turk‚Äù was portrayed as a defiler of ancient shrines, a pagan barbarian. </p><p>  Many barons and kings saw a world of great opportunity in the Middle East.  They assumed that for the liberation of the Holy Land they would be rewarded with power, income, and land.  In addition, the practice of inheritance in accordance with the birthright has expanded in many states.  Thus, many younger sons, in particular, in the north of France, did not count on the participation of the feudal fathers in the division of land.  Participation in the Crusade gave them hope for the acquisition of land, and with it the status of society. </p><p>  The crusade for the peasant was an opportunity to get rid of lifelong addiction.  Becoming cooks and servants, they formed convoys of crusader troops. </p><p>  The history of the Crusades began in 1095.  Pope Urban 2 proclaimed the first movement at Clermont Cathedral. </p><p>  There were eight trips in total.  According to some accounts, in 1212 even teenagers made the Crusade.  Their leader was the shepherd Etienne of Cluis.  According to legend, they assumed that their faith and innocence would do what the armed adults did not.  According to one source, after ships with children reached the shores of Egypt, shipowners sold teenagers into slavery.  This Crusade is evidenced by different sources in different ways. </p><p>  The campaigns of the Christians ceased in 1291 after the capture of Acre by Muslims. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the crusaders could not achieve the goals set at the beginning of military expeditions, their campaigns constituted a whole historical era, influencing various aspects of European life. </p>
