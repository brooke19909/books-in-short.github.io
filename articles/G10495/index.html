Athens throughout the history of this state remained the center of all events.  Athens reached its highest peak in the fifth century BC.  This time was marked by victory in the war with Persia, which led to the development of the state, making it the largest in the world.  During this period, the first <span>principles of a democratic</span> system are born, and art reaches the highest degree of development.  It was during this century that the capital of Greece learned about philosophers such as Plato and Socrates.  Here lived the historians Thucydides and Herodotus, the scholars and playwrights Sophocles, Aeschylus, Euripides, Aristotle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Capital of Greece" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9765/21057.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <p>  The capital of Greece is proudly named after the name of the <span>goddess of wisdom</span> Athens.  Legend has it that there was a dispute between the god of the seas Poseidon and the warrior Athena over the right to be the patron saint of the city.  The assembled <span>Greek gods</span> decided that power would fall into the hands of the one who would present the most valuable gift to the city. </p><p>  <span>The god of the seas</span> struck a rock with his trident, a source of seawater in that place.  In response, Athena hit the ground with her spear, and an olive tree instantly grew there.  After much discussion, the gods decided that the goddess of wisdom brought the greatest gift to the city, and gave her power.  Since then, the capital of Greece has been called Athens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece Athens" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9765/21056.jpg" width="400"></div>

The main attraction and symbol of Athens is the Acropolis built of white marble.  This sacred rock today plays the role of a link, connecting the majestic ancient civilization with modernity.  The Acropolis is rightfully the subject of pride of the Athenians, and all of Greece is proud of it.  Excursions to this hill are very popular, because the temple of Parferon rises above the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece tours" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9765/21055.jpg" width="518"></div>

    <p>  In the 5th century BC  a temple was erected in honor of the patroness of the city, art and craft, the goddess <span>Athena Parthenos.</span>  That is why the Parthenon can be considered not only a temple, but also a kind of art gallery or museum.  During the reign of Pericles, the architects Iktin and Kallikrath on the Acropolis built not only the Parthenon, but also many other temples.  Most of them were dedicated to the <span>Greek goddess</span> Athena, but, unfortunately, not all of them have survived to this day. </p><p>  Athens is not only the Acropolis with its temples and mythological stories.  The capital of Greece is filled with many other attractions.  Ancient Agora, Kerameikos, Daphne Monastery, Benaki Museum, Greek Folk Instrument Museums, Greek Folk Art, Cycladic and Greek Ancient Art and the National Archaeological Museum.  In the heart of Athens is Syntagma Square, which is also called Concorde Square.  It houses the building of the Parliament, built in 1840.  Initially, it was the Royal Palace. </p><p>  Athens is not only historical monuments of architecture, it is a modern city, the streets of which are filled with all kinds of hotels, bars and restaurants.  Traditional taverns are especially popular among locals, where they enjoy spending time themselves and where guests of the city are invited.  The Athenians are very hospitable and good-natured towards tourists.  Having been once in Greece, you will definitely want to return there again. </p>
