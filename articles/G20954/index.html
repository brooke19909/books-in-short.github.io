This is a town with several beautiful bays, in which there are resort villages that are part of a larger settlement.  In the center of it there are also many beaches, but they are quite "populated", and often there is nowhere for an apple to fall. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Bodrum Hotel" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/318604.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  All hotels are located near the town or on its territory.  Of course, small family hotels are located in the center, and large luxurious palaces are located on the outskirts of Bodrum resort (Turkey).  <span>4</span> and 5 star <span>hotels</span> in this region offer almost the same services, but tourists believe that the local Quartet is much better than the Antalyan Quintuple.  The owners of the best hotels in this region are patriots.  Not without reason, many of these hotels have the name of the city in their name.  Let us briefly review some of them. </p><h2>  Turkey, Bodrum Magic Life Hotel </h2><p>  This "five" is now called the "Imperium", but many remember it under the old name.  The hotel is built as a chic palace in the style of the Ottoman Empire.  Vacationers seem to be transferred to the series "The Magnificent Century," so everything here shines with luxury.  Elegant three-story buildings, the cleanest sand and pebble beach (blue flag), the amazing nature around ... Especially the hotel is good for children - they have not only beds and chairs, but also a pool with slides, a nursery for the smallest and several clubs (one of them - ‚ÄúScandinavian‚Äù). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Turkey Bodrum Hotels" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/318605.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, there are a myriad of different types of rooms - Deluxe, Premium, Superior, Royal Suite, as well as luxurious villas - some with panoramic views.

    <h2>  Turkey, Bodrum Marmara Hotel </h2><p>  Designer boutique hotel.  Its architecture and layout was developed by Turkish and French specialists.  Although the hotel is not located on the beach, but on a hill, the stunning views that open from above cover all the inconvenience.  Moreover, an excellent shuttle service is organized to the sea.  And from the bizarre pool, located on a hill, even the <span>Greek island of</span> Kos is visible.  Beautiful and comfortable wooden furniture, excellent location (near the marina, and the famous Bodrum castle a kilometer from the hotel), numerous services and excellent staff are bearing fruit.  Guests characterize their stay in it in one word - ‚Äúamazing‚Äù. </p><h2>  Turkey, Bodrum Holiday Resort &amp; Spa Hotel </h2><p>  Winner of a gold certificate for the purity of water and the quality of food, this hotel is located closest to the city center.  It is the oldest of the fives described above, but was completely renovated in 2004.  The hotel is located in Icmeler Bay.  There are standard, two-room rooms, as well as suites with living rooms and several bedrooms.  The hotel is very good for people who value outdoor activities - it has a small water park, as well as many sports and water activities.  The hotel has several buildings - the usual, "club" and for VIP-s.  The hotel is surrounded by a beautiful olive grove. </p>
