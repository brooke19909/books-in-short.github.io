Travelers who have been here note that not all hotels in the resort of Sunny Beach can boast of this.  So, according to them, there are a lot of hotels, the pools on the territory of which are separated from the roadway with just a flimsy fence.  Of course, this does not provide vacationers with comfort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="izola paradise 4 bulgaria sunny beach" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1394413.jpg" width="595"></div>

Therefore, being in them is very nice.  The guests were also pleased with the spacious balconies on which you can sit in the evening, watching what is happening in the vicinity or on the hotel territory, with a glass of wine or a cup of tea.

    <h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  Check-in at the hotel should be done after two in the afternoon.  However, as tourists who have been here note, in practice this rule is rarely applied.  So, even if you arrive at the hotel in the morning, if there are available rooms for the category you have reserved, the keys to your apartments will be issued to you almost immediately.  And there‚Äôs no need to pay anything extra for this.  In addition, guests were pleased with the fact that even in case of early arrival at the hotel they could go for breakfast, although according to the rules of the hotel, this is not provided.  However, with regard to the day of departure from Izola Paradise 4 * (Bulgaria), here on the part of holidaymakers you can meet a number of complaints.  So, to vacate the occupied room should be up to 11 hours of the day.  However, experienced tourists warn that if your flight is in the afternoon or evening and you want to extend your stay at the hotel, then you are unlikely to succeed.  The fact is that at the height of the holiday season, the hotel is usually 100 percent full.  Therefore, administrators, even with all their desire, will not be able to find a free number for you.  Keep this in mind.  However, for the vast majority of these circumstances were not particularly difficult.  So, they handed over the keys to the room, left their things in the left-luggage office at the reception and spent time until they left by the pool or at sea. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Judging by the comments of the guests, they were mostly satisfied with this item.  So, the food at Izola Paradise is organized according to the ol inclusive system.  Of course, you should not count on the same variety of dishes and drinks, as, for example, in Turkey, beloved by our compatriots, but in general everything is organized quite well.  Travelers note that they were satisfied with a large number of meat and fish dishes.  They also liked local vegetables and fruits, pastries.  As for the weaknesses, their choice here is not particularly great.  However, this did not become a particular problem.  Indeed, in the vicinity of the hotel there are lots of shops, supermarkets, cooking, where you can always buy something tasty. </p><p>  In general, tourists note that, choosing the Izola Paradise 4 * hotel with an all-inclusive food system, they were not mistaken at all.  After all, according to them, prices at resorts in Bulgaria are not at all low.  And dinners with dinners outside the hotel cost travelers a tidy sum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="izola paradise 4 reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1394411.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  According to many of our compatriots vacationing at Isola Paradise, they were very pleased with the hotel staff.  So, judging by their reviews, the staff here are very welcoming, attentive and coping with their duties.  This applies to both reception staff and waiters, maids and other employees.  In addition, many hotel employees understand the Russian language, so you will not have any special difficulties in communicating here. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Since most tourists come to the Bulgarian resort of Sunny Beach for a beach holiday, this question excites them in the first place.  Our compatriots staying at Isola Paradise claim that they really liked the sea here.  The only drawback was the fact that you need to walk about 20 minutes in measured steps to the beach from the hotel.  However, some travelers were even happy about this, since such a walk allowed them to stretch after long hours on the beach or by the pool and plentiful food.  The sea here, as our compatriots note, is very clean and warm.  There are no special waves, so it will be comfortable for adults and children to swim.  The beaches here are large, sandy.  Sun loungers and parasols are available at an additional cost.  Many tourists were unhappy with this fact, especially since the price of this servant is considerable.  So, daily use of a chaise lounge with an umbrella in high season will cost you about 10 euros!  A significant part of vacationers prefers not to spend money on renting sunbeds, but to settle down on special free sections of the beach, laying a towel or mat directly on the sand. </p><h2>  Infrastructure, entertainment </h2><p>  According to tourists, Izola Paradise 4 * (Bulgaria, Sunny Beach) can not boast of a special animation program.  So, for adult vacationers, it consists only in evening discos and periodically held Bulgarian evenings with national dishes, songs, dances, etc. During the same day, tourists can spend time by the pool, visit the spa, beauty salon, gym, go to the beach and go on excursions.  As for the youngest travelers, for them the hotel administration tried to diversify leisure.  So, although the children's playground at the hotel is small, there are animators working all day, offering kids to draw, make funny crafts, play, etc. So you can easily leave your child here for several hours. </p>
